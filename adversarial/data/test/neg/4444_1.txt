Seriously what happened to ND sushi? They used to great on Baldwin st.  We went there today Dec 2nd 2017 on college st and it was a disappointment. \n\nService was slow, food took forever to come out, they didn't give us wasabi with our sushi, we asked waitress for some and she also totally forgets the wasabi.\n\nTheir portions used to be generous but not even close now. I left hungry ordering sushi A and grilled eggplant side dish.\n\nThier grilled eggplant used to come with a large eggplant and now its around half the size.\n\nWe also ordered nebayaki udon, it should be called empty shells noodle soup.\n\nI pointed out to the waitress that none of the mussels  (4 of them) actually had any meat in them. It's like they just reuse empty shells. The waitress went back to the chef and later came back to us and said that that's just how they are. At $12.50 for a small bowl of udon I advise everyone to stay away from this one.\n\nI noticed everyone around us were complaining how long  the food took to come out. Even though it was about 60% full.\n\nND sushi used to be our favorite sushi in Toronto.    Now we are afraid to go back.
