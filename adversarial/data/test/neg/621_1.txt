Don't let the name fool you. This place has the best carry out beer selection of any store in Cleveland, including La Cave Du Vin. There is a rotating draft selection for growlers or a tasting and a wall full of six packs or single bottles. Brendan is very knowledgeable and constantly improves the selection. If you love beer, you need to visit.
