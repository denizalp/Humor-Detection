I sent in my resume and within a month I had offers rolling in. People are helpful and the bureaucracy isn't too engorged. I had a few minor annoyances like check is late or w2 wasn't sent but If you can't handle the very occasional late check by a few days then you forgot what it was like to be unemployed!!!
