I will never again go to this service center. Never realized what a joke it is to get any sort of help from this place plus when it comes to any warranty issues, they'll do just about anything to not cover it.  replaced ignition coil on Dec,2014 and the same coil went out in Jan 2015 they won't honor the warranty both part or labor. \n\n\n they even up charge more to replace the same coil that they charge previously.  very disappointed
