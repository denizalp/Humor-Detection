5 stars for the food. I have loved everything I have ever ordered from here. I have been here many times. They have items that are delicious that are lower in calories if you're concerned about that. 1 Star off for horrendously loud environment. I could not hear my waiter, he could not hear me. The people in our party had to yell at each other to be heard. I would have left, but we were hungry and had waited 1\/2 hour to be seated. That was getting on a call ahead wait list. Boo. It was louder than normal because it was the NBA playoff game and the TV was up extremely loud. That would be ok in the bar area, but it was all over the entire restaurant. It was not enjoyable for me.
