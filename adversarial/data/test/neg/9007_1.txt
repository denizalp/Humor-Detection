Tomahawk Tuesday for a birthday celebration at Fleming's is as good as it gets.  Our waiter, Brian, was exceptionally friendly and very helpful and knowledgeable.  He helped steer us away from things not to our liking and towards things we really enjoyed.  Managers and hostess seemed genuinely concerned that we have a good experience.  Value here is exceptional.  The steak was cooked to perfection.  We had the mushrooms and asparagus sides which were both delicious.  For dessert, they were out of walnut turtle pie, but the chocolate caramel substitute was rich and delicious and the carrot cake was simply to die for.  The birthday gift at the end was a nice touch to a great experience. There are many steakhouses in Las Vegas, and we have been to many of them first as tourists and now as residents of the area, and this is simply the best.  Strip restaurants could learn a great deal by doing things the way it is done at Fleming's.
