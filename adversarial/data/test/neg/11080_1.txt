Great place.  A group of high school buddies chose this place for a sort-of mini-reunion.  Nice to see a quality, upscale, but casual place in the hometown area.  Food and service are excellent; live entertainment and a patio are nice extras.  I recommend this place highly for drinks, casual dinner or get-togethers!
