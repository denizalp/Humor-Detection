If you are cravying for wonton with noodles. This is a place for you. The restaurant is small, have around 40 to 50 seats. They do offer takeout service and also sell premade wontons and other items. They close every Wednesdays. Wait times are usually minimal depending on the number of people and if you are willing to share your table with other people. Not a great place if you go in groups of more than 6 people. CASH ONLY payment. The ambience is very casual. \n\nMenu - small selection, you either get beef, minced fish ball, wonton, or any of the combinations, you have choices of noodles. You can add veggie dish with oyster sauce. Water and tea are self served at the back of the restaurant. Other drinks like pop are extra, which will be brought to your table once order is placed. \n\nCustomer Service - very fast, the food comes within 5 minutes after you order if not less. And you pay at the cashier. I wouldn't say this place is friendly but it isn't unfriendly. It is average. If you want a fast lunch or just something quick, this is a good place to go.  \n\nTaste - I have ordered all three types of meat with either egg noodle or vermicelli and never a let down. Good portions and value. \n\nAuthenticity - definitely authentic with good value. \n\nOverall great place for a quick economical meal.
