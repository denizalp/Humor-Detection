The salad was good but nothing you couldn't get at a supermarket's salad bar for far less money. The man behind the counter was surly. I'm not too demanding when it comes to customer service but he seemed genuinely annoyed that we were there. It was a weekday during what should have been lunch rush and it wasn't busy.
