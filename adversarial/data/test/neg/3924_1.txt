I am a long time customer with Via and have been blessed with her quality service for more than a year now. As an individual who works in the cosmetics industry and have worked for large makeup corporations such as L'Oreal and Revlon, I am extremely careful and particular about the quality service, and materials used when getting eye lash extensions. Vee Nail Spa has never failed me and my high expectations, and neither has Via, who is truly an industry specialist. \n\nI had originally gotten my lashes done elsewhere but was looking for better quality mink lashes at a more reasonable price. When I first met Via, she was working elsewhere. I quickly became a loyal customer and have followed her since, regardless of the location she's been at. I have always left content with the service and a happy customer. She is detail oriented, careful, and a perfectionist when it comes to treating my lashes and that is exactly the attentive skill set required for any eye lash extension expert, but unfortunately short in supply in this industry. \n\nAfter I leave my appointment, my lashes were always luscious, well filled, and not synthetic cheap fibers that many other businesses use. She's very wary of your personal needs and changes the glue type based on weather to ensure that you get the longest wear without frequent visits and your \"biggest-bang-of-your-buck\" which is rare when she could be making a lot more having eye lash replenishment services. She has the customers best interest in mind and considering that Vee Nail Spa is opened by her, I have no doubt that as the owner, she is doing everything in her power to ensure every reasonable customer leaves at a minimum - satisfied. \n\nHer staff is extremely personable, charismatic, and the location is spacious and stages a more elegant taste in decor compared to the average spa locations here in Mississauga. I know in my mind that Vee Nail Spa is a place that comes highly recommended and the massage therapists are professionals in their fields as well. \n\nGive this place a try, you will not be disappointed. Just like how I haven't been for the past year.
