Was hesitant to try a new place that I wasn't familiar with but Dream Nails does not disappoint.  They have a huge selection of gel colors to choose from at a decent price.  What I like most about this place is the service.  They are incredibly patient while waiting for my friends and me to pick our gel color.  Not only that but they are helpful in guiding us and suggesting different colors or ideas.
