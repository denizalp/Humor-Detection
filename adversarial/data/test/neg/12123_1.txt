After seeing the fantastic retro sign and open air seating, I was excited to go to The Porch. We went on a Sunday afternoon, and the weather was perfect for sitting outdoors. The place wasn't overly crowded, and we had our pick of tables. Our server was very friendly and had a great personality, but disappeared once we were served food. The pros: the outdoor area is nice, and a decent place for an afternoon beer. It is along Indian School Rd however, so when motorcycles go by, it is pretty loud. The negs: beyond the retro-themed sign and motel chairs, the place is more of a bro sports bar (if you are thinking it will be more like an Upward Projects or Genuine Concepts restaurant, forget about it). Inside has a few retro fixtures and yellow booths, but the main focal attraction is the huge bar in the middle of the hyper-air-conditioned room. Not only does the retro-theme fall short, the menu and food leave a lot to be desired. The menu selections are uninspired and pricey. My companion had a sloppy joe, which he enjoyed. Not being a meat eater and not in the mood for a salad, I selected the Poke Bowl. For $15 I received an anticlimatic bowl of flavorless white rice, a scattering of tuna, some chopped up cucumber, and some avocado. Knowing what I know now, I would have stopped by one of the countless poke restaurants in the area before going to the Porch, and spent my $ more wisely. If you go to the Porch, go to hang out with your friends to have some cocktails in the outdoor area. Don't bother with the food.
