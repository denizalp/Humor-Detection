Good luck getting a follow up from this place. I went and got a second opinion on a back issue from another doctor and all of a sudden Dr. Kody Smith and team cancelled my blood pressure meds, stating I was no longer a patient.\n\nNow I permanently moved doctors and couldn't be happier. The new Dr. Is actually completing tests to find out the problem. \n\nThere are plenty of options and it seems this place has enough business that they don't need to treat people right.
