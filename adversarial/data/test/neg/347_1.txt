Wasn't a huge fan of the entrees the first couple of times I visited Hogtown. I came back and enjoyed some of the appetizers including the supremacy fries, buffalo \"wing\" and the black bean and daiya cheese quesadilla and was blown away. So good! I have been coming back to try more and more items from hog town and I am quite impressed by the vegan junk food offered here. The unchicken cesaer wrap is really good and I love how thinly cut and crispy there fries are. Delicious.
