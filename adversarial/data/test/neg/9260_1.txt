I've been here quite a few times. The food is pretty good (a fan of the beer battered french fries and the selection of burgers), but I've always enjoyed bar food.  There are a variety of deals throughout the week including my favorite: $5 dollar \"Big ass beers\" (23 oz. beers) and $5 wing buckets on Thursdays. They also have very good grouper sandwiches.The brewery changes their beer selection throughout the year for the season changes and to keep variety in the menu. Their christmas ale is very good, along with their blueberry beer and their \"Punchin' the nuts\" beer. In the summer, the patio is in a very nice location with televisions and an outdoor bar. The inside is a little cramped around the bar area and can get pretty loud at night, but I've always enjoyed the place. I usually take people from out of town to the restaurant for a nice casual setting and they typically enjoy it as well. I would recommend the place to anyone living nearby.
