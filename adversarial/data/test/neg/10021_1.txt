Fresh Meat!  Literally......what a great burger!   So nice to get a nice combination of ground beef and good cheese with bacon that was actually cooked in house!  Too many places take shortcuts in one aspect or another.\n\nMany beers to try still on the list but there will be plenty of opportunities to visit again.  The server and proprietor was very knowledgable on the beers as one in my party was wanting to try something different but was afraid to stray from her typical Blue Moon.\n\nPlanning a visit there soon to watch the draft.   GO BROWNS!
