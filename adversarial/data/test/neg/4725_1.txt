My husband and I love to come here for brunch! The food is soooo good, along with the prices. They have great drinks as well. Dog friendly too! \n\nThe Rojo Chili de la Casa is my dish of choice for breakfast. Their tortillas are yummy and the chili is perfect! If you like spicy Bloody Mary's this is the place for you!
