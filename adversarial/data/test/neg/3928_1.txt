I love our Golden Knight's Stadium. It is ample enough o hold everybody. The facilities are always clean and the staff is very friendly. I like the layout of the stadium makes it really easy to get around.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the facility is the expense of the food and the parking, it is ridiculous. 25 for parking is a lot, and now it's 40 dollars for parking that is freaking BS and I can't believe they are trying to screw locals so bad...this isn't California knock it off. At least the city is getting more money with the buses!\n\nOverall this is a pretty sweet place to watch the games. Just make sure to carpool and be nice and full before coming to any games.
