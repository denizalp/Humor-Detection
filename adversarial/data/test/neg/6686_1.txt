This was our first time to this restaurant. I could go either 3 or 4 stars and I chose 3. First our party was seated upon arrival. Service was first rate and the food was very good and the portions generous. Why 3 stars? Because the prices are outrageous. For a party of three each with one drink, appetizer and main course and the price was $188! We did not have high end drinks, lobster, crab or anything that you might expect to drive up the cost. We had crab cakes, scallops and halibut.\n\nI've been to many very good places and while the experience was very nice, their prices are way too high.
