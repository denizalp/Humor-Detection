Ok, it's a pizzeria and it is geared for take-out.\nThe pizzas are too quality and they usually have a special.  Be sure to check in on Yelp to get a free goodie.\n\nWe got the Meat Lovers Pizza and a side of Chicken Strips for the girls.  The chicken was nicely breaded and pretty good.  The pizza is generously topped and the price is more than fair.\n\nThe 24\" will feed an army ( or 4 teenagers and the parents).\n\nTry this place next time you are ordering takeout.
