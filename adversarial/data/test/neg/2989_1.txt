This place is so quaint and the people working here are sooo friendly! We brought my mother in law here for Mother's Day breakfast and the ladies were so nice and helpful with her. She has dementia and doesn't walk well and they helped her walk through the patio and brought her the kids menus which was perfect! Also brought her a cup with a lid so she wouldn't spill. Like I said so helpful and kind. I will be back and back! \nOh, and food is crazy good!!
