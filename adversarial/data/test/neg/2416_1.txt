I love this place! I come here on every single trip I make to Las Vegas and usually make it a priority to come here at least a few times per trip. The prices are good for Las Vegas standards, but the portions are enormous! This place is colorful and something you would never see back home. I love coming here late at night (or early morning) and having eggs Benedict with a cocktail or 2, because hey it's Vegas! Whenever a friend of mine is planning on a trip to Vegas I always recommend going here as a must!
