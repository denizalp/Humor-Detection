I used to like Fast Nail.  They are very busy and if you dont have an appointment you can wait over an hour.  Cindy the owner is very nice as well as Alex who used to do my nails.  However Alex doesnt do pedicures so someone else would do mine.  I have no complaints about the pedicures, they were always done quite well.  My problem came with the one girl, Heidi, who did a pedicure for me one day.  I wont go into all the details but I will say she made me feel unwelcome and uncomfortable.  It was a bad experience that made me feel as though I would never go back there and I havent.  The acrylic fills and pedicures were good.  I just couldnt take the \"stigma\" I now feel for Fast Nail.
