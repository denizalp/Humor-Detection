Love the reviews for helping me find this place. Clean. Great machines. Affordable, and the staff is awesome and friendly. The last time I went to a laundromat with a comforter in emergency mode, was one of the grossest experiences in my life thus far. I was convinced I was going to be stabbed. Best part was when some dude came in and began scrubbing the vomit and urine out of his jeans. \nWish I had checked reviews that time - but I'll definitely be coming here from now on.
