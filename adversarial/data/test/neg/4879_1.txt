\"Farm to Table\" is a very trendy concept these days.  Heritage does it perfectly.   Very knowledgeable wait staff, a friendly intimate atmosphere and a great wine and bar list all combine to setup an amazing meal.  The food was innovative,  fresh and absolutely delicious.   Chef Paul was very gracious and welcoming.   Heritage is a gem and ranks as one of the best restaurants in the area.
