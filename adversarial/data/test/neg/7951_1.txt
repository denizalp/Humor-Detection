I'm a big fan of Mr Chow & have been a loyal customer since the early 2000's. However, this was my 2nd time to this new location at Caesars Palace & it was worst experience then the 1st time. My expectations for a $$$$ restaurant wasn't even close to being met. Took 20 minutes to get a glass of water and our main course didn't come til 50 minutes after we ordered. Needless to say, the service was beyond terrible. I will go ahead and give this location one more try, if they let me down again, I have no choice but to visit my favorite location in Beverly Hills. \n\nThis all happened on Valentine's Night. I had to leave my girlfriend with my brother & his wife because I had to be at work. I gave them 90 mins and they couldn't even deliver. SMH\n\nBeing a Vegas local for 15 years and dining at some of the finest spots has me 2nd guessing this location. The whole staff needs to change their attitude and way they serve their customers at this location. Not to mention the appetizers were cold when they brought it out. STEP YOUR GAME UP MR CHOW! - signed a very disappointed customer!
