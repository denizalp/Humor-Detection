To begin, I know better... With that said, I was hoping Yelp would do me right, but it simply left me $15 dollars poorer.\n\nI ordered around the menu but that still did very little to spare me the American Meal. The restaurant should be labeled American w\/a slight influence from south of the border.\nTheir only saving grace was the server in which I got to chat in Spanish with. She un-Americanized the menu for me as best as possible but You can be sure that w\/out her, the place would really have to turn my arm to earn 1 star.\n\nBloody disappointing & yes I know better, for I am in PA & not CA...
