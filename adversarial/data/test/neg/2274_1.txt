Great place for nails and pampering. Ivy did designs on my nails and toes even on powder nails. \n\nI haven't had cute design nails since I switched from regular polish manicures to shellac. I asked before at other salons and was discouraged from putting designs on shellac. \n\nMy nails look whimsical and great!
