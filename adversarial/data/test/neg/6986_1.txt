Screw me once shame on you screw me twice shame on me.\n\nI swore I'd never step foot in Ashley ever again however my girlfriend just bought a new house and was having a hard time finding a bed she liked and with a budget in mind asked if we could go check them out.  I was reluctant but thought I'd give them another chance, things can change right?  WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!  This time around was even worse then what happened to me 2 1\/2 years ago.  \nShe ended up buying a bed, nightstand, dining table and small entertainment unit that has a fireplace insert.  We arranged for the furniture to be shipped and on the day it arrived the bed was damaged and we were informed to reject the order and they would replace the broken side rail but that would take a few days to get it.  When the adjustable bed arrived (from a different company) we were told it wasn't going to fit in the frame of the bed we bought from Ashley.\nNow this is where the fun begins........Ashley told us the model bed we bought WOULD and we even had the mattress store call and confirm with them ad they again said it would fit.\nWell that was not the case so I called them back and said don't bother bringing a new piece just come get the whole bed and refund us the money.  To this statement I was told that was not possible because they don't have a return policy, REALLY???  After some strong words I was told that yes they would take the bed back but I was going to be charged $69 for a pick up fee............I DON'T THINK SO!!  Again took some more choice words and the fee was waived.  We then went back to the store and talked to our Sales guy and the Manager and filled them in on what happened and they were very apologetic and asked what they could do to make things right. This is where the sucker got sucked in again.  My girl said that it would be nice to get a second nightstand and maybe a rug for the dining room.  They cut us a great deal on both so she breaks out the CC and buys both.  We then set a delivery for that Saturday but never got any confirmation call or email.  I called and was informed that they set up for the deliver for the following Saturday (we stood with the Sales kid and he confirmed twice on the date).  Well we were SOL and were also told that the rug was on back order so it wouldn't have come anyway.  We again complained and mentioned that the nightstand we already received had a small crack in the bottom drawer.  The store Manager said \"No problem, we'll get you TWO NEW ONES\" and take the damaged one back.\nThe day comes for them to bring the new stuff and we get a call that they are bring us ONE not TWO new nightstands and the rug.  She calls the store and is told yet again that it will be handled and corrected in the computer.  We both go back to the store very well prepared to tell them just to refund our money but got sucked in again by asking for the matching dresser for free to make up for all the screw ups.  Free was never going to happen but we were offered almost 75% off so...................what the hell, get that dresser too.\nWe add that to the order so now we're waiting for 2 nightstands, 1 area rug, a dresser and they're removing a nightstand.\nI get a call from her the morning the driver arrived and she said they brought the dresser ONLY?  Seriously people?? Do you not communicate between sales, CS and the shipping Department?  She signs for the dresser but is told that they can't bring the rest of the order until the following day.  At this point we have no choice, get it right, bring us our stuff and move on with life.  We set the delivery for the next day and I get a call 20 minutes later asking why we refused the nightstand (yes if you're playing along it was a dresser).  I said we didn't, that was signed for but the rest of the order wasn't on the truck.\nWhen everything finally came the next day we now realize that the furniture does look great but I must yet again say that you should NEVER buy anything from this company.\nThe right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing because the right foot is sticking it in your A**.  The worst case of poor customer service, lack of communication and misinformation I've ever experienced.\n\nOn a scale of 1-10 I'd give them -25
