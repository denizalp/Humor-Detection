My girlfriend and I visited Milos on Saturday night.  The Cosmopolitan is extremely crowded and not a very big casino in respect to other casinos around town.\n\nWe walked in without reservations.  The average wait time was around 45 minutes.  We ended up sitting at one of the very nice tables at the bar.  The tables there are true dining tables and not your standard bar tables you might find in most restaurants.\n\nWe ordered crab cakes, wine, lobster (the spiny kind) and the fillet.  The lobster definitely wasn't worth the price (nearly $200 per lobster) but the steak was easily one of the best i've had in a while.  The wine was good and the crab cakes were fresh and fantastic.\n\nThe atmosphere at Milos and at the Cosmo are unparalleled.  It's easily the most \"upscale\" and trendy casino in all of Vegas.  Milos is exceptionally decorated.  It is quite pricey though.  Our bill ended up near $350 for the two of us but it was well worth the cost for such a lavish experience.
