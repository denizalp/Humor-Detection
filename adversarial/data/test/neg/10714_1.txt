Really enjoyed the atmosphere and choice of music. The flat iron steak was excellent, joined by delicious Brussels sprouts and acceptable mashed potatoes. Our friend had the burger and is willing to come back, so it must have been good. It was accompanied by ample steak fries. They take reservations, a plus. Will certainly return.
