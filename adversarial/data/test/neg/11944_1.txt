This is a great pizza place ... even better when it's nice enough to sit on their amazing patio!\n\nMy girlfriend and I shared a bottle of Sangria, which was tasty.\n\nWe've been here twice.  Service is definitely hit-and-miss.  One time we went there, the server was too busy.  The other time, the server forgot to return my credit card.\n\nThe pizzas are good.  Nothing spectacular, but definitely good.
