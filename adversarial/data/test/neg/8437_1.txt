Rapidly going downhill. Aroma was fantastic when it opened, but this location has become terrible over the last year. The other locations i go to are still great though. I was a frequent regular here BTW.\n\nFirst, the service is insanely bad. The staff moves at a comically slow pace with a bored vacant stare. When you finally manage to get their attention, they make you feel like you are disturbing them by placing an order. \n\nThe \"baristas\" seem more interested in chatting with friends than the line of people waiting for coffee.  And when they do get around to making coffee, they shuffle like they are working to rule. Typical wait for an espresso-based beverage is about 10-20 mins.\n\nThe nail in the coffin is that lately the coffee itself has become terrible. I couldn't even drink my last 2 cappuccinos and went across the street to get new ones at their competitors.\n\nThe last thing I will mention is the lack of seating due to non-paying people. I don't get it. You'd think they'd want to have seats available to attract paying customers, but they make no effort to police the tables. As I type this 4 of the tables near me are people who simply walked in and sat down without ordering anything. They have been sitting for over 30 mins while other people who are actual customers, cannot find a free table. It is always like this, though you can still get a table in slower hours.\n\nOh, and they have started playing loud bad rock too.\n\nI am angry because I used to love coming here and it has gone to pot. I really hope one of the owners sees this and takes action.
