Just tried this place for the first time and we'll be coming back. It has a cool indoor and outdoor ambiance and the food was really good. I love their different tacos and the ability to mix up your toppings. \n\nLike previous posts, if you're looking for \"authentic Mexican\" with enchiladas and fajitas, then this might not be your place, but the food and drinks are great if you're open for new options.
