This place is amazing! Not only is it a beautifully decorated place, but the people are hard Corp animal lovers! They often work with rescues to help save more Arizona dogs in need! I know that if anyone has hearts fir animals like these guys, they are the ones I'll trust my dogs with! They spend hours on my big Saint Bernard and tolerate her antics and make her the most gorgeous dog in town! Hearts of gold these people! They've got my business that's for sure! Great boarding and play area too!
