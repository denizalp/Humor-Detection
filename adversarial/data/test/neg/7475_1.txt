After expressing my unhappiness, the District Manager for Big O, Eric, contacted me directly.  We spoke for some time about my experience, what exactly I was unhappy about, and how Big O could mend the relationship.  Eric assured me that my experience was not unique under this location's former management, and that the former manager had been terminated and replaced by a very qualified, and customer-focused new manager, Mike.  Mike later contacted me and explained how my issues had been resolved, and I now look forward to returning to this location for what, I am optimistic will be, a good experience.
