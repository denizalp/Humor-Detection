My favorite Payless. All I ever wear sandals sandals all the time sandals all year long and the only sandals I wear are the ones from Payless. This particular location has every color has every size in every color it's well-stocked the store is absolutely beautiful. The saleswomen are really good and they try their best to up sell. Almost annoying but not quite. They always have great sales every summer for these sandals pick yourself up some you won't regret it!
