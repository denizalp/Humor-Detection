This is a must go to if you are in Charlotte, NC.  I was taken here for a business dinner and we ordered \"everything on the menu\" literally.  It was so awesome I had to make a stop when I came back into town.  This time we just sat at the bar, a much smaller group, and we each ordered 2 items to share and a flat bread.  It was plenty of food.  I also love the beer selection and the bartender was really awesome!  I will keep going back. :)
