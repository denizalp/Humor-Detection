The service here is always top notch and for awhile for like 3 yrs we were regulars there just because it was the place for us to get a quick dinner before my single mom's group.  \n\nIt was nice that some of the people knew us by name and greeted us so well.  The food is delish and they are always kind.   Good food, good service, nice ambiance.
