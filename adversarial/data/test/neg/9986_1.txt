Extremely poor customer service.  Last visited on 12\/3 and all you heard was employees complaining about being over worked due to the holidays.  Employees were standing around while clients waited for a loan or service.  I guess they think that a loan is a service to a client but they forget that interest is earned and a profit is made when the item is sold.  So, try to remember that clients are your life's blood and your not the only pawn shop in town. My suggestion to the employees is change jobs since everyone there is unhappy and the manager is clueless to what's going on in the store.  Also the fat guy with freckles thinks he's doing you a favor so he makes clients feel like dirt without consideration for the client's issues.
