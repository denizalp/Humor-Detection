Decent independent theatre. They're one of the first licensed theaters in Toronto but have no beers on tap it's all bottled beer. It's reasonably priced (about $6)  but all they do is pour the bottled beer in a plastic cup and looks like a beer at a high school party not very professional but it's a theatre not a bar so it's understandable. \n\nThe concessions are typical, and about the same price as Cineplex theaters maybe a bit cheaper. \n\nTickets are only $8 for students and I think it's $5 every Tuesday which is a pretty good deal. \n\nThey screen the Room monthly and have some Toronto exclusives of independent films. I came here to see Palo Alto as it was the only theatre in Toronto playing.\n\nThe theatre is very accessible and it's 2 minute walk from College station.\n\nI would come here again for exclusive movies or to see the Room again with an audience.
