There's only one lady who works here (that I know of) and she's the sweetest person ever and does AMAZING eyebrows. She's done them a little thin once but a majority of the time she's meticulous  and gets them perfect every time. Still the best eyebrow threading I've gotten at this price in town and I've been to a few places.
