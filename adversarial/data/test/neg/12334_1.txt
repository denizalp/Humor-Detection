Lavish nail salon is a clean spot to stop by for premium service and product.\n\nThe interior is comfortably modern and calming when you enter. My highest recommendation is that you ask for one of the owners, Katherine or Michael.\n\nThey'll both really make you feel appreciated and take their time on providing the best service. As a rule of thumb anywhere to be safe, I also always suggest making a reservation over just walking in to reduce wait time if there possibly is one.\n\nFrom quick glance, they have a large selection of quality colors and gels for the women and for the men they offer brow waxing and also have sugar scrubs and soaks. Both that will leave you feeling and looking clean.\n\nParking also isn't a problem and it is conveniently located. They say you get what you give, and you really get a lot for what you give at Lavish.
