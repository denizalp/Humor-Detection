First of all there is nothing wrong with the storage staff or location. This company itself is horrible. If you are military and expect to be overseas long, I recommend not storing your things with this company. The auto pay doesn't work most of the time, and when you try and explain your situation they hang up on you. I have been paying online for over a year now and now I can't even do that due to their website for some reason. Again I say it is not the stores personnel, in fact they were great when I had to come home on a Red Cross message to store my loved ones things. They were there when I needed them. it's the company as a whole. Horrible customer service online, and over the phone.
