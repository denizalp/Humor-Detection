I have never had an issue with jo Ann's until I visited the Charlotte location. My mother went to purchase a Christmas card making magazine, the price issued by the magazine company printed on the front was 8.99. When we went to check out Jo Ann's had up charged on the bottom to 15.99. I was so blown away over the double price change. And in addition no coupon was allowed. I will NEVER go there again.
