They seem to have a lot of wait staff but our server kept forgetting things. My husband and I ordered drinks and he ordered a diet root beer which comes in a bottle. We probably waited 10 minutes after she brought my ginger ale before she finally brought over his drink. Then we ordered the not so fries which is supposed to come with sour cream and we were over half done with our fries before she remembered to bring it.
