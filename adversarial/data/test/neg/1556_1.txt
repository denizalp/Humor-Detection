Gosh, Green is just the best. I wasn't even vegetarian when I first started coming here, much less vegan. I didn't even know it was vegan until a few trips in. I'm about 90% vegan now but it doesn't even matter. Good food is good food.\n\nMy favorite thing to get is the Original G po-boy with sweet potato tots, but always always check their specials. And the soynamis....eat them. Eat all of the soynamis.
