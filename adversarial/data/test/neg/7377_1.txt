SC and I met up with a friend here for a weekday dinner and had luckily caught the end of their happy hour (430-630p) with 50% drinks!! I ordered the Grapefruit Basil Margarita and SC the Poco Picante. The drinks had great flavor and according to SC, his was \"the best drink I've ever had.\"\n\nFood wise we got the Jamaican Green Curry Vegetables and Jerk Pulled Pork Quesadilla. There was a lot of great flavor in the curry and I love the fresh pineapple to offset the (a little too spicy for me) curry, all the veggies and the rice. It was comfort in a bowl!\n\nThe service was also very friendly and attentive. I also liked the decor of the restaurant. Would definitely come by again next time we're in town!
