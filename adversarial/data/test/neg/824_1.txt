I just recently came here to get my tape extensions out and a wash and cut. The staff was friendly and great BUT here's the thing, after all my extensions were out which I paid good money for was thrown into a pile and put in back, I had to ASK for my extensions back like I wasn't expecting them back? What the hell?! Then I was told to get them out was $35-$40 they charged me $45. Then I was paying $40 for the cut, style and wash. HE NEVER ASKED ME HOW I WANTED IT CUT. He had me turned away from the mirror the ENTIRE TIME!!!!!! So not only did the owner not ask what I wanted, he just did what he felt what the literal f***, are you kidding me?!? Oh and get this, I came there because it was cheaper yet he charged me for a damn deep clean BUT DIDNT ask me if I wanted that and just did it!!!!you always always ALWAYS, ask the client what they want or if they want to add that and tell them how much it will be !!!!!! Lucky for them i didn't say anything I let it go, but here I will speak up. You do not add anything without telling your client first and the price and see if they want that AND you always let them see what you're doing, he also cut my hair dry not wet...I got why but he didn't cut my bangs right at all. I'm so annoyed about the price and not being told about this deep clean without my consent to then be charged for it. And him leaving my hair in knots and in a bag and literally didn't give them to me until I asked!! I didn't pay $350 for hair to just be treated that way.  Whatever. Never coming here again. The only good thing was that they were friendly but it doesn't go very far when it comes to services being done
