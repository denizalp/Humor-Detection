Let's start with the bad. REALLY slow. I dined in once and it took over an hour before we could leave. The waitress told us the cooks were being lazy because of a previous rush of deliveries. She also told us that the owners put far more weight into the deleveries than they do those who are dinning in and waiting. This seems backwards. If I have to wait on something I would rather be in the comfort of my own home.  We had gotten up and put our coats on when the food finally arrived.\nOur waitress was far too forthcoming with the issues with the restaurant and the owners. We know that the owners are great with Italian food because they're from Egypt... Wait... What? I don't think that waitress works there anymore.\n\nNow the conundrum of the food:\nThe lazagne was interesting. It had way too much liquid in it and I was ready for a horrible meal. I was surprised at the outstanding flavor though. I was ready for the very tasting looking garlic knots. Again, looks are deceiving. They were obviously bought in a can or the freezer section and they were over cooked. I couldn't even eat one. The waitress said that the good bread sells out early so they then bake this other stuff. Personally, I think they just go next door to food lion and grab it out of the freezer. \nMy wife got the philly cheese steak, which was awesome. It came with fries, which were horrible. I am sure they are frozen. \n\nThey have a large selction (although quite a few typos on the menu)\nThey need to reduce the amount on the menu, fix the side items, and pay a little more attention to the people seated in the restaurant.\n\nOur solution:\nWhat we do now is call ahead to get philly cheese steaks (it takes about 20 minutes for them to be ready) and go pick it up. After several attempts with the fries, we just don't bother anymore.
