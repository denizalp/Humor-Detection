This place is awesome! The menu had a great deal of variety to it. They had a lot of traditional Chinese food and Hongkong\/house specialties. The prices were not bad either. They were actually quite affordable. The restaurant was surprisingly big and spacious inside. The service was great with a warm and gracious smile. I checked the lunch menu and it looks really promising. This place is probably one of the best Chinese restaurants that I have recently dined in.
