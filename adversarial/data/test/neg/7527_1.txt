What a horrible service! This girl that works there Carolina or whatever her name was so rude! I was standing in line but had to assist someone on my turn and without being bothered by losing my place I went to the back of the line.... These nice ladies that I was ahead of was willing to let me go back up and order before them but this Witch wouldn't let me saying \" No! She left the line she can't order, she has to go to the back of the line!\" Everyone was starting at her like she was crazy, and it wasn't like I was ordering for the whole casino and paying in change! I was ordering one drink and paying with my Starbucks App, so no one there cared! At all! we were all just trying to get our drinks... \n\nAlso this witch took it to the next level and decided to call security on my boyfriend because he wanted to order a drink and was paying with a workers card, she didn't know what a workers card was so he decided not to get the drink, but then she called security and just started spitting out lies, telling them that we were taking pictures of her, I'm like bitch we're just trying to get a drink, fucken paying customers! ain't no one trying to take pictures of your ugly ass. ( WTF is wrong with people?! )
