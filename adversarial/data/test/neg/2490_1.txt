My wife and I love this new place, good variety, excellent service every time we've been there, incuding this evening from Dana, thanks Dana for outstandiing service and attentiveness. AND we especially like the 70 cent wing Wednesday which my wife and I have made into a new \"tradition\". Great to have this new place in the neighborhood!
