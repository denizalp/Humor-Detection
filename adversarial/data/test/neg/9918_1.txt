i went to Swan Restaurant for Saturday brunch after reviewing it on this website! Jackie P's review made me laugh out loud and it seemed like a pretty cool place.\n\nWe showed up around 11am and were really lucky to score the last available table at the very back, right beside the kitchen the stairs leading to the bathroom.  The place has a very retro feel to it, like its a 50's diner.  I loved that they had coat racks at every booth.\n\nI expected the service to be unfriendly, but our server was actually really nice, and had a big smile on her face the whole time we were there.  Service is fast and efficient.\n\nAs for the food, there are a lot of standard \"eggs and bacon\"  options, and some interesting options such as oysters, arugula salad, etc.\n\nThe coffee was americano, you could tell that they had just brewed it individually.... pretty strong!  Unfortunately, this means no free refills.\n\nMy 'benedicts' came with lots of hash browns, a roasted tomato, a slice of orange and a slice of cantalope..  the servings are pretty big.  The poached eggs were perfectly cooked.  The hash browns were nice and onion-y.  The only negative things i noticed were everything was slightly cold, and the hollandaise sauce was sweet and tangy, rather than creamy and delicious.  This really sticks out because hollandaise sauce, makes an eggs benedict in my opinion, but this sauce just tasted weird.  I wouldn't order it again.\n\nMy friends 'special omlette of the day' had roasted pears, orange peppers and cheese.  Also served with potatoes and fruit.  The omlette was humongous, and very tasty.  I would order this again, but i would split it between two people, as even my very hungry friend and i couldn't finish it!\n\nAll in all, it was very delicious, satisfying breakfast.  A bit pricey (10-12$ for a breakfast entree), excellent service and good food.\n\nOh!  and as a final note, the washrooms (non-accessible, in the basement) are lovely!  pretty and clean.
