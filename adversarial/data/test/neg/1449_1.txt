Delicious food. Owner checks in at the table. Go for the oxtail empanadas but cut them because they are full of hot broth.\n\nOrder everything social. \n\nEverything was delicious but perhaps pass on the Salmon main course. Cooked well but good fish should never smell like...fish.\n\nDefinitely get the chicken w lemon mashed potatoes and the white chocolate cheesecake!!!
