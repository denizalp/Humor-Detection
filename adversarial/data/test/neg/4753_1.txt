Nice Pub Food in Park Rd Plaza.  We came here for a after work going away function and it was good place to hang out with a dark Irish pub feel.  Place is bigger than it looks than when you first walk it. \n\nThey had several seasonal beers on tap (this time Saranac Oktoberfest and some pumpkin) and the food was good. I got to sample the Chicken Fingers which looked to be hand breaded there.  Then I got a order of the Cod fish tacos.   The blackened seasoning was really good, but if you order it get it with a side of sweet potato fries.  It really compliments it.
