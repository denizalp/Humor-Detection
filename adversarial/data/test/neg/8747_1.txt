I am extremely happy I made the choice to finally get my LASIK surgery. I had been doing lots of research about it and was patiently waiting for a place that I can trust. \nI finally made my appointment to go and check it out, I was greeted by their amazing staff. They are very attentive and kind. I was greeted by Aldo as I was checked in by Bianca at the front desk. Bianca then asked me for my information and to fill out some forms. Next I went in to talk to Taylor, she sat down with me and explained to me in detail how the procedure works and what I can be expecting as we moved forward. She gave me some instructions to follow preparing me for my next appointment. I was instructed not to wear my contact lenses for 2 weeks, and to take some hydro eye pills to keep my eyes moisturized. The 2 weeks past by and it was time to get a few test done on my eyes. My pupils were dilated so they could see deep in my eye. Gabby was the lady that was running the exams, she did an amazing job and made me feel comfortable as she was guiding me through the exams. The next day was surgery day. I was a bit nervous because this is all new to me but I knew I was in good hands. Dr McCandless sat down with me and introduced himself with me, sat me down and told me what to expect. Prior to the surgery they gave me some pills to relax me and they did help me to keep calm and at ease. Once I sat down on the chair I knew that was going to walk out of the operation room a new man, with 20\/15 vision. The surgery was a success and now I am so happy to have great visi√≥n, no more wearing glasses or contact lenses. Thank you all for your help and amazing service. I definitely recommend them if you ever think of getting your LASIK.
