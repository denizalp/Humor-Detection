We came in on a Saturday morning around eleven so a wait was to be expected. There's a sign that says the community table is 'open seating' but we were informed it wasn't at that time? There's nowhere to wait inside so bring a jacket! The food was good except my veggie chili that was a bowl of hard beans. I much prefer Flipside but would give it another try.
