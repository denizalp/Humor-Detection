We live in Indiana and we went there last night. I wouldn't brag myself if I says this is the best Indian food I ever ate in States! Food was very delicious, ambiance was nice and Owner(Mr.Gill) was very friendly and taking care of each table personally!\nOverall everything was perfect and on top of that it's located in very happening street! Don't miss this spot if you are in Arizona!
