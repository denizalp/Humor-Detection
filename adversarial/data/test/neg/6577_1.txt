I've eaten here twice and both times the food has been delicious. The service is ok, the valet lines take a considerable amount of time; but overall my expectations have been met! They offer many vegan items and have a good assortment of options. The food time does take a little longer than a typical restaurant, I've noticed. I would definitely recommend this restaurant as a good place to eat, sit and relax- you won't get out of here in less than 2 hours so do go if you're pressed for time.
