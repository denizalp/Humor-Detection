I just returned from picking up our takeout with my son, and I have to say the experience was some of the worst service I've experienced in Madison.  When I called to order the server was almost reluctant to give me the balance, and then abruptly hung up.  \n\nWhen my son and I arrived at the restaurant we had three servers pass us, ignore us, and then waited 2 minutes for a server to get off the phone before asking us what we wanted, as if it was an inconvenience.  I am a single mother and was trying to buy something as a Memorial Day indulgence but not break the bank.  The amount of food we received for the 1\/3 slab and pulled pork sandwich was laughable.  If you are going to charge $15 for that, then at least have the decency to provide good sides and in something larger than a condiment cup that the Mexican place down the road uses for their sour cream.  \n\n I am not sure how people rate this place so highly; my suspicion is that the meat is very well done, while the rest of the business languishes.  I have eaten all over the world and in any international city this business would fail.  \n\nWe will not be returning.
