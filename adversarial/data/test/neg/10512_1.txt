It's unfortunate to read all these negative reviews. Seems logical there would be many good reviews too, however people are not as likely to post positive reviews, or so it seems. \nThis will be a positive review. We have lived in our Fulton Home in Ironwood Crossing for almost 2 months and have had a great experience with this builder. I feel that this is a very quality built home and there is nothing cheap about it. We see nothing in this house that tells us they tried to cut corners on workmanship or quality. Just the opposite, we see quality. You can easily tell when you've lived in the house for a while that it was not just thrown together. \nAlso, Fulton puts a lot of quality features into their homes, 16 seer AC unit, marble, window covering, ceiling fans, and much more. I was even surprised to find out there is a gas furnace. I would have expected a heat pump only like our previous AZ home. I'm my opinion they are trying to go above and beyond to build a quality home. \nAnd the subdivision is equally as great. \nNot sure what happened with the other reviewers who had issues, and not doubting those issues, just feeling like the problems are not the norm for this builder. For every negative review I'm sure there would be many many positive reviews, just folks don't usually bother writing those. Even my neighbors have only good things to say about the quality of their homes. \nAnother thing, the couple small issues we did have in the first days were taken care of promptly. They were all over these things quickly. They care. \nAll in all very happy with our decision to go with Fulton. If there are issues longer term I will update this review to reflect that but for now just going to enjoy our new home.
