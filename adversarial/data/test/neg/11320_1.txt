Im only giving a 3 because of food. I've been looking at the reviews on Yelp and I was excited to try their food! The food didn't disappoint it was the service that did. First impression when I walked in was the smell..over powered with pinesol! I had to hold my nose. The hostess\/waitress was really nice and upbeat but she didnt know the menu...she kept looking at our menu to write things down and everything we asked about she had to go back to ask the kitchen. Ordered a beer had to ask 3 times for it and when she brought it over it was wrong. My water had a few things floating in it. My knife was dirty. She came by to refill water and only refilled 1 glass and walked away while the other 2 were close to empty. Our appetizer came out after our main course. I had to get out of there. Next time I'll order to go!
