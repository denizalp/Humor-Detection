We walked past this place several times before we realized it was a mexican restaurant (the exterior looks more like a bar and it's hard to tell if it's open from the street). Thanks to my trusty yelp app, though I figured out it was a restaurant we should try. We tried the tacos and a burrito. The tacos are tasty and well priced even without it being taco tuesday. The burrito was the best burrito we've had since leaving California. We also ordered a margarita. The drink was delicious and strong... just what you'd expect in a mexican restaurant!\n\nI wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but it's a pretty solid option if you're in the neighborhood and hungry.
