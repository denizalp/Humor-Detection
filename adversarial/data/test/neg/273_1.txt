This is one of my favorite spots in Phoenix.  The tortilla soup is legendary and all of the toppings are delicious and generously offered. I always order a side of the cornbread.. its amazing!  The shortrib enchiladas are super flavorful. I've also tried the nachos, and they are enough for an entire meal.  Every time I go, my eyes are bigger than my stomach! The line gets really long at lunch time, so its better to hit this place up at an off time.  This is the type of place that has something for everyone, and no one will leave disappointed!
