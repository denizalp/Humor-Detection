Always delicious sashimi, nigiri, rolls, and specialty hot Japanese dishes. Nice sake selection as well. Service is always attentive and genuinely friendly. Watcharee is usually our server; she always makes sure we have an excellent meal. My favorites include: miso cod, toro nigiri, spicy salmon w\/avocado roll, fresh wasabi.
