This restaurant mostly trades on the beauty of the building and not on the quality of the food or the service. Wait staff was attentive but disinterested. The food was not as impressive as expected. I had the shrimp fra biablo and there was no spice. Our cappuccinos came with a packet of sugar..most higher end establishments use sugar cubes.  We were not offered a choice of dessert although it was a good cake. Small things but they don't go unnoticed. We had 2 dinners in Scottsdale, one at Kai and one at Cafe Monarch, and Kai was the clear winner. If you're looking for a true culinary experience go to Kai, but Cafe Monarch is a good option in old Scottsdale for a decent dinner in a beautiful building.
