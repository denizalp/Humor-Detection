What a cute little spot on State Street! Love the cute decor and seating area with tables and couches for people to lounge. \n\nThe Tainan braised pork was so yummy and pretty authentic. Tender and nice pickled veggies over a some warm rice - yum!\n\nCrispy Chicken Cutlet bento box was also great although I prefer the steamed fresh broccoli to be warm (steam to order) than cold. The breading on the cutlet was really good and still pretty light being fried. \n\nDefinitely worth making a visit!
