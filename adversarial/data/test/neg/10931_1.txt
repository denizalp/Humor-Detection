I'm extremely happy with the service that I received from Modern Family from the beginning to the end the process was very smooth informative I didn't have to ask no questions they answered everything that I could have thought to ask also they took a really good exam the glasses that I received I can see so clearly now it's amazing it's been a good 13 years since I've actually been able to see out of both eyes without squinting or having to get up really close but after I receive my glasses I can see a hundred percent no more headaches and I thank them so so much so if you're looking for an eye doctor don't look no more this is the place to come I promise you you will not regret the service you receive from these ladies from the receptionist to the one that checks your exam until the doctor thank you ladies so so much
