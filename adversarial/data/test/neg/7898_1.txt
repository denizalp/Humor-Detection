Food is great. The service is great. I highly recommend this place.  My wife and I like to grab lunch here. The lunch specials are good. I had their brownie ice cream dessert once. It was delicious.  For some reason they've been out of fresh brownies since then. I'd like for them to bring the dessert back.\n\nUpdate...9\/19\/14....went to the Blue 32 to grab a quick dessert with my lady and they had brownies again!  Nice!
