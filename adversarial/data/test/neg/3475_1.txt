Another specialty store, in another strip mall. Yee-haw. (Sarcasm dripping from my keyboard). \n\nSelection here is nothing to brag about, especially for running shoes. They carry New-Balances and Nikes, but that's about it. For more selection on athletic shoes, go to Dick's Sporting Goods. Their casual and dress shoe selection is pretty impressive. I love the whole 90s grunge look that is coming back and they have plenty of this in stock. \n\nIn the front, towards the cash registers and near the window, they have cool shoes that you don't notice until you're ready to check out. Missed out on those ones. \n\nPrices are \"OK\" but for a shoe store, I'd expect a better deal. Running shoes are on better sale as sporting goods. They have clearance racks, but they are usually picked over pretty thoroughly, unless you have size 11+ feet. \n\nA quick stop, in and out. It's a shoe store, not brain surgery.
