Phenomenal.\nI am quite the snob when it comes to Italian food, but this place is a gem.\nAfter walking around Fremont street for an hour looking for a place to eat, we stumbled upon this place and the exquisite aroma of the food is what drew us in. For a party of 5 on a Saturday night with no reservation we we're sat right away. \nWhat impresses me in any restaurant is a server who is passionate about what they serve and ours was just that. She was knowledgable about the wine and food pairings and recommended great dishes. \nAntipasti- 5 stars\nCannelloni Di Pollo- 4 stars\nChicken Picatta- 4 stars\nTiramisu- 5 stars\nBut what blew me away was the Margherita Pizza. Wow. Thin, crispy crispy baked in a stone oven. Just wow. And the flavor is to die for. I'd go back I Vegas just for this pizza.\nVery romantic seating, worth getting dressed up for.
