First, the positive: the shrimp ceviche was the best I've had in Las Vegas - hands down. Amazing. The cilantro chicken dish I tried was also very good. \n\nThe not-quite-so-positive: my wife's steak was overcooked and bland. Also, with an shared appetizer and entree each, it quickly turned into a $55 lunch - and we don't even drink. \n\nNext time I think I'll just order the appetizer as my meal and I will be a happy camper!
