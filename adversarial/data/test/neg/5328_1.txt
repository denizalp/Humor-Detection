Waited several minutes to be greeted and sat.  Server came and took drink orders.  We had 3 shareable apps, pretzel sticks had no salt, looked like they had blisters and were dripping in oil, beer sauce was nice.  Egg rolls were nice too.  I had beef tips on garlic mash with stout gravy.  Was just warm, beef way over cooked and chewy, raw mushrooms which was odd.  Johan had a beef and brisket burger which was dry and paid extra for garlic fries, it was just fries with a plop of garlic on a few fries.\nServer checked on food the second it was put down and we didn't see him again till after meal.
