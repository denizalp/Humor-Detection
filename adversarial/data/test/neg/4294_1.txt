We stopped in the first time in summer for a beer just to wait for the shuttle to the Airdrie Rodeo... which met in front, and were pleased at the selection on tap. I recently ended up back here for lunch, after working outside for the morning in -34 weather and had the Craft Dinner....  WOW!  In the menu it is described thus: \"Maplewood smoked bacon, chorizo sausage, mozzarella, cheddar, jack cheese, jalape√±o, frizzled onion, and garlic toast.\" It sounded good to me, but didn't look like anything fancy, honestly. The blend of textures and flavours was a surprise, presenting and tasting like quite the masterpiece  when I thought I was just ordering a standard (see what I did there?) pub comfort dish to combat the cold weather, and I will definitely order it again. The servers were pleasant.  In summer, with the garage doors open, it is breezy and pleasant, and on this visit it was warm and inviting.
