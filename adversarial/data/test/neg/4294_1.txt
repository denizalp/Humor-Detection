My girlfriend took me here for my birthday. Very impressed. Service was awesome (kudos to Kimberly,  she was great), and the food was incredible. \n\nVery interesting flavour profiles in the 5 course tasting menu, and I enjoyed mixing & matching different parts of each plate to try something new. Fantastic wine list as well. Would definitely go again. Chef Lorenzo and his team did not disappoint!
