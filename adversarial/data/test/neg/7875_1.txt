After receiving my new windshield I noticed that the vin number was visible while driving. My insurance company recommended a tinting shop 1 1\/2 hours away and I was not happy with his recommendation. I contacted them again and they gave me the number to Randy's tint shop. Randy diagnosed the problem right away and explained the problem and solution to my insurance company. I recommend contacting Randy for any windshield concerns.
