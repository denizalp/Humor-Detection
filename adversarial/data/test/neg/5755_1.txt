Just got back from Europe and exchanged my Euros here because my bank wouldn't accept the edition of bill I had. It is located inside of the US Bank. The service was very fast, friendly and efficient. The only negative aspect of my experience was paying the $8 service charge. Other than that the exchange rate was fair. Would recommend to friends.
