What a disaster!  The only reason I gave one star was because there were no negative star options!  Definitely not a place to go with a large party.   We had a party of 13 and a reservation for 7:15 to have a celebratory dinner.  We all stood in the lobby waiting for our \"reservation\" for about 40 minutes. We were the wait was because they didn't have enough menus.  Really??? My bad, thought it was pretty standard to have enough menus for your guest.  It was about 8 pm before we even placed our orders. Every part of this experience was horrible.  Dinner\/salads started coming out before the apps.  I never got the drink I ordered, we kept being told refills were coming which never happened.  Some of the dishes were just so awful they were inedible. 2 of our party ordered tri trip which looked like it had just been scavenged somewhere from the kitchen and thrown on the plate. It was so tough they couldn't chew it. I ordered the chicken parm pasta which was nothing like the description.  The breading was soggy and needed to be cooked longer and it was pretty tasteless. I was skeptical about even eating it wondering if I would get sick. The talapia and shrimp dish came out missing it's sauce.  Potatoes came with no toppings and the beef ribs were full of fat and rubbery.  We had to ask repeatedly for things like toppings and drink refills.  By the time they did bring toppings for the potatoes, they had to bring new potatoes because the original ones were cold.  The manager finally came over and started trying to help our waiter play catch up by bringing out drinks.  One couple had to share a glass all through dinner because their drink never came.  Our server was clearly in over his head and freaking out making it a very uncomfortable experience for all of us. His attitude and lip service was like we should share the blame for his misfortune of having to deal with our large party.  When the waiter asked if we would be needing separate checks he was very excited when we said no, one is fine. He then tells us, that's awesome, you guys just don't understand I'm dislexic and this is really difficult!  PRICELESS!  \n\nOur host was very upset because it was his intention to treat us all to a great meal and experience.  Unfortunately CJ has gone way down hill!  Meals used to be incredible and a very special experience.  Not the case this time.  Go somewhere else!!
