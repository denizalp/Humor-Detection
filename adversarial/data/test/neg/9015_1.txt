Okay... I just realized I am a flavor whore. I'm just not satisfied unless my frozen yogurt cup has 5 or more flavors. I especially like the fruity, no dairy flavors and mojo had only one choice for that. :( I would compare the options to golden spoon.\nSooo... I continue my hunt for my favorite yogurt shop.
