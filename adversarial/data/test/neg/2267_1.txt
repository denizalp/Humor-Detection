I love the staff, the owners and the fit family over here at Raw. I took the Drop 20 in 6 Wks challenge and though I only lost about -11lbs, I have kept the weight off. It is totally worth it. The support system here is incredible and they truly care about you and your well being. The trainers keep you motivated and want you to succeed. The owners are caring and genuinely want you to do better for yourself. I couldn't ask for a better place to work out.
