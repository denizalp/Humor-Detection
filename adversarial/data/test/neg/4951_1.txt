Love Cannery. Great craft beer selection. I'm always able to find brews here that you just don't see other places. They've got a very small build a six pack cooler. A good variety of bomber bottles. Good selection of wine and spirits also. \n\nMy husband brews beer, so it's nice having this place w\/in about a half hour of Beaver Dam. He orders most of his stuff online, but there have been a couple of times he realizes he's missing something, so we make a quick run to Cannery to pick up whatever he needs. \n\nThey also do tastings quite frequently and I've even been in there when they've had a brewing class going on. I wish we lived a little closer, I would stop in for those events. \n\nI highly recommend this place, especially to craft beer lovers and homebrewers.
