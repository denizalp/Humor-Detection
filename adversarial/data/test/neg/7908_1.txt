Called to make an appointment because I read such great reviews. A women answers and greets me then I tell her I would like to make an appointment. So she says okay and puts me on hold long enough for the system to automatically dial again just for a different women to answer and greet me again. Obviously confused, I tell her someone else just put me on hold then she puts me on hold again to find out who I was initially talking to! She takes me off hold to tell me that the person I was talking to \"had to help another patient\" and that \"the call was lost\". Which one was it? Lost my interest in this place that fast.
