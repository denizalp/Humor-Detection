I recently ordered delivery from Sushi Mugen. While it can be a bit more expensive than its neighbouring sushi spot, the quality is much better. Service is delightful. Salad comes with creamy sesame dressing! And the driver is an honest person who bypasses the tip option on the machine because the delivery charge is prepaid -- I've never experienced that before. Anyway eat their sushi, tip the driver, and good things will happen.
