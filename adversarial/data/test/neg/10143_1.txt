I love their food! I just went there for pickup and I was greeted as soon as I walked in. The lady was really nice. She was patient with me while I looked through the menu. It took my awhile because I had a cranky three yr old with me.  The food was hot and fresh. They had a really good selection of made-on-site desserts. \nI ordered the chicken curry pita wrap add it was made perfectly!  My son had the chicken cheese pita pitza and my husband has the chicken Dijon pita wrap. All of it was fresh, hot, and quickly made.
