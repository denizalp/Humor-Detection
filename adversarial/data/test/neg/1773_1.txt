This was my first time eating cafe rio at this location. My experience here wasn't so bad as other reviews. But I guess it's because my friend and I came around 6:00pm so the place wasn't too empty or too packed. It was just right and I didn't have to wait that long in line. It went by pretty fast and got my food on time so that's a plus.
