This Best Buy is great, and employees us awesome, most helpful and nice ever! If not theys help, I will never get to buy new phone but keep my phone number when I switching services with Verizon because when I purchasing new phone, they help me choose one and set all up ( and its honestly a huge challenge with Verizon horrible customer tech support and even with that terrific Best Buy employees help phone number 'migration'  take couple of hours, because Verizon keep hanging up and transferring). \nThank you, Jaylene and Matthew!!! \nYou are most terrific and unbelievable friendly, nice and helpful, simply THE BEST!!!\nI will be back, its my favorite store now!!!
