This place is a very large asian supermarket.  Very clean & well organized & stocked.  They sell a variety of asian foods like korean, japanese, & some hawaiian too.  Very much affordable as well.  Not to mention, they also have a great food court in there.  Not too much of a selection in the food court but the food is awesome & the staff is super nice! Luv it!!
