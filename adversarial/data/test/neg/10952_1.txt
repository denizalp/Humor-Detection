Disgusting.\n\nFirst off, the server was horrible.  She didn't listen and got several drink orders wrong.  She also took up to 20 minutes before getting drinks and refills.\n\nThe food selection was abysmal.  And the taste was worse.  Things tasted stale, like they set out too long, old, and unseasoned.\n\nI would never return to this buffet or recommend it.
