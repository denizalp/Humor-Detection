I am doing a flash back into time and reviewing this place. I lived in Las Vegas for a year during a post graduate program about  5 years ago. From the look of the reviews, the place has not changed much. But, take that into consideration. I used to get all over LV., and this was my all time favorite place to have lunch. It is likely the best sandwich place on the planet!!! \n\nMy first exposure to them was at a couple different work locations. They do sandwich trays for catering. They just kept poppin up everywhere I went (new work\/training location every 4 weeks). The great thing about catered sandwich trays is 1. then are free to me, and 2. you can try a few different types of sandwiches. Over time I tried several. But, my favorite was their Bobby. It was a turkey, cranberry and stuffing sandwich on a soft roll with mayonnaise. It makes my mouth water. I was never a stuffing fan as a kid (those nasty gizzards in there turned me off!). But, this was like a nice bread or cornbread stuffing without the extra fluff. Damn, what a great combination. It was just to die for. And with several of these places around town, I could get them just about anywhere I was. I cant say I ate them all that often, but I used to run from the plaza where this one is and dinner was an easy stop off here. \n\nWhether you are from Vegas or just visiting, get by a Capriottis. All of their sandwiches are great but the Bobby is SOOOOO GOOOD, you just have to try it out. And, if you are catering your work lunch, think about them too so all your staff can enjoy.\n\nCapriotti's needs to franchise to the bay area, PLEASE!!!!
