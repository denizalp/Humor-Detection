I knew about this place in it's former location, and liked it then! Wasn't sure what to expect when I saw where it had moved too. It took a couple of times in the Hall to find it as it's in the back corner, tucked away. I have to say though, the staff is Very friendly, they smile at my Bad jokes, the service is top notch, the coffee is excellent, and there Brownie, OMG, if your a chocolate addict like me, It's Insanely good! It Could last you a good hour to eat, several of the people I work with have become addicted to it like me!!
