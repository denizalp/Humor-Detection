To start I've only had breakfast, but our friends that love BLD say breakfast is the best.  We've tried it 3 times, both getting something different and didn't like any of the meals.  I do like that we can bring our dog here.  Somebody once told us it depends on the day and who's cooking if the food is any good.  From the reviews it sounds like it.  The service is really good, beer options are good, happy is good.
