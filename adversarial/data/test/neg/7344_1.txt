Wow, not surprising I had a bad experience at their auto service centre.  I brought my car in for a simple door window fix.  The initial repair took 14 hours of my day for 1.5 hours of labour.  Then I had to bring my car back a couple of days later twice in the same day because they wouldn't listen to what I was telling them was the problem I was experiencing.\n\nThey accused me of saying that I had requested specific parts be replaced and they did the work as requested, where all I did was bring my car to them and asked them to fix it and authorized them to replace the parts they recommended.\n\nUnless you are getting something simple done like getting new tires or an oil change I would stay away from this service centre.  The two different staff members that I dealt with were friendly to me but overall VERY rude to most of the customers that came through while I was sitting in the waiting area.\n\nI don't want to tarnish Canadian Tire's rapport in general as I've had good experiences at other service centres, just not this specific location.
