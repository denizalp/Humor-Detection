If you're looking for sushi, definitely do not come here. We had a lunch pre fixe meal and it consisted of a miso soup\/salad, tonkatsu ramen and salmon avocado roll. The soup was great and ramen was superb, the pork slices especially delicious. BUT on to the roll. Oh my god the roll was served very cold, the salmon was not fresh, definitely old, and the rice just tasted bad, like really bad. The result was a weird dark berry taste combination when you mix it in soy sauce. Yes that sounds weird but I swear that the best description for what horror my roll experience was. Had i not been for the sushi I would give this place 3-4 stars, but that definitely ruined it.
