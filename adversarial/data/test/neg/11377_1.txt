BYOB is a great place with extremely fresh ingredients. I was impressed with both the cleanliness and the fact they let you pull your own ingredients (if desired) or they can pull them for you. You can smell the freshness when you first walk in the door. I've made two beers recently with their ingredients and they've turned out perfect. The freshness makes a big difference and I highly recommend a stop here if you're making your own brew.
