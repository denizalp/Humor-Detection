Very much enjoyed Papa Kelsey's Pizza. Started out with a great host to order our pizza. Was helpful with suggestions. Our salad was out with in 2 minutes, and the pizza not far behind. Very good pizza. ALL of the staff was friendly and helpful. Even heard them offer to help a customer bring out a large order to their car.
