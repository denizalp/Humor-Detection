I've finally tried this place.....sadly, disappointing. Cashier couldn't answer my questions. Not welcoming. No good customer service. Ordered wings, pizza slices=seasoning was flat. Several tables were dirty the thirty minutes we sat there. Disappointing. Tv's too loud. Kids running things. Where was management?
