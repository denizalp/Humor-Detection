Great Fresh food and excellent service. This business values it's customers and it shows. \n\nI've been getting lunch from Cosi at least twice a month for 3 years. \n\nThe food selection is pretty good, with quite a few vegetarian options. Their menu is easily accessed online along with the nutritional and allergen info. They keep the website up to date with seasonal offerings as well. They also offer a 'Duo' option where you can choose 2 items of either a small salad, half sandwich, or small soup. It's perfect to change it up for lunch depending on the season. \n\nI've not once had a poor quality meal here. The food is fresh, substantial, and quite tasty. The menus list all ingredients in an item and you can customize. They also provide a 'lightened up' version of many salads and sandwiches that allow you to cut the calories a bit. \n\nI've also had darn great service here, too. Only once did I have to wait an inordinate amount of time for my To Go order. When I asked how much longer it would take, a manager jumped on it right away (despite being super busy) and not only got me my order but gave me a certificate for a free meal. They also offer a 'rewards' deal. 10 purchased meals will get you a free Entree with no restrictions on your selection. The counter staff is very friendly, and there's one older gentlemen who works there who is fantastically outgoing and funny! \n\nThe restaurant itself is cozy and clean. I rarely see dirty tables, the decor is warm with a mixture of booths and chairs and tables that can be easily pulled together for larger parties. And free Wi-Fi is also a huge bonus!
