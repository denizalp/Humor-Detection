I am mildly impressed with the fact that the attempt to be a Vegas -style casino in Arizona is long overdue here in the valley of the slots.  This is not a pass, but rather a visit that will allow you to feel like you are in the middle of something more special than the other casinos in the area.  Not just because it is new but because you will be charged for the aesthetics.  But it is beautifully and tastefully done.  I for one am happy that there is another place to meet up with a middle class crowd of good people looking to enjoy  the fruits of their labour.\nBearing in mind that you are actually NOT in Nevada, and remembering that you have to drive 25 miles to get to Scottsdale, this community is strategically placed for success.  Its size is also well porportioned for a successful feeling of activity.  \n\nIf you are looking for flaws, we can point them out upon entering from the parking lot. The TV screens show programs sideways and it only seems to show football each time I go by.  I think the screens are meant to advertise the venue vertically and so there was no attempt to have the screens turned horizontically.  Then, we could say that fewer machines might be appropriate with more variety of types of machines.  We could complain about the price of the tables, but since the place is new, it may take them a while to drop the minimum bets to $5.  The absence of a buffet is not a miss in my opinion and I hope that the retaurants that are there will maintain the quality of their menus.  The platinum invitation only bar upstairs is a little cold atmospherically, but could be easily overcome with the right music piped into it.  The live entertainment venue is my biggest complaint.  I feel that they could have had a larger venue for winners, alas losers to jiggle and hoop about in...  I think that it is a miss also because I saw no evidence of Karoake. Sorry.  I am biased.\n\nOverall.  I will say that the place should be successful and I hope that it does not just wind up sitting in the desert under populated by winners and heavily trafficked by losers.
