Came here for a celebration last Saturday . . . \nIt feels a little fancier than King st - maybe the area, maybe it's the #2 designation on Canada's Best Restaurants 2016, but the food most def. lives up to this top tier rating . . . wow! \nWe were greeted by a bevy of friendly faces, and seated instantly (reservations strongly recommended, which we had).\nWine list is A+ - and staff is happy to answer any questions you have. We tried:\nBurrata Pizza + addition of shaved truffles (not on the menu, but so worth it!) - God I love soft cheese. The pizza here is a MUST try - any kind, they are all great!\nBigoli Pasta - Duck pasta with mascarpone stewed in warm spices (5\/5 for a savoury\/sweet lover)\nAlici Pizza - super delish\n\nWhen we return we will definitely try seafood, their crispy seafood platter looks fantastic & was recommended.\n\nPs. Entry is on the right side of the Four Seasons courtyard on Yorkville, not Scollard.
