This is a cute place for kids to visit, or if you are a huge avengers fan. If you check in on yelp, there is a discount for admission. The employees are really nice. There was one employee dressed like black panther and he seemed really into his job, which we appreciated. It was a nice experience and the kids really enjoyed it, so that's a plus.
