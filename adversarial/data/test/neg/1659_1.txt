Great place! I got the king size for just over $100, and pool side view. Bed was extremly comfortable. They have complimentry wine and beer every night from 5-7 pm(limit 2 per person). Great breakfast with all sorts of food and fruit. More then the usual hotel. I would give this place a 5-star, but the ONLY thing that changed my mind was how nasty the pool was. If you take a second to look at it, you can see cereal, women's hair, bugs, and all sorts of stuff. Grossed me out. Other then that, great hotel.
