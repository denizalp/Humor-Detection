I've been to a few big race tracks on the West Coast. Infineon, California motor speedway, Irwindale and even streets of long beach. My problem is with the security and not the events held there. Im pretty sure security is handled by each track and not part of the events. So I've gone to all the formula D's at their locations. I actually race at California Motor speedway for a track day.\n\nAnyways. We came a little late to the last show for formula D and couldn't find a seat. Down in front of the isle to the side not blocking anyones view was the blocked off iron gate. With 20 minuites to go, we decided to just wait there since it was a great spot and we could see everything. One security gaurd came over and told us that regulations we had to stand another 20 feet back. So being that it was still early we went ahead and stepped back to ensure our spot in the front to watch. Time biulds and we get closer to the starting of the drift. Of course with there being a line of poeple 20 feet back, poeple started walking forward and staying there. We didnt want to move as to not loose our \"front\" spot. Race starts, security doesnt tell anyone to move now. So we had our spot, and now we lost it because security won't tell the 50 or so poeple that biult up in our way to move. I complained to a security guy and he told me. Rules changed. Tuff luck. Just find another spot, I can't move them because it would start a fight. \n\nI asked who his supervisor was. Would not give me the name. Wouldnt even give me his name. So in short, because of this guy. I will probably never go to an event at this racetrack. I've never had any other issues at any race track. I understand safety and have no problem with it.
