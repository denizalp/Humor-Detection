Came here with a large group (11) and had a nice little space all to ourselves. We really got a kick out of Gordie the accordion player as he came around and showed us his chops.\n\nI have to give some credit to the free table wine - it was flowing freely, and the carafes were always full. \n\nThe food was good overall. Delicious garlic bread. The minestrone was tasty, and the italian salad was fresh. I decided to try the special for the day - veal osso bucco. The veal was amazingly tender, but the orzo pasta base was a bit lacking in flavor.\n\nA fun joint, unless you are about to get whacked.
