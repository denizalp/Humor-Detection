$27 is way too expensive for the quality of food and service at this buffet. A good buffet should not sacrifice quality for quantity, which is what this place does. Chicken is dry, Hawaiian food does not taste like it is supposed to, desserts were warm, wait time to even be seated was 30 minutes, the waiter didn't make sure our drinks were full... Had to continuously ask him for more water. I won't be coming here again.
