Used them a lot and generally, I never have a problem.  But one caveat -- if you book online, you are required to prepay your parking.  If you ever have to reschedule your parking dates, or cancel them, you can almost never get a refund, despite them saying that they will refund you.  Even after you contact them and they tell you in writing via email that they will credit the refund to your credit card, they don't!
