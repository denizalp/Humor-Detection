Absolutely delicious! We had a shrimp ramen with vegetable broth which my girlfriend loved. I had the ohjah ramen and it was solid. We received our food quickly and the service was excellent! We also tried the green tea cheesecake. It didn't have a strong green tea flavor which I liked. I will be back!
