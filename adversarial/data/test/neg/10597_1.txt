Came in on. Tuesday for lunch. Let's hope dinners later in the week are better.  It's too bad. No martini glasses so it came in a champagne flute. Took way too long to get our drinks. Let me say that again, WAY TOO LONG. We had six tacos between the two of us. Mine were tasteless. Chicken, beef, steak. The other three were blah. Fried fish was terrible. Shrimp was ok and grilled fish was ok. Tres Leches was awful. Service blah. No need to return. Many better places to go. No wonder they have so many daily specials.
