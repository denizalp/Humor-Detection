Yes there is a lot of hype about Matt's and yes it's worth it. So is the wait. If you arrive any time after like 8:30 am on the weekend you will have to wait. It's no fancy brunch spot, just a good ol' traditional\nAmerican breakfast that hits the spot. Eggs toast potatoes jam waffles pancakes and options of meat if that's your thing too - ( I've heard they have the best bacon around) it's all delicious and it really is BIG.
