I literally just ordered a salad WITH steak, paid $17. I was in a rush to get to my gate so I grabbed the bag she handed me and ran (it took 20 minutes to get my salad). I got to my gate, and there wasn't any steak. I paid an extra $7 for nothing!!! Not to mention I have a 5 hour flight with some lettuce to tide me over! Grrrrrr!
