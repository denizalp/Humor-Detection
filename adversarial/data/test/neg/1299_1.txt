Cute, clean, and cozy Thai restaurant in east Mesa. Service is gracious, speedy, and friendly. Lunch prices can't be beat. I got a choice of soup or salad with my entree as well as a fried spring roll with a drink for $11. The panang curry with beef is very tasty. Their Thai iced tea is delish, too.
