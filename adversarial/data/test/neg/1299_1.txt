My family and I dined at Roy's last night. Wonderful experience from start to finish. I made the Rez online and indicated that it was my husband and Sister-in-laws' birthdays. We were seated at our table and found birthday cards for both!! SO nice! Our server as well as busser were fantastic! (I've worked in fine dining for 17 years so I'm definitely a tough critic!) \n\nWe had the Prawn app, wagyu beef and crab roll and sunrise roll. All amazing!\n\nWe had the short ribs, fish sampler, butterfish and scallops and all were amazing!\n\nTWO complimentary key lime (I think) desserts that were awesome as well as Chocolate lava cake and an amazing pineapple upside down cake!\n\nStart to finish a wonderful night! Thank you Roy's! We will be back soon!
