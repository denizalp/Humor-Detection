WATCH BATTERY REPLACEMENT\n\nOn the way to lunch at Krazy Buffet I took a shot and asked these people if they would put a new battery in my watch.   Finding this service is not that easy.\n\nThey welcomed my request.  They popped in a new battery and shined up my watch.  Very pleasant consumer experience.  They charged $10.  Nicky Santoro would have been proud.
