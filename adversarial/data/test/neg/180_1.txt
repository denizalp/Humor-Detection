The atmosphere was great and the food was amazing. Service was prompt and courteous. I had the Prime Rib and it was delicious and my wife had the Rib Eye steak and it was possibly the greatest steak ever. The Parmesan potato stack was a great side, very flavorful. I will definitely go again next time I visit Phoenix.
