WOW! I absolutely LOVE this place! A bookstore and a cheesecake restaurant...what more could a person want. The savory cheesecakes are my absolute favorite. You gotta try the little mini jalapeno cheesecakes. I could live off this stuff. When I arrived I was greeted by a rather dapper young man in a really cool zoot suit. I was quite impressed with him. He knows his stuff. He took me on a little tour pointing out a few things that he think I would like based on our conversation. Why isn't there one of these in LA? It would be a HUGE success here. I am definitely visiting this little gem every time I am in Vegas.
