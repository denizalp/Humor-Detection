Love Mexican food. Traveled to Mexico many times. Cook Mexican food at home. blah blah blah.\n\nBasically, Frank & Fina's presented nothing special. As a matter of fact, the guacamole was Terrible=watered down, no spices, and tasted \"shiny\" (you know what I mean right?). Yuck. There was absolutely no difference b\/t the Carne Asada and the Rib-eye except the price. Lame. \n\nBenefits of going here were: no wait on a Friday night, good service, decent atmosphere (not romantic, but not blaring terribly loud music either). \n\nI'd rather go to Pepe's Tacos (any location). Its cheaper, tastier, and they serve Manzanita (apple flavored soda)!
