Hands down my favorite falafel place. \n\nTheir falafel is delicious. I'd been going to the one in the market since I was a little kid. When I went to try the  new one at metro, the owner knew my name and what I wanted to order! Now that's service...\n\nSince then I've tried the burgers (good!), onion rings (great!) and gyro (also really good!). Definitely worth the trip. Yum.
