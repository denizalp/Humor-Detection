What can i say, staff food and atmosphere all come together for an enjoyable breakfast. Perfect for client meetings or sitting alone.\nIf you like homemade chips and\/or deep fried potato hash browns, this is the place for you, you can watch them prepare everything right before your eyes.\n\nBe prepared to serve yourself for grabbing utensils, water and all you can drink coffee. I myself really enjoy that part of the experience. So don't be lazy, get up and get that second cup of coffee or glass of water.\n\nLot of condiments to choose too.\n\nEnjoy
