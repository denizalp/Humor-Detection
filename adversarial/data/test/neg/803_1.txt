I scheduled a rental which was a convertible mustang. When I arrived I was in the line for 85 minutes before getting to the counter. When I got to the counter, they informed me they did not have the car that I rented, and had to chose something else. It came to getting a Convertible jeep. They have a weird policy that they will not assist you with removal the roof but instead give you lack luster instructions and claim its a liability. The price was a bit more expensive but we were very set on having a convertible for the Memorial Day Weekend.  Upon returning the vehicle they informed me I would have to pay an extra $75 if the roof wasn't placed back on the vehicle. I drove the vehicle across the street to the gas station to put the roof on. I was never given instructions on placing this difficult roof back on. The male manager came over to help me and my wife and upon completion, the manager said \"Ok its good to drive back over there now\". One of the associates comes to tell me that they found ashes in the back seat. Ok cool you got me, I was smoking all weekend in the car. They also charged me the $75 fee for not having the roof on the vehicle when the manager just helped me put it on and told me to drive it back. There was a pregnant female manager they used profanity and cussed at me during this interaction. Worst experience ever when renting a car. I've never received service from ANYONE not just a rental car, that would use inappropriate language just to make a point. Terrible service would never recommend ACE or VERVE car rental in Las Vegas, rent from the air port or Fox Rent a Car
