This is by far my favourite board game cafe in Toronto. Costs $6 to get in and you have access to over 3500k games to choose from. There is a guru that walks around and helps your choose a game for you and your company, simply give him\/her your choice of genre and you will be offered a few games to choose from, where they will sit and teach you the game! SnL also has tournaments, game developer night, and special events. The menu has gotten a lot better! Popcorn is always a hit. The smoothies are delicious, but you must get the Nutella cafe, it's too delicious...warning, you might order two! The drip coffee is delicious and I believe it's fair trade. Enjoy your experience !!! #GameOn
