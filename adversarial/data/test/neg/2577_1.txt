So excited to find this great burger place in our neighborhood! This restaurant is decorated super kitschy and quaint, and feels like you're back in time the moment you walk in.\n\nThe burgers come bare, and cheese is an add on. What I really loved was the fixin's bar, where you can dress up your burger with lettuce, onion, pickles, tomatoes, condiments - whatever you want.\n\nThe chicken tenders looked reeeally good, but I just got a small burger with fries. Hubby got the double big burger and shared my fries (saving me from myself since 2013...HA.) \n\nService was super nice. You can see the real chicken breasts and burger patties being made on the grill and the food definitely looked, felt, and tasted high quality.
