I went for happy hour when they offer half off of the common rolls. The specialty rolls are still normal price but you can get some of each and mix it up for a hot deal. \n\nDon't let the strip mall store front or the lack of atmosphere inside fool you, this place serves up some quality fish! I would even say that it's better than some of our more expensive hibachi places here in Sandusky. The fish was super fresh and the rolls were well made.\n\nThe only negatives I could say would be to maybe update the decor a bit and put more flare into the presentation itself. But these things wouldn't keep me away from such delicious offerings.
