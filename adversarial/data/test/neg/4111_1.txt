This was my second time coming here, the first time was almost 4 years ago. Last time, our all around experience, including the food was mediocre at best, but it was much better than this time. We came here tonight for a friend's birthday, and since being here last, everything has dramatically gone down hill. Here is the list of complaints we had about our evening:\n-As soon as we walked in, the interior looked dingy and run down. The ceiling tiles were water damaged and warped and it was uncomfortably warm inside. \n-The lighting was too bright and my husband actually had some sort of spot light shining into his face during the entire dinner while we sat stuffed in a corner away from everything. \n-The waitress, Jennette, seemed put out and almost in a rush to take our orders. She was very snippy and appeared to be annoyed with our questions about the menu. \n-My husband's wine glass had dried wine in it. The water or its glass appeared cloudy and overall it was dirty.\n-The food was way overpriced for its quality and portion size. The house salads that came with the entrees were basic and some of the lettuce was brown and wilted. My cajun halibut was extremely overcooked and dry. My husband's scallops didn't have any sear on them and they were gritty. They were also cooked and placed into a cream sauce that was heavy and lacking any depth of flavor. The ranch style potatoes were extremely salty and greasy. \n-When the bill came we asked if we could split the check, and we asked for a pen so we could write who had what. My husband said it would be split with each couple on their own bill and she either acted like she didn't hear us or just wasn't paying attention and walked away after he suggested it. She came back quickly, standing over us; once again making us feel rushed. She could have easily split the checks without us having to write out who had what. \n\nThis place is known for being a steak house, and last time we were here got steaks, and others in our party tonight got steaks. The steaks are subpar to other places we've been. \n \nOverall, it was a terrible experience and a complete waste of money. I won't ever recommend anyone to go here and will make sure to suggest other places if this place is brought up.
