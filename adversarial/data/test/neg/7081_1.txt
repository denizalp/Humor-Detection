Called Ryan yesterday to get general idea of what might fit my situation, replacing a stock radio on an older vehicle to have bluetooth, aux and USB connections. Called again late this morning and he said he could free up a guy in 45 minutes for new stereo installation. Drove over there and waited while they completed the job in a timely and professional manner. Great result at a price that made it not worth it to do it myself. Definitely worth the 25 minute drive to get there. I will be back here for any auto sound needs.
