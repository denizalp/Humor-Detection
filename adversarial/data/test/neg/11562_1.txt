Maybe I'm being picky or just being a pregnant lady. Anyways, I was excited to try this place out, but honestly a little let down. The taste of the ABC burger was good but literally means avocado, bacon, and cheese... I wish the lady would of gave me an heads up that it didn't have any lettuce or tomatoes... For the fried zucchini, geezus I understand it's called farmer boys but these are not items that you can eat in the car. They take a whole zucchini, cut it into 4 long humongous pieces and fry them. I don't know, overall it was a let down. Don't get me wrong the flavors were good but it was missing something or a few things. Wait, my burger was crushed by the fried zucchinis. Literally a flat ABC burger.
