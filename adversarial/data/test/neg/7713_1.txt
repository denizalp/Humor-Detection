We got our late night Cantonese fixings here! So happy with the Wonton Noodle Soup, BBQ Rice Plate, and stir-fried vegetables (asked for less oil and the dish was not greasy as well, good job!). Not sure why they have such low ratings? Maybe because they take cash only? lol, which took me by surprise but at the end I was fine with it. The typical Chinese style service might make you feel rushed and unwelcome, but once you've accepted that that is a cultural manner, just don't think too much about it!
