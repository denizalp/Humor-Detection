Bad reviews? What restaurant were these people at?  Il Mulino has Outstanding service, exquisite cuisine, and an impressive wine list making this authentic Italian restaurant a must experience.\n\nFrom the small samplings delivered to table upon our being seated to dessert and everything in between, simply amazing.\nI had the Osso Bucco and my wife had shrimp with a mushroom risotto.  Everything was cooked perfectly and delicious.  For dessert? The best Tiramisu I've ever had.\n\nThis is not an inexpensive place to eat but it is well worth it.  Among the best meals I've had on any continent.
