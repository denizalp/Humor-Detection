This is the worst bank with the ABSOLUTELY worst Branch\nThat I have encountered in my entire life anywhere I have lived in the whole world\nThey make you promises that they do things and they NEVER follow through\nThey have different Clerks and managers all of the time \nYou can not count on ANYTHING they say or do\nIf there had minus or no stars on here I would MOST CERTAINLY not even give them one Star\nIf you like service then thus is NOT THE A BANK you want to open your account at\nI hardly ever leave a feedback for anyone but I wanted to put the word out\nThat others would not have to go through thE HORROR I had to go through\nI closed 6 of my 11 accounts this week and will close the others just as soon as I make my necessary financial arrangements \nDon't even get started here and avoid future HEARTACHES \nPLEASE I urge you PAY ATTENTION  to my review \nThank you VERY MUCH
