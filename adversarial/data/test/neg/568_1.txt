*adventurous, delicious and if you want healthy and definitely large portions*\n\nI don't think it's right that Cora's only has 3 stars as average rating.\n\nThis is an awesome place for breakfast with lots of unusual choices, but all extremely delicious.\n\nThere seems to be a usual wait time at weekends and the only complaint I could have is that I got the impression that they tried to keep a the line out there to push their reputation.\nAs we got seated, there was suddenly lots of place around us and still a short line.\n\nHowever, once you get your order served, you can enjoy really delicious food and basically all dishes come with a lot of tasty fruits.\n\nWell, I wish the place had a nicer and more unique atmosphere, but for me taste is more important and Cora's definitely delivers. The service was also nice and helpful.
