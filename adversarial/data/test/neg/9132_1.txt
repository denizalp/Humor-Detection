I tried Lazy Dog a couple weeks ago for a dinner out with friends. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and based on the vibe of the table, my friends felt the same way. Since this was my first time at any Lazy Dog location, I signed up online for the email club and got a coupon for a free starter or small plate up to $11. I ended up ordering the chicken chile verde nachos and a side Caesar salad. The chicken chile nachos were good overall, they had black beans, cheese, tomatillo chicken, and guacamole on top. The only thing I didnt like is that they were advertised as coming with pickled jalapenos and they arrived covered with fresh jalapenos... I personally don't like the taste of fresh jalapenos (but I LOVE pickled), so I pushed them off and asked for some pickled, but they just brought me another side of fresh jalapenos, but diced this time instead of sliced lol. Otherwise, they were pretty good! The Caesar salad was good as well. I also liked our waiter, he was friendly and faced honest opinions when I asked instead of the standard \"I love everything here, you really can't go wrong!\" answer everyone always gives you. I would definitely return here.
