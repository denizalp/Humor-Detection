I found out about this place at \"Taste of Calgary\". It was really interesting to see a catering company at \"Taste of Calgary\" but really that is a brilliant plan from the owners and the best marketing plan because now more people like me know about them and will remember them. \nAt \"Taste of Calgary\" this year on the menu they had: \n- Chicken Satay: 2 skewers, dairy free, gluten free and contains nuts \n- Smoked Brisket Tostada: pickled kohlrabi and chipolte aioli\n- Cajun Jumbo Prawn (1) with Plantain Feta Dip- dairy free and gluten free\n- Vegetarian Samosa with apricot and habanero jelly, vegetarian\n- Vegetarian Taquito with taco sauce and creme fruit- dairy free and vegetarian \n\nThis was probably one of my favourite places especially the prawn even though it was just one piece which seemed a little hefty. However, all their dairy free options and accommodations were great! Making those changes makes them a great catering company!
