I don't see what all the fuss is about the Bellagio Buffet.\n\nI went for dinner recently with my sister. $36 pp. The food was all virtually tasteless. The seafood tasted like water. No fresh flavour. \n\nThe Asian dishes were boring, the Italian ones seemed like they were prepared very sloppily. \n\nDessert was okay, but I'd rather go get a cheesecake or gelato at a cafe in Vegas somewhere. The creme brulee was really nice though, but no where near good enough to make up for the $36 and the epic wait to get in (about an hour). \n\nDon't waste your time, unless you really want to experience what is meant to be the 'best' buffet (and be disappointed)
