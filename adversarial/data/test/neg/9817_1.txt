Wow this place really changed the game for what to expect from a nail salon. Such a relaxing and spa like atmosphere! Mellow classical\/spa music playing, nature slideshow on the tv screens and very professional staff. They offered my something to drink, water, juice, wine or a margarita even! Supper comfy pedicure chairs that actually gave a good chair massage. Fruit in the water I soaked my feet in. But the best part was the quality pedicure I received. She really took her time and did a great job, not just a quick 20 minute pedicure here. This is definitely my new go to place.
