Hubs and I went here in the mid afternoon, in between his daughter's volleyball games at Desert Oasis.  We decided to sit at the bar and have some apps, and catch up on some Sportscenter.  What a great find!  We ordered the bacon and date wrapped meatballs, with tomato sauce and OH MY GOODNESS they were awesome!  And the sauce had a little zing to it, full of spice and heat.  Yummo!  We also got the portobello fries, which were perfectly seasoned and cooked and served with two different dipping sauces, one was ranch and the other seemed to be a roasted red pepper sauce.  Both were good and you could tell homemade.  We also split the blackened fish tacos, and again yum!  It was like a lovely little unexpected tapas journey and we are so glad we stumbled on this place.  Next time we are in that neck of the woods, we'll definitely go back.
