Love Chou's Kitchen! This place has the best Chinese food. You can tell from the moment you walk in their food is great home cooking. They are making fresh dumplings as you walk in and the family that owns the restaurant is always kind and welcoming.  The owners really make an effort to get to know their customers. Every time we go they ask how I'm doing and about my family. They even remember that I like extra sauce and toss some extra in with our order.  But the fabulous service isn't the only reason my husband and I love going to Chou's the food is fantastic! Dumplings are handmade, juicy and packed with flavor. The meat in their beef pie is seasoned to perfection and the dough is soft in the center and perfectly crunchy on the outside. I also highly recommend their green onion pancakes.  It's a great appetizer, with tasty scallions and they always serve the perfect portion. Last but not least their main course of Mongolian beef is out of this world good. Marinated and tender beef is served with a zesty brown sauce over rice. It's incredibly hard not to eat this dish in one serving but it makes for wonderful leftovers. Go to Chou's Kitchen once and you'll never want to go anywhere else for your Chinese food!
