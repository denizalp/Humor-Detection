I'm jealous that we don't have Olive & Ivy in Denver....\n\nMy friend and I hadn't planned on going here last week, but after getting lost on our way somewhere else we wound up here. \n\nIt was a hopping Saturday night and everyone looked very dressed up. All ages filled the restaurant. We got lucky with 2 lounge chairs outside. There were limited seats and they are 1st come 1st serve and beware of couples making out.\n\nWe loved the Braised Short Rib flat bread with Caramelized Onions & Gorgonzola. I wish we knew how big it was going to be as we didn't need the Prosciutto di Parma Bruschetta with Crescenza Cheese, Arugula & Fig Preserves. But we love everything in front of us.\n\nAnd their Red Raspberry Mojito was fabulous to look at and drink. Enjoy my pictures.
