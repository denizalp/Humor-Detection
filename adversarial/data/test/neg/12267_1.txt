I've been gong to Jennifer for years.  Years ago I recommended her to my wife, and my wife smiled and said \"oh thanks honey, but you don't know what it's like for girls when they finally find a stylist that they like, but thanks anyways.\" A week later, my wife's fancy expensive high end big salon girl overcharged her and treated her like a number, she tried Jennifer, and not only has she been going there ever since, but she sends her mom there also.  Jennifer is very talented, very good at men and women's hairstyles, and she has even dyed my beard without making it look like fake black shoe polish, which is what do it yourself kits make it look like- I lost track of how many years we've been going here, and it's the only place for us!  She is reasonably priced, and talk about convenient location, Tatum and Cactus? Wow!! Thanks Jennifer!!
