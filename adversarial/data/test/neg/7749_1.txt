This is a great complex.  Friendly neighbors, office staff and maintenance.  When I first moved to Charlotte I completely overlooked Atkins Circle because of how ugly I thought it looked from Johnston Road.  Once you enter the neighborhood though, it's beautiful!  The apartments are really pretty on the inside.  There are two \"phases\" of apartments here, basically it's one with ceiling fans and black appliances and one with no ceiling fans and white appliances.  There are a ton of different layouts though.  The prices are a little high, but average for living in Ballantyne (and I've heard they don't raise rent much year after year).  This is one of the more pet friendly neighborhoods in Ballantyne, so there are a lot of families with all different sized dogs.  Both pools are very nice, usually well kept too.  Although the pool by the office gets less use, so it gets a little less attention too - dirt on the bottom of the pool, dirty filters, etc.  There is a fitness center that's ok, lots of machines, but not a lot of weights and it's smaller than it looks on the website pictures.  Atkins Circle is right next door to LA Fitness, and within walking distance of a handful of restaurants.  The only real downside that I've found is the trash compactors, usually one (or both) are broken and trash piles up next to them. Definitely worth an extra look, and a tour of the apartments!
