This place is our \"Korea Town\" here in Las Vegas. Pretty much one market and a couple of restaurants. This market has many selections of snacks, vegetables, meats you name it. This is my number one spot to get any groceries if I'm craving fresh salmon. They do have a open food court that serves great Korean food. \n\nMust come to this place to check it out yourself. Many varieties and shops are in this market to try for. Love this place !
