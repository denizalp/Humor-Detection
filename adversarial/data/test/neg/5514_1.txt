This is a good place to take your parents or to have a business event.  The location is right in the city (mellon center).  The bar is relatively small with most seating in old leather chairs and some table tops.  The decor is definitely old school with the wallpaper being golfers in traditional garb in a picturesque (sp?), 1920's scene with girls golfing in dresses.  The rest of the restaurant is dark wood, leather, and white tops.  The servers are dressed in tuxes or suits and in my experience are true professionals.  I have a couple business dinner parties here a year and have always been extremely pleased.  I've never come here on a date and I suggest if you are under 50 there are much better date spots to take your partner.  However, for all its old school charm the menu can be occassionally surprisingly nuanced and fresh.  My favorite is to have the wine dinners here.  The chef truly is talented and always comes up with something surprising and delicious.  Also, props need to be paid to Kevin Joyce for fighting this damn county drink tax.  He also serves some of the best, reasonably priced wine in the city and has been for decades.  I didn't do the wine tasting dinner last night, but instead went a more traditional route offering multiple entree choices.  The dinner starts with either a carlton salad or soup of the day.  The carlton salad looked awesome, romaine, tomatoes, mushrooms, bacon, hard boiled egg and creamy dressing (definitely not for the dieter).  The soup I had last night was the three food groups, those being cheese, bacon, and potatoes.  The soup was obviously heavy, but I found way too salty and in general not a good choice for me.  It sat in my stomach like a sock full of nickels.  Many ordered the seafood wellington, which I've had before and it's another non-dieter dish comprising of pastry, sole, lobster, crab and cheese.  This dish is definitely rich and tasty.  I tried the prime rib, which was about an average tasting non- \"prime\" prime rib with plenty of marbeling and cooked well enough.  However, I've had just as good prime rib if not better at Outback.  The most delicious presentation goes to the veal portabello which is sauteed veal with capers adn mushrooms, whipped potatoes and a nice tomato beurre blanc.  Sadly, I didn't get a chance to try this.  I was told it was delicious.  The desserts were all good and most likely prepared in house.  I tried the award winning chocolate cheesecake which was very good.  I only wish they had some lighter dessert options like berries.  All in all a great restaurant for the older crowd or business events.  The servers, especially Faye are awesome.  Last night Faye literally chased me down the parking garage to give me my leftovers.  The food deserves 3 stars, the servers 4 stars, and the wine prices and Kevins anti tax efforts 5 stars.  This is a true Pittsburgh institution.
