How did he know? I guess we looked liked tired shoppers who needed a few margaritas, and they were damn good margaritas at that. The bartender was attentive, and so was the wait staff (chips and salsa as soon as we hit the seats). We had a couple margs and shared the brisket tacos, which were pretty deelish. The salsas are also nice. \n\nOnly four stars cause, the decor is lacking any interest and it's a corporate franchise, it's hard for me to give five stars to a place that's a little too expensive and lacks soul.
