Went there on a Friday night. Was seated fairly quickly. Very nice and cozy ambiance, pretty hipster. Drinks were pretty pricey, but that goes the same with most Bloor street bars\/restaurant. We tried the guacamole and nachos which were terrific. Will definitely visit again but won't go out of my way for a visit.
