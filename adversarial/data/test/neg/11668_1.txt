Stopped in here for lunch on the way out, eh, it was pretty good.  We had the deviled egg appetizer, I didn't care for the fish eggs on top but other than that it was decent.  They have a pretty good beer menu, a lot of craft ipa.  The Bloody Mary that they serve is delicious.  The Brussels sprout side was the highlight of our meal, they use some kind of honey glaze which was something I hadn't encountered before, the flavor was excellent.  I had the chicken wings, they were just alright.  It's kind of your typical casino restaurant.  Service was prompt and attentive.
