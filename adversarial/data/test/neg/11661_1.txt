You wouldn't believe the experience we had here. We arrived on a Thursday night at 8:00 PM, for the Arizona -Oregon game and some food. All the other bars in Old Town Scottsdale were packed. This place had about three tables occupied. While we had a great server, cute and sweet and friendly, we noticed how they kept serving beer to a table of about six guys who were really outrageously drunk. I mean they were really tanked -- loud, obnoxious, and using the F word in every other sentence. \n\nThey had some kind of altercation with our sweet waitress and left in a huff. We were leaving about the same time, and my wife and I stumbled into them at the door of the bar where they had stopped, put their you-know-what's in their hands, and were pissing all over Blitz's floor. It was a real treat to see what we saw (not really) and my wife screamed for the manager. He came running, but the guys had all taken off down the street. The bar manager didn't offer to do anything for us. I think \"Come on, let me buy you a drink\" would have been an appropriate response for that one. \n\nI rate the place with one star because of this experience. It feels like it is going out of business in the next few days, it's dead, plus the food was only marginal and I had a choice of three lousy beers because their taps were dead on others. I would avoid this establishment at all costs.
