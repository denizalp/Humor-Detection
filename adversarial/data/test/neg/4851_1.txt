I came in to get my trade in appraised and look at used vehicles. First impression was the dealership was not very clean or nice looking. I have always been a Ford person, and this was the least impressed I've been with a dealership. I had very specific wants for my next car and printed off vehicles I found on their website. The salesman frankly ignored them and brought up a used Escape that did not meet my main requirement of low mileage. He finally took a look at one of the vehicles I wanted to inquire about, but basically ignored the jeep I wanted information about. Neither of the cars were at their lot and he told me he could get the escape there but never mentioned the jeep again. Debating visiting another dealership based on the other reviews I've read as well, but not sure if it's worth the drive.
