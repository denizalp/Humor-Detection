My last visit to Red Robin was a perfect example of bare minimum service. What I mean by that is the lowest amount for the standard tip.\n1. The 12 min. wait for a seat even though there was 9 free tables, 6 of which were in between stationed areas- the remaining 3 was probably closed off.\n2. The server provided one refill for drinks.\n3. Service was relatively quick, but server was not aware of terminology on their own menu. (I ordered \"bunless\" and printed on the menu, a note says, \"Order it BUNLESS, get your burger wrapped in lettuce.\" Yet she still asked me if I wanted my burger to be wrapped in lettuce.)\nThis would normally warrant a 2 star rating but oddly enough this sub par service was not as bad as most of the places I've been to as of lately.\nI wanna say keep it up, but you can do better. Just think about food service in the 80's and 90's. They only looked for 10% gratuity but their excellence far exceeds today's standards.
