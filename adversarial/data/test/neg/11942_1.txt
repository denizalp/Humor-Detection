I decided to check this place out because I heard it was pretty kid friendly and had decent food. My friend was pretty upset the weekend before when she dragged out her two kids on a Sunday for some eats and was turned away at 6:30 for closing but I thought I'd give them a shot anyway. \n\nMy husband and kid and I rolled in there to this really laid back atmosphere place that would never give you the impression that it was kid friendly if it wasn't for the other strollers in the restaurant and row of high chairs. \n\nThe menus are cute and packed inside record sleeves and has such things like a Mac and Cheese boutique, yam fries, brie bake, hot pot, phud thai and calamari strips.\n\nI had the yam fries and the mac and cheese with brie cheese with spicy beef and mushrooms.\n\nThe sweet potato fries (served with one of about 9 sauces - I had the piri piri) were hands down the best I've had in the city so far. \n\nThe portions were great and tasty. I'll definitely be back there many times and bring back my friend's kids too to check out their kids menu.\n\nUpdate: spring hours have Sunday's now open until 11pm
