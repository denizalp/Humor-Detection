Super cheap beers ($4.70!!), good music, and friendly service!  I dig the self-serve model, antique decor and chill atmosphere.  For whatever reason, it's kind of empty heretonight for a Saturday night - people are missing out!  Just a tad bit too dark here though - it looks like it's closed from the outside!  Would def recommend this place!
