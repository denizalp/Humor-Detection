After hearing such great reviews about Hurts Donuts, I made it my mission to stop in one rare morning when I was in the area. A foodie friend who is local said he'd been a few times and it was \"meh.\" But when you have to go, you have to go!\n\nUnfortunately, I have to agree with my friend on the \"meh\" factor here. Although Hurts offers a variety of toppings, the donuts themselves are lackluster. I tried the Andes mint and Twix, and I ended up just eating the tops (and the Twix just wasn't good, period). The cake donut was dry, dense, and just not as excellent as I would have hoped.\n\nThe service was friendly, and for those that want the experience, Hurts delivers. For foodies, though, I suggest another option.
