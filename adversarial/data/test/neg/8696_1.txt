Its 10 bucks a month. You get tiny change rooms but decent equipment.\nNot always super packed and off times you have your pick of a ton of cardio equipment. \nThe fees are monthly rather than year or by week.\nSadly they still tried to charge us an extra month when we quit, even though we cancelled before the date we were told was the cut-off to be charged for another month.
