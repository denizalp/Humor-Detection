We arrived Saturday, March 3 at around 6:30. I was meeting my wife who was coming from Stouville for a quick dinner before our 8 pm show at the Town Hall. I should have known better. It took us 6 minutes to get seated even though there was no one in front of us. Then a 15 minute wait for our first interaction with our waitress. We explained we had a time constraint. Ordered the basic two can dine special chicken. Nothing fancy. Nothing special. Waitress said that the white meat would take longer. \n??? When we got our meal we asked for our bill. We skipped dessert and left at 7:34. Over an hour for a basic chicken dinner. Contrast that with a leisurely dinner at any other Swiss Chalet that typically takes less than 45 minutes and that's with appetizers and desserts!
