Being Taiwanese, I'm torn since I'm super happy that they opened up a place like this in Madison, but it really isn't THAT good.\n\nTo be fair, I don't expect amazing authentic Taiwanese food here, so that's why this place still certainly gets a 4 star review. \n\nTheir milk tea is above average - definitely better than Kung fu tea. Their tapioca isn't that great (from the few times I've tried it), but perhaps they'll improve over time! New restaurant tend to take a bit of time to hit their stride.\n\nThe food is prepared pretty fast, and there's a decent amount. The bento boxes are great, but a LITTLE pricey I would say. I expect stuff like this to be more in the $7-$8 range, and the bento boxes are $9.50 without tax. The food is certainly good quality though, but not AMAZING...\n\nAnyways, overall a great place to stop by! Taiwanese street food is AMAZING and im glad this place is bringing some of it to Madison.
