Dog Park Review: I brought my small dog to the small dog park here all the time and she has only had fun but I am giving a one star because my husky recently went to the the big dog park and got Roundworms, so now both dogs have to stay home for two weeks. Obviously nobody picked up their dogs poop and someone brought an infected dog to this dog park. So yeah unless you want your babies to be sick don't bring them here.
