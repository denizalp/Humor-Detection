The kouign amann here is one of the best desserts \/ pastries that I've ever had. We came in to split 1 and ended up buying 4 slices... and regretting that we didn't buy an entire cake.\n\nDO YOURSELF A FAVOUR AND GET A SLICE. Your life will be changed.\n\nNot very much in terms of seating here but the pastry is best eaten warm with a tea or coffee.
