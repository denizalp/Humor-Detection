This is my update to Kyklos as I was contacted by the very, very nice manager in response to my disappointment I had with my Groupon and gyro experience. \n\nI have once again returned to Kyklos and I will return again and again when I am shopping at The Galleria. It honestly is the best place to eat in the food court. They take great pride in their food here and the staff is incredibly friendly. This time I went I once again had a gyro and this time I got my feta on the side. I highly recommend this as it lets you sprinkle the exact amount of feta as you eat. I also got the rice, which I thought would be simple, yet it was bursting with delicious tomato flavor!\n\nI must say Kyklos is kicking butt in the arena of mall food AND Greek food! Can't wait to try something else here.
