Took two tours with this company last week. First, we went to Bryce Canyon and Zion National Park with Brian, who is also the owner of the company. There were 7 people in our van. The van was very comfortable, and we were offered water at each stop. We stopped at a cute restaurant for lunch, and were told they had amazing pies. True.  We had a great time! He was extremely knowledgeable and even took us on a couple of side trips. It was apparent that Brian is passionate about what he does. After the tour, we decided to book another one with them to Antelope Canyon and Horseshoe Bend. \"T\" was our guide. He was also very knowledgeable. Stopped at a great Mexican restaurant and he also kept us hydrated. Loved the ice water bottles cause it got HOT! I'm glad we took  both tours. Support a small business and book your tour with them.
