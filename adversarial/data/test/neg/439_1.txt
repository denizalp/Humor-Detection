Sorrrrrry to say sooooooo disappointed. My husband and I stay at Caesars every couple of months and we were very excited to try out this new restaurant.  Here are our comments:\nThe decor is beautiful and creative. Our waiter was not overly helpful when we asked questions.  The food was disappointing. #1. Noodles were just warm almost on the cool side.  #2 The prawn appetizer was mushy soft and the shells did not come off easily.  #3. The fresh seabass was just OK - not very flavorful.  #4 I don't eat meat - but my husband said that the fiery beef was delicious.  While we ate, two waiters or busboys dropped things near us ... one was a tray and a full drink, while the other was silverware and a couple of plates.  It was hard to relax after broken glass and a metal tray hit the cement type floor.  We wish that we could say \"Can't wait to come back\", but there are much better restaurants at Caesars to spend our time and money.
