I've been coming here with a group most Wednesday's for awhile now. Even If I don't go my group comes here every week regardless, so I'd say we're regulars here. Unfortunately I think this will be my last time here. I don't know if they raised their prices but $3.00 for a soda is BS. I used to get my sodas here for $1.00. I can buy a beer here for less than the price of a soda. It seems like they don't want repeat customers. Why else would they encourage people to drink and drive by charging more for soda than beer? However, seeing as how I'm the designated driver I'm not gonna drink. Every other bar in the world either gives free or discounted sodas to the DD. It would seem that the amount my group and I spend on food and drink here would be more than enough to cover  a complimentary soda. It's unfortunate they're losing a customer over a $3.00 soda.
