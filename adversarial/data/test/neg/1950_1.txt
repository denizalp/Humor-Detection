I cannot sing enough praise for this place, it's my new favorite sushi joint! I absolutely love the staff and service is always top notch. As embarrassing as this is, I've come once a week since I've moved to this side of town, if not more and I leave happy every time. I will be telling all of my friends and anyone asking for great sushi at work will get a college length thesis on how they can't go wrong with Sushi Koma!
