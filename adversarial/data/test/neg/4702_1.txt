I was there for the first time yesterday. \nPro: The foods taste great. The staffs are friendly. The place is clean. Quick service (~10 mins wait). \nCon: There is not a lot of space. Take out would be best for now. \nI am trying to be a bit healthier, so I will be back on a regular basis now.\nDefinitely recommend!\nNote that the place is not open from 3pm to 5pm.
