Good food but service is iffy. Four of us ate dinner (including rice and chicken breast) without silverware and they said they were \"looking for more\" and finally brought it when we were a few bites done from being finished. Didn't really say sorry or offer discounts or anything. Pretty lame. But we did learn to eat rice with a skewer broken in half. \n\nUPDATE: Called the manager and told them what happened. Never got an explanation on what happened, but they said sorry and sent us a gift card to make up for it!
