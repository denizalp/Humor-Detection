Dr Kleckner is a fantastic children's chiropractor. She has treated both of my children age 4 and 2. Her calm and caring nature allowed my children to relax and receive a complete and effective chiropractic adjustment. We live out of the area and plan to take the time to travel to Dr Kleckner as she is truly gifted in her ability to care for children. \nAs a patient of Dr Kleckner's I have also received treatments from Dr Kleckner and realized that her ability to make pinpoint cervical adjustments have been superior to adjustments I have received from other chiropractors. If you want a chiropractor that  is truly passionate about their profession , cares and loves what they do I recommend you see Dr Kleckner
