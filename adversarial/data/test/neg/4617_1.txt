They always get my order wrong always!!!! Last time I came and went through drive thru I told my Bf check the bags cause they are notorious for missing an item or two or getting the order wrong. Sure enough they were missing my potato cakes and turnover ugh I can see once or twice making mistakes but every time???? And I come here randomly like once a year or 2 times in a month for 6 years and always get it wrong! Absolutely terrible I worked at Arby's I know what it entails this is unacceptable
