Visited in early August 2016. We had a buy 1, get 1 pass for dinner and went early to try to avoid a huge line (the line was still pretty slow-moving, but wasn't massive). \nThe food was really good-- just what I expected from a Vegas buffet! The prime rib was excellent. The \"Kobe\" beef was a little off in flavor (I've had it in Kobe, and this didn't taste like that), but still delicious. The sushi, despite so many warnings against sushi on Vegas buffets, was delicious. The desserts were absolutely amazing. I couldn't choose and just ended up getting one of almost every kind! The crab was tasty but I missed having a butter dipping sauce for sure. \nThe Buffet loses a star for service. The staff at the registers where you prepay weren't very hospitable and we were slow to get drinks from the wait staff (they were very friendly though).
