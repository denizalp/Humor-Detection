Ok. I lived here since April of 2013 (use to be Cambridge Square). I use to LOVE it when the old manger and leasing agent was here.  Since they both left,  all I've been getting is ATTITUDE from the \"new\" leasing agent.  I put in a work order for maintenance and 3 days later NOTHING bc it was NEVER put in the system.  One of my neighbors had bed bugs in oct 2016. They got into my apt. Took them 3 weeks to take care of it! Then said my neighbor \"ONLY\" had roaches!. WTF!!! I took pictures of the bugs on the outside of HIS door crawling toward mine. I asked last month to move into a bigger apt. I was told to ask the manager.  Well EVERYTIME I called she was either \"busy\" or not there.  I finally decided to just go in and found out she is no longer with us.  (We went through 5 mangers)!!! I was told in front of another tenant to change my review bc we now have new owners. That was last year.  (Guess it was deleted bc I can't find it). Now in order for me to get into a bigger apt the leasing agent again said give her a good review.  SHE CAN KISS MY ROYAL PALM WHITE ASS BECAUSE I WILL NEVER CHANGE IT!!!!!!  She's mean,  rude and a bitch towards the women tenants.  If I have to sell all of my belongs, I will. I be damn if I renew my lease again after this one is up.  My outdated apt was $460 a month in 2013. Now I'm paying $632! ($20 in a pet fee.  They charge $200 or $400 for a 40lb or less animal then a MONTHLY fee on top of that) what is funny, I have seen 100 + pound dogs living here.  Huge dogs.  I can't say anything bad or negative about the NEW manager bc I have not met her yet.  I would CONSIDER staying and changing my review if the rude ass leasing agent was forever GONE!  NOTE: SHE'S ONLY RUDE TO THE WOMEN AND WHEN YOU ARE ALONE WITH HER.  If other ppl are in the office...she puts on a show.  I honestly hope the new owners see this and realize why ppl are giving bad reviews on her.  I think cameras should be installed.  My bf car got broken into a few years ago and my truck got BOTH tail lights stolen.  (Not the bulb, but the fixture). I reported it to her.  Her answer was \"NOT MY PROBLEM\".  Suppose to have security.  I never see anyone walking the grounds.
