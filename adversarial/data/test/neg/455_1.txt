Dr. Bruce A. Kletscher is AWESOME he gets 5 stars.  Front desk, Techs., Dr. assistants, officer manager Lori and Michelle who makes appointments for testing all have their heads in the dirt.  Don't tell you when they are going to order a 2nd test without telling you.  Office manager needs to take a course called \"Active Listening\".  So all of those folks deserve a MINUS 4.  That's why this over all experience is only a 2 rating.
