Didn't bowl, but went for a drink in the Schwoegler's bar on a busy Friday night. The place has a generic look typical of any other sports bar. There are two rather imposing uniformed security guards seated at the entrances to the bar, which gives the impression that the place has had some problems. My main complaint is that the bar reeked of cigarette smoke. There's a \"smoking room\" adjacent to the bar, and every time the door is opened the smoke seeps into the room. It's overwhelming and is the main reason my friend and I left quickly after one drink. Another note... My wine glass wasn't clean. It had someone's lipstick residue on it. I've worked in a bar before and know that wine glasses need to be checked even when they've been run through the cleaning cycle. Lipstick and lip balm leave a waxy residue.
