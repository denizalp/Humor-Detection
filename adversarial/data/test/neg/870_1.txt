Went to the new Cafe Rio in Queen Creek. Loud, crowded....felt like you are rushed thru and you can't even hear what they're asking...very confusing. I'm giving them 1 star becuz they don't have corn tortillas that are gluten, flour free! And they were out of them. They had processed corn tostada shells...for a fast food restaurant that proclaims fresh and homemade you'd think they could have fresh corn tortillas made with corn. I will never eat there again...very disappointing.
