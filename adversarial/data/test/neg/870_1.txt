After a horrible experience at David's Bridal, I decided to make an appointment here after reading all the good reviews. Denice was my stylist and she helped me find the perfect dress!!! I called two hours before my appointment time to see if she could take me early. (Read my review about Davids Bridal at Arroyo Crossing location.) She said yes so by the time I rounded up the kids and dropped them off at the babysitter I was there an hour before my appointment. I tried on six dresses and the first dress I tried on was the one. The dresses were of great quality, and they were clean. My dress is a San Patrick 2015 at 30% off. Awesome! I have a vow renewal in two months and needed to purchase off the rack. The shop was super cute and clean. The dressing rooms were huge. I highly recommend this place to find your perfect dress. The customer service is outstanding. Thank you Denice!!!!!
