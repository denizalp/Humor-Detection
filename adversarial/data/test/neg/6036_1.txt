If your skin is screaming to be saved, The Body Shop is the place to go for items to revitalize and pamper it. Although I stop by from time to time, I do not see a variation in products or stock like I do with other retail stores.\n\nThe major difference is in the quality of customer service. The girls that work at this location are bubbly, chipper, and took no time for them to convince me to stop by. The body butter, lip balm, and tea tree oil products are some constant essentials that I have on hand at all times.
