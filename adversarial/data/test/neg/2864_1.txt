This place was really quite spectacular on many levels.  \n\nThis restaurant is the most attractive Chinese restaurant around.  It is to the right of  Rao's in Caesar's Palace.  I love going up the elevator and then walking into the dining room. Nice high pitched ceilings, modern furniture in a cool ivory arranged in a circular fashion.  It was very special and unique.  The service was really good. The servers were attentive. They poured my tea, continually stopped by with water (have you tried getting water at a Chinese restaurant???), and it was overall such a wonderful and lovely experience.  Low key, elegant, and calm. The perfect antidote to the craziness beyond its walls.  My only gripe would be the hostess that met us upstairs.  I like nice people who are polite and she was haughty and that is a very unattractive quality. Yet the hostess on the main floor of the casino was very sweet and pleasant...that's one reason why we felt we were willing to try it going into the elevator to be hoisted upstairs.\n\nOur server was Vicky and she knew absolutely everything about the food.  She was so terrific and just REAL! Her favorite is the General Tso's Chicken so we got that dish. My husband and friend liked it...I don't eat chicken so will not comment on it personally.  \n\nWe also ordered the Sea Bass and Tofu Hot Pot.  OMG -- this was EXCELLENT. The sea bass was completely succulent and the tofu was just right...soft and soaked up the sauce.  This was my favorite dish. \n\nThe third dish we ordered was Buddha's Delight.  There was an ingredient I enjoyed however did now know what it was..Vicky told us it was gingko.  Great!  Now I know I love gingko.\n\nI ordered a special dessert...I do not remember the name of it - although Vicky wrote it for me in Chinese...however I will describe it as being made with barley and is a sweet slightly syrupy soup...it was quite good except...it looked to be a huge portion but was not...more soupy than substantive - however I still liked it - quite a bit. And maybe it is suppose to be soupy? Vicky described it as a healthy dessert...if you know Chinese medicine...this had some medicinal herbs in it.\n\nThe tea is not on the house like at other Chinese restaurants yet it was only $3...what a DEAL!  I ordered the chrysanthemum tea and it came with rock sugar on the side. JUST delicious.  Before the teapot was half empty, Vicky had brought out a fresh pot for me.  THANK YOU Vicky...that is really attentive service!\n\nI would come back again and feel totally confident suggesting it to my friends.  I hope that you, dear reader, will go to this restaurant and enjoy the ambiance of the gorgeous and softly lit low key dining room.
