This is a follow up to my original review. I have flown with allegiant 3 round trip flights since, and 3 of those flights were delayed! 2 of them were 2+ hour delays flying out of Mesa. The other was a 45 minute delay elsewhere.\n\nHalf of my flights have been delayed when flying allegiant, that should be a red flag.\n\nOn the bright side they do EVENTUALLY get you from point A to point B, you just don't know how long it's going to take.
