Warm beer out of the draft is not what I'm looking for when it's 100 degrees outside. Our service here is what made me give it 2 stars and not 1 star. Our waitress here was awesome. The food was not. Over priced but it's New York New York right? Food wasn't that great and not worth it at all. I wish I could go back in time and not come here.
