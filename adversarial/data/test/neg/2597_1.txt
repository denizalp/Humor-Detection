Fell in love right when I saw the menu! Only 4 items to choose from; very convenient and fast! My boyfriend and I ordered #2, his with regular fries mines with ANIMAL style fries. It was to die for ;) Best burger joint I've ever been to. Definately beats Jack in the Box, Wendys, Burger King and McDonalds. If they had it in Hawaii, that'd be my number one fast food place I'd go to!
