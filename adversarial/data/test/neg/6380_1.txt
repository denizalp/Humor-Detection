I came in on Friday afternoon with friends in a group of 6. We were attracted by the \"Grand Opening\" sign hanging at the front door. \nThe restaurant is a bit small where there are only tables of 4 and we ended up sitting at the bar table. \nI love ramen but this place is a bit disappointing. There are many choices on the menu while most of them look like the same. The Shio soup and Curry soup is just fair to me.  Noodle is too hard.  The sprouts are cold.  Pork is a bit fatty. 3 stars are more than enough for the food.\nThe only pro in this place is their price. They took 10% off the bill if you pay cash. Noodle is 10$ each ($9 after discount) which is much cheaper than ny.  So I add 1 star for the their pricing.\nI would not suggest my friends to come for their noodles and I may not visit this store again when I pay my next visit to Pittsburgh.
