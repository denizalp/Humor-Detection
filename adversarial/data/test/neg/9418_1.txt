We had our attic insulation replaced.  Our home was 28 years old and the original insulation had degraded as to be ineffective.  We are so much more comfortable now.  We turn our thermostat to a couple of degrees higher most of the time and stay very comfortable.  \n\nWe trusted Brett to upgrade our insulation and we were not disappointed.  The job was done on time, on budget and there was no mess left behind.  We could not be happier!
