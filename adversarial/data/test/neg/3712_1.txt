This place definitely earned 5 stars in my book. if you have never been to a ben & Jerry's ice cream store you HAVE TO GO TO ONE. the ice cream selection is is almost as wide as their actual selection of retail products. but they have a ton of in store special products that you can purchase there. i got a \"half baked milkshake\" and let me tell you. it was literally gone in 5 minutes, not because it was so small but because it was so good i couldn't control myself. the prices are a bit steep, 8 bucks for a milkshake is a bit much. but if you think of it as getting desert from any other restaurant your most likely going to pay the same amount if not more. But seriously, if you have the opportunity to go to an actual store of theirs, i totally and compactly recommend it.
