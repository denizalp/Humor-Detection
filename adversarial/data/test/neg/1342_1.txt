Short ribs was very very tasty. It was not your regular bossam. They \"modernized\" it....with side of \"steamed\" cabbage, kimchi and pickled cabbage. My only disappointment: it didn't come with rice. It's like ordering curry without rice or naan. It is ridiculous or just damn cheap. Just doesn't make sense. I would rather they charged a few dollar more than cheap out.\n\n\nService was ok.
