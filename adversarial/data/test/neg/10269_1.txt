I have been to many studios but this one feels good. The staff and clients are warm and friendly. The classes are high quality and the instructors are professional, knowledgeable and you can see, they are true yogis . The intro promotions are amazing and as far as pricing goes, the prices are good. I'm very happy to have found this studio and highly recommend it .
