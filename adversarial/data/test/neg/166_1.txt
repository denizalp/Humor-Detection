I came in with admittedly unrealistic expectations for buying a new car ($150 a month). I didn't want anything fancy obviously, but difficult considering my credit. I was looking at a new 2016 Versa, and we were pretty close to my budget, but not quite there. I worked with David and James, and they came up with a fantastic deal for me on a certified used 2015 Versa Hatchback. The warranty was better than what Nissan provides on the brand new cars, it has everything I wanted, plus it's adorable. \nEveryone that I dealt with at this dealership (David and James in sales, and Alan in finance) was just great. They seem like good-hearted, honest people who just happen to work in a car dealership. They were patient, informative, and very accommodating to my ridiculous expectations (without even insinuating that I was being ridiculous). I would hang out with any of these people in my free time, and I'm picky about whom I spend time with. They were never condescending or rude, certainly not pushy. They were so good to me that I overheard another customer getting a little uppity and felt defensive on their behalf. I would definitely recommend this dealership to anyone.
