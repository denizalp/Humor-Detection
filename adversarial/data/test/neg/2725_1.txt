I wish I had read reviews before I wasted my money going here! I made an appointment and I asked before I made it if I was going to see a doctor ? I was assured I would. I went and lo and behold she wasn't . She was a nurse practitioner!! I didn't want to be rude and walk out as I filigreed they already had my money and I wouldn't get it back so I listened and was not impressed. \nI needed refills on meds which she also wanted to change one and prescribed me an antidepressant which is NOT what I went in for. I ended up flying back to my personal MD in Las Vegas and was taken care of properly . \nShe had a kind if all attitude which I was not impressed with. \nI'll never go there again !!
