When in doubt speak with the manager first. \n\nRe: Switching from a dropin oven to a slide in. Purchased the LG Studio slide in- which gets a separate rating of 5 stars\n\nTo make a long story short after the used car salesman approach by sales person Brian I was told I could cut the baseboard at the bottom of my former drop in stove for the new slide in.  Or I could have the installer  Do it for$100.00 FALSE!\n\nNot only was I misinformed of the process was more extensive, $300.00 and a horrific mess that created a dust storm CUTTING TILE in my home AS THEY DID NO COVERING OF DOORWAYS OR FURNITURE ETC.  creating days worth of work cleaning off dust from blinds, counter, appliances, carpets floor walls everything AND IN adjoining rooms forcing me to hire cleaning help at more expense to me.\n\nThe installer along with leaving a huge mess left a gap between the stove and the counter top.  Forcing me to hire someone else to finish and fill in with foam and caulk- anther $75.00\n\nThis sales persons mandacity lacked vision while holding No consideration for expense and any health issues people may have in the household like resperatory or auto immune disease whereby this environment can compromise their health. \n\nSadly, it was only after this upsetting experience I contacted the store manager Clifton, with my concerns. \n\nClifton  was very receptive, apologetic and made every attempt to rectify the situation. It is only because of his response that I rerated this purchase experience 3 stars otherwise it would have remained with it's previous rating 1 star. \n\nLessons learned:\nI would recommend if your getting that used car salesman approach and purchasing a range other than free standibg run the details by the manager before you sign on the doted line. And insist on speaking with their installer before they come out. It could save you money, days of work and a lot of time in the end.
