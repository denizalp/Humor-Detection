I was guessing whether or not a watch was worth what the person was asking. So stopped in this store since specialize in Citizen high end watches and wanted to make sure that it worked like it should and such.\n\nThe owner of the store was very polite and looked the watch over for me and cleaned it it appeared. He took his time with my asking all kinds of questions and such. In the end he did not charge me and was browsing while he was doing watch stuff and there prices are really reasonable and very friendly and helpful.
