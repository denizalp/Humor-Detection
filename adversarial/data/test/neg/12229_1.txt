A great place to get amazing Belgian beers and average Belgian-ish food.  If you like Sin and Redemption by the AGO, you will love this since they are almost identical.  Town Crier is always busy, and it should be being right downtown and surrounded by the likes of Hooters and Jack Astors.  They have 50 beers on tap and a healthy bottle list.  \n\nPros:\nHuge selection of beer, primarily Belgian.\nLarge patio with lots of umbrellas for shade.\nAttentive service.\nNon-gougy prices, especially for the location.\nThey will hurry service if you are seeing a movie or a show nearby.\n\nCons:\nIt is a tight squeeze.  The tables are on top of each other and poorly dispersed.\nThe menu never changes.
