Terrible.  The movers were fast and didn't take any breaks.  They broke a lot of stuff, but that's different.  Once the movers were done and we started unpacking we saw all the damage.  Broken dishes, glasses and dressers.  They even broke a door in my new house.  I had the owners over to see the damage and all they did was deny, deny, deny.  They even tried to blame it on us.  Crazy.  Then they went on to say \"too bad, you signed the contract.  We're not responsible.\"  If you use them, don't sign the contract until you have had a chance to inspect everything.
