I love this store with a passion. Not many people know this... But you can ask for a \"facial demo\" and get a free facial. I mean who doesn't want a free facial? Make sure you pick up some bath bombs and some ocean salt facial scrub. You're skin will thank you. The staff is awesome, products are awesome, and although it is small and can be crowded grab an employee and let them guide you to what you need.
