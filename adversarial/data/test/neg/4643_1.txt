No wonder West Russell Animal Hospital has FIVE stars!! I would have to agree completely!!\n\nI made an appointment for my new Boxer puppy. Starting with the phone receptionist to the vet tech and Dr. Roach, everyone had very high standards. They were all sincere and answered all my questions I had. \n\nReasonable prices, easy appointments, CLEAN and plenty of services offered..... The ENTIRE staff (which is usually unheard of) was outstanding and an A+++++ for me and I won't take Jagger anywhere else for years to come.
