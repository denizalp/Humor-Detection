I love this place so much. The service is exceptional, the food is always top-notch, the  environment is positive, up-beat, clean, etc. \n\nI stopped in today to get a quick tea (the hibiscus tea). The guy at the front was so astonished that I came by just for a tea, that he gave it to me for free! I always have a great experience there. Me and my coworkers go there at least twice a month for lunch on Friday's (our lunch day). \n\nMy favorite dishes are the roll-ups and the hummus. You can never go wrong with either of those. And of course the tea!
