We stopped in Phoenix for an overnight stay before catching a flight home, and were looking for a place to have a nice lunch....just good food. \n\nWell, we had lunch, and left with food to enjoy for our trip home. Bertha and her gang whipped up an acai bowl for us to have on our long flight for breakfast, and then a sandwich to have for lunch. They split everything for us so my wife and I could share it.\n\nWe may never come back this way again, but if I lived in the area I would be a regular. Great food.....and even better service!!!
