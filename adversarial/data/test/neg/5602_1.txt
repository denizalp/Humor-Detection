Excellent studio! All the yoga and Pilates classes are professionally taught by highly experienced instructors. The particular hot yoga form that you can learn and practice in this studio is very therapeutic. From my experience, an ongoing practice of the combination of hot yoga and hot Pilates let me improve health and strength effectively. The instructors are knowledgeable and respectable. There is a strong sense of community in this studio that members enjoy taking classes several times a week. Some of them even take more than one classes a day often. The studio is very clean and organized, and has recently been renovated. Two thumbs up!
