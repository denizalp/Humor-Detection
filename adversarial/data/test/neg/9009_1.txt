Decent buffett, exactly what you would expect from a mid level vegas buffett... Sushi was ehh, they had a guys making \"hand rolls\" more like sushi joints... i felt at home lol... but they were good... shrimp is always good, but that was like the highlight really... everything else was just ok.. they do charge extra if u wanna have alcohol, my lady wanted mimosas. I was disappointed with the crab legs. they seemed water logged and as if the were frozen too long...long story short they sucked...
