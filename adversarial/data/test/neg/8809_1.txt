Usually have a good experience here....but today.....I was met with one of the most unprofessional and rude people to help me....name is Simon.....I just had to sit there with my mouth agape! I am by no means a diva who belittles the technicians.  I am nice and I TIP WELL!! I thought I should tell him what I liked as far as my manicure....little things I didn't like.   You know ....setting expectations as this was NOT my normal guy....I did it in a very nice tone of voice and I was sweet as I know many people aren't nice to the technicians and look right through them. I didn't think I was being unreasonable. He said he didn't work wirh picky people and that I need to not be so picky because I make him nervous and I need not to make him nervous if I want a good job.....imagine that....he's telling ME what I need to do to make HIM comfortable....it's my money and I was being extremely nice.....I.AM THE CUSTOMER. .....ITS NOT MY PLACE TO MAKE HIM FEEL AT EASE......IT IS HIS PLACE TO MAKE MY EXPERIENCE A GOID ONE......ALL I WANTED WAS TO FEEL PAMPERED FOR A COUPLE HOURS......THIS UNPROFESSIONAL A-HOLE got up and refused to continue. I was SPEECHLESS....... I WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT again..... there are over 100 nail salons in a ten mile radius and I don't need this negative crap!.......I regret this as the owner is a very nice person and did her best to make up for his rude behavior.......but I won't spend my money to be treated this way EVER AGAIN!!!!! LIFE IS TOO DAMN SHORT
