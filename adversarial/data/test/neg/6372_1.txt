This was one of the best meals I've ever had!! It was a 9 course tasting menu with or without wine pairing. Every dish was original, delicious and just perfect. The service was excellent and the dishes arrived and were cleared at a good pace. We will definitely be going back! The restaurant is also able to accommodate allergies if they are mentioned when you make a reservation.
