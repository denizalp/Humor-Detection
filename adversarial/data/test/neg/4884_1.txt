I've heard so many good things about this place, I finally went to check it out with my friend who is a regular. We both decided to treat ourselves and shared their daily specials: fisherman's platter (sole, shrimp, scallops) and sweet and sour ribs. Both came with an appetizer (soup or salad), a drink, and dessert. We both chose their soup of the day. \n\nWe were seated very quickly when we arrived around noon. It was very busy and loud at the restaurant. You could tell that business was good. The soup was VERY filling (for a soup), and that's coming from someone who will eat 3 people portions. Don't underestimate the small portion. The barley was very thick and filling.  When our main course arrived, we were already pretty full. \n\nThe fish could have been cooked better in my opinion. The tartar sauce was pretty disappointing. It was like I was eating mayo- I couldn't taste any of the pickles or sourness it usually would have. The shrimp and scallops were delicious with the seafood sauce! I love how they were fried - not too greasy. I asked for crispy house fries but they weren't really crispy aside from a few pieces. It was rather mushy. \n\nThe ribs were alright. The sauce was good but the meat wasn't warm, as if it had just been sitting there for a good while. However, the meat was very tender and practically fell off the bone clean. \n\nOverall, the portions were more than generous but definitely on the pricier side. I feel that they should offer smaller portions and adjust prices for that. I'm the type to eat everything put out in front of me until I absolutely can't. This meal definitely took a while to finish. We spent about 2 hours (including waiting time and chatting) and there were still leftovers. Regardless, I'll definitely come back to try their anniversary special and other breakfast menu items.
