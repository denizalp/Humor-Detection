I have been to the here several times as part of a group and a romantic date with my wife. Let's start with the positive. Great location in downtown Phoenix. Easy to stop by when going to a game or other events downtown. The food is nothin special, not bad, but not great. I'm a beer drinker and I am always underwhelmed by the selection they have as well. Would I go back? Probably. Will I be raving about my experiences to anyone who will listen? No.
