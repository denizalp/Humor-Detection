A buffet with lobster tails. Do I need to say more? This is by far the best seafood buffet I've ever been too. Even though they have more than just seafood, it wouldn't be worth the $50 per person to eat anything else. Not all of the lobster pieces was cooked well, but that's why it's a buffet and you can choose what you do and don't want to eat. \n\nThey also had fillet mignon, but I didn't care for the pesto that it was smothered in. The dessert also impressed me. They have some of the best gelato in vegas. Come on an empty stomach because you'll wan to get your moneys worth here.
