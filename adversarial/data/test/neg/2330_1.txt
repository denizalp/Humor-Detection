We have been there several times in the spring but this was our first in the summer.  Temps were warm but it was shady where the tables are.  We had 12 of us and it was a Sunday morning which I know usually means a wait.  Wait time was fine and they handled us like pros when we did get sat down.   Food is always good and the kids enjoy running around and seeing everything.  Good family place to go.
