I hadn't really tried Korean-Mex fusion before, so I don't have much to go off of, but I felt that the flavors from Seoul Taco weren't really nuanced. I had the chicken burrito. The rice was kinda bland, and it felt like there wasn't much variety in flavor--the entire burrito kind of tasted the same, except for the small parts in the burrito that had Seoul sauce. Had their been more sauce, it would've definitely been better. Most of the burrito was rice, and it wasn't really easy to eat unless you included it with a bite of some other ingredients in the burrito.\n\nI'll be back, but only to try the quesadillas or tacos.
