This review was dangerously close to being a two...I mean I had a full paragraph written, but had to leave my review as a draft to come back and finish it. I was initially unimpressed with the service since I was basically ignored for the first ten minutes while 5 bartenders pretended to look very busy. I told several friends about this experience, and read others reviews before deciding to return and actually eat this time...I'm really glad I did. \n\nWe were automatically greeted by a bartender who welcomed us back. Followed up with the most generous pour on a glass of Merlot ever...I mean more than I fill up at home. You know from all the previous reviews about the menu and the ordering process, so all I will say is that the Vegan dog is simply amazing. It's not that I'm Vegan, I just try to cut fat and eat relatively healthy, so many times I leave less than satisfied with my choices, but full nonetheless. Not the case this time. I would have eaten and enjoyed that vegan dog even if it had not been smothered by toppings. The great service continued on as the spot got busier on a Saturday night. More bartenders came in and they constantly walked around the bar and checked back in. \n\nOnly tip I'll give is to get in before 8ish if you're going on a Saturday night. Both times we were there a live band was playing and a cover of $5 went into effect. Dude, that's as much as a dog!
