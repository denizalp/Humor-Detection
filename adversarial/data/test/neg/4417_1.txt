This food was delicious!. The place is a little small, but has a very nice look to it. I ordered the chicken shawarma entree, but subbed chicken skewers. The chicken was moist and delicious. As was the rice, tabbouleh and baba ganoush. I also got one of the seasoned flat breads, Zaatar Manousheh, which was really tasty. The prices were good too, so all around, I highly recommend. I will definitely be back to try more.
