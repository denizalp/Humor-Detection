My first experience almost landed them 1 star, but after a 4 day go round with this place, I would give them more stars if there was an option. My girlfriend and I are locals and do staycations occasionally and the palazzo was our pick this time around. We had heard a lot of good things about yardbird so we made reservations on a Thursday. While making the reservation I specified I wanted a booth, but when we arrived, we were taken to a table that was so close to the other tables that we were almost bumping elbows with people we didn't know. We asked for another table and as we are aware it is a busy place with reservations to fulfill but the hostess did not even try to accommodate us. We walked out so upset we ended up eating somewhere else. The next day I called to speak to a manager and was told that he was busy and would give me a call back. I was ready to write this place off until I received a call from Gregg, he offered a few things to make it right so we decided to give it another try that next night. We went in and met another Gregg who was very accommodating and friendly. He felt like a longtime friend and he stayed attentive to us the whole night! The food and service was so amazing that we went back Saturday morning for brunch. Everyone remembered us and really made us feel comfortable and appreciated. Did I mention the food was to die for! This place will definitely be our choice when southern food and hospitality is desired. Thanks again guys!
