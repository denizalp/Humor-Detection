This place is great for young, school aged children. We just had our daughter's 6th birthday party and the kids and parents had a great time. We weren't quite sure what to expect but you must remember that this is a place for children. Through the lens of a child, this place is a place where they can run around with friends, participate in games, rides, laser tag and golf. We got a little room but the kids didn't even want to come in and eat cake and pizza. We didn't even open presents there because they were more interested in playing with each other. Our party coordinator was sweet and attentive and the staff in general appeared to be happy. Some of the games are dated but you know what? The kids had a blast. That's all that really matters.
