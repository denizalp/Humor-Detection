If you're visiting Downtown LV, make SURE you stop by here. The interior is huge and offers something to do for everyone. Lots of TVs and comfortable seating both inside and outside. What most impressed me was how large the back outdoor area was, where most of the life-size games were located. Even though they don't have any happy hour deals, I really enjoyed my cocktails.  I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in town!
