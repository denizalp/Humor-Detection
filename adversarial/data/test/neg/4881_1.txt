Hailey the pet stylist at WFAH is terrific. She did a great job with my little Jessie. This was her first time grooming Jessie.  Hailey was so patient with her and all Jessie's health issues. She let her rest when she got tired and then would work on her after her rest. That is so important to me. She didn't try to rush it as not to stress Jessie out. I just think that is so special and compassionate. Jessie's hair cut is great and she feels so much better. Thank you to Hailey and all the techs who checked on Jess. WFAH has the best staff members around.
