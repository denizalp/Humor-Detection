Yayyy =) I'm a fan.\nNot only of the desserts (sugar) but, THE FOOD!!!\n\nThe menu is extensive and is, literally, a book. Kinda reminds me of the menu\/book at Cheesecake Factory. YES; THAT much food!\nHad the crepes with chicken, feta, and spinach. And nooooOOoo, I wasn't on a diet kick, I just like those ingredients.\nFriend had the turkey club crepe; and another friend had the chicken and waffles.\n\nThe crepes were good but, after having tried the chicken and waffles; I wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiish, I had gotten something more substantial like their pastas or their bigger entrees.\n\nI know one of the chef's there so, he comped us our dessert(s). Plural =)\nHad the banana split sundae and the...get this: \"everything chocolate pizza,\" which was dark choco syrup, chips, brownies....ughhhhh, it was delicious.\n\nThe service was spectacular. Our server was soooooo nice. And when he didn't bring my drink in a timely manner because he forgot; he bought my next drink. Amazing =)\n\nBLOWS SERENDIPITY AWAY!!!!!\n\n\np.s. It's open 24\/7. Thank me later.
