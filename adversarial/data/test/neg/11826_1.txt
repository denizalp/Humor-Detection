My Miata mechanic retired..so I went shopping for a new one.  Happened upon Wilhelm Auto and went over to talk to them.  Clean spaces, humming activity, and the front office, thanks Chris, who took the time to explain everything that could be wrong, based on my comments.  I left the car, got a call several hours later (this is a good thing, \nthey told me up front it could be a while) and was given the laundry list.  My husband is a retired mechanic and knew what should be needed.  They nailed it!  Gave me the price and it was in the ballpark for what I'd looked at online. Job was finished in less time than estimated  and the car not only sounds better, it drives as it did when it was new!  I will be back for all oil changes and services.
