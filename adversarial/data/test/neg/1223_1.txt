Nice place, clean, good food, fun time, Can get a little expensive in smaller groups, so i would recommend party of four or more.  Can't bring in or use driver, wedges or hybrids, because the free way is to close.  Service was very good, servers are nice and always checking back to make sure you don't need anything.  Would prefer a standard driving range, but a good fill in to keep up your swing.
