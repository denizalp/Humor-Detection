If you want to avoid a super long line up, I recommend to go early. I went there at 9:30 and there were 4 persons before my turn. I could get a freshly baked cheesecake for $12. It tasted like a typical Japanese cheese cake; fluffy and soft. The size is small but it might be too cheesy to finish it for one person. I recommend to share it with two persons.
