They have both sweet and savoury choices. I ordered the matcha crepe which have have been craving for, and my friend ordered nutella one. \n\nWe thought it was just dessert portion, turned out that they served two huge plates. My matcha one had red bean and cream in it. I started from the cream side and quickly got bored with it, then I reached to the other side where red beans were all in there...It is suggested that they could have mixed red bean and cream, so that the taste could have been balanced. Maybe next time I'll eat from the middle lol.\n\nThe matcha ice cream lighted up the plate, made the taste much better.\n\nThe place is small but comfortable, the waitress is nice and cute, she even allowed us to use her iPhone charger :)
