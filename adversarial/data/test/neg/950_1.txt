I'm not sure what was better, the sangria or the thin crust pizza but either way- a must see place. The owner has an adorable little dog that sits up at the at bar on a cushion! It is hysterical! I had the vegetarian pizza, a large house salad, and a carafe of the red sangria which made a perfect size meal for my two friends and I.
