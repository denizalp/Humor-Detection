Food: Very good.  I had the white spinach\/artichoke\/prosciutto pizza - my wife had the chicken masala ravioli special.  We shared a caprese salad with fresh-made mozzarella.\n\nService: Excellent.  Our server Drew was a pro - knew the menu well, was able to make good menu recommendations as well as recommending wine.\n\nNoise: It was Friday night and there was live music, so it was loud - but not punishingly so.
