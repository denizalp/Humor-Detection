Rented a car here through Hotwire for the day after Thanksgiving to the Sunday following.  Thanks to booking through Hotwire the car was very inexpensive at $15  per day for a compact.  Only reason why I gave this a star at all is being such a large agency there are no lines in picking up a car.  In this case it goes to show you truly get what you pay for\n\nAs I was checking in the guy behind the counter had put me in a Ford Focus. I asked if it was possible to get any other type of car since I don't like the way that Ford's drive.  He said \"No, that was it.\"  No offer to upgrade, nothing.  So I say \"OK\".\n\nI get upstairs to where the cars are kept and there is a car in every. single. stall.  What do you mean there aren't any options when every slot is full???  Get to my assigned car and it looks like something I could get from Rent a Wreck.  Get halfway through my walk around, notating all the dents and scratches and someone else had been assigned the same car!  Neither of us wanting such a dumpy car we both went back down to the counter and requested a new one, since the one they assigned was in such poor shape.  I figured the people behind the counter must have been embarrassed to have us come back after being given such a lemon, thinking to myself now (!) I can get out of a Ford and hopefully into something better.  But, no.  They gave me the same type of car that, thankfully wasn't full of dents and scratches, but shuttered when accelerating and when you're travelling on a highway 90 minutes from your destination, you'd like something that feels safe, not something that will fall apart underneath you.\n\nIn the future, as much as I love Hotwire I will not use them again to book a car for fear of returning to this rental agency.  I would gladly pay twice as much somewhere else, than to come back to this company again.
