The ladies here took their time with my appointment and were so friendly and polite and really made my experience here wonderful. The price is soo worth it for the service and professionalism you receive and they really put time in and didn't feel like i was just another customer and really did an amazing job at ensuring i left with nails i loved. My cuticles have never looked so clean and nice. And for the sparkles she individually put them on \/ moved them around rather than just swiping it down my nails as other salons may do. They take their work very seriously. Highly recommend!!! \n\n\n\nMy nails (the recent almond shapes ones- photo #3) that Cathy did held up so nicely the last 2 1\/2 weeks. The girls here are really honest and you can tell they genuinely love what they do. They take their time and work really hard to ensure you love the end product. It's amazing and the prices are extremely fair. They also are AMAZING with manicures and cleaning up the cuticle areas and the results really do last!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!
