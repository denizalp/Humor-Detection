We lived in the Biltmore floorplan, two bedroom apartment from Jan 2014 to Jan 2015 on the third floor and paid just over $1800 a month. This was our experience while living there.\n\nThe Good:\nQuiet complex, no noise between apartments but we were on a top floor.\nGym is spacious with nice equipment. No stairmaster though.\nBeautiful pool with nice lounge chairs.\nThe new washer and dryer are great (though I wasn't a fan of the front loading washer).\nNew construction so apartment was the first anyone had lived in it.\nUnderground parking was close to our elevator and kept the cars cool. We had a tandem spot and no issues with door dents.\nPlenty of availability at grills and they worked great near our apartment. Lights and nice seating provided, which isn't always the case at other apartments.\nFast service on maintenance calls.\nGarden tub with nice bathroom fixtures.\nQuartz countertops looked nice and were durable but showed dirt\/water spots.\nSecure with on site security at night.\nLocation, location, location. Walking to Biltmore Fashion and the AMC dine-in theater was great!\nFree bike rentals.\nLots of event functions.\nNice, modern paint color.\n\nBad:\nLimited storage spaces with small closets and no patio storage. Additional space cost $$$.\nGuest suite was misrepresented by a former employee - for your guests its $100 a night with 3 night minimum and $50 cleaning fee. When my brother and his girls came to stay it  smelled like cat pee.\nDid I mention the small closets?!\nThe master bedroom was a VERY tight fit for a king bed. The linen closet behind the door was really inconvenient and you had to close the bedroom door to get to it.\nGym was hot and the cleaning staff isn't great. No towels sometimes but more were purchased just prior to us leaving. I never saw any other people working out clean the machines or mats once they were done. \nPool - wasn't cleaned often and there was always leaves floating around and due to the surrounding buildings, there was no sun after 3pm.\nClubhouse rental was $100 an hour and price had also been misrepresented by the same former employee.\nAdditional rent fees with community power and gas was an extra $80 a month tacked onto our already expensive rent.\nPool fountains were beautiful but were on at random times. \n3rd floor is hot and the oven heats up whole apartment when in use.\nHigh utilities for 884sq feet. \nLaminate Wood Floors never looked clean, light berber carpet shows dirt easily.\nNo good gym in the area if you need more equipment. \nPaint is flat and shows marks easily and leaves marks when trying to clean the walls.\n$200 moving out fees so only received back $100 of deposit. They make you pay to repaint the apartment.\nExpensive rent.\n\nOverall, it's one of the best places to live in the Biltmore area. While I miss certain things about the apartment, I ultimately don't miss the high rent payment and the small sq footage.
