Macy's stock varies greatly by region -- they cater to the local demographic. \n\nSo think about the local demographic before going to this location, and you'll get what you expect. The Macy's around where I live are sort of a step below Nordstom (which is a step below Bloomingdales, which is a step below Saks, which is a step below Barney's), but here Macy's is an itty bitty step above JC Penny.  Some will think its great, others (like me) will find it depressing. \n\nThe important thing here is that it's clean and mostly well-kept.
