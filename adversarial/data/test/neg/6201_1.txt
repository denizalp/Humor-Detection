St-Viateur bagels are without a doubt some of the best bagels on the planet. This restaurant, however, is a complete joke.\n\nFor starters, we waited 15 minutes before getting up and going to ask for a menu ourselves. We then tried to get one of the three waitresses' attention so we could finally order, but still no luck there. All 4 waitresses on duty while we were there completely ignored us. After almost 20min waiting, I got up to ask a waitress for the menu. Then I had to get up once again to order a coffee, AND to order. So just to recap, not one single waitress came to our table. Oh and I also had to ask for water. Once we finally got our meal, both orders were wrong but we were so hungry that we said we'd just eat and pay. Once we waited so long to ask someone for the bill that I almost got up and walked out of the restaurant. It probably would have gone unnoticed but I just couldn't bring myself to do something like that. Crappy service and a total tourist trap, unfortunately.
