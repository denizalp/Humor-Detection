Has anyone been to this Chili's lately. No. Good, you are not missing anything. Went there with my son and had a hamburger. And seriously, the hamburger was so greasy that it seeped into the bun, which turned into a glob. So disgusting. Spoke with the manager and he gave me a 5 dollar gift certificate. Yahoo...NOT! As hard as he tried to be nice about the whole thing, I think he was a bit agitated that I was cutting into his football game. Ugh!!
