I only bother to review businesses when I think they are awful or amazing, and my experience with Aqua-Tots at 12th street has exceeded my expectations in every way.  Imagine my surprise when I went to review this business and saw that it only has a 3.5 star rating and 4\/12 of the reviews are highly critical.  I was so shocked that I read each 1 star review word for word, and I am left seriously questioning if those reviews are fake.  I'll share my experience and why I don't trust the negative reviews.\n\nI contacted this school mid summer 2018 and expressed interest in signing my 10 month old up for swim lessons.  The person who answered the phone offered a free class to let me assess whether lessons would be a good fit and told me to drop in any time, which I did the next week.  Angie was at the desk and was unaware of my conversation with the other employee, but enthusiastically got us right in to the Tadpoles (recommended for 4 to 12 months).  When it was apparent that my daughter already met the goals for that class, the manager (Angie) offered to let us stay and try the next level class for free also, the Minnows (13 to 30 months). Both classes involve parent participation.  Given my daughter's comfort in the pool, I was skeptical that lessons would boost her skills much more than me simply making time to play with her.  But I was interested in having her in a social pool activity, and I didn't want her to lose her comfort once pool season ended.  The instructors are very experienced, engage the children in fun skill-building routines that include songs and colorful pool toys, and have helped my daughter improve her skills with just 1 class per week.  Although my daughter is generally comfortable in the water, she is a baby and strong-willed.  Anytime she has expressed resistance to an activity, the instructor has suggested a modification that allows her to participate in a way that she enjoys.  She has never encouraged participation in a way that is unpleasant to my child!!  In addition to being happy with our classes, I have experienced exceptional customer service.  My daughter has an unusual fondness for Angie (the manager), and it's cute that they are \"friends\", but mostly I appreciate that the environment is very welcoming and fun.  I appreciated the flexibility that they were willing to put my child in a class based on her individual needs and not simply her age.  I've also experienced flexibility in other ways.  During our first paid swim class, my daughter experienced an unexpected allergic reaction.  I doubted it was due to the pool, but Angie agreed that if she experienced a problem the following week (which she did not because it was a food reaction), she would refund our fee.  The school even called to follow up on how my daughter was doing later that day.  On another occasion, Angie happily rescheduled a class on short notice.  Everyone I have ever interacted with has been awesome, and my daughter and I just love this place and all of the staff!\n\nI found the 1 star reviews to be highly suspect.  One review says this facility is not safe.  The mom gave an example of how her \"almost 2-year-old walked right off the ledge and went under water.\"  I don't believe this because all classes for almost 2 year old children require parent participation!  So if this claim were true, the mom obviously omitted an explanation of why the parent participant allowed this to happen!  It appears that another 1 star review came from the supposed husband of this lady, and they both talk about how traumatized their child was.  For this age, the instructors have very little physical contact with the toddlers.  Participation is parent directed.  The husband seems to acknowledge he was in the pool with the child during their second lesson (demonstrating the parent participation requirement), and he claims that the instructor removed the child from his hold and further traumatized her.  I don't buy that either!   The classes have a specific format where one skill after another is practiced (and to songs).  The class begins with a fun introduction song and continues through several sets where the parent is directed how to support their child in practicing a skill.  The only time my toddler has ever been independently handled by an instructor is being passed back and forth to me at the end of class once she is comfortable.  On a couple occasions when she was moody\/tired, the instructor skipped this.  \n\nThis is how much my baby loves Angie (one of the sweetest humans I've ever met)!
