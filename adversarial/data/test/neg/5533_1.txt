If there's a Popeye's nearby we like to swing by.  We eyed this one on our way to the Cosmopolitan so we bookmarked it in our heads for maybe later as we were headed to a buffet at the Wicked Spoon for brunch.\n\nHours later, we made a point of coming back over.  Place not too busy.  Hubby ordered 4 pieces spicy with mashed potatoes.  He didn't declare white meat or dark meat.\n\nOur friends ordered spicy all dark meat with fries.\n\nWe get back to our timeshare to chow down.  Our friends opened their box to find it's a combo of dark & white. With the fries.\n\nHubby opened his, and it's all dark.  With his mashed potatoes.\n\nNow how can the folks at Popeye's mess up?  On top of each box, the order was marked correctly. Probable cause - too many workers standing around and not paying attention.\n\nThe worst part - the chicken was overcooked and very dry.
