I was just there for tge first time on Saturday. They were missing a few great traditional Puerto Rican dishes and their customer service was mediocre, but their cook is absolutely amazing and the food they did have was great. The first bite took me back to my home land. That Puerto Rican love in every dish was definitely there. Brother and sister were very nice and inviting. I will definitely be going back soon. But I need to get my Mofongo fix from my other spot.
