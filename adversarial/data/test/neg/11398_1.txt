The first time I visited Jack's I was very impressed by the selection and quality of the food.  I had the Nova Scotia Platter, which is smoked salmon, cream cheese, tomato, onion, and a bagel.  It was awesome!\n\nHowever, the second time I visited, I had ordered the same Nova Scotia Platter online and I ended up having to wait at the restaurant (which was not very busy) while they made my order because they hadn't even started it by the time I arrived. Also, in the rush to get my order out, they left off the cream cheese in my order, which I didn't realize until I was back at home. Normally, something like that wouldn't bother me, but the cream cheese is what makes a lox and bagel so I was a little disappointed.  \n\nI'm going to chalk up my bad experience to the fact that the online ordering service is still new and they're working out the kinks still.  I'll be returning for sure... but maybe to dine in next time.
