I wanted to get a foam roof for my small condo that has a flat roof. I called Durafoam to come out and they said that they could do it for $4400.00. I thought that price was a bit on the high side, but  I wanted a good job. My two neighbors on either side of me had Scott Roofing and KYKO Roofing foam their roofs for less money and they both look terrible. Durafoam DID do a nice job foaming  my flat roof. A few things that bothered me are: I was told that the AC unit would be removed so that they could foam under it. I don't believe that it was ( overspray on unit and no evidence that it was ever taken loose). And I'm OK with that, but was that labor that I paid for but did not get? They did the job on a very windy day and I think the guys were rushing to get it done before the wind kicked up even more. I wish that they had put the job off until the wind was more favorable. Also, was never told when they would be back out to do the elastomer top  coating. They just come out a few days later. A little more communication would be nice. And finally, it would be nice if more companies would do a walk through inspection of the completed job with you, before you hand them a check, instead of, OK we're done, send us the check.
