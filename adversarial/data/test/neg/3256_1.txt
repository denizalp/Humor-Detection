Checked into the Rumor hotel a few weekends ago and everything was smooth and thought the room was nicely decorated. However, the air conditioning in the room did not work properly. It took 2 calls and almost 2 hours for someone to come and address the issue. It was determined that the a\/c unit was busted and we would have to move rooms. Kind of a pain, but things happen....however, the woman at the front desk tried to downgrade the room! I informed her that it would be unacceptable to do so and she copped a major attitude with me, informing me that she had to move someone else's room to accommodate me (like a care!). We had to move our stuff on our own to a room across the hotel (to a room that had a view of a wall). The bellboy informed us that a bottle of champagne would be sent up, but of course we never saw it. After I returned home I sent an email to the management informing them of my experience and of course I never heard a thing. It seems like this is their mo, never to respond to guest complaints. I promise with such horrendous customer service this place will be closed within 24 months. There are too many options in Vegas to deal with rudeness.
