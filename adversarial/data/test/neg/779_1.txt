Actually if there were 10 stars I would award all of them  The last time we were in Las Vegas we stopped by the Clark County Museum  It is a very intresting museum with both the inside and outside displays. While we were there we happined to run across Mark. I think this was the highlight of the stop . I was supprised to meet such a down to earth person as him, especially with all the exposure he has recieved because of Pawn Stars  and Ricks Restorations  Keep up the great work Mark
