Been sitting here for 20mins and still haven't met our server. LOL. If ambience is your #1 motivator look no further than PROOF Canteen. If you're actually hungry you will get better service at Chilis. Hopefully the food turns out okay. #NoConfidence\n\nUpdate: Manager Kelesey took care of us. We appreciated his understanding of the situation. Also the smoked babe sandwhich is pretty fantastic.
