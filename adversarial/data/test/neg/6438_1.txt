This was the first record store on our Madison, Wisconsin vinyl picking trip. Parking here is a cinch compared to finding parking near that record store on State Street. MadCity has a pretty nice selection of new vinyl. Usually, however, I buy mostly used vinyl and there wasn't a great selection on this day. The prices seemed right on and I noticed that at least three of the Madison records stores have a similar selection of new vinyl at about the same prices. The guy manning the shop was helpful and it was nice to see the listening stations. If you collect new vinyl, this is a good spot to check out.
