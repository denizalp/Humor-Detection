Unbelievable. Recommended to us by a foodie friend. A party of four and we were all beyond pleased. \nWe started with special salad of the day Herb Beef Tenderloin Salad. I wish we would have remembered to take a pix. We shared it. It was tiered and stuffed onion rings. Even our teenager liked it!\nOur dinner included Chicken Parmesan, Asparagus Grilled Flat Bread Pizza,Orecchiette Pasta and Baby Back Pork Ribs. Would recommend all. The ribs fell off the bone and highlighted with an usually tasteful coleslaw. Couldn't resist the dessert. Shared a carrot Cake and Chocolate Ganache Cake. We also had to take home a lemon bar and a hidden Oreo in a chocolate chip cookie. WOULD DEFINITELY COME BACK MORE THAN ONCE.
