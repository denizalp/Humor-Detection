Moe's has Incredible food, and great service as well. Also a great place to go and get a cocktail or glass of wine if you aren't hungry. The bar staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is extremely inviting. Also, if you are ever hosting an event or party, they cater and the food is phenominal as well.
