I had usually gone to Shepard Eye Center.  I was due for my exam, and with 6 doctors at multiple locations, the soonest they could get me in was 2 months!  I found out that Optic Gallery accepted my insurance, called them, and they got me in within 3 days!!  The service was outstanding!  Dr. Nguyen was great, and so was the staff.  \n\nI was upsold on lenses, and there is a contact lense fitting fee, but it's a small price to pay.  I chose to get the lenses that they recommended, and I choose to wear contacts too.  Just waiting until I can be a candidate for LASIK.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend them.
