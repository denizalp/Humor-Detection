On our stay in Las Vegas, we visited this place on the first full day that we were there. We found the buffet well stocked with the best of Filipino cuisine. Taste and quality are good but honestly, the buffet next door called Pinoy Resto Buffet was just a tad better in terms of quality and taste even if the restaurant itself doesn't compare to Joy's. We'll still go back here when we get the chance.
