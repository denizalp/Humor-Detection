Sighing...lolos is ight. The chicken had no special flavors, and as well the waffles are 2 thick and heavy..honestly u don't need  2 waffles on the plate becuz u will get full 2 fast and I wasnt happy with paying 4 dollars for a jar of kool-aid and as well 5.69 for the sides...thats 2 pricey, and the portions are not big at all for the price.i was not happy spending 82. Bucks for three people..hell I coulda and shoulda went to churches chick...So disappointed
