I came in today to see what the rave was about. I ordered a medium chicken on the rocks. The lady that took and prepared my order was pleasant, and I got my order within 10 minutes of ordering. Portion size was decent. Taste wise...it was okay. The rice was nice and fluffy, and the chicken was tender and flavourful. But TOO MUCH SAUCE! Quarter way through my meal, I got tired of the sweetish-garlicky taste. Having said that, the hot sauce did compliment it very well - enough spice and kick to cut the richness of the white sauce. I'll probably be back to try other things on their menu, and if I ever choose to get the chicken on the rocks again, I'll specify to take it easy on their signature sauce lol
