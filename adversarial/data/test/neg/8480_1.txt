A MUST GO WHEN IN VEGAS!!! I've only shot a gun once before coming here and man oh man was this the best money spent! Such an adrenaline rush to shoot a variety of guns. I personally shot the zombie package and two shots out of the 50 cal sniper. INSANE.  Karl, my instructor, was very friendly and super encouraging when I was scared to shoot- not to mention he's also insanely hot ladies!!! LOL  had such a blast, can't wait to come back!
