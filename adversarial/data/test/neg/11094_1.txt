Upon arriving there was no one to seat me I waited more than 5 minute until a kitchen staff member came out and saw me.  \n\nI was seated by the kitchen person to a dirty table which he wiped down with a dirty rag and dirty water.  The table did not get cleaned.  After waiting more time, finally a waiter came and took the order.  \n\nThe pizza was okay but not true New York Pizza and it was not made to my request.  No one bothered to read the ticket and just did a regular pizza, not to order.  \n\nThe desert was a frozen desert that was put in the microwave to thaw out and warm up. It was not good and I was very disappointed.  \nOver all the place needed a good scrubbing. I could see greasy finger smudges everywhere and lots of debris on the floor.  I would not recommend this place to anyone.
