Went for lunch with my family on a Saturday afternoon. The place was very clean, and you order at the front. This was my first time at one of these franchises. We enjoyed our food. My daughter got a quesadilla with tons of cheese! When I went to fill the horchata, the lever got stuck and it went everywhere. LOL! We will be back for more. Don't know why we waited so long to try this place out. By the way, I did have the vegetarian burrito and it was very good.  My only complaint is that their hot sauce is weak.
