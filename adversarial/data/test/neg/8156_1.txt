From phone call to pick up, we had a super experience.  Of course, we searched Yelpers' recommendations and this spot surfaced. Called this morning and they were able to fit our two fur babies in, no problem. I was expecting to wait, but so glad not to.  They reminded us to bring vaccination history, or also offered to call our vet to confirm.\n\nWhen we arrived to the shop, which was easy to find near Ann & Cimarron, we were warmly greeted. They were not flustered when our pooches marked their territory upfront, which put us at ease quickly. It's hard to try another groomer since we loved Petiamo, but they are far across the valley from us now.  When it comes to our furbabies, we are protective of their health and well being.\n\nAfter getting the paperwork squared away, we ran some errands and a couple of hours later, got the call the babies were done, with a little verbal report card on how they did.  (Great, even the little one who has a napoleonic complex.)\n\nFurbabies looked amazing--I never saw Rocky look so fluffy and cute! Bella acted like she knew she had the princess treatment. Both doggies were happy and excited.  \n\nThe charge was exactly as they said at check in, no add ons, but definitely full service!  We paid cash, but plastic is accepted with a small fee.  The team here is personable and sure seem to love what they do.\n\nThink we found our new grooming salon!
