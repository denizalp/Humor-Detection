Came here today for a second cartilage piercing and a rook piercing. The people at the front are nice, have a dry sense of humour. I didn't catch my piercer's name but she was the younger of the two with long hair. She was so nice and listened to my nervous babbling the whole time. \nWhen it came time to pierce she told me to breathe in on the count of 3. She was very gentle (or as much as she could be). She told me which part of the process hurt the most (because I was really nervous about my rook). \nAll in all she was super nice and I would definitely go back there again. It was quick and fast (in and out within 15 minutes), but I went 30 minutes after they opened and there may be a longer wait later in the day. Their $17 Saturday specials are definitely the cheapest around.
