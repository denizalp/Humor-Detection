This place came up when looking for things to do in Toronto. The concept is awesome, but you definitely need to take advantage of the 'game guru' especially as a first-timer. There are a lot of games and unless you know what you're about, you may not have the best experience. Best part is that he's an awesome dude, so no worries there. As far as food\/coffee, our service was...meh. We were seated, we sat for about 10 minutes until I decided to get up and grab a waiter to take our order. Not the best first impression. But the coffee was really good, and the snacks were okay as well. I'd go again, but it wasn't my favorite place to be.
