I like it, shop here couple years already, service is not the best but not bad either, people usually willing to help to find the best, things they don't so they say they don't then find the answer for you which is the quality we need.\n\nVegetable are not very fresh here, sometimes they do have some special varieties that is hard to find. Fair price, not big place but it gets to the point that you find most things you need.\n\nThink the Deli dept is getting better since the past year, overall, good
