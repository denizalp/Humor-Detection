The atmosphere is good. The staff are very friendly. CT did my tatoo. However, this being my first tattoo, I didnt receive any after care instructions and they didn't check if I signed everything  on the waiver. As days  went by I had to frequently call or email them to explain  problems I had with after care or to know if parts of my healing process was normal.\n\nI went for a touch up and even after the touch up ( its been 6 months since the touch up) I still see empty spots or rather areas that haven't been touched up properly. Areas that were worked on the most during touch up still have a scarred look to it.\n\nAfter my first tattoo experience here,  I would probably go to a different place for my next one.
