Jessa did a ferret tattoo on my ankle.  It was one of her first, if not her first commercial tattoo. It was very simple and basically child's play for an artist of her caliber.  I am a person, let's say of a certain age (almost 70) and that ferret tattoo is one of the best things I have ever done.  Have received numerous compliments on it even though many peeps are not all that thrilled with ferrets.
