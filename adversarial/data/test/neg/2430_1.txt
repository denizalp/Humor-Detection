Who'd have thought that in a part of the country where basements are nonexistent, there's a fantastic restaurant that's entirely underground? Salt Cellar has always been my favorite place for sea food in the valley. The quality of the fish is always good and fresh, especially when you consider that Arizona is a landlocked state. \n\nMy girlfriend and I had a wonderful Valentine's Day dinner at the Salt Cellar. She can't eat shell fish, which eliminates a lot of the items on the menu, but there's plenty of good options to pick from. We split a Halibut ceviche appetizer, which may have been the best ceviche I've ever had. Nothing against shrimp, but the Halibut is much more flavorful. I had Swordfish with mango salsa. The mango salsa was unreal. They left everything cut in big chunks, which was a little shocking at first, but it covered the whole fish, and was quite tasty. The fish itself tasted a little dry to me at first, but as I got to the center, I found that it was perfectly cooked, and the salsa continued to enhance the flavor. My girlfriend had Mahi. I tried a bite, and it was also delicious. \n\nEntrees are around the prices you'd expect to pay at this type of establishment. But orders come with a salad, vegetables, and choice of potato or rice. Two glasses of wine, an appetizer, and two entrees cost a little more than $100 (not including tip). Not bad for a special occasion. \n\nThe place is very small (be prepared to be seated a little too close to the party next to) so reservations are a must. For parties of two, you can make them on Salt Cellar's website. They only thing I think Salt cellar needs is an update. While the dim lighting, wood and nautical theme is cool. The walls and art hanging on them walk a fine line between out of date and nostalgic.
