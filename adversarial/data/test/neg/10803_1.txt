I've had pretty good sushi in the NY \/ NJ area and this would definitely be a place we'd go on the regular, so for the people of Pittsburgh PA, you guys deff have good sushi in town. Not only was the sushi good, but a great selection of beers, and a cool sports bar feel. Really hip, not something I expected in Pitt, very NYC like. \n\nMy one comment would be on a Sunday during Football Season, nobody want's to see pirate baseball on tv, especially regular season baseball.
