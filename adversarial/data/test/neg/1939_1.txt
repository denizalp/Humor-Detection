Love the atmosphere love the food love the customer service! Im not a foodie bt far but i think The Club is to die for!\n\nSugar Factory Club Sandwich\nTurkey Breat, Toasted Cranberry Challah, no bacon thank you!, butter lettuce, tomatoes, avocado abd herb mayonnaise.\n\nI had a 2 buck chuck! My way of saying cheap! Lol\nRed Wine\nMalbec, Filus, Argentina\nSupple, ripe dark berries, fruity tellichwrry pepper, smooth complexity only $8 and it was tastey. Normally I get the Banana Mango Margarita! Yummy!!\n\nYeah everybody says it pricey but in my eye you get what you pay for.\n\nOne dislike i have is that I didn't like the waiter coming over saying celebrities were here. I could care less.
