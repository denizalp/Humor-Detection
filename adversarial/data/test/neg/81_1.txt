Yeah, for realz... all the awards, accolades, etc., are spot on. Best ribs I can remember having in a very, very, very long time - perhaps ever. I especially liked the end portions of the slab that somehow dodged the sauce and were on the  tougher side (think jerky). That alone was fantastic. Unfortunately, much like the Cookie Monster now says that cookies are sometimes food, these delicious ribs are sometimes food too. Every now and then though, I might have my Cookie Monster moment where sometimes is NOW!
