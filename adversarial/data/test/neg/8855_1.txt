Thank you Jason! This is my go-to place for my Lucy. Jason and his staff always know exactly how to groom my yorkie, and let me tell you, I'm not easy to please. \n\nI love how you don't have to wait forever to get an appointment, IDK why but good groomers are in high demand. Some (who will remain unnamed) schedule 6 months in advance...WTF. Paws and Effect get Lucy in the same week, which is extremely convenient for me. \n\nThe services are affordable, which is a huge plus. I pay $40 for a full groom for my small yorkie. (I've paid upwards $60-70 at other places.) \n\nThey truly care about my dog, which makes me feel comfortable with leaving her with them. I don't have to worry about mistreatment or anything like that. \n\nIf you need a good groomer - go to Paws and Effect, you will not be disappointed! Jason and his staff will treat you and your fur-baby with the care they deserve.
