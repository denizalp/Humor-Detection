I started eating Dave Russo's food when he was chef at Liberty Brewing way back when. Such a sad day when it closed down but we rejoiced when we found out he was opening his own place and adding Italian to his menu along with his tried and true cajun offerings. Every time we go home for a visit, we eat at Russo's AT LEAST once...usually more. Everything on the menu is good. I think I've literally eaten everything on it. It can be a little loud in the restaurant because of the open kitchen and all the hard surfaces, so just be prepared for that. Oh, and they always have a great beer and wine selection - super important.
