Fantastic views of camelback. Absolutely gorgeous location. Beautiful all around. Drinks are great. The lavender lemon martinis was good. The charcuterie board is fantastic! Fried lobster tail is great. The lamb chops are alright. Not the best. I should have gone with the short ribs as the waitress suggested. The sticky buns are FANTASTIC! And the apple pie was also amazing. Couldn't really go wrong and I had a great night.
