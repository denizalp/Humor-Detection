Based on the other and only review, I've got to add a \"Bravo\" to Pat at this bar.\n\nThe 4 of us had a blast at Silverton on this trip. We're in Vegas 3 times a year, for the past 35 years, ouch!\n\nAt the Flare bar is \"Pat\", the coolest bartender with fabulous customer service skills.\n\nYes, ladies he is easy on the eyes!!!!!\n\nWe witnessed his skills when he put out a fire! Another couple had just been to a restaraunt there, Friday night, \"Buy One Get One ' promo and weren't happy about their experience. They were local I think, and describing their experience to \"Pat\" after dinner while they were having cocktails. Pat contacted the Manager of food service who came over to the couple and asked what had happened and did everything he needed to to make the couples issues a little better and not loose them as a return customer. They were much happier after they got there situation aired. If Pat hadn't picked up on this, they would have told lots of their friends about their negative experience, nothing wouls have been resolved and it would have been so sad for the food service.\n That said, we had lunch at the buffet one day. It was totally good...\nI'm a Weighht Watcher Leader. I don't eat bad food. Or tolerate bad service!\n\nThen we made reservations at Twin Creek. The 4 of us all having different entres and were very happy. So happy we made a late reservation for the next night and totally enjoyed that experience also. Our servers were great . The place was very busy. Ours waiters were attentive and genuinely there to make our experience a fun one. I love the decore' and background music, lighting, and bar service. Our bus boy even remembered us from the night before and brought over the last of the pretzel breads for the night. How sweet!\n\nSo we will be back in December for New Years week, we're already looking forward to the parmessan crispies.\n\nThe drink specials during the week are great and not watered down.\n\nThe bowling alley at Sports books was so cool. You get better after a couple of drinks!!!!\n\nWe came over to the Casino to look at boats, we got a pleasant suprise and bonuses to our week of casino hopping.\n\nGreat job Pat, keep up the good work!     \"  Tequilla Jane \"
