La Piazza Al Forno, LOVE IT!!!\n\nWife and I tried this place after driving by it several times, but after seeing Guy on DDD (Diners, Drive-in's and Dives) and glad we did!\nAmazing pizza and the Chicken Pesto Lasagna was really good and not like anything I had before.  Count on it, we will be back!!
