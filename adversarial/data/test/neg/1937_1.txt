Horrible service, went there when it was dead, and still couldn't even get good service and even get a refill, forgot half the stuff we preferred and the food was burnt. The manager was nice, she said the waitress was new but there's no excuse for pure laziness she sat behind the counter on her phone the whole time, I won't be going back there,definitely don't recommend.
