Started off at Mezzo for the Italian Cheese board and a charcuterie with a bottle of wine and everything was fantastic. My date and I also had a pizza that was phenomenal. My only grip with Mezzo was that the cocktail menu seemed a bit strange for the atmosphere. I was expecting Italian appertif based items when it seemed like an odd mix of whiskey and tequila instead. That being said the drink that I chose was fantastically crafted and delicious. After dinner we went to Il Tetto to catch a bit of the Pens game and while we only stayed for one beer it was at no fault of the restaurant. The weather was perfect and the rooftop is probably one of the better atmospheres to have a beer at in Pittsburgh when the weather is good. Great selection of beer and the service at this entire place is spectacular. One of our staple downtown experiences.
