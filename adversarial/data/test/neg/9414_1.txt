It's hard to explain to someone how a $6 pizza might be one of the most original and tasty pizzas that they might ever have but it's true.  I wish I knew what to say to get others to just go and try it for themselves other than, \"go it's delicious\".\n\nThe Tuesday and Wednesday $6 pizza special alone makes it perfect for a mid-week pizza binge but know that you'll be facing a 60 - 90 min wait for you pick up, cash only order.
