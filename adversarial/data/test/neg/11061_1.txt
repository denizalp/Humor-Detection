Excellent food, excellent service, excellent drink selection- I adore this place. My parents have a taste for great food and they have never been wrong - I can add this to the list! I've actually never met anyone personally who doesn't love the Brew. Start out with the Asparagus fries, you'll be glad you did. Save room for dessert, too!\nOn a side note, I was there with my Dad and sister one night and all our food arrived at the same time- I felt like we were descended upon on by the staff, anticipating and attending to the smallest detail, and then they were gone to leave us to enjoy our meal. It made me feel like a million bucks!
