went here with girlfriends on a saturday night- got to skip the line and hang out in the VIP area downstairs, here are my thoughts-\n\n1. it is PACKED - like, i was getting shoved \/ pushed over everywhere except in the VIP area.\n2. the VIP area is the one non-air conditioned part of the club.  combine this with the fact that it is mostly guys who have tables in there, and yeah... makes you want to be in the mosh pit disaster of a dance floor\n3. rude, rude rude - even more so than your typical vegas doorguys and busboys, for what reason i have no idea.\n4. the DJ here was the WORST DJ i have ever heard (this was saturday, 8\/22\/09).  we're talking like, full second pauses (with just silence) between songs, no attempt to mix into the next upcoming song, would switch tracks mid-chorus when people were singing along, was playing some fun upbeat techno and then went into a journey tribute for an hour, old school hiphop no one could dance to... really anything he could have done wrong, he did.  singlehandedly put a damper on the night.\n\nthe crowd was poor, the music was terrible, can't speak for the weekday crowd but if it's a weekend, go to tryst or xs or rain or anywhere else.  my girls and i left, and got in at tryst at midnight or so no problem, and salvaged the night with a decent looking crowd, and some room to dance!
