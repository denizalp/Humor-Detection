I went there on a Wednesday night so price was better for dinner. $30 and change with tax per person. No line since we got there like at 9:30. The last seating is at 10 but  once you get it, they don't kick you out unless if the food kicks your ass. \n\nSo far as Vegas buffet line goes, Winn hotel has better crab legs then Rio or Bellagio, but the overall experience, I thought Bellagio is better than the rest. The sushi was good including spicy tuna hand rolls. They even had steak tartare, which no one else has. And also they have a variety sugar-free desserts that were quite delectable. When in Vegas for enjoying too much of everything in one sitting, just go to the Bellagio buffet.
