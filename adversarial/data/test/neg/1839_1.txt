This place is amazing and the service was quick and friendly. We had the Tonkotsu and the pork  broth was incredible.  The seasoned egg was a complete surprise and extremely tasty.  The Pork chashu was very flavorful and we greatly enjoyed our lunch.  Highly recommended and a very simple menu of wonderful selections.   Good Job folks
