Love love love this place! We opted for the outdoor seating on the patio for lunch which was perfect. The seating is very comfortable and casual and included a fire pit. My mom and I ordered the avocado, mozzarella, and mushroom bruschettas. The mozzarella was my favorite out of the bunch. We also got the hummus appetizer which was good but kind of spicy. The braised short rib flatbread was the best part of the meal. Overall friendly service, lovely atmosphere, and great food. Definitely a must to visit in Scottsdale.
