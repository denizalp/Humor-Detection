This place has it all: a huge menu that's perfectly executed, loads of vegetarian\/vegan options (yet plenty to keep the meat-eaters happy), local and organic options, and quick service... and all the while they keep the prices appropriately cheap for a diner. \n\nI've found everything there to be tasty, and the place is always clean. Their Heathen Vegan Shoplifter's Delight sandwich is possibly the best thing I've ever tasted. The only downside is that I'm always too full to try one of their great looking desserts!
