Went here for a pre-artwalk drink at the beginning of July. We sat at the bar. I should have been uncomfortable, but was not. The misters were working great. We only had drinks and chips so I can't comment on the food, but the service was very good. Everyone working that night seemed to be having a good time and we did too. See you soon, Diego Pops!
