Great service! My friend from New York was craving NY-style pizza and luckily we accidentally stumbled upon this place. The first time we came in Tony was extremely hospitable and introduced himself and has remembered our names ever since! He also gave us 6 free garlic knots on our first visit, but that's not the best part.  They're pizza is phenomenal!! The crust is always perfectly thin, but never dry like some other places, and the toppings are really fresh.  I always get anchovies with my white pizza and a lot of places I've been to serve frozen anchovies, but here they are fresh.  My go-to order here is the white pizza with garlic, anchovies, and basil. I can never get sick of it! The fried zucchini is also great, not the frozen kind but fresh zucchini fried on the spot. This place is definitely a must-go-to joint if you love pizza!
