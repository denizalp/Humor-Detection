Dr.Langford is the best I have received awesome care. I ended up getting an infection in both eyes after getting pink eye that has taken over a month to heal. I had no insurance and he made sure he saw me every week at no charge for over a month. I am extremely grateful and cannot say enough about dr Langford and his staff he truly is an exceptional dr. Thanks again for all the great care
