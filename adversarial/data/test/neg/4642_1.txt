I wanted to give it more than 3 stars, perhaps 3.5 or 4 but there were a couple things off with my experience. I'll start with the bad. \n\nMy boyfriend and had almost picked out exactly what we were going to get as soon as we got to the restaurant since we had checked out their menu prior to getting there. We got there, however, and they had run out of the hush puppies (app.). The other bad thing was the fact that after we ordered the bruschetta and specifically told the server we needed the vegan option for it she came back with the non-vegan and my boyfriend accidentally ate the cheddar cheese and was like \"Hmm, this tastes way too good, like really sharp!\". I mean it was actually kinda humorous but we let the server know and they brought us back the right one. The second one that came out, however, was kinda soft, not toasted\/grilled enough, must've been because they really tried to rush it out in order to not aggravate us further? Anyhow, it wasn't bad, the flavors of it were there, just the texture of the bread was not what we were hoping for. The sweet potatoes gnocchi was definitely not something that stood out for me either. It was mehhh. \n\nNow the good. Their Indian Tacos (app.) were pretty delicious. It was a large portion and I tend to get full easily but I could keep eating like a thousand of those things, okay not really but you know what I mean. The dough on the bottom reminded me of \"Sopaipillas\" which are a typical Chilean snack (which is where I was born). The beer  options were good. My boyfriend and I are obsessed with trying out good beers so that was a plus. Also, very reasonably priced, but I may be biased as we just moved down to Charlotte from NYC. Lastly, their desserts were pretty good, the chocolate cake more so than the beer donuts. The cake was perfectly moist and not too overwhelmingly sweet\/rich. Probably due to the balance of the peppermint icing on top. I enjoyed this since I am not really a chocolate lover, at all.\n\nService was attentive. A little bit nervous and definitely not the most genuine but overall clear and concise. Will definitely give it another go and hope to give it a 4!
