I was very happy and satisfied with my experience with Zippy Shell.  I needed to move out of one house and into another 6 wks later.  Zippy Shell was the best options for us. The shell was delivered and I had plenty of time to move all of my goods into it before they came and hauled it away.  It was shrink wrapped and stored in a safe and secure location free of dust or any contaminates.  The entire Zippy Shell team provided excellent customer service and personalized attention.  The driver and administrative staff were very friendly and caring. I would absolutely use them again and would and have recommended them to my friends and family.
