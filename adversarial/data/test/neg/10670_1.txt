This place is a good bet for a sit down meal if you have time to kill at the airport. I would make sure you at least have an hour to eat, the service is not the quickest. There also isn't really that much room to put your bags or carry-ons down.\n\nOnce we were seated, a server came by a few minutes later. I really think she might have been one of two people serving the whole place. Trying her best to keep up with the demand, she brought our drinks back quickly and took our order. We waited around 15 minutes for a cobb salad and buffalo chicken wrap. The cobb salad was huge and packed with a ton of toppings, just how I like it. I got asked by many people waiting in line for the adjacent pizza place if it was as good as it looked, yes, yes it was. My husband said the chicken wrap was decent. \n\nThe only problem we had was getting refills on our drinks and the check, both took a little longer than wanted.
