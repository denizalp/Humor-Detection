I was pretty happy with this choice, and I'll definitely be back.  Great selection, fast service, and excellent food.  The wait staff was very friendly and attentative, and the restaurant was clean.  We got the shrimp cerviche, which was excellent, the burger, which I'd highly recommend, the stuffed mushrooms, which weren't plentiful but were definitely good, the caramones a la diabla which was excellent and the Mac and cheese which was solid.  I'm definitely excited to come back and try some other stuffs on the menu.
