First off you get a lot of food at this place.  We could have done with half the fries.  The chicken was juicy and cooked just right, we had the 2 piece thigh.  One thing I thought was really cool was the Boylan Soda dispenser, something different than Pepsi or Coke.  The cream soda was awesome!  We will be back.
