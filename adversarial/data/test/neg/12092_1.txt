This place is my favorite Chinese food place within about 5 miles.\n\nThe staff is friendly though the best English-speakers in the place are a still a little hard to understand.\n\nThe prices, speed and portions are about average and the food is very good.\n\nI actually like the location and styling of the building.  Its right next to a taco bell and looks like it might have used to be a KFC or something.  The building looks better inside and out than almost all Chinese food restaurants nearby.
