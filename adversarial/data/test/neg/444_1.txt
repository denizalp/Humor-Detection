I really love this place!! Alex was so kind and helpful. She spent so much time assisting me and I really appreciated all of her individualized attention and input. They have so many beautiful items and Alex help me to find some lovely and very flattering outfits for a Boudoir photo shoot. They have really nice quality outfits and accessories for very reasonable prices. My photos turned out great and my husband loved all of my purchases! This is definitely my new go to place for lingerie and bachelorette gifts!!
