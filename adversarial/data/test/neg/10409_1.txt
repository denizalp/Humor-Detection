I like Chipotle because they have great vegetarian options, but this one is an exception. I have been here twice and both times were a less than satisfactory experience. I feel that they skimp on the ingredients. I get far more food at other Chipotles than I do this one. For example, the one at Chandler mall always leaves me feeling well fed. The people are nice enough, but there is a sense that they what you to be in and out as quickly as possible that turns me off. I don't understand why this location got so many good reviews.
