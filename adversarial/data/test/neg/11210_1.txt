Exceeded our expectations! Very cheap, very fresh, very high quality. You'd be hard pressed to find anything better! We returned to stock up before our trip was over, bought a few more cheese danish (we know better now that we should each get our own), and opted for a large loaf of the white chocolate raspberry bread this time to bring back home. So good!
