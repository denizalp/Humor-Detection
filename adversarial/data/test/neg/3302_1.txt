Horrible customer service! You don't scream at your customer on the phone, period! I called to order a lunch take-out, I asked a simple question as to what come with your lunch combo (not shown on their website), but the lady ignored my question the first time. I then asked again to be sure, she proceeded to yell \"soda!\" I will not give be going here ever and won't give this business a penny.
