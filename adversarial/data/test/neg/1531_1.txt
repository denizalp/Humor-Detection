I rate Suha Bites four stars because the Veggie Wong sushi burrito was excellent. Crisp, clean flavors, crunchy, sauced well, wrapped perfectly. The spring rolls were also very good. Super crispy outside, even the leftovers the next day. The filling was tasty but slightly mushy.\nThe Hawaiian side of the menu was not as impressive. Standard bbq combo plate. Chicken was fine, ribs a bit chewy. Macaroni salad was just okay. Spam Musubi was good, worth getting again.\nI will most likely get the Veggie Wong again and will definitely recommend it to my vegetarian friends.
