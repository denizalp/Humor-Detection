So good! I think you pretty much win with whatever you get at Chino. I love the Jade Red Chicken, Emerald Chicken, Jerk Chicken...the list goes on and on! The black refried beans are great too. I'm sort of a white rice fan, but I've heard the fried rice varieties are all yummy. I love that every meal comes with a snickerdoodle cookie. They are so good! The best part about Chino's is the mixture of flavors you get and the fact that they offer samples. Their ordering system can be a little complicated, but the staff is very helpful!
