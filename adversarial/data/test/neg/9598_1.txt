There's a Mongolian barbecue in Indianapolis that I absolutely love and used to go to quite often. When I moved to Madison my boyfriend assured me that this place was the bees knees. Alas, it is not. The sauce is average and their barbecue is quite bland. The meat is dry and tough. The fish and seafood are terrible. The veggies are what you would expect. The staff is amazing! The grillers are usually entertaining and Joy, my favorite waitress, is such a peach. I keep getting dragged back here, but I never enjoy the food much. They have a freestyle Coke machine, so that's pretty neat. The BEST part about this place is the cheesecake rangoon. It's usually the bribe that gets me to go. Every restaurant should put it on their menu.
