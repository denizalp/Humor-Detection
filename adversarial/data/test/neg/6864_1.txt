Simply fell in love when I was fortunate enough to finally try this amazing ice cream. Great variety of flavors. Reminds me my childhood while visiting family in Mexico. Ice cream, yogurt, fresh fruit juices and fruits salads. So many other delicious snacks you will find. A must on the east side of town. If you come a bit late in the evening be prepared to wait. Trust me, it is worth it.
