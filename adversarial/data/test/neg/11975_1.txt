Nothing special. Additional stars deducted for business disorganization. \n\nI had made a reservation for two for Saturday brunch at 10:30. I got a call from them at 9:30 for what I thought would be a confirmation, but they said \"I know you asked if you can come in earlier and you can\". I was confused but I politely said \"no that wasn't me I'll see you at 10:30\". \n\nMy friend got there before me and asked what name the reservation was made under. Turns out he tried my name and they had no record of the reservation. So some time between 9:30 and 10:30, my reservation got lost. This luckily wasn't an issue for us as they had space available, but if I had gone with a larger party I might have been SOL. \n\nThe food itself was also nothing special. My friend (who is Persian) said that the Persian chai latte was a mix of two different drinks. I had some form of eggs Benedict but it was with thinly sliced Persian cured meat. I was surprised that they only gave one piece on the benny- two would have yielded better flavour. \n\nI've satisfied my curiosity and wouldn't come back here.
