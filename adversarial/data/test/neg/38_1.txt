Great dinner here.  Nice view of waterfront, ask for a window seat.  Did not dine on patio as wind was whipping out there but those that did said the fire pits provided adequate warmth to do so. Food was delicious, tried the bruschetta appetizer and the combination of manchego, quince and spanish chorizo was unique and tasty.  Splitting each a beet and kale salad was a great way to taste two different salads, both excellent and not to be missed. Husband had the steak, bone-in rib-eye (huge portion - enough for lunch next day!) with potatoes and spinach done perfectly.  The sea bass was beautiful presentation and very good, but small serving size.  Server was professional and knowledgeable.
