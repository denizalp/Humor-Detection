Went here for lunch during my break.  Lasagna, 3 garlic knots and a drink for less than 10 bucks. The hearing time took ages but it was worth the wait. Huge piece, fluffy, not doughy, garlic knots and enough extra sauce to satisfy anyone. Bummed that it took so long but I'd do it again. Mid level food quality for a place like this but we'll made and relatively clean place. Bathrooms were either tied up or closed and the ladies room said it was out of order.  Fix that shit! People need to wash hands before eating with them.
