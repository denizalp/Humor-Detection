We ordered our wedding cake here back in 2014 and it was super. We ordered my birthday cake in Dec 2015 and portions of the lower cake were completely dried out. The frosting was delish, so I wrote it off as an exception. I ordered iced cookies for Valentines 2016, I was very disappointed. They gave me a box of oversized hearts in three different shades of pink with things like \"Be Mine\" and \"Hugs.\" They were alright, but given that i ordered from a bakery, I expected cute moist cutout cookies like cupid, a rose, hearts etc. with heavy decorative buttercream frosting. The cookies were a hard thin layer of icing and the cookies were crisp. I went to the Giant Eagle bakery and found what I wanted for .76 LESS per cookie.
