What a cool spot. We stopped by for dinner on a bustling Saturday night. We had to wait about 30 minutes for a table on the 2nd floor (Il Mezzo) so we went up to the 3rd floor (Il Tetto), which is a rooftop beer garden with retractable glass roof, to grab a drink. We got draft beers and took in the city views as the sun set. The top floor was a lively bar atmosphere with lots of people socializing. It was a big space with room for a crowd. Our table was ready on time and we were seated near the front of the restaurant by the streetside window. We got the parmesan and peppers pizza, arugula salad and arancini. Everything was very tasty. Our server was great and so was our overall experience. The first floor is a more casual meatball shop - not our thing as vegetarians, so it was great that they had all these options. Great spot to have a small party or go out with friends.
