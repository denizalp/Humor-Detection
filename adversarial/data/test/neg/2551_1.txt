Me and my husband decided to try this New Mexican Restaurant (despite already having a \"usual\" Mexican place we frequent). We showed up 10 minutes before they closed and honestly expected a little rushing on their part perhaps a little attitude .... I know how it is when customers come in minutes before closing when you're expecting to start clean up and get out of there. However, we were treated very patiently and kindly by the hostess, waiter and busier. We were really hungry and they brought out chips, salsa, retried beans, and grilled onions and peppers! It was great. I was even more pleased to see that they had a section on the menu for vegetarians!! I was thrilled! We got our food rather fast, it looked great and tasted great. Serving size was perfect and we were able to take home leftovers. Bathrooms were clean, restaurant had an overall pleasing atmosphere. Hubby and I decided to make this our new home Mexican restaurant!
