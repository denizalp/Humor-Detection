outstanding is all i have to say. super friendly and fun staff and the chef came over and personally greeted us and even gave my boyfriend a suggestion. and then came back and made sure he loved it! the food was beyond words. they even gave us these little cinnamon sugar chips with banana nutella dip that were out of this world! think about it..what brunch place gives you appetizers like some give you bread or chips? no where! that was such a fun little teaser to help tide us over. they were so good we could have filled up just on that. the food was not only incredible, but also prepared and presented beautifully. i was blown away by this place. i will absolutely be coming back!
