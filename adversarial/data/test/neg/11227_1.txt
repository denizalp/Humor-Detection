Stumbled across this place a few weeks ago and was meaning to try their food.  Cool little spot playing some old school hip hop.  Asked for a recommendation on what to try and the suggestion was the goat roti.  It did not disappoint!  I am not a big hot sauce guy but they served\nIt with a side of hot sauce so I gave it a go which brought the dish to a new level... and spice!  Great food at a fair price... be sure to check this spot out!
