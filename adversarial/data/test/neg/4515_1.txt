My appliance horror story started out six days before Christmas.  I notified my home warranty company that my fridge was not cooling and they dispatched their contract technician out to take a look.  He diagnosed the problem as a blown compressor.  Three days drag by and coming to find out they don't work on an R12 sealed system.  It's Christmas now and we have a houseful of company.  Fast forward and it's the 28th now and still no word what is going on.  I asked to speak to a supervisor of the contracted company and they blew me off and later would hang up on me!  I got back in touch with my warranty company and they said if I could find someone to work on my fridge they would pay for the repair since none of their contractors work on this type of system.  So I hit Yelp and called Elite Pro.  Rachelle was extremely helpful and an hour later Ronald was at my house.  He diagnosed the problem as a blown relay and in half an hour Ronald and Elite Pro had us up and running.  My problem was misdiagnosed by someone either poorly trained or looking to make money on a $2,000 compressor repair!  It took me waiting 12 days without a fridge and Elite Pro had me up and running in less than two hours from the time I made the call.  The whole thing cost about 10% what a compressor would have  AWESOME!  My home warranty company and that contract company could learn a thing or two from Elite Pro Appliance Repair Services!  These guys are honest and have my highest recommendation!
