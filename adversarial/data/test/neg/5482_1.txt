I  arrived home from vacation to find a green pool and needed help ASAP.  I called a few businesses but with this Vegas summer heat, pool techs are busy.  When Bryce called me back he just happened to be in the area and came over.  He gave me a quote to fix a leak in my pipes and get the pool back in shape. The quote seemed a little high but he mentioned some Green to Clean and that they could have my pool up and running in a fair number and this is my first pool and I really had no idea so so I agreed.  Before the work was done my pump stopped working and within a day the pool was back to green, $400 immediately down the drain...no pun intended!!  I ended up having a friends friend who does pools professionally at the big casinos come over and he said the job looked like the tech was trained on Youtube - no primer only glue and the nipple was screwed too far into the pump and caused it to break....so after wasting 400 dollars I had to spend thousands more on a new pump!!   In addition to that the pipe still leaks- Bryce actually tried to collect the balance before the work was complete...I see now why he was in a rush.  To top if off I sent Bryce a message to let him know and he didn't even respond.   Reminder, get several quotes and check yelp in advance...don't hurry up and make a bigger mess like I did...what an expensive lesson!
