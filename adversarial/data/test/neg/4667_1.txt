The lady working was kind of aggressive. Ya she's an old lady but from the moment we walked in she rubbed me in a wrong way. We walked in with outside food not knowing it wasn't allowed and she told us \"i can't let you eat that in here\" i was like ok. I continue to look at donuts tho becuz I'm not eating the food it's just sitting for when I'm done with picking out my donut. And she stood there expecting us to take it out right away. I said \"we'll take it out\" becuz i just wanted my donut. I'm trying to pay with Apple Pay and she's just trying to rush it. Mind you me and 2 friends are the only people ordering in the store. I'm like lady i have to wait for the machine to go chill. Then we get to the donut. It was so dry,nasty, and i couldn't finish it. Which is crazy considering i paid like $5 for 2 donuts. My friends donut was so stale i felt bad for her. My donut had an odd taste. The donuts should have a shelf life and then throw them out once it gets past that point. No one wants an old donut considering how they price their donuts. I'll just stick with BoSa
