The sushi here is excellent. I sort of stumbled upon this place while visiting downtown Phoenix for a week-long work conference and was immediately impressed and surprised by the the purple sushi rolls. Apparently the black rice they use is much better for you and was really delicious and fun to look at! I've been back to Phoenix multiple times since then for more conferences and I always stop by and get myself a couple rolls that are both delicious and extremely reasonably priced. They use great quality tasting fish with a good sweet flavor and an pretty good list of both basic and specialty rolls to choose from.
