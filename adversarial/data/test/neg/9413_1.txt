First timer here and it's really good!  Here are the things we tried and a short comment:\n\nPotato soup.  Very good. Thicker which is better. 4 stars.\n\nBLT was good but had cheddar cheese on it??? That's just weird.  It was a 3 star.\n\nPumpkin soup.  5 stars!  Nothing else to say.\n\nChicken Parmesan sandwich.  Served open face and pretty good.  Probably a 3.75 stars sandwich.  Needs more seasoning in the sauce.\n\nWill we be back?  Yes!
