My sister and I came here for lunch the other day, I had a Gyro and she had a Chicago dog and we split a tamale. My gyro was ok, the onions were cut WAY big and the sauce tasted like sour cream instead of cucumber, but her hot dog was awesome and the fries were the BOMB. The tamale had a weird chili flavor so we didn't finish it. I LOVED that they had the news on all of their tv's, and had current issues of Chicago newspapers to read. It seemed like a nice place to sit down and read the paper and enjoy a dog.
