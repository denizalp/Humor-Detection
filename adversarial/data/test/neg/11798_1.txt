Went for lunch on a Wednesday. Had the hot and sour soup which was good. It had a little zip to it and a bit of thick consistency which is how I like it. BBQ pork fried rice was tasty. Service was quick and efficient. Also, they have a baccarat section right outside...probably not a coincidence it's in front of Noodle Asia.
