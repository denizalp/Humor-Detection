So me and three of my friends came here for breakfast on a Saturday morning: first of all they sat us at a big table with other strangers... second our waiter was high or on some drug... he came to the table maybe twice when we were there for like two hours and only filled two out of four water glasses... the food took forever and half of my stuff came out an hour later... when i asked to speak to the manager she was rude and standoffish and then when i asked to speak to the owner he said no... then our waiter mixed up our credit cards for different meals that we had.. they kept bringing us other people's food... get better servers or management this was the most ridiculous experience it wasn't even that busy
