I spent months wondering if a guy should wax.  That pestering 'old man hair' on the top of my shoulders was bothering me.  Finally one day I thought 'why not!'. Glad I did and this was the place to go. Clean, nice people, helpful, quick, location is discreet (but I liked that) and the process was painless and affordable.\nEnjoyed my visit.
