During my week in Phoenix the drivers often refused to pick us up when we flagged them down because they didn't like the fair. Called for a pickup and called after 30 minutes and no idea when they would get to me. I know it was a busy because it was after the Super Bowl but they NEVER did call or come. Just topped how unprofessional they were in the community.
