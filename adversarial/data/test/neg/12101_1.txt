This place is almost five stars for me.  I love the old time feel, complete with underground milking tunnel connecting the two buildings.  \nThe hand muddled Korbel old fashions are perfect! \nI had the fish combo (available Wed or Fri) with the cheesy potatoes,  a must.  Combo comes with baked and fried cod and fried perch. Plus slaw and all the bread you like.\nSave the sub-par service we had while dinning, this place is great!
