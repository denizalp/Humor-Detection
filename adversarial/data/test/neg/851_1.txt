Nice place to buy Eastern European, Russian, Polish and other regional  specialty foods. Great selections of various  meats, cheese and sausages. Always walk away with an assortment. Peanut halavah was the best I have had. Got the Smoked Krakowska Kielbasy, Ehmer Smolked Salami, Smoked Gouda Cheese, Foot Long Sausages, a Dense Rye Bread and Kras Napolitanke Cookies. The nice part is I can't pronounce most of the product names, I may not always know exactly what I purchased but the samples are always available and Misha is always helpful. I have been to this place about 6 times. Since Misha took over ownership...place has got even better.
