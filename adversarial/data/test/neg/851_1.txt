Was craving some wings so I came to Wings  Restaurants. It was my first time going there and the one staffer working was very helpful and patient with me while I looked over the menu. \n\nI decided to order 2lbs of wings, fries, celery and carrots. It didn't take that long for my order, about a 15 minute wait. Had a pleasant conversation with the staffer. She was very friendly and helpful...  \n\nThe wings and fries  were delicious! Will definitely go back! There's lots of flavors to choose from and planning on trying all of them...
