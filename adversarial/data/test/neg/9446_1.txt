I end up at Victory Cafe because it's on my way home from work, their music is good, and they have a great selection of beer.  Oh, and it feels like a pub -- probably because it kind of is.  \n\nNormally quite packed with a good selection of non-pretentious folks, they have a downstairs area with two rooms and a larger upstairs area.  Their cask beer is only served downstairs but you can trek down and trek back up with it if your party is upstairs.  In the summer though, they've got a wonderful patio that faces the street so you can hang out, people watch, and drink beer on the most beautiful of summer days and evenings on Markham street.  I can't wait for summer!\n\nTheir food is only fair to middling: not the best, not the worst.  I normally don't go for the food but if I must eat it I will.  They have the usual burgers, salads, fries, vegetable curry, and so on.
