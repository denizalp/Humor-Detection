My favorite coffee shop in the West Valley! Chill atmosphere and wide variety of drinks. The pink hair lady is soo sweet and funny she makes my day! If you don't like your drink you can get it remade and the staff likes coming up with new things with you. I'm in love! Don't forget to take advantage of the free wifi.
