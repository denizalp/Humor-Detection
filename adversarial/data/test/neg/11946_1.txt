Really liked my experience... there was an hour wait for a table, but the bar and couches are full service and open seating, so I sat at the bar.\n\nAll of the bar tenders were nice and on the ball.  Beer was cold and good, and fried chicken and macaroni and cheese was amazing.\n\nOnly thing I thought the decor was too dark\/black, and that they should brighten it up a bit.
