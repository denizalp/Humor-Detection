Woah , lets talk about fancy.\n\nso this place had some upscale decorations going on, it was beautiful.\nthis place has been open for sometime but it was still busy. \nI wouldn't go here for a date, but more like a family dinner, or a group of friends. \n\nit is def sharing style, so order a bit of whatever and share with your group, it is the best way to experience this type of restaurant.\n\nThe food was good, and of course more upscale in presentation comparing to the average Chinese cuisine.\n\nI would definitely go here again.
