I'm pretty sure it's the happy hour menu that made me instantly love this place. I stopped by with three friends for an early bite before an event. We shared a bottle of their house pinot noir, two orders of bruscetta, and the hummus place. There was something about the food, the wine, and the beautiful patio that made me not want to leave. Everything was delicious and beautifully presented. I love the way they present the drink menu via iPad with descriptions of each wine and details on pricing. Definitely a new favorite place!
