We walked in right before they closed for lunch and were the only people there.  I had the Sukiyaki with beef and my friend had the Shabu Shabu.\n\nThe sauces were really tasty, I ended up asking for more of the peanut sauce.  I didn't eat much of the rice because you get a small bit of noodles with the veggie trays so I filled up on that and the tofu.  I ended up getting three trays of veggies and three bowls of salad.  I was full but not Thanksgiving Dinner stuffed.\n\nThe waitress always checked on us to see if we needed anything, and turned the burner down once things heated up.  I don't know if she is always attentive like that or if it was because we were the only people there.\n\nMy friend said that they had a lunch discount coupon they gave out for awhile and he'd go at least once a week with a friend or two.  You know it has to be good if you know someone that does that.
