visiting from charleston, sc with 6 others.  we had a nice time in the back private room.  the service was attentive and the waitress was knowledgeable about the specials.  this is a seafood restaurant with asian fusion influences.  i started with the lobster bisque which was average at best.  however, the scottish salmon entree was delicious; perhaps the best salmon entree i've had in a restaurant.  (i'm not a great salmon fan.)  the rest of my party enjoyed dishes like the calamari appetizer and the entrees Mediterranean whole sea bass and grilled filet.  there also was a nice touch where you could mix and match fish, sauce, and a side (i think it was called 'simply sides').  the wine list was considered very good by the oenophiles in the room.  it was overall a pleasant experience.
