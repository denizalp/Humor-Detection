Decided to give this place a try, since we drive by it all the time.\n\nFirst time we came we ordered the meat lovers. It came out fresh and hot and was pretty good. We had added garlic for the extra kick.  The salad we okay, not really worth getting.  \n\nThe second time we sat at the bar and ordered the Big Kahuna.  It has ham, pineapple and basil.  I had added garlic to it as well. I enjoyed this pie more than the first. I also had a beer that I guess was from New York.  Anyway the beer and pizza combo was wonderful.. Our server\/bartender was friendly and efficient.\n\nOverall, I thought it was a decent enough place.
