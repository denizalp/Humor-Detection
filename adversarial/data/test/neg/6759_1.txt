Never went in there when it was Avenue Bar so I can't compare but a large group of us went there on a Sunday night and the service was impeccable in spite of the fact that we all came in at different times. Everyone was happy with the food which was mostly sandwiches. Prices are a bit steep for what you get but the place has a nice inviting feel, and a good ambiance. We'll probably return to try the dinner but for $26+ we'll expect it to be outstanding!
