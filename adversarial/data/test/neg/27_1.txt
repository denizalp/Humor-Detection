At the beggining of September Access had to auction off anything of value that belonged to my wife and I because I had defaulted on my rental agreement. Amongst our stuff were some photos and an urn with our previous dog's ashes and paw print. We informed the manager of these items and he assured us that those items would be put aside in a box so we could pick them up at a later time. When my wife went to retrieve everything the photos were in a plastic laundry basket but the ashes and paw print were missing. When my wife pointed this out to the manager he just shrugged his shoulders and said he didn't know where they went. This upset my wife very deeply so she asked very nicely if he could look into finding them. After some grumbling the manager reluctantly agreed. It's been two weeks and there's been no word on where the ashes and paw print are. I know I shouldn't make any accussations without any proof but it wouldn't surprise me if someone took of threw the urn in the garbage. My advice? Don't rent from this place.
