My bf and I are only in town for the weekend and we found this gem.  I must say the customer service here is excellent.  The owner of the restaurant was hilarious and very attentive.  The staff was also very friendly!  On top of that the food was superb!! They have omakase for $35.  It's not the traditional omakase where they serve you each sushi one at a time.  It comes all at once on a platter.  Every piece was fresh and delightful!  What's unique about the sushi here is the black rice they use.  Healthy and did not take away from the texture or taste!  I'm just blown away!!! We also ordered the blue fin combo (melts in your mouth). \n\nWe also got to try what real wasabi tasted like.  Overall one of the best restaurant experience ever.  Brought me back to when I was in Japan. \n\nLast but not least the mochi was the cherry  on top! \n\nWished they were located in NYC!
