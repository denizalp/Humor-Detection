This class was so much fun!!!  Great cardio and lots of energy from the instructors!  Some of the steps were hard for me since I am not very coordinated but I just kept moving and laughing!  We really worked up a sweat and  moved some muscles I hadn't moved in a while.  Can't wait to go back and try it again!!
