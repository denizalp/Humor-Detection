Every thing was fantastic! Cute and well laid out space and fantastic food. My fiance had the grilled cheese sandwich with Sriracha ketchup, I had the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich and we shared the bacon poutine. We sat right by the food window and I was dying waiting for my food. Parking situation is street parking, one of the better that I have seen since moving here. Wifi is locked.
