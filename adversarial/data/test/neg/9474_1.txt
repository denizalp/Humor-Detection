JoJo Smith is the best saleswoman I have had the pleasure of working with.  She fought for me to get the vehicle of my dreams after providing me with alternatives that better suited my price range. I am in the car of my dreams because Autonation Westlake worked hard to help me get it.  I was in a traumatic car accident a year ago and to feel safe was all I wanted in a new vehicle, especially after not driving for a year. They are by far the most honest sales group I have come across and I would recommend them to anyone looking for new vehicle. Awesome experience.
