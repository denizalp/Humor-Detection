So this is not a positive review, but I do own some of the problem as will be outlined below.\nTook my MTB in to get disc brakes installed, wheels\/tires set up with Stan's no tubes, and purchase a Surly Tugnut (and install it since it was already in there). After I told him what I needed and that my budget was around $100 the mechanic verbally quoted me a price of $105. Told him it sounded good, gave him my contact info got my ticket and took off. This is where it is partially my fault: Two days later when I actually took a look at my ticket, the quote was $140. I called the shop and asked what was up, and the mechanic I spoke too pretty much told me I was out of luck and that I should have looked at my ticket (albeit he was more polite than just saying that). So fine, I was willing to own up to that and shell out the extra 35 bones. Picked up the bike, and hit the trail for the first time the following morning, and quickly heard that my rear caliper had not been installed correctly and that a bolt that attaches the caliper to the frame was rubbing up against my disc. Needless to say, I will not be returning to this shop, even for them to fix the problem they created, as I can't really trust them to be honest about how much they are gonna charge me to fix their own mistake. So, two stars because there are definitely problems with this LBS, and I will not be returning. But not one star, because I definitely need to own part of the problem.
