Went here with another friend and wanted a really quick lunch coz I was on the go! Had only 30 min and thought, let's try this. And to my surprise, we actually made it in time ! \n\nSo I ordered the lunch menu that comes with a drink (green tea, black tea, green milk tea or black Milk tea) I ordered the sausage and braised pork rice. It came literally within 5 minutes.\n\nI found it a little salty but definitely satisfying. One bowl was really filling. :) \n\nI'd definitely come back to try their other menu when I have more time than 30 min ;)
