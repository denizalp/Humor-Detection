Hungry after a trip to Hoover Dam we searched on Yelp and found this small cafe.  I'm so glad we did.  My entire family loved the experience -- the food, the service, the atmosphere, etc.  My husby got the 9 lb Reuben with curly fries - YUM!  I had the grilled chicken\/avocado wrap with curly fries - FRESH and YUM!  My kids ate their meals without hesitation.  They enjoyed the crinkle-cut fries, but I would recommend the curly fries over their crinkle-cut fries.  We ended our meal with malts made from an ice cream machine that was 60 years old.  The small malt is plenty, as all their portion sizes are generous.  Service was top notch and friendly.  We ate at restaurants in Vegas of \"James Beard Award-Winning Chefs\", but this little place left the greatest impression on us.  Sometimes simple (done well) is better.  When our trip was said and done my husby, also a chef, wanted to go out of our way to eat here again.  What a pleasant surprise and experience!!
