I tried the three course combo meal here. It starts off with an appetizer, a soup, salad or cucumber dish. Then you choose from a various of teriyaki chicken and other meat dishes or ramen. Since our group were mostly hungover lol we pretty much all opted for the ramen. And then the third course are consists of a either salmon avocado, spicy tuna or tempura roll. \n\nThe miso soup was so salty and the flavor was just.. a weird indescribable flavor that I can't explain but it just was not good. The ramen wasn't horrible, edible but I wouldn't say it's anything special. It does come with some spice and roasted garlic flakes on the side that's really delicious in the ramen. The spicy tuna roll was eh. Nothing special, but not bad.\n\nDecor is good, pretty fancy and service is good. But food was eh. Price is decent, well for vegas.
