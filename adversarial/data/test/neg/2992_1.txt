I don't understand all the five star reviews. We had an awful dinner. We ordered two appetizers, the hummus and 3 bruschetta (prosciutto, mushroom, and avocado.) All were lacking in flavor. The bread was sliced too thick, it was soft inside, and wasn't brushed with oil. Not true bruschetta, more like dip on top of a thick slice of French bread. The hummus was inedible. So much cumin that that is all you could taste. Totally overpowering. Were they trying to give it an Indian influence? My sister's beet salad was fine, but a salad you could find on any menu. My Caesar salad and my sister's flatbread were flavorless. The worst was the \"gelato.\" How they call that gelato is beyond me. Nowhere close to what gelato really tastes like. It was closer to ice milk. \nI am not sure why this place is so popular. Perhaps because of the social scene or the ability to sit outside. If you are interested in good food, skip it.
