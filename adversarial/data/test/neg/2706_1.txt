Great location. Easy to find and tons of parking. Super nice and friendly employees. This location is quite small inside but there is still a decent amount of seating inside. There is also some seating outside but not a lot. Fast service which I look for in Starbucks. Good food choices, they don't have everything though. Free wifi which is a plus. Clean and fresh looking bathroom. Overall this Starbucks was definitely a nice one and I had a pleasant visit with no disruptions to make it bad.
