This is the worst business in Las Vegas it's really sad that I'm refusing to order from here anymore because I refuse to deal with the manager Rasheed and it's extremely sad that his father leaves the business to him the way that he runs things this business will never get far they are a rip-off if they don't have your order correct they will not fix it and when they tell you they will fix it they never do I am now fighting them in court because my order was way off I spent $100 on a business order and now they're refusing to do anything about it not to mention I've been a customer over 2 years now and Rasheed has the nerve to treat me this way HE IS THE WORST MANAGER I HOPE IS FATHER PUTS HIS TRUST IN SOMEONE ELSE RASHEED IS DEFINITELY NOT FIT FOR THE JOB save your self the trouble don't order here
