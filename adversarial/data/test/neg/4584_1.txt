Visiting from Dallas when I realized my eyebrows were in dire need of a touch up. I was hesitant to let someone besides my Dallas esthetician near my brows so I searched yelp and it appears she had solid reviews so I thought what the heck. I texted the number and she responded promptly indicating I could walk in and be seen. The wait wasn't long and more importantly she listened to my request as I didn't want the top portion of my brow threaded (this throws off my shape considerably). My brows turned out fabulous and I will be returning when I'm in the area!!!!
