We had just finished a hike and decided to grab some breakfast when we came across Scramble. The restaurant is definitely fast food style. You order at the counter but the staff does deliver to the table and cleans up the dishes for you?  Our group kept changing orders and asking for menu alternatives - the epitome of the difficult customers - and yet our cashier was patient and accommodating. \nI had the Vegan Mushroom Scramble with sweet potato hash and a side of fruit in lieu of the bread (no additional charge). My brother got a bacon and cheese omelet with jalape√±o cornbread. They also offer sides of pancakes instead of toast, if you like. The meal was delicious with plenty of options for everyone in the group to be happy.  I like that there are several vegan options on the menu. We just made closing and were the last customers to leave but we're not made to feel rushed at all. I will definitely make it back here whenever I'm in Phoenix.
