I am pretty sure they put drugs in their food. Like ... addictive drugs. Because I literally crave the chizu all the time. \n\nI was wary to try a ramen place. I didn't even like it in college; why would I bother going to a restaurant that serves just ramen, ick? But oh, I was so wrong. \n\nMy friend recommended the chizu the first time I went and I ordered it based on her recommendation. It was so good that I now order it every time; I decided there's no way to top this dish. \n\nMy yoga friends and I eat here all the time; sometimes once a week, and I will never get tired of it. We also love the brussel sprouts.\n\nSushi is good, but it's definitely not a sushi place, so if that's what I was craving I would go elsewhere. Ice cream is just ok, too, but it's ok because I'm usually too full for dessert anyway!
