The new location is pretty and upgraded to double space of the previous one. The best place to try authentic Chinese food plus dim sum, good place for group dining as well. The portions here are very big and fresh. Must try lamb chop and Cantonese roast duck; they have perfect seasoning. Walnut shrimp is my favorite; it's juicy and not too salty and the shrimp were super big with creamy sauce and crispy walnut.
