I wanted a couture wedding gown that would wow. I was told this Bridal Salon carried couture gowns. I made an appointment and met with Soondis. I ended up finding my dream gown at a silhouette within a 20 minute appointment time. I was in tears. Mind you, I'm very picky! It shocked me! Soondis, your professionalism is impeccable and you have made my dreams come true!!! I highly recommend this Bridal Salon!
