We were referred to the buffet knowing the price but were told the experience would be above par. The variety was nice but the quality wasn't that great. For the middle of the week\/lunch price point I felt that I ate more than I should have of just average food. I did not walk away feeling like I ate great food. I will not refer anyone to this buffet or return to try it again
