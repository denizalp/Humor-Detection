Brought my kids here this morning and had a BOGO complimentary entrée coupon for dinner to use. The waitress was really nice and told me I could basically use the coupon on any entrée, it was basically BOGO on any entrée up to $8.00 in value, I had the steak tips with mash potatoes and corn, my Son had the chicken fried steak with broccoli and mash potatoes and my Daughter had a breakfast entrée. When the food came it was very good, tips were mixed with mushrooms and onions. I added some A1 sauce to it and couldn't believe how good it was. I was expecting mediocre, nothing much more than that but boy was I wrong. I guess that goes to say that's why the place was filled to the max upon arrival. Luckily we got a booth right away. We usually don't come here that often but the cook they got at that location right now at this period in time is on point! The restaurant is only as good as there cooks and the food I had was delicious. Thank you IHop for honoring my coupon and thank you to the waitress that treated us with respect! It was a great experience and hope to be back soon. FYI. We went Saturday  morning today. You  might want to hold on to that cook you got on at that particular time. He\/She is very good!! Cheers!!
