I visited Olive and Ivy last night with a few of my friends and I have to say that the service we received from Thomas Mann was outstanding! !!  He was attentive to our table while having to serve several other tables.  The food was excellent.   The portions were just right\nJust as a suggestion when serving the lamb meatballs,  is it possible to have mint jelly as a compliment to this tasty dish?\nI will be back in the near future. \nI thought the restaurant was absolutely beautiful with the lights all around.
