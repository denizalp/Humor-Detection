Our experience with Giovanni of Giovanni's Upholstrey was a very positive one. He was very informative and helpful to us in choosing the correct fabric that we needed for the upholstery of our 1895 Barber Chair. The workmanship was excellent and the chair came out looking beautiful. We would definitely use him again.\n\n\nKent Skalla
