Our server seemed annoyed that we were there, I know realistically this means there was probably issues in the back that we're just being brought to the front. We ordered the caprese as an appetizer, 4 slices cost $8.Our pizza was pretty forgettable as well.\n\nI guess I had really high expectations from people I know who have gone in the past, but I'm definitely not going back.
