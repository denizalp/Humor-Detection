A riend took me here for the first time today. Great salsa, when we could get it. The Mexican Pizza was delightful, as well. Chips were okay, I like 'em a little thinner, but that's just me. \n\nThe problem here, as I see it, is the service. Maybe they were just short-handed today, but we had to ask for chips and salsa (the whole reason my friend wanted me to experience the place) to BEGIN with, when there was hardly anyone else there, and when it should have been on the table immediately. Then, we had to ask for more salsa THREE times before we got it. As our dining experience progressed, the place got busier and busier. The staff was actually RUNNING to get everything done. I saw a guy get up and get his own hot sauce at one point. There's nothing like a bunch of people running around like chickens with their heads cut off to make one feel comfortable, you know? \n\nFor a Mexican Pizza to knock your socks off and a MUCH more extensive menu (Bitz-ee Mama's only has like four weird entrees), head to Valle Luna. And if you don't care about decor, etc., walk up to the window at El Norteno and get their pollo fundido, carne asada plate or anything with their crack-in-it red chili. (I don't think it really has crack in it, but that would be one of the reasons it's so addicting.)\n\nI'm a server whose been in the industry all her life. I'm all for giving a place a second chance, but based on the other reviews, it seems I'm right on with this one. Sorry, Bitz-ee Mama's. I won't be returning.
