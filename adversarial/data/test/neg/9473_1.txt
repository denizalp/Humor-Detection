I was refered to Mr. Steve Massis and his son Harry about a year and a half ago by another tech Chris in the. Same complex... I own a classic automobile a '96 Chevy Caprice Classic and he does a great job fixing what ever problem I am having with my car his service is great. Even Though I'm From L.A. I will recommend him to anyone in the Las Vegas Valley for any car or truck forgein or domestic.
