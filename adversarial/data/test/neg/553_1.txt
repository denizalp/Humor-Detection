On the first night of our stay at the Rio Hotel in Las Vegas we decided to stay in and eat at one of the restaurants in the hotel.  We both ordered the fried shrimp dinner with mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.\n \nThe shrimp were HUGE!  They were also delicious as were the mashed potatoes.  Not cheap - over $80 with tip for two meals.
