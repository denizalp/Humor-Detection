This place is really amazing! The manager can tell that we are new to the place so just gave us arancini for free! It is really tasty and feel like home food! I also had gyro. The meat was so tender but perhaps a little bit saltier than my taste. My friends had souvlaki and veal burger, the portion is huge! Also the service is great! I will definitely come back again.
