This location is clean and convenient when I'm in the neighborhood. I've been eating at Chipotle locations for many years. The staff at this location is friendly and the food is consistant with most other locations. I had the Carnitas Burrito this time but the Barbacoa is my fav. They filled it with plenty of pork and just the right amount of the other condiments I usually get.
