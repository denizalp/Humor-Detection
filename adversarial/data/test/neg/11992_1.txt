came here on a Saturday night with the family and the food was nothing but exceptional. The spices and portions were great! The reason why I gave it 4 stores is because our server didn't seem very attentive to our table. She never smiled at us and never came and checked on us. There was another server who kept coming to refill our waters and asked us how everything was and she was super nice and more attentive to us than our actual sever!! All in all it was a great night with amazing food. Highly reccomend
