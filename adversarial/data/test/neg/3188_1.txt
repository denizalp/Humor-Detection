I know what some of you will say... many dogs are in shelters looking to find a loving home...\nI did look and contacted some \"animal rescue\" for the last 2 months....\nI put couple applications in to adopt a rescued pet but did not receive response or they called me but then silence radio :( even the 4 diff√©rents shelters I contacted said my application was great, got the first call then did not contact me back.\nSo we went to Petland at Boca Park. We were looking for a little brother for our 12 years old rescued  Border Collie Humphrey. Humphrey is so intelligent, a very loving and caring member of our family!\nPetland has a large variety of breeds. From dogs to cats, Hamster to birds! Petland's team is very friendly. Pets look well cared for. I did not see any dirty crate like some said.\nMy husband and I came to meet with a little female english Shepherd or a little male shetland sheepdog we saw on their website www.petlandlasvegas.com\nThe little female english Shepherd was too active. the male shetland sheepdog had that personality that you just fall in love with.\nFor some reason I asked Hanah to give me a minute to see the other puppies they had.\nHanah was our counselor there. She was so bubbly and very passionate when speaking about the puppies. She was very sweet and knowledgeable. All my questions were answered, the one she didn't have the answer for, she search and came back with the answer. \nHanah was very patient and left us some time alone with the puppy and just came check on us.\nShe kindly show me all the puppies I asked.\nWhile husband was playing with the little Shetland Sheepdog, Another Shetland Sheepdog caught my attention. He was sharing a crate with another puppy. My heart dropped for that mini Shetland Sheepdog.\nWhen Hanah brought him to the play cubicle, the puppy just came and cuddle in my arms. I knew in that second it was my new little son and Humphrey little brother \nThat night we did not get him. Hanah gave me the option to pay $100 deposit to hold him (valid 24h if you don't make up your mind you loose it or if you decide to get the puppy, the $100 is deducted from the purchase) She was not pushy for me to leave a deposit or anything.\nWe came the following day and decided to bring our puppy home. We asked to spend some time with him in the play cubicle before jumping.\nWe named our Shelty MUPPET  He should be 10\/12 pounds when he reach his adult age.\nthe all process paper work and getting puppy bathed and clean less than 1 hour.\nthey offer you $100 in products, you can get anything you like for the puppy.\nThey also offer with the puppy a crate, dry food, wet food, toys, cleaning product, pads and couple more things :) and the most important they include a Vet visit you must schedule within 5 days of the purchase.\nWe called right away and got an appointment\nsunday. Muppet has a micro chip implanted already.\nThey offer payment options.\nWe took Muppet home yesterday. He is 2 months old. I just Adore Him, whole family as well.\nAs soon we got home! He just feel at home! and met humphrey. Muppet is the miniature of Humphrey! they played all evening! they bonded instantly! \nMuppet followed Humphrey and did his business in our backyard and did not use the pads yet...\nGuys I highly recommend HANAH at Petland! she usually 4pm to 9pm and Petland Boca Park. Animals looks healthy, clean and well care for.\nI believe they have a location in Henderson as well!\nWe are blessed with Muppet.\nTIPS: Please ask for puppy's parents info (breed\/weight). Name of breeders... \nDay 2 Muppett is home with us, at the Vet, i was going through his documents and noticed the name of an LLC... and a different name for the breeder.\nI googled it and yelp it. I started to freak out...\nYes i have name and breed of parents but no information was given for weight.\nI read horrible things about the LLC that happens to be a puppy mills :( \nI am praying that Muppett will be growing healthy. I will make sure my puppy like Humphrey will be well treated and loved! \nAlso I received a call from AKC (Animal Kennel Club), they registered my Muppett. It cost us about $330 :( one time transaction, still... I think Petland should inform me about extra $$ to spend ... Was it necessary? that is everyone own decision :)\nnext update beginning of January then end of January for Muppett vaccin. \nMerry christmas all
