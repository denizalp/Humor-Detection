Amazing place!! We spent some time at the desert and it was really nice to be in a place that shows and feels the American culture. Everything there is made in the USA. Service was very attentive and friendly. Food was delicious. We started with the pretzel deep in cheese, I had a burger and my wife had a shrimp and grits. Definitely a place to check it out while in Scottsdale.
