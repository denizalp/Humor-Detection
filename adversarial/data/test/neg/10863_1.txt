The Good: Delicious food - I had the chicken burrito and it was magnificent. The owner provided chips and salsa during the wait. The atmosphere was comfortable, open and relaxing . The owners brother-in-law served us and he was awesome ! Nice guy who cares a great deal about the service and experience. Top shelf service and food all the way.\n\nThe Bad: A little tucked out of the way, but some of the best spots are a gem to find. \n\nThe Ugly: No ugly to report on here. This was an excellent experience all the way.\n\nWill go again and absolutely recommended to others !
