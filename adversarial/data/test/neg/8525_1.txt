Somehow this is the best American style food I've ever had.  I know that seems strange since I was in Canada!\n\nIt was late in the evening and a friend and I were walking down Sainte-Catherine and we needed a bite to eat.  It was pretty late so we weren't sure what we would be able to find.  After walking around taking photos in the cold wet weather, a warm, comfortable place to eat had clearly made it to the top of the agenda.  When we came across Mister Steer tucked between two strip clubs, we decided to go for it.\n\nThe food was both good and fast with friendly service.  How fast was the service?  Well, I went to the washroom right after I ordered and when I came back the whole meal was already there!  Granted, it was late so they weren't that busy, but I have never had food come out that fast before.\n  \nThe hamburger was very tasty and well seasoned.  It also came as a round lump, not flat, somewhat like it would if you made it at home.  The curly fries were okay, and it was nice to have a little side salad with the meal. For dessert I had hot apple pie a la mode.  It wasn't the best apple pie I've ever had, but it was still a very good dessert.\n\nThis place is the perfect spot for a home style meal on a cold day.
