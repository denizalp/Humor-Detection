We had supper there last night.\n\nWe shared a bottle of white house wine ... it was good.\n\nGord ordered Ortikia (two large size quails mixed with herbs and spices baked in the oven) with rice, potatoes and veggies.\n\nI ordered Chicken Breast Dinner (two generous pieces of char-broiled chicken filet) with rice, potatoes, veggies and tzatziki.\n\nIt was delicious!\n\nMy only complaint is that the veggies weren't fresh (they were cooked from frozen).\n\nI'd recommend this restaurant ... the food was good and our server was very friendly.
