My husband and I went hear when I was 15 weeks pregnant. We were able to find out the gender  the sonographer was very nice took her time and talked to us about what she was looking at. The room was huge with a big screen for my family to look at as well as toys for my little ones to play. We enjoyed our visit very much!
