Picked this flight on Expedia for a return home trip. Rate was good.... Until you see all of the hidden cost they try to apply to you when you go to check in. They have a smaller carry on sizer so you are will have to check in a carry-on that is allow on other airlines. \"30 bucks per bag \"  although after seating we notices others that had the same size bag we had to check in. They were allowed to place over head.  Plane was messy.... trash in seats,  floor needed to be picked up. Window was so bad I had to clean it just to see out.  On Flight ...charges  you for a small pack of snacks free on other flights, $2.00 for water, $6.00 to watch tv, bring your on head phone or you will be charged.  I am surprised they did not have a coin slot to go to the toilet  All the airline personnel seem nice. But for customer service forget it. No help at all !! I was give a phone number to call about my concern with the luggage,was disconnected one time, had then I was told they would call back NOT. I would not use this airline again
