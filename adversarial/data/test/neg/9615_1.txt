Nothing but good things to say about Bobby and his little shop! I was referred by a friend who had gone to him for a chair of his and was happy.\nI needed the foam in my 8 year old sofa cushions replaced as I was sagging all the way down to the \"deck\" is what Bobby called it. \nHis prices are reasonable and he listened. Sold!
