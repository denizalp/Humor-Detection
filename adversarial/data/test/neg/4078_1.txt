I initially gave Verve 2 stars when we picked up our car, because they were nice, and I understand the struggle of a startup. However, when we dropped the car off, the shuttle did not take us to the airport as the nice customer service girl told us....they took us to the the rental car center for the airport shuttles to take us to the airport.\n\nVerve felt like crooks, by  deceiving people with the use of the Economy name. Terrible way to start out. Do better.
