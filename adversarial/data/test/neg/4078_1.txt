I was sooo excited to try this place and was extremely happy when they had a easy way to order online (the only reason for one star). So after ordering online we go to pick up our two pizzas cheese bread and churro pizza. It was busy, hectic and the employees were extremely rude. I get it your busy and overwhelmed but you work in the hospitality industry. At least try to act like you like your job that you are getting paid for. They hand us one pizza and a bread and we asked where the gf pizza was, they got an attitude and said oh that was yours? (It wasn't even in the oven yet and shouldn't they a check order with each item ordered??). So after a 15 minute wait and a lot of passive aggressive rude interactions with the employees we got the pizza and left with out realizing we were still missing an item from our order. By the time we got our hangry children reminded us of the mistake. We called in and the \"manager\" told us they forget to put it in the oven..... a little more passive aggressive rude \"oh sweetie\"s thrown in and she said well you can come back and get it or we can add it to your next order.... like thanks.... for adding an item that we already paid for to our next order... \n\nSo we drove back out to pick up the rest of our order, they ended up giving us a free cheese bread.... but still left a bad taste in our mouth for the whole place. If the employees were nice from the beginning and tried to be accommodating for their mistake (I understand things happen but it's all in how you handle the situation) it wouldn't of been such an ordeal.
