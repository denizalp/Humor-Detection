Wish I could have stayed longer and lingered by the beautiful pool !  We had a great room which was very clean and cool.  Love the bartenders and the front desk people.  The staff was very friendly and there was a wedding going on while we were there, but they still took the time for us and treated us like a priority despite them being very busy.
