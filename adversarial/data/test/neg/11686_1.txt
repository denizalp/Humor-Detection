There are so many good things to say about Pick of the Litter Pet Sitting.\n\nAfter multiple horrible experiences with other sitters over a few years, I decided to give it one more shot with Pick of the Litter, and so glad I did. The owner, Lisa, is fantastic. She is so responsive and detailed. And our sitter, Monika - I truly cannot say enough good things about her.\n\nMonika watched our two mini dachshunds, one with a lot of medical and mobility issues. I always hated to leave my special needs girl, because she was so dependent on me, but with Monika, I was no longer as concerned. Monika followed my extensive directions and took amazing care of both of my dogs, but went above and beyond for my oldest. \n\nMonika did both sleep overs and mid-day stops for us. She was truly a lifesaver so many times.\n\nFor all of you who are weary of having someone in your home and\/or leaving your pets (even special needs pets) with someone, you will not be disappointed with Pick of the Litter.
