Ive been to hair color Xperts after a recommendation from my co-workers. I didn't end up with the same person they see as he was really busy and booked months in advance (eye roll) -so  I saw Julie. I definitely didn't mind getting her though because she has done an excellent job- my hair looks and feels fabulous when I get done and I would give the actual quality of the hair cut\/color 5 stars all around (and trust me I am a PICKY customer in terms of hair cut and color)\n\nThe salon itself is very clean (unlike my first salon experience in Charlotte) and they also offer you a complimentary beverage, so the experience is relaxing and nice all around.\n\nMaybe its because my mother owned a salon, or if I was use to the college discounts when I lived in NY, but for a cut and partial highlight $140 seems a tad bit on the pricey side. I am all for paying 80-100, especially since its a two hour process ...but I dont know that extra 40 just kind of irks me ( that busy stylist who I was told to go see originally only charges $100 apparently) \n\nAll in all Ive decided to leave hair color up to my own device during winter months since highlighting is the part I do not trust myself with- and so that's my attempt to save money. But rest assure I will book an appointment with Julie come summer!
