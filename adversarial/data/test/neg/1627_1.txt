Best Irish Sunday breakfast buffet in town...bit pricey (adult: $18) but so worth it, and one that certainly can lead one to sinful gluttony. The Irish sausage and the creamed salmon are the real deal. Polite, attentive and yet not intrusive service. Five stars were the dessert selections a bit more interesting (note to management, if they're reading: sherry trifle!). But truth be told, you'd have to be a trencherman or -woman of truly heroic appetite to feel the need for a closing course of sweet after a swoop on this buffet. Plan for a post-prandial hour or two to devote to reflection and digestion after a Sunday morning at Johnny Fox's.
