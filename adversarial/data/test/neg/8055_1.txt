I had a great experience today at Turn it up. First off, the selection and pricing of used LPs and CDs is phenomenal. They host some fairly rare discs that I enjoyed finding.  Second off,  I have never been treated better at a record store than here.  I was given a rundown of where everything was,  I was asked several times if I needed any help finding things and he kept the store open 15 minutes late  (unknownst to me) until I was done browsing. Those experiences are what make you feel valued as a customer and it was a pleasure shopping there today,
