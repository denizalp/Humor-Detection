My girlfriend and I love this place. The building is so old and seedy looking on the outside but honestly once you come in it's a super comfortable fun atmosphere. I have never had a problem playing in a game or playing doubles if all the pool tables are full and every other customer I've met is super friendly. The wings are the biggest around and it's not very close AND they're not breaded at all, I don't know where they get them from but they're big and delicious. It's either those or the fire burger every time I come in, because that comes with french fries and their french frys are A++ as well. Crystal, Casey, and Leslie are the sweetest bartenders in town and we always try to come in to see them once a week, and Ari is Tempe's ambassador to Europe so if you like to travel he's the one to talk to. If ever we go out, we end up back at Groggy's and it's always a great time.
