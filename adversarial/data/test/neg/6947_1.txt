Baker Wee is awesome. A couple years ago, my husband's one birthday wish was for a birthday cake. Simple enough, you'd think, but he was diabetic and it was a task to locate and choose a bakery that makes custom sugar-free cakes. I'm sure glad I found Baker Wee! The cake was good, but had that sugar-free taste (which was fine and kind of expected). I've returned a couple times and each cake has been just as good. The last time I picked up a cake, they asked me how much I was quoted when I placed the order. I wasn't quoted a price and told him so. He only charged me $25 for a cake that should have cost more according to their price list!
