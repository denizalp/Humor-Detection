This is one of the best places to eat. Vegan can be great, and Luna's knows how to make such great selections with local and regionally farmed foods. I can not recommend it any higher. It is the best. The staff is amazingly friendly and on top of their service game. Julianna is awesome, what a great culture and atmosphere.
