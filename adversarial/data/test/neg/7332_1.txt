Overall a good restaurant.  We have been here 3 times so far, each time with a good food experience. The first and last time we had good service as well.  You have to be prepared as this is a sports bar, but has a nice family feel. When there are a lot of games on it can get a little loud, but that should be expected!  I would recommend.
