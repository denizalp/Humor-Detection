Wow. Girlfriend and I ate here last night and it was a spectacular meal. Yasu serves Omakase (chef's choice\/tasting menu) only, and that's really for the best. Being left to do your own ordering would almost certainly result in a less exciting meal. The Omakase is $80pp and well worth it. 18 pieces of incredible sushi, generally in order from more mild (we started with scallop) all the way to stronger flavours like smoked bonito and BBQ eel, each with their own distinct flavours and textures. The chefs explain the type of fish and it's origin (lots from Japan, Boston, BC...clearly they source the best of the best). You just sit back and let them take you through the journey. On that note, try to reserve seats at the bar, not at a table. A huge part of the experience is watching the masterful preparation!\n\nService was excellent. The waiter helped me pick out a great sake to drink with my meal, but honestly I preferred drinking green tea before eating more sushi, as is does a better job of cleansing the palate and preparing you for the next piece. Before beginning service, the chefs ask if you have any allergies or aversions. I don't like uni, so the chef chose a replacement piece for me that was not even part of the meal, so that I had no repeats. At the end, before desert, you'll have an opportunity to order any additional pieces a la carte but we were absolutely stuffed!\n\nThis was an experience I will absolutely repeat.
