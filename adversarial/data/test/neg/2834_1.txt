I appreciate the reply but I asked about scheduling an appointment the first day I came in and was told by the staff, general x-rays are walk-in only. They even suggested coming in the morning or the middle of the day, when wait times are shorter. Sounds like your staff needs to be brought up to speed so they can relay better information on to customers\/patients.
