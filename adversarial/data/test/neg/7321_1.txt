I came here on the hunt for Cold Brew coffee cans (they were out), and was thrilled about their selection of gluten free beers and ciders.  I was impressed with their selection in the cooler and on the floor and the fact they said they can make any item on the menu gluten free.   I had their pumpkin cider (only available on draft), which was pretty good, and picked up some GF beers and ciders to take home.  \n\nI'll definitely be back to try the food.
