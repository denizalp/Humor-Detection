I'm going to go with a 4.5 star rating this time.  They did an excellent job refinishing a kitchen table and a mahogany night stand, as well as fixing a broken bedpost.  All the items came back looking like new, and I have no issues with the response time or quality of the work.  My only issue is that they were quite expensive, but I guess you get what you pay for, so all is well that ends well.
