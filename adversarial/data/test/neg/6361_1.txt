Truly and sincerely want this place to improve; it's got such potential! Love going here due to its convenience, atmosphere, and menu.  Staff is friendly.  But there are never enough servers, service is slow, crowd is often shady, and what could be a delicious menu is poorly executed.  Potentially excellent food often arrives cold.  I keep going to show support for this business that I want to see thrive, but always leave underwhelmed and frustrated.
