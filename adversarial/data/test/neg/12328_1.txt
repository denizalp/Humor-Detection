Two days ago I went to Crown nails with my best friend to get a regular French manicure and pedicure done. Within an hour of leaving the nail salon my nail polish started coming off. I called Crown nails to ask if I could have my nails re done in a day, since I had an event that evening to attend and I didn't have time to get them fix. the lady on the phone said yes and to go ahead and come in so my nails could be fixed ( I should have gotten her name ). \n\nToday when I came back the women who had done my nails was there. I let her know I called two days ago about my nails, my pedicure still looked great ( same nail polish used on my nails ) but my manicure had almost completely come off the first day they were done. To my surprise the women who did my nails was actually the owner. She told me it didn't matter, I got regular nails and not gel. Which I understand gel nails last longer then regular nails but that doesn't mean my nail polish should have came off the first day or hour I got them done. I asked her if she would honor what the her employee said on the phone about re doing my nails and she told me no. She continued to be quite rude to me and made me feel as if I was in the wrong for coming in. She then continued to speak over me to tell me I had to pay eight dollars for them to be re done. At this point I realized she didn't care about fixing my nails nor having a happy costumer... I was upset and said okay if I pay the eight dollar can I get a top coat of gel so they won't come off today and she said it will be twenty dollars to do that, so I said I'll just get them re done regular. \n \nOne of her employees sat me\nDown to take off the rest of my nails polish. lady was kind and I could tell she felt bad, she told me that her boss ( the owner ) would do the gel for me.  I said okay thank you, the owner came over and did my nails. She didn't speak to me then at the end she asked if I would like lotion on my hands, I said yes please. Then she continued to surprise me with her horrible attitude and told me to rub the lotion in myself. I went up to the front to give her the eight dollars and she told me it was twenty ( after I told her I wanted regular and her employee said she would do gel...) I left the store almost in tears.\n\nI wouldn't recommend going to Crown Nails due to the disrespect, lack and care in costumer service I experienced. If someone is going to pay to get there nails done it should be done right and if not, the situation should be made right. I will take my business elsewhere in the future.
