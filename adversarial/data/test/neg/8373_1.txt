This is my first time renting a car and it was awful. When we booked the car online it didn't say anything about an extra fee for being under the age of 25. That tacked on an additional $200!! The associate we had dealt with was a young man named Steve who was eating and spitting sun flower seeds while dealing with us. What kind of customer service is that? Steve should be fired, he tried to upsell so much BS to us, and then tried to make my GF pay for a bigger car because when you add a bag of clothes to a small car it kills the MPG (According to him). We finally get our paperwork and the attendant giving out cars, who was a very nice gentlemen said Steve forgot something on the paperwork. So we went back to Steve who said it wasn't his fault, then went back to the other gentlemen who had to actually call Steve and ask him what the heck he was doing. After all this we finally get a car. The only reason I didn't give a 1 star is because the car was clean and returning it was rather easy. Also, Steve should be fired.
