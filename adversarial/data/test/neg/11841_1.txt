We LOVE the rustic cafe. My husband and I come here on weekends for breakfast. We recommend the Farmers Breakfast (a little bit of everything), or the Breakfast Changa. It's HUGE and totally worth 9.99. I promise you won't be leaving hungry after that one. The pancakes are also HUGE and amazingly good. Eric is very kind and attentive.
