Consumer beware! This is a horrible firm to be dealing with in regards to vacation home rentals. They held my deposit hostage and upon writing this review its still being held hostage. They play ridiculous phone games and have you go through hoops on trying to actually speak to someone who can make a decision without immediately telling you about some company policy as if you were an employee granted an employees handbook you can refer to??? I would use another property rental company other than anything affiliated to National Equity Consultants. Buyer Beware.
