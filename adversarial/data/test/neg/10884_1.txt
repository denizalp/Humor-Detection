Rude hostesses, hairy food and extremely undercooked steaks. My second bad experience at a TGI Fridays. I ordered the Flat Iron steak and I've had it before, and it was severely overcooked twice in my first visit. But I gave them the benefit of the doubt and came back. BAD MISTAKE. \n\nFirst off, the last two times I have come, the hostesses have been extremely rude and\/or have ignored my existence. Once I got to the table, there was a brown sticky substance that I had to clean up myself. \n\nI ordered my food and it came with two sides. Okay, I asked for seasoned fries and if I could substitute my second side for a side salad. Apparently they can't do that so I had to add a salad to my meal for an extra $4. When the salad came out there was, of course, a nice hair mixed in with my dressing. How wonderful. \n\nBy the time our steaks came out, we could already tell they were undercooked. Our waiter agreed and took the steaks back. Once they came out again, ten minutes later, they were still extremely undercooked. \n\nThe only think good about this place is their Vanilla Bean Cheesecake.
