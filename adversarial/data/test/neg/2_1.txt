LOVE this place... with a very picky taiwanese palate.. this place is extremely authentic. I almost felt like I traveled to Taiwan for a moment with the dishes we got. \n\nIf you haven't tried this place, this is a must! We got the beef noodle soup (which I have to be honest was the least appetizing), we got stinky tofu, crispy intestine, spicy seafood pot, crispy salt and peper chicken (a MUST & made so well) and sausage fried rice. Everything was great. I am looking forward to coming here very often!!!
