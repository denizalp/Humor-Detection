We eat at Pita Jungle at least once a week and have for years.   Love the fresh veggies and Mediterranean flair.  We are always delighted when we get our favorite waiter Josh Berk.  He is truly interested in making your dining experience something special.  From beverages to your main course and even dessert.  We always ask what is new or have him suggest something he has concocted from the regular menu with special additions. We have never been disappointed. You can tell he truly enjoys what he does and is so professional and attentive. He is why we keep coming back aside from the great food.
