This place is definitely my favorite pizza joint in Madison. The Fig and Bacon is crazy good! They  also have a good beer selection and very reasonable prices. If the don't have seating you can eat next door at JPH as well.  \n\nProtip - Order one small pizza per person. You might have leftovers but they're just as good!
