If you're looking for the greatest sushi place ever... you may want to look somewhere else. If you're looking for a place to chow on decent sushi on a tab under $15, then you've found the right place. \n\nTeharu Sushi is a restaurant done in the classic Japanese style, where there's a conveyor belt running along the bar and most of the tables. Along the belt is a gamut of various sushi stylings. Nigiri (raw fish on rice) or rolls, gyoza (potstickers), edamame (soy beans), and other random fare (like pudding cups and Japanese soda) run their course through the restaurant, beckoning you to grab them. \n\nAnd that's what you do. See something you like? Grab it off the belt, and go to town. Each plate is color coded, denoting the price (anywhere from $1-$3). This allows you to have a large sampling of many different kinds of sushi, rather than dropping $6-12 on a single large roll of sushi most other restaurants force you to do.\n\nThe sushi isn't spectacular, and runs the course of familiar rather than out of the ordinary more often than not, but the fact that you can sample multiple varieties rather than committing to just one for the same price more than makes up for it. \n\nThey also sell 22oz. bombers of either Kirin or Sapporo for $4. All day. No happy hour special, $4 for a large beer. Amazing.\n\nFor the less adventurous, they actually have a decent sized, decent priced normal menu too. My wife ended up getting the salmon teriyaki one time when we came here and was very impressed.\n\nThe conveyor belt is a bit of a novelty, but after the dozen or so times I've gone, it still hasn't worn off. It literally saves this place from being a mediocre sushi bar to being a fantastic sushi bar. Being able to have so many different kinds of sushi and a beer for under $15 is the reason why I love this place so much. Definitely check it out, you'll be hooked.
