Local - check, Organic - check, Cool vibe - check, Close to home - check, they got it all for me.  This place is truly a hidden gem right in Desert Ridge.  I met the Owners when I was there really nice people putting out a good product.  Honestly, not one bad thing on the menu and yes the sweet potato tots are awesome!  They even have Organic Beers....heaven
