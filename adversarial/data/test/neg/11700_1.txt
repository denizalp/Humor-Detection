Just tried this place for the first time last night, and it was absolutely amazing! From the incredible ambience to the top notch customer service, the whole experience was a perfect 10. But of course the main story is the food- and it was a complete knockout. The sushi was beyond fresh, the appetizers were unique and fun, and between the 6 of us, not one person had a single complaint on any of the dishes- which is quite the feat. Don't be hesitant to try even if you aren't a fish person, the steak tacos and the kahlua pig were fantastic! This is definitely a must try in Chandler!
