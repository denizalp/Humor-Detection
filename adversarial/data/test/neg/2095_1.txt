We are fans of most Fox Restaurant Concepts, but not impressed with our experience here. We had a $50 gift card and decided to try it out after attending a Suns game yesterday afternoon. We started with a glass of wine and beer, and ordered the pretzel fondue. Beer was good, wine was just okay but I expect a better selection from this caliber of restaurant. The pretzels were terrible- hard and way over salted and the cheese had a strange texture, like it had been sitting out for a bit before making it to the table and candle barely lit and went out. We only ate about a third of the appetizer because we were starving. Hoping the entrees were better, we ordered the cheeseburger, which was extremely disappointing for us both. First, the burger barely contained cheese, and they were so tiny they were like the size of sliders in a giant bun. Also, the bottom bun contained some kind of house sauce that was not listed on the menu, and not knowing what it was, I tossed it aside. I took the top of the bun and cut it in half and easily fit my entire burger in it. Then we tasted the burgers and they were just terrible. It tasted like some kind of sauce was mixed into the meat, but we couldn't put our fingers on what it was. The fries were nothing special, and the side salad with champagne vinaigrette was okay- the best of what we ate. I am disappointed that given what we ate (or didn't eat) that we were not offered to remove at least meal. I can say that we will never return here again and very sorry we wasted a gift card here.
