An excellent place to visit for a look back.  Don't expect to spent all day there maybe an hour or two.  Free to enter and most games were $0.25 to $ 0.50 each to play.  Surprised how uncommon some were.  Some games were only the second time I've ever seen them in my life.  The first sometime in the 1970s.  Large selection of pinball small selection of 1980s video games, including a working 720 skateboard video game which I have not scene since 1989.  A working metal typer souvenir machine was such an added plus, had to make medallions for all my kids.
