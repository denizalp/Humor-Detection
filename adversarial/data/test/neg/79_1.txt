** Update **\nI ordered and paid for a 1 month Lean Pack and after a week I had to cancel the remainder of my order due to intestinal distress. The food was tasty and the raw veges heated right up to delicious crispness. Delivery was prompt and always friendly. I was more than pleased with my experience with Fit Prep Food Delivery Service. Yes communication could improve (why 4 stars)
