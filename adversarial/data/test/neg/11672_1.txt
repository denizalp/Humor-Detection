I came here for lunch and I thought this place was pretty disappointing.\n\nIt may be because I was part of a large group but it took a while to place our orders and get our food. The food itself was disappointing. I started with a salad and that was a normal salad. My entree was the salmon and that was pretty offputting. It was pretty flavorless and just felt really mushy.\n\nThere are definitely better places here, especially at this price point.
