The All-American Bar & Grille is where I'll usually go to eat at the Rio.  I'm a poker player and during the WSOP everyone I know prefers to go there as well.  Even when it's not WSOP time, however, I'll make the trek over there occasionally.  If you just want to drop in for a bite to eat, use the valet, otherwise you're going to walk across half the casino to get there.\n\nIt's a bit cramped and almost always busy inside, although you won't have to wait to be seated.  There's a bar and a number of tables out front, facing the table games, and at least half a dozen TVs tuned to various sports channels, not that you can hear any of them.  What I didn't know until the third or fourth time I was there was that there's actually a back part to the restaurant which is at least twice the size of the main part and has a totally different ambiance.  That area is much more suitable for large groups or just when they're busy.  A couple of TVs are in the back, but there are also water features, softer lighting, and a fake fireplace.\n\nAAB&G has standard \"American\" fare -- burgers, steaks, chicken, fries, and quite a few seafood dishes as well.  Service can be hit or miss, but it's generally good, and food tends to arrive in a reasonable amount of time.  \n\nI've had the chicken fingers, they are pretty good, although the chicken wings are far better, and I would normally prefer to eat chicken fingers rather than chicken wings anywhere else.  The wings are so well done, in fact, that I'll usually eat them without sauce which is also something I wouldn't do anywhere else.  Another appetizer which is really great is the prime rib & fried onion quesadilla.  It's really good and if you just got it and the chicken wings from the appetizers menu you could easily be satisfied with those two alone as a good meal.  The burgers are very good and quite large.  I usually get one with bacon and cheddar.  They are served with a mix of fries that include the normal fast food fries, waffle fries, and curly fries.  Sometimes they can oversalt these, however.  \n\nExpect to spend around $20 per person or so after a tip, maybe a tad more if you get an appetizer, but I can guarantee you that you won't say something like \"I could have just gone to McDonalds instead and spent $5\".
