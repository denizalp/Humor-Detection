Ramsey has a mobile service and did a phenomenal job and went even above and beyond what I expected.  He was very responsive, answered my first call to him.  He was able to squeeze me in the very next morning and was even flexible with his schedule to accommodate mine.\n\nMy car had damage on both the front and the back bumpers, along with the sides because of people hitting their car doors against my car.  He was able to get most of the scratches out of the sides of the car; covered up the plastic damage on my back bumper with matching paint to the car, and was able to restore the front bumper from scraping against a red curb.\n\nHe's amazing and well-priced.  Will definitely use him again if I need to.
