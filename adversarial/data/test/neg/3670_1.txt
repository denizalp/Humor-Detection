What I like about this place...the food is locally sourced and organic and the beer selection is plentiful. What I don't like.... the waiters seem a bit inexperienced and disorganized and the food can be bland. All in all it's definitely worth a visit (and likely several return trips) but if you're looking for a particularly flavorful meal this probably isn't your place.
