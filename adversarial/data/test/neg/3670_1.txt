Paul says he's semi-retired, so I almost hate to review him, but he really was fantastic.  He understood the quirks of my old house and made some really good recommendations.  I called him on a Friday after I closed on my new house and he was able to come Saturday to change the locks and install a new combination lock.  He's a got a great dry wit on top of being good at his job.  I was really happy with his work and his service.
