The last few times I've been to Vegas, I did not get to eat a crepe from Vegas. So I just had to stop here to fulfill my craving instead of any other crepe place. \n\nThe lines can be a bit long, but moves at a fast pace. The cooks are amazing, at the time I went there was only one person working it and he was whipping up crepes at a blur. The quality of these crepes are amazing, with the actually crepe a light egg flavor, and always flavorful, fresh ingredients you can see. Sweet or Savory it is hard to make up my mind. \n\nI went with the savory crepe Toulouse, which has sausage, mushroom and pepperoni in it, topped with marinara sauce. Delicious, and just hit the spot.
