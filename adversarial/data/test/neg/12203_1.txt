Had to travel a good distance to get to 'Right Toyota' for the right car, for the right price. I am glad we did because our Sales Rep Isaac Abdul...welcomed us the moment we arrived. We purchased one of Toyota's newest models Venza on the same day. Gave us a good trade in value for our car.\n\nIsaac went above and beyond to make sure we were satisfied and got a deal. They had awesome deals and added Military discount for Veteran status.\n\nI recommend Veterans to consider Right Toyota for your next vehicle they will work with you on Military discount. They were not pushy and patient with the millions of questions I had about the deal. I might just consider getting another car from 'Right Toyota' in the future.
