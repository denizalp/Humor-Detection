Got a flat on the turnpike. Pulled in here hoping for some help. Took 15 minutes to have someone come to the desk, when he did he said that they could help? But it would be a really long wait as only two guys were working. I feel for the two guys who were working so hard, but forget this place if you need timely service. And forget Defer Tire (behind Walmart) if you need ANY service.
