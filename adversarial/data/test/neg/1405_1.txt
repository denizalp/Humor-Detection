Although very out of the way for me, I happened to be in the neighborhood while going to see my hair stylist. I was a little bit early so I decided to grab a quick lunch. I saw the ratings and thought this was the place. The service was solid and the prices were pretty standard. It was on a weekend, so I did not see the super awesome lunch special deals that some raved about. I ordered my go to dish that allows me to best gauge a new place - drunken noodles with chicken. These were probably the best drunken noodles I've had out of countless places that I have already tried. The price was around $11 and we also shared the calamari appetizer which was delicious at the time, but pretty forgettable. I wouldn't drive across town for the calamari, but I would go for their drunken noodles every time I am in the area to get my hair done (once a month on average). I heard the waiter make curry recommendations to other patrons, so after I have had my fill of the drunken noodles, I may venture on to the curry.
