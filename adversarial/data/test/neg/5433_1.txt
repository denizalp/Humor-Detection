Visiting from Vancouver, where we have mostly Japanese ramen, this place is outstanding. Chinese flavors are very prominent in the dish, the pork belly in the dish was amazing. \n\nI asked for spicy, and the spiciness level was just outstanding, perfect in every way. The addition of peanuts in the bowl was nice. \n\nI highly recommend this place
