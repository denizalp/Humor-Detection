Worst Walmart ever.  Looking for a baby bathing suit and ask the congregating women in the fitting room if they have any. \" I don't know what they have over there!\"   I said \"Cool - thanks for the help\" and tried to find them again.  Asked another woman where they were and she said as she was pointing and walking away, \"they're over there\". I didn't find them so I opted for self check out.   Get me the HELL out of here now.  I asked the man at the register to speak to the manager.  He points and said \" she's down there.   She's got short hair!\"   I asked if he could get her for me and with an attitude he gets her.   The manager seemed like she could give a rats butt too as she approached me.   I told her I thought her the staff was some of the most lazy people I have ever dealt with and that I was glad I don't frequent this Walmart.  I also  said it was not appreciated and told her the story of my interactions. All she said was \"I apologize\". \nDon't go to this Walmart.  It sucks. Target is around the corner.
