Download the Assembly Hall Application for $5 credit to Bulldog Coffee at Assembly Hall.  I opted for the Rainbow Latte since it looks so pretty!  It came out to $6.05 (around that) and tasted pretty good.\n\nWhat I didn't like was the attitude of the cashier who was very rude when I tried to give her cash.  It was my first time there and I am more than happy to use a credit card but figured since it was $1.05 (after the credit) cash would just take care of it.  Instead I had to listen to a long rant or lecture on how she is \"cash-free\"--I hope the next time she goes in a rant she takes a look at our laws that in Canada you must accept every form of physical Canadian currency.  \n\nStuart, the owner was a complete 360--very friendly and nice.  If you happen to be on the lady's nice side your experience will be better.
