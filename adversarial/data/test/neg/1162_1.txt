I love French and French-inspired food, and found a great place to try a short walk down the street and across a river from my hotel.  I went up the stairs and was promptly seated by the window by a very friendly gentleman, who was also my waiter.  The place has a great, comfortable, casual, yet cool feel, with indie music playing in the background (my favorite!).  Looking outside, I saw that they also had al fresco seating, which also would have been great, since the temps were in the mid-20s C (mid-70s F).  \n\nI asked for a white wine recommendation, and was given a sample before committing (always nice!), and then asked the waiter for recommendations, as I saw 3 duck-related options that all looked awesome.  Since I wasn't tremendously hungry, he recommended the Foie Gras Poutine.  This wasn't your normal poutine. The fries are fried in duck fat, cheese curds are added, it's topped with duck gravy, and then foie gras is placed on the very top.  Every bite was so divine!  I am dreaming of eating this meal as I type.  So incredibly good!\n\nFor dessert, I selected the Rhubarb Crumble with Crème Fraîche from off the chalkboard. It was perfect - the rhubarb tasted very fresh, not too sweet, and the crumble crisp - the perfect way to end a meal.  Highly recommend!
