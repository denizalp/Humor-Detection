You can make an appointment but they won't show up! Made a 9am appointment. 9:00 passes, no one showed up, called and their response was \"oh I'm busy I'll be there at like 10 now.\" Said ill take my business else where. Don't want to show up on time to a schedule appointment I'm happy to give my money to someone else. I'd give 0 stars if I could. Customer service at your best!
