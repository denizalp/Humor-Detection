Quite pricey for a salad and long wait times. Friendly service. Food is pretty good.\n\nThey have delivery so I was excited to get healthy food delivered but they don't deliver to Yonge and Eglinton and the location at Yonge and Eglinton doesn't have enough staff working to deliver. What the heck?\n\nThis chain is frustrating. It's a good concept but if they're going to offer delivery they shouldn't half ass it.
