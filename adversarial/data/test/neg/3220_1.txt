This is a well run business and a very professional team doing nails.  I frequently visit for pedicures, and absolutely enjoy the entire experience.  I've never been disappointed.  Kevin the owner\/ manager, is all about customer satisfaction.  There are many spa's in town, and I have found that this is the only one that truly appreciates and values your business.
