i am shocked by any bad reviews of this place and i urge anyone who had a bad experience to give 'em another shot! i have seen this tiny place tucked on the side of Camelback for sometime but wasn't impressed with its exterior enough to venture in but boy, was i missing out! these pancakes will knock your socks off; every cake i've tried has taken me to taste -bud heaven. i'm usually not a fan of the richness in chocolate chip pancakes but for some reason The Original Pancake House makes them so divine, i typically order them... but it's not without a thoughtful internal argument since everything looks and tastes really flippin' good. \n\ni feel sorry for anyone letting the minor \"rules\" that they ask that you turn off your cell (AS COURTESY to your server and other patrons) and that they are a cash-only establishment get in the way of enjoying super tasty pancakes. but i'm glad some people keep away - it means more for me!
