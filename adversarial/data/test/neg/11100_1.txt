Four stars is for the food. Went for breakfast with my daughter. Corn beef hash, fresh made, not canned, was outstanding and delicious big biscuits. Eggs Benedict was also very good. Portions are HUGE, we took home enough for another whole meal. Service was a bit spotty, but the place was packed. We had four different servers tend to us and they seemed to be all over the place, like they're not working assigned sections.
