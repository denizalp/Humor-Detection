Agreed.  Customer service at this location is such a joke.  I don't understand how this place is still in business.  All the reviews of BBQ galore are horrible and everything is overpriced.  I am a avid grillmaster and I always want to give this place the benefit of the doubt, but everytime I come in, I walk away disappointed.\n\nChris, if you are the manager of this location...you might want to hire a more friendly staff.\n\nThis place is a joke!
