Let;s start a bit over a year ago I bring my Prius in to get my AC charged and I am told that it will cost 399 because there MAY be a leak and they have to inject dye..yadayadayada..I took the car back and had it charged by a local mechanic for 59.99\n\nYesterday , having purchased an extended warranty I brought my car in because the ABS light was on for about a week....I get a call asking about damage that car had and I do mention that 15 months earlier I had a high speed blowout.  I am told this voids the warranty and the cost for repair was 6800 and maybe I should call my insurer to report the \"accident\" of my blowout 15 months earlier....I pass and say I will just pick up my car....I am told then for the first time there is a $130 diagnostic fee....This was never disclosed when I checked the car in , I never signed any document mentioning this..it was what I have found over the years how Toyota treats their customers..............Of course I havent any choice because I need the car back .....To NOT disclose this when I brought the car in is awful customer service........ I bought 3 cars here and will never ever do business with them again.....How do you not disclose charges up front.....
