Short walk from Residence Inn.  What a cool little bar.  Walked in on a Tuesday night and they were full.  Was able to get a seat at the bar.  Nice draft list with lots of local Canadian beers.  Tuesday night's are also buck a shuck - lucky me.  One nice treat was the fresh horse radish to top they oysters.  Ordered the burger and it was loaded with goodies including a homemade onion ring.  \n\nThe guy behind the bar was by himself and having a hard time keeping up.  Not sure why a bar that full would do that.  Bathroom was also a little less than desirable.
