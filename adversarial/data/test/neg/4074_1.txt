A group of coworkers and I decided to try a new place for lunch today. We had tried another Italian place nearby several times, and while it was good, it wasn't great. \n\nI used Yelp to check out a few other places in the neighbourhood and Cinquelire came up. The reviews seemed decent so we gave it a shot. First off, the place is nicely appointed and has a small patio out front. Perfect for a beautiful sunny day.\n\nThe service was friendly but a bit spotty. We put in our orders and after a while food started to trickle out. First one dish, then another, then two more. I had ordered the lunch special pasta dish, Pici. After a few minutes of nothing else arriving, we asked our server who informed me that the pasta I had ordered takes a little longer to cook. It seems odd that they wouldn't time all of the meals to come out at the same time. It was 13 minutes after the first dishes came out that my pasta was finally ready. While waiting, another employee approached (possibly the manager) to tell me once again that the pasta I ordered takes extra time to cook. It was clear that they had simply missed placing my food order. When the pasta finally arrived there was nothing in it that would suggest it would take an extra amount of time to cook. Also, we never heard from the manager again during our visit to apologize for the delay or any such thing.\n\nWhile we ate, the table beside us received all of their meals and then the server left the area. The patrons at that table had to call the server back to ask for napkins and cutlery. Another example of the spotty service.\n\nHowever, all of the waiting and excuses aside, the food was delicious! During the wait I had mentally decided not to return, but after our delicious lunch we are definitely going to give it a second chance.\n\nWith a few tweaks to the service and some higher standards, this place would have received a 5 star rating. Let's hope next time it does. The food deserves 5 stars.
