I just might be a little bit parshall to the willow house. I hung out there when i was in high school and even after 8 years i still love it. The atmoshere and makes up for where its lacking in taste. If you are looking for somewhere to go just hang out and people watch, this is your place. \nGo get your drink, listen to the live music and look at the local art work displayed. If you want amazing coffee, i'd pass.
