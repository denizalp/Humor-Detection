This location needs some work with their so called CUSTARD.. i never had a custard where it took only a couple of minutes for it to melt..eating the same custard from the Eastern\/Silverado Ranch Location it defintely is a big difference. This experience was still great as their food is still awesome but the custard was a big dissapointment it was not thick creamy and it melted real fast. i couldve spent $1 at mcdonalds and got a better quality ice cream. So much for my perspective on reviewing fast food chains for now it is necessary. Please get your custard back on track Freddys Thanks. (i hope i get a reply from the manager saying it was real custard because if it really is they need to check the difference from their other location)
