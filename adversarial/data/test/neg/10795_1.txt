We really enjoyed the selection the MGM buffet offered.  My husband and I like to eat different things, so buffets work out well for us.  We both really liked the steak with peppercorn sauce (one of the best peppercorn sauces I have ever had) and the pot roast with cilantro (amazing and I'm still trying to figure out the recipe).  My husband enjoyed the seafood and I loved the salad bar, although they should add an non creamy dressing option like Italian or oil and vinegar.  The deserts were fantastic and small so you could sample several without feeling overly stuffed.  We can't wait to return the next time we are in Vegas.
