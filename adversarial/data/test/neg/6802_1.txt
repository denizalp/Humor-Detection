Finally got the chance to stop here for brunch and I was pretty pumped I did.\nThey have a variety of bloody mary's using different flavored liquors for a start. Pepper Whiskey Bloody, sure. Cucumber Vodka Bloody, yea! Habanero Tequila Bloody? If it's hard to comprehend how that would taste, get it because it's bloody amazing. (I hate myself for that)\n\nI had their Chilaquiles and it was amazing as it looks and LOADED with flavor. I was starving so my picture is a butchered version of how it was served but KAYA is spot on for brunch. It is a wee bit on the expensive side for Pittsburgh(really not expensive), but they have great service and the portions are more than adequate (you'll be stuffed). Not to mention the location is pretty nice. I'll certainly return to try everything else on the menu at some point.
