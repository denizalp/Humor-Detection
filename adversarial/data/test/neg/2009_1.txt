Worst service! Last few times I've been here, the service has been terrible, but since the next closest Demetres has been closed. I've brushed off the bad service since the dessert has always been great, but this time my boyfriend and I gave them 20 minutes to even bring us a water or come get our order, before we got fed up and left.
