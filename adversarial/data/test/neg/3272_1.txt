Just what we were looking for!  Our youngest is attending ASU on the Polytechnic Campus.  We were visiting for family weekend and he wanted Asian.  I searched Yelp and this restaurant was close with good reviews.  The food was just as advertised: quick, tasty, moderately priced.  Even the lunch menu included a spring roll and soup - there was even a small lettuce salad.  My son is ready to go again now that he knows how easy it is to get to from campus and how good the food is!  And, the service was great too!
