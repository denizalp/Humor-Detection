Aunt Abby's is a welcome addition to the Scottsdale dessert scene.  Even though it is small and has a limited menu of various sorts of cookies, I would still come here enough times to taste them all - or at least most of them.  They are both macarons and macaroons, a variety of Mexican wedding cookie, fruit filled shortbread (they go to the trouble of making their own lemon curd), and standards like chocolate chip.  At $2 for one cookie, Aunt Abby's is not cheap but that just helps you not to over-indulge.  Try it!
