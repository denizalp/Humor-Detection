I live fairly close to this place.  Finally decided to try it out so the wife and I went there on Saturday night.  The decor is awesome, wife and I agree we want our house to look like this!\n\nThe menu is decent, nice mix of appetizers and sandwiches and entrees.  We had a beet and apple pizza which was ok, not great and not bad.\n\nI had the club sandwich on the recommendation of the server and it was pretty good.  Wife had a brie and ham sandwich (i think that is what was in it) and she said it was also good.  \n\nThere were a lot of families with young kids in there dining which was great, but the place was half empty on a Saturday at 7 pm.   I hope it was an anamoly and that it stays busy.  It is nice to have this place in the neighborhood and i hope it is around for many years to come.  Also, Lagunitas IPA on tap which is nice!
