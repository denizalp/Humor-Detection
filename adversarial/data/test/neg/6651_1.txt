Visiting Vegas from Palm Springs CA. We have always wanted to eat here! No wait on a Friday law afternoon. We were sat quickly. 2 adults and 4 kids. They do not have a kids menu, so they got sides of mac and cheese with fries. The fries were seasoned amazingly. We also got the trash can nachos and song Whiskey wings. They were both great! Portion sizes are Big! Great to share! We always got a \"go big\" drink. Panoe cattle is what the cocktail was called... AMAZING!!! Just thinking about it I want another one! \nTo top it all off the server asked if you could get a desert for the kiddies, which was so kind of him! All the staff was nice, helpful, and on their A game! \nOkay, I know I said the desert was for the kids.. OMG! The best I've had anywhere! He gave them a mint chocolate ice cream pie! I'm guilty of sharing it with the kids, I couldn't resist! This is a great place to come!!!
