I just signed up for service this morning based on the reviews that everyone put out there, so first I thank everyone for their input.  I was a little hesitant when I did not see any pricing, but it really only took about 5 min to make a phone call and learn all I needed to know.  I have been in contact with them twice this morning and had the pleasure of speaking with Alina - she is a sweetheart.  I am excited about starting new service with them and saying SO LONG to Cox and all of their garbage.  No throttling, no maximum usage or over limit charges is going to be sweet.
