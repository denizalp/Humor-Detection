This is my new favorite quick bite joint and it certainly beats fast food! It's much different than any pita place I've been to before.. It's Subway style but with pitas.. So you can choose what goes in your pita as you move down the line. There's plenty of options so if you're a returning customer like me it doesn't get old. Its made to order so always fresh. They frequently have coupons in the mail offers, so check it out and give them a try!! You won't regret it.
