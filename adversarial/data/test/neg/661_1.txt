Pita Jungle is home to some of the tastiest hummus that has ever passed through my lips! The original version is delicious but the cilantro jalapeño? Out of this world!! It's especially good with the homemade pita chips they serve. \n\nTalk about tantalizing the taste buds!\n\nI'm also a big fan of their falafel and that amazing four cheese quesadilla which they make with lavosh bread. Really, really yummy!\n\nMy absolute fave though is the Mahi Mahi. It's always cooked & seasoned to perfection and pairing it with the cilantro jalapeño hummus & pita chips is a combo that can't be beat!
