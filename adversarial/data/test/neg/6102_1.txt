I get a craving for the 49er flapjacks every 3 years or so  and I took the family for brunch today.  We went early to avoid the wait but ended up hanging out for 15 minutes anyway.  I don't, as a rule, wait but I really wanted those flapjacks!\n\nWe were taken to our table by a hostess who almost didn't seat us because my brother was in the restroom.  I had to tell her where he was...kinda ridiculous.  \n\nWe were famished and ordered coffee, pancakes, corned beef hash, eggs, and a few other goodies.  Our water and coffee were never less than half-full, our waitress was reall nice, and we walked out with leftovers.\n\nSo I struggle with rating this place.  The service was good once we were seated.  The flapjacks are really good.  The coffee was too.  They take credit cards now, which is a plus.\n\n The hash was dry and grainy and we took it home JUST because it was 5.95.  The eggs and hash browns weren't wonderful either .\n\nAll in all, it wasn't a horrible experience but I have an aversion to traveling, waiting, and explaining where one of our party is just to have food that is average.\n\nSee you in 3 years UNLESS I learn how to make them myself.
