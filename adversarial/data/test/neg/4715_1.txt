I had a really good experience here. Although it has taken a while due to them going back & forth with the insurance company, they kept me in the loop and were quick to get back to me whenever I reached out to them. Today I spoke with Lizette and she was amazing. She worked to help me and did what she said she was going to do. I appreciate her awesome customer service skills and all that she did! I would recommend this law group, especially cause of her!
