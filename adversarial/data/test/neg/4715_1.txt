I am a big, big fan of H&H! I don't recognize half of the ingredients on their cocktail menu, but anything I've ordered has been fantastic.  I love the vibe here as well...dark, but very modern and minimalist even though the drinks are totally old-fashioned, craft cocktail kind of concoctions.\n\nI like this place enough to go way out of my way to stop here even though there is a similar place in my neighborhood, so 5 stars it is!
