There are not many places in the valley that offer the authentic tastes this place does. It's just a convenient store with a deli counter. Although...behind that counter they make great tasting subs. Their Italian Sub tastes exactly like the Subs we would get at our favorite deli in New York City. They deliver most of the time but if you have to drive it's worth every mile. I highly recommend this place.
