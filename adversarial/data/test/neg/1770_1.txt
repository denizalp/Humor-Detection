Coffee Fans beware...bring your own K-cups or SB Via packets.\nKeurig machine is in the room, but the K-cups are in the mini-bar at $9 each.\n\nSmoky casino down below. The escalator-going down (by Burger King) was closed for repairs and it was a hassle.\n\nBUT the comfy beds, \"Hash House a Go Go\", and the pool made this place a memorable spot!
