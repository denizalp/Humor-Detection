Wonderful new find! My family of four were all happy with our meals; including my husband who ordered his meal with a side of biscuits and gravy (and he is very picky with these!). The diner style setting was cute and the outdoor seating area was quaint in a sophisticated way. We received great service and my husband enjoyed that he could watch the football game this morning without it being an overbearing portion of our breakfast.
