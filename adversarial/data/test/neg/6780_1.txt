I cannot say enough great things about the Blowdry dollhouse! I absolutely love my hair after Dominique finished it! My hair is full and has curls that last!! Not only that, but I loved getting to spend time with her! She was such a pleasure to talk to and made me feel like family! I also got the honor of meeting the owner Lotoya!! What an amazing, spirited women!! I can see why Blowdry Dollhouse is taking off! She believes in everything she puts into this place!! EVERYTIME I am in Vegas I will be coming here!
