I'm a huge fan of LGO. The food is fabulous and the grocery is so eccentric with awesome finds. Parking is a bit difficult, but during prime time they have free valet. Their tea is delicious, and you can't go wrong with any pastry or dessert. I love their English muffins and recommend the commuter. There are great vegetarian options on the menu as well.
