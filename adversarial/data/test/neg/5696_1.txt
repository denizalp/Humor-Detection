This restaurant has been a staple in our family! I've been coming here since i was about 6 years old. Heck my cousin ended up marrying their lovely daughter. The restaurant has then been sold to someone else and has moved into the plaza since. The food is still as good and the service the same. I recognized the original waiters that are still working here. The won ton soup, cantonese chow mein and stuffed tofu are mainly the three dishes i would order every time i come here.  Reasonable prices and fast service. Give if a try if you're craving Chinese food tonight
