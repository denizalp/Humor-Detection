We just signed up for bug spraying service with Bulwark after moving here a few months ago.  Ben Sykora was out for our first service and he was so polite and helpful.  His professionalism and expertise were great.  We look forward to more great service from Bulwark and from this first experience, I will recommend them to our neighbors and friends.  Hey Ben - Go Cubs!
