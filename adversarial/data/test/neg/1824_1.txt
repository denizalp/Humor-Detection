Surprised at the poor reviews on here :\/ I only have one meal to use as an example but it was very good! I was the only person there at 5:30 in the morning getting some breakfast, the potatoes and steak were both two of the best I've ever had. Under 13 bucks, and you get a coupon for 15% off when you stay at the Riviera. The hostess say me immediately, food vane in under 10 mins, and check came as soon as I asked for it, no complaints here!
