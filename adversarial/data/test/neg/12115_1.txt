There aren't many times in my life I have to send an entree back, but this is one. Bland. Alfredo. Sauce. My worst enemy. I get the same crap back with a discussion that back of house has altered the dish to my taste. Note to the GM. Don't lie to the guest, when they know bland food when they taste it. I gave you leave to amend your defect and I get a defensive GM. Sorry shouldn't ever be in your vocabulary. Fix it. Say you were wrong, and fix the damn dish. You had one chance, and blew a second. I gave my leftovers to a homeless person, and he thought it  was crap also.
