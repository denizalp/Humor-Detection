Ever had food that's just bad for you, but you keep coming back for more because it's so delicious? Say hello to Chino Bandido - I entirely lacked faith when I first heard about the Asian-Mexican fusion. Jade Red Chicken inside of a cheese quesadilla? I came to a rational conclusion that these foods shouldn't be mixed together, which I partially blame for my extended delay of eating here.\n\nThe truth is that Jade Red Chicken was meant to be eaten inside of a cheese quesadilla. Or even a burrito. You can come up with endless combinations here. You choose the meat, then decide whether to get it wrapped in a burrito, placed inside a quesadilla, or just have it straight up by itself. Your entree comes with a side of rice, beans and the infamous Snicker doodle cookie. Don't forget about the Snicker doodle cookie.
