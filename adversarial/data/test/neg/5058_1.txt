Recommended by a friend, went there and were delighted to find it was Taco Monday meaning  reasonable prices! The wife and I each tried 3 tacos and they were mostly great. The crunchy fish taco had one of the best flour tortillas I've had - very thin and crunchy, not soft and chewy like many flour tortillas (which can be great as well.) The interior was really cute and fun, and the agua frescos wasn't overly sweetened. The music was a bit loud for lunchtime, but at least the song selection was good!
