If you have a thing for Italian and Mediterranean then this is your place! Come hungry, this place oozes freshness in all that they offer from the Fresh Baked Focaccia with Pesto to their flatbreads and pasta options.\n\nAmbiance: Hip trendy vibes. Service staff is extremely helpful and nice. If it's not too hot, sit outside on the patio it's a beautiful view.\n\nRecommendations: Bruchetta (Mushroom and Roasted Garlic- Finger Licking good, I mean it!) and Prosciutto and Fig, Molte Bene! Pesto Chicken Flatbread is packed with flavor and not too heavy. Pasta: You must get the Wild Mushroom Pappardelle- It's amazing, it has truffle, herbs and Parmesan cheese (sorry folks it has no meat, but a well done dish) highly recommend it. It's pack with flavor, and if you are a truffle fan this is a must.\n\nI can't go back soon enough! Make a trip to Camelback Rd to check this place out!
