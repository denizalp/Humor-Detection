This was my first time getting a wax and it was a good experience. I would definitely recommend Sugar Me Wax to others. Lexis did a great job of making me comfortable and explaining things very clearly. I didn't give it five stars just because I didn't know where to \"check in\" once I got there so I was a little confused. It turns out you just sit in the seating area and they come find you!
