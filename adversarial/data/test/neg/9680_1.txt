We love direct buy pricing. For lower prices direct buy is the way to go.  The ordering process is tediousand confusing.  Every time we have gone we always need to find an associate when we are ready to order. The associates friendliness varies depending on who you get.  Today we worked with dave and he was friendly and very helpful.  We would definitely work with him again.
