Cheap wine.  Booya!  I came from WA where it was dubbed 3-buck Chuck and was actually $3.99 but here, it is actually $2.99!!  Yessssss, solid win for Wisconsin here.\n\nI do have to say, I have to mentally prepare myself for parking.  You can either pay for the small lot right by TJ's or fight out a spot in the lot below where every turn makes your wheels squeal and the spots are for cars you could probably throw because they are so small.\n\nAfter you make it through parking, usually you have to fight the mob of people.  This location is small.  I kind of enjoy my grocery shopping experience and take in what the store has to offer but everyone here is bustling and I feel like I am always in someone's way.  \n\nBut...it's Trader Joes.  They have some fun food.  Their juices are awesome.  Beer selection is pretty legit.  Produce is on par.  I love their chocolate covered coffee beans.  Yeah, I walk through and do find great items to snack on but they also have great options for actual meals.\n\nI have never had an issue with the staff.  I have also never really asked them any questions or needed help.
