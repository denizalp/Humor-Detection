In my limited experience with this location, it's been all aces.\n\nStaff is friendly (you'll notice I'm big on that, as you should be) and helpful when asked questions.\n\nI laughed when Loblaws started making clothes. Never gonna' last I thought. It appears I was mistaken. \n\nThese clothes are actually good quality swag. Ok, nobody will mistake any of it for Harry Rosen, but the t-shirts are a good cut, nice finish and clean in their design, and seem like they'll last. I've bought several scarfs and a toque off them and they're also good quality and cheap in price. I normally buy only Levi's or Calvin Klein pants, but the salvage denim here looked decent and I'd heard good things about it. \n\nThere's a reason stores like this and Uniqlo do so well, simple clothes and at good prices. \n\nBasics are back, baby!!
