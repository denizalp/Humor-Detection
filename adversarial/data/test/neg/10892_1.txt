I usually like Applebee's but this particular one is the worst around, by far.  Drive to Avon or Rocky River.  Tried it for the first time in 2 years last night and had a terrible meal of the house sirloin.  The first one was way over cooked.  The next one was a bad cut of meat and didn't even have the regular marinated flavor.  The steamed vegetables were undercooked, cold and totally without any seasoning or flavor.  The mashed potatoes were awful.  Cold and runny with big lumps and totally tasteless.  How could they screw up such a basic popular entree?  No wonder it was nearly empty.  The server was actually pretty good but the food was awful.
