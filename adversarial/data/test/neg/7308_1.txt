Came in for lunch today because honestly we were too hungover to venture out of the hotel. The food portions were quite large. But the service was TERRIBLE. And it wasn't a busy time either. We saw our server three times total. To order our food, bringing us our food, and then the checks. Which even after asking for the check we waited ten minutes to get that. The food was mediocre. At least the spaghetti and meatballs were. My friends panini was delicious though. Our waters were always empty. Only got one refill (when he brought our food). If the service wasn't so bad the whole situation may have been different. Wouldn't go back again.
