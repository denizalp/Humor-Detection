This is a fun and casual place, but certainly not a place to go work on your game.  The balls will not fly correctly (lacks yardage) and the AstroTurf will have you practicing ill advised shots.  However, it is a casual atmosphere with food and beverages and an opportunity to shoot the sh!t with your buds.  The wait time on the weekend (Spring Training?) were over an hour so be sure plan ahead.
