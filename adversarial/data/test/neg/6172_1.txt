Just landed, arrived at the hotel famished this was our first meal on the trip. \n\nAfter walking around I wasn't in the mood to sit and be waited on in a restaurant, I didn't want greasy old flat pizza nor a hot dog located next door. \n\nAfter reading the menu on the wall this place sounded like it would do. I ordered the turkey toasted on wheat slice bread with cheese and all the standard samage produce, w\/o mayo. The order taker told the sandwich maker the order. I watched as he was assembling the sandwich and saw him put a huge heeping blob of mayo on the bread. I went back and told the order taker that I asked for no mayo. He turned around and told the guy making the sandwich. The guy making the sandwich got a little of an attitude with the order taker, threw the sandwich away and started a new one. I feel bad to see food wasted. \n\nAfter a few minutes the sandwich went through the toaster and was dressed with the produce, wrapped up and given to me. I took our sandwiches and drinks to the other counter to pay. \n\nPrice was close to $27. For two sandwiches and two teas. $9.25 each sandwich and $2.95 per each bottle of tea. Way over price for a small sandwich with no side. \n\nSorry no pics on this one I was so hungry I forgot to pull the camera out before devouring it. In the end it was good and hit the spot but over priced.
