Accurate Lien continues to send inaccurate preliminary lien notices even after being advised that the ownership information they show is incorrect and this is not our property. We were told that they get their information from the County Assessor, and were instructed to check that info, which we did, and sent them the parcel maps showing the correct ownership, to their 'Quality Control' fax. This shouldn't be our responsibility since we have no connection to the project on the notice. We received another incorrect notice after they had ample time to correct it.
