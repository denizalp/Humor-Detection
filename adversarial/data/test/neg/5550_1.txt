We looked for something different to do in Vegas for an afternoon.  With all the cooking shows on television, this one was intriguing.  Located in a strip mall with many empty spots, they are in the process of moving, you need to overlook the area and enter into Sonya's world.  She has such personality that if she were to teach you to tie your shoe, it would be a fun thing to do.  \n\nMy sister and I had no experience with piping or cake decorating, but we made several really nice cupcakes that I would be proud to show off, they are on the facebook page, and I think I could replicate them.  So, it was loads of fun, a great way to spend an afternoon, and we both learned how to pipe and brought home some really cool cupcakes to show off.  We'll do it again with another of her classes to learn some more techniques.
