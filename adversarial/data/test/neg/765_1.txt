I lived near the Bay Area for 20+ years. I have had better and cheaper chinese food than this place. that being said, the noodles here are big portions, but overpriced.\nI had the won-ton soup (not very good) and the Ta Lu noodles (ok).\nI don't think I would ever go back here for chinese food unless i was desperate
