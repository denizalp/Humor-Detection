First off, I'm EXTREMELY picky when it comes to car washing. I tend to spend hours washing my own car. However, when weather or time is not permitting this is my go to place. Everything here is all hand wash! An exterior wash is $10 or $12.50 if you want the carpets vacuumed as well (they'll also hose down your mats if they are rubber\/plastic). \n\nAt first, this place may seem a bit intimidating because of its location and look. You pull into a narrow drive way where you can get the interior vacuumed or immediately turn into the rinsing area. Someone will hose down your car with a pressure washer and pre-soak your wheels with a cleaner (I don't know what these guys use, but it seems to clean better than my $16 bottle cleaners!). Once rinsed, you pull inside for a wash. Two guys wash the car with warm soapy water. They work quickly and are pretty good with attention to detail. Once the car has been cleaned, it goes through a gentle rinse. You'd then pull the car out for drying. Typically 3 or 4 guys would dry the car with towels. There's a pretty cool vintage towel dryer\/ringer that they use. They can also clean the inside glass but you may see over spray on your seats or dash. This all takes about 15-20 minutes and you'll come out with a rather clean car without the harmful damages of a machine car wash!
