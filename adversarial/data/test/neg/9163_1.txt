I had the tonkatsu ramen w extra chasu pork. It was wonderful. Presentation was simple and clean. The flavor of the broth was clearly natural...no unnecessary doctoring. The portion size is perfect. The menu is also very simple. The basic broths and the basic add-ons. Who needs any more? Try this place...I'm sure you'll love it.
