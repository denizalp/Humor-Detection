I contacted a woman named Na (Nga Diep) off of a MLS listing for a property. Upon reaching her, after several attempts, she was rude and short with me when I inquired about viewing the property. She told me that she couldn't show me the property because it was the New Year and that she would call me back after the Holiday to see the property. Surprise, no call back. When I contacted her again to see the property it was already off the market, surprisingly since she couldn't be bothered to show it. I am severely disgusted as the property was perfect for us. I will never use this company and strongly urge anyone dealing with them to avoid Na (Nga Diep).
