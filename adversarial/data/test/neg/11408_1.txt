Where to begin... My girlfriend and I absolutely LOVE this place. We visit up twice a week whenever possible. \n\nStaff: They're awesome! We're regulars and T always treats us like family. He remembers what we drink and what we eat. In the event we stray away from our norm, his recommendations are always on point and in line with what we're into! \n\nFood: If you're into Thai, Chada takes the crown. Comparing it to other spots locally like Lotus and Natayas, Chada is above and beyond. Better tasting \/ quality food and nearly unbeatable prices. Their somewhat traditional Thai menu can please just about anyone. I recommend the Spicy Mushroom \/ Lemongrass soup (pronounced Tom Kah?), Drunken Noodles, and the Mango Sticky Rice (If it's available). \n\nDrinks: An awesome wine list, by the bottle or by the glass. My girl loves the Banshee Pinot by the glass! Beer list is small but has my favorite beer of all time. Very good Thai Tea as well.\n\nOverall Ambiance: Sort of a hidden gem in a busy strip mall! Interior is classy and clam. It is small and intimate. Clean and welcoming! \n\nThank you Chada! You guys rock.
