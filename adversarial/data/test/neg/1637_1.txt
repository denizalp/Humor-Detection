We've been going to Jade Palace for several years now. The service is amazing, the food never disappoints us no matter what we order and the prices are reasonable. The waiters are very accommodating and very friendly. We've never had a bad experience at Jade Palace. My favorite is the crispy orange beef over brown rice with a glass of Pinot Grigio, of course! Don't do anything different, Jade Palace! You're doing everything just fine!
