Brunch wasn't very good. Portion was okay. Home fries are frozen deep fried kind. Eggs over cooked. The bacon tasted like the grease was off. Only got one sausage. Not worth the price of eggs and carbs. No breakfast meats other than pork.\nThey advertise brunch on the door but only have a small corner of the menu with maybe 6-7 items.\nService was good, and I've had a good dinner here before. Really disappointed.\n Wouldn't come again for brunch, would not recommend it.
