I had dinner here on my recent trip to Las Vegas and enjoyed it quite a bit. The atmosphere was terrific, a nice quiet sanctuary inside of a noisy, smoky casino. The restaurant has TV's all around the the room that display a slide show of Vegas throughout the early years through current day that was very fun to watch. We were dining with my wife's uncle who is a 30 year resident and he enjoyed it quite a bit. The old photos helped him to recall a lot of memories and share some great stories.\nI started with a Caesar salad which was nicely done, good flavor and the perfect amount of dressing.\nFor my entree I ordered the 10 ounce wagyu rib steak which was delicious. It was my first time trying wagyu and I found it to be very tasty. It had a wonderful sear, but was cooked a little closer to rare than the medium rare I ordered. For sides we shared steak fries which were sort of blah, creamed corn with bacon which was absolutely amazing and lobster Mac n cheese which was great but lacked a little in lobster in my opinion. While the sides were pretty good, they were very small, much smaller than you would get in a typical steakhouse.\nFor dessert they brought out a piece of cheesecake that we all shared. It was very nice and the presentation was wonderful too.\nOverall it was a good experience for the price you paid to dine here. If you present your players card you get a discount off the prices so keep that in mind if you're staying at any of the Harrah's properties.
