If I could give it 4.5 I would, but closer to 4 than 5 stars. First, the positives (and there were many): 1) Lobster bisque had more lobster meat than any bisque I've had in recent years, 2) both my wife's and my steak were perfectly cooked, 3) sauce on broccoli was very tasty, 4) server (I think it was Eric) was very attentive and his positive demeanor could do nothing but rub off on you, 5) garlic mashed potatoes were solid, 6) wine list-while limited, was inexpensive. Now the minuses: 1) refills on water were slow, 2) broccoli side was mushy, 3) chocolate mousse dessert had 2 of 3 great tastes, unfortunately the mousse itself was lacking (whipped cream and cake portion of dessert were phenomenal).  Would I go back - without a doubt. A definate hidden gem......
