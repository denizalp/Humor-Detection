Terrible service! Do not recommend! I have purchased a group deal with them and my appointment got reschedule quite often sometime after 1 month a delay for a laser treatment. \nNot only this but once i got upset about this situation they came up with a story (after 6 IPL treatments) that the group deal have not paid them and that they will not be giving me any more service. Can you believe this, cause i cannot!
