This is my go to bubble tea place now. I've tried Presotea, Chatime, and Tea Shop, but none of them are as good as Coco's. They always give a ton of tapioca or grass jelly\/pudding(depending on what I get) and it always tastes like it should. The service is quick and if you don't know how to order, they'll give you a hand. The prices are like all the other bbtea places, but it's definitely more worth it in my opinion!
