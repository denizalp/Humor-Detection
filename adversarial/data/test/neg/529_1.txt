Absolutely amazing! The staff is so kind and helpful...had our daughters 6th bday here. You can pick from dozens of paintings to paint. Staff is very attentive. Best part - you can bring your own food, wine and drink (saves you tons of $$$)...small place near colonnade movie theater...first class place all the way! Highly recommend for birthdays or even team\/builds, date night.
