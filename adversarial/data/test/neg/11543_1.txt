We got into Vegas pretty late and hadn't eaten all day. We decided to have a quick bite to eat due to their late night menu. The line was long, but we got seated rather quickly. We ordered the Truffled Potato Chips and Roasted Chicken BBQ Pizza. Both of them are very flavorful; you could taste each ingredient. They were great! We also had a really friendly waiter, his name was Raymond. I didn't know what to expect, but now I know if we're hungry while staying at MGM, we're coming back here!
