I bought all new furniture and found out the furniture delivery place can not take my old furniture (a full sized sofa, a love seat and a chair with an ottoman) which my cats have destroyed by spraying on them from shock of the move. Metro Hauling took them away for a good price. They showed up bright and early between 7 and 8 AM in the rain and on time. They were very nice with a great upbeat attitude. I will definitely will be choosing them again for our next round of items that need to be removed.
