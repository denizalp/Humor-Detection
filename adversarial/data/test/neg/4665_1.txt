You get what you pay for. My husband and I stayed here over the forth of July weekend. Three days total. It's a dated hotel. It needs renovations and a better cleaning crew. Our room was 80% clean. Not too bad but what I did see dirty was gross. Pubic hair and hair in general on the bathroom floor and no tub. Which might be a good think considering they don't do a great job cleaning. Overall it's a lowbrow hotel with lowbrow clientele. The parking facilities are atrocious. Be cautious and remember you get what you pay for!
