Went here for the first time during restaurant week.  I saw the menu and I was sold on the pork belly.  I just love pork belly dishes.  My friend and I both got the sangria which we both agreed were pretty good and refreshing.  The bread basket from breadworks was a great way to start.  I loved the one with the cheese inside.  I commend the restaurant for going against just serving plain bread and giving a variety and a good one at that.  It adds to their thoughtfulness and for the atmosphere of the place, I can tell that matters.  Speaking of atmosphere, I loved it!  It is a small place but it's like a comfy house. I liked how there's a fireplace with a place to lounge if you're just there for drinks.\n\nThe bacon and egg dish was good.  Definitely needed the 5 min egg to add the creamy component to the dish as my pork belly was a litle dry.  I'm assuming it was overcooked? My fiance had the celery soup, and it was really good!  For entree, I had the roasted pork.  It was pretty fancy how the server set the dish on the table and then poured the apple aus jus on top.  The pork was cooked perfectly on this dish and I liked the prierogies served with it.  My fiance liked the cassoulet, but the presentation wasn't that great on that one. It just looked like beans on the bottom with chunks of sausage.  Now the highlight of the meal was the dessert.  All of us got the spoon bar and all agreed it was amazing!  It's a chocolate mousse with nouggat sprinkled on top (which the server said was only made in the restaurant) and then it had a layer of cheesecake.  It was a good portion to satisfy the sweet tooth, but I really could have some more. Haha.  Pretty good first time experience.  I did wish the price for restaurant week would've been a little lower bc we basicalt saved about $3 per person, so one of our friends just ordered off the regular menu.
