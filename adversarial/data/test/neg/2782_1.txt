Great spot. My friend and I enjoyed lunch yesterday.  We lucked out  and were taken to a table right away usually there is a line up. I ordered the breakfast and i was a large portion, delicious and came with a skewer of fresh fruit.  This was our first visit , we will be back our waiter Raymond was very pleasant and attentive.
