Loved being questioned why I was only ordering a yogurt parfait at brunch--apparently you can't have a small appetite when you're out. Since the server attempted to upsell me by suggesting I order more\/repeatedly questioning my order, I asked to hold on to the menu should I change my mind....yet he proceeded to take the menu away. Was rushed while here despite running up my tab with $15 cocktails.
