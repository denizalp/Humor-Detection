I have wanted a Louis from the moment i saw one. I finally saved up for one, which being a college student was not easy, so i was extremely excited to make my purchase. I called ahead to make sure it was in stock and the lady i talked to was very knowledgeable and helped a lot. Once entering the store, absolutely no one greeted me. It was a sunday afternoon, and it was not very busy at all. I waited for about 20 minutes to have someone help me and still no one was even looking my way. Eventually i just searched the store for someone who was not trying to \"act busy\"  by fixing a shelf display or cleaning the shelves. I do not mind spend the money here, but when your treated like this i refuse to come here EVER again. Finally someone grabbed me my purse i wanted. She asked if i wanted a wallet, and i said no because of the service i received. I called to speak with the manager and she just wanted me to come back and upsell me on products. So far, i have not received a very \"sincere apology\" and will not be back, which is unfortunate because i do want a wallet and to purchase a purse for my mom. Over all, i love the products. But the service was horrid.
