If vegan eating is your thing, this is probably the best of two purists' choices in Charlotte. I'm not vegan, or even vegetarian, but I do enjoy a totally guilt free, no concerns about ordering healthy, type of dining experience. Most of the items on the menu are raw, but not all. I ordered a coffee that I just couldn't drink, because of the alternative milk concoction that I had optimistically tried. The waitress was completely understanding and removed it from my bill. Bring your fat wallet. It's not for those on a budget, but the quality is clearly top shelf, local, organic and quite tasty.
