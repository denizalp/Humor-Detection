They did all the things you would expect- answer the phone, provide an accurate estimate, arrive on time, and move our stuff carefully. But then they did more, which made me think they are way above average. Taping down runners to protect floors, RUNNING back from the truck (when not carrying stuff), speeding up the process by a lot, offering very smart suggestions on grouping things in boxes, things I would have never thought of. Basically they showed that they are PROFESSIONAL movers, as opposed to some large guys who are strong but might not really know about moving.  A+ move for us, way above average.
