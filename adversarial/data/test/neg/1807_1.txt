It's a car part store. And that pretty much means I was in a foreign land - and I didn't speak the language and was freaking out about my poor Elizabeth (a.k.a. my Jeep). Upon entering, the two employees were having a heated conversation (something to do with another Autozone and a customer being sent back and forth between the two stores). However, despite this, I was helped within just a couple of minutes. The employee who helped me had to be all of 16 years old (or so he appeared to me), but he was friendly enough and efficient. I was in and out with a new battery (installed for me by the employee) in about 10 minutes - and that's pretty nice.
