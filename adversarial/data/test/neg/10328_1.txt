My fellow yelpers didn't let me down with this recommendation.\n\nI have'nt had pho for a while. This place is in Chinatown and the small parking lot is always packed on the weekends, but I swooped by pretty early today and found a spot.  \n\nEverything looked great on the menu and the noodle dishes also comes in \"XL size.\"\n\nFor takeout, I ordered-\nP11: Tai Gan - rare steak, tendon, and rice noodle. \n\nB4: Bbq Pork with Vermicelli and\n\nGolden Egg rolls which was delightfully crispy.\n\nBroth is tasty and just the perfect amount of star anise and seasoning , with generous chunks of bbq pork, tendons, and sides.  The rare slices of beef flank were packed separately on the side.  I like to throw those in the broth once it comes out but luckily they weren't well done. The Bbq pork was well seasoned.\n\nQuality and quantity.  Best of both worlds.  Overall a statisfying bowl of pho.  Next time it will be Banh Mi sandwiches and Smoothies.
