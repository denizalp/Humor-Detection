Their billing department and admissions office have overcharged my wife and my insurance company on three occasions.  On one visit, the office staff said they accepted a certain insurance for a specific procedure, they were wrong. I had to pay $1500 out of pocket for trusting them. My wife and I should have gotten pre-approval from my insurance company. \nIn two separate instances, it  took us months to recover money when SimonMeds was paid twice and did not return the money.  How good are their scans if all other departments are managed this poorly? Read the reviews from all simonmeds when you get a chance...a very common theme rises up. I think Amanda R. is getting tired of apologizing...just words
