From the moment I first spoke with Dr. Brendon Gibb I knew that I was dealing with an extremely special person. I'm a twenty something year old. I walked into his office in basketball shorts and sandals, unshaven and donning some unflattering bed head. I felt that my appearance may hinder his level of effort with my particular situation. It did not. From the beginning I was treated like his own son. \n\nJust holding a conversation with him is intense. You can see the passion and belief that reside in every fiber of his being. I've only met two other people that share the same piercing gaze that Dr. Gibb has. One, a world renowned colon hydrotherapist and the other an independent filmmaker. The common theme within all these people is that they truly feel that through their work they can change the world. \n\nOur first conversation was extremely thorough about everything that was going on with my health and how it was interconnected. He truly made me believe that he sincerely cares about each and every patient and more than that, every person. Over the course of a month, Dr. Gibb has inspired me to stop countless bad habits (And has me laughing the whole time). Whereas when I would try to stop a bad habit previously I would only do so because I knew it was bad for me. I did not stop the habit because I didn't like doing it, because I did. Through nothing more than some brief conversations and adjustments Dr. Gibb helped me become more in touch with myself which led to me realizing that I am exponentially happier when I am not involved in those old bad habits. Moreover, he has inspired me to constantly work to achieve greatness in everything I do. I can't stress enough how much of an inspiration he is. He's a chiropractor, life coach, doctor, and your best friend all rolled into one. \n\nI've had only one other chiropractor in the past and he was GREAT. The one thing he was lacking was that feeling that you get from Dr. Gibb. The feeling that he wants to help us so much, and more so, for us to help ourselves.
