Awesome place to get your ice cream fix! I keep coming back because I like how they  have a variety of different options that could cater to those who want an extravagant dessert, to those who want a lighter option. \n\nTheir flavours are posted on their chalk board wall, which is really cute and has become famous on Instagram as their backdrop!\n\nThe Cookie Monster is so cute! It's a great option for those who really want to indulge! You could really see the high level of attention to detail as they make the desserts, as they ensure that every aspect is perfect for your perfect Instagram picture! \n\nI also really like their tea flavoured ice cream including the Hojicha and jasmine tea. It's a refreshing change from all the matcha flavours every other ice cream shop is serving. Don't be afraid to ask the staff what each flavour is, as they are really friendly and will offer you a sample to ensure you pick your favourite flavour! The staff is also really helpful in explaining the menu, and they also help make recommendations. You could really tell customer service is a priority for them.\n\nMy personal favourites are the soft serve options. They are said to be on a rotational basis, and so far the earl grey and Thai tea do not disappoint! It's perfect if you're looking for a slightly lighter option. They strike the perfect balance between a creamy taste while still keeping it light and refreshing. I can't wait to try other flavours they bring out! \n\nOnly downside is sometimes they will sell out on some of their products, especially the popular ones like the Cookie Monster. So if you want to make sure you get what you want, I suggest you go earlier!
