The other reviews on here seem strange to me - I've been going to this Pet Valu for just under a year now and it's out of my way. Gino is so caring and such a nice guy - the staff are all knowledgable and are really there to help. My dog has severe food allergies and when the one dog food he wasn't allergic to was no longer being produced Gino did everything in his power to find me extra bags at other stores and then ultimately convinced me to switch to a different trusted brand.\n\nIt makes me very happy to shop with someone who cares. Thanks guys!
