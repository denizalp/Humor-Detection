Good food, I truly recommend this place. Amazing dining room setting to. My only biggest issue with this place is the service. I think the service could be better. Our server didn't hardly come over to check on us or ask if we wanted any refills at all. But later on a very nice lady that happen to be working in the front, checked on us by the time we was ready to pay the bill. Also when we first came in, it took awhile for someone to come seat us. Also when the server came to get our drink order, I ask for ice water but he gave me ice tea instead. Other than that, the food was delicious and the lady that came to our table that was working in the front, was very nice. I do recommend this place though, not bad pricing either. Me and my friend order a few dishes, and we had like our own feast, we split each dish. Then we each split the bill, wasn't alot of money. Last thing I recommend, is the restaurant should have silverware on the table, not just the Tia sticks cause not everyone knows how to use those.
