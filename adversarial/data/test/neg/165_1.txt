I had higher hopes for this popular spot but I was disappointed. The girls wear interesting outfits that basically show their butts, so I imagine it's mostly popular for the guys. \n\nI ordered off the happy hour menu for food to save a few bucks on a late lunch. Vegas gets to be a little too pricey for bar food and I personally would rather save for nice dinners. I got the cheeseburger and fries and buffalo chicken tenders so I wasn't expecting to be wowed but I wouldn't even call it good. I hope some of their regular menu items would be better based on their higher price point.
