Very very delicious large portions.\n\nBeef phone was delicious.\nVietnamese pizza : Banh Xeo (Vietnamese Crepe with Shrimp, Chicken & Bean Sprouts)\n\nWas a big meal of its own although it was under the appetizers.\n\nWe all loved it, never had one of these before.\n\nI have been passing by this joint for a very long time, as it is on a very busy street.\n\nThe chef even came out yo explain us about the portion size. Good and friendly place
