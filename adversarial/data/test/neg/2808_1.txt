I had to plan a bachelor party in Pittsburgh without ever having actually been there, and McFaddens saved my butt.\n\nWe wanted to find a bar that would allow us somewhat of a 'private event' for a few hours on Saturday afternoon, and McFaddens was the perfect choice.  The staff was super helpful both during the planning stages and during the actual event.  The prices were very reasonable and the food and drinks were exactly what we asked for.\n\nThe crowd was barely picking up by the time we left, but we interacted with some of the locals and it seemed like a cool place to hang out.  I don't know what midnight on a Friday is like, but if you're planning a small gathering and want you and your guests taken care of in impeccable fashion, I'd highly recommend McFaddens.
