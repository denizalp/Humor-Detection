This show is amazing. The songs selected by the Beatles were perfect and the performance from this group is outstanding.  This was my first Cirque show and I didn't quite know what to expect.  I was truly impressed by everyone's ability to translate the music both physically and emotionally. The show is very colorful and extremely creative.  \n\nIt starts promptly and runs 90 minutes.  The venue does not have a bad seat in the house.  We sat in section 207 row P and the view was fabulous.\n\nHighly recommended!
