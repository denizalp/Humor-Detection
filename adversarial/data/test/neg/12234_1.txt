when my girlfriend came back from Las Vegas last year, and said she had eaten at Marie Callender's, I was thinking some new age, olive garden type, pasta restaurant. When we went together this year, and I saw the sign, I thought... \"Oh my... all of these great places we could eat in vegas and you bring me to this little place...\" Well, I got a pot pie and it was phenomenal!!! I found out afterwards that this location was themed, even with their sign, and marketed as real homey and comfort food. it was excellent and I know right where to go to cure my hangovers, next time we go. If I had any complaints... the server didn't seem to pick up on a couple of our requests, but it was no major inconvenience. I know serving sucks. I'm a server too...
