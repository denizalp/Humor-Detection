This is the perfect, downtown hang out spot with a group of friends. \n\nI have never eaten here, and I have not really had their drinks, but to me, Gold Spike is all about the atmosphere. The bean bags and beds and couches feel like a really comfortable party at someone's house. There is always music playing, and you have a wide variety of games to choose from, ranging from corn hole to pool to giant jenga. \n\nGold Spike has something for everyone, and it is in a great location downtown. You can make it your only stop of the night or one of many.\n\nI have never been here when there was a cover, so you are really getting a great deal. It can get extremely busy, so you may have to wait for games and seating, but it's no where near as crazy as some of the other bars and clubs.
