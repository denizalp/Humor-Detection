I went there after watching great reviews on Google. Looks like they were mostly fake. The food was just average and the service poor. In Mississauga people are spoilt for choices when it comes to Indian food, the food here was just passable. For starters we ordered papri chat and chicken tikka, neither were very good. For main course the kadhayi panner was no good either and the naan was a little stiff. For desert the rasmalai that we ordered tasted exactly like the frozen one that we buy for our home, we strongly suspect that they don't make it in house and just serve the frozen ones. \n\nWorst thing though was the service, while we had still not finished our appetizers they just brought our main course and placed it on the table and left it to get cold. When we asked for recommendations while ordering we were replied in a very curt and disinterested manner. My friend who had asked for water towards the end, never got it. Overall we ended up paying 100$+ for a dinner for 3 for very sub standard food and bad service. Not recommended at all.
