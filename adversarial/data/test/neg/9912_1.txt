Went here for my sister in laws birthday! Everybody had a great time, the staff was excellent and efficient and the food was fabulous! My wife and I shared a large plate of shrimp scampi and we both got soup, salad and those yummy breadsticks. They even have the Birthday Girl a free dessert and sang to her. It was a wonderful evening, thanks Olive Garden
