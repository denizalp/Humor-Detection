Love this place.  I'm in this town often and rarely stay anywhere else.  The rooms are a tad more expensive than the average rate but since the standard rooms are actually suites, it's worth the extra money for the sitting area.  The casino provides a plethora entertainment (casino, bars & restaurants, shows, shopping in the Canal), and, if you get bored, the Wynn is right next door, which also offers many activities for your sinful liking.
