What can I say about this place. Staff are rude and don't really show a need to cater to the guest. They seem to have the mind set that \"who cares if you never come back\" so I will definitely not come back. Now if customer service isn't important to you, the food is pretty good. So you might actually enjoy this place. For me....3 stars
