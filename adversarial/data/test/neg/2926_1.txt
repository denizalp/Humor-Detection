Great buffet, classic setting, no complaints other than the obvious crowds.\n\nI was lucky and got here with 20 minutes left for breakfast so I paid the lower entrance fee and after my first round, they converted everything to lunch food and higher prices, so I felt like I beat the Man on that one.\n\nI am not sure if this is still the best in Vegas, as I have not been to them all, but you will be very satisfied here and the ambiance is awesome.
