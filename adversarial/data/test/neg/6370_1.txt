This was the first time trying this Jamaican restaurant and I cant say I was happy. My wife called ahead for pick up. We ordered a large Stew Chicken Meal which comes with rice and peas and a salad. My wife ordered a Jerk Chicken Wrap and fries. The chicken and wrap was good but i have had better. The salad that came with the meal was a horribly small (See Pic) . I'm use to getting a nice creamy Salad at other Jamaican food spots \nOverall I was trying to get over the fact the meal was $32. Defiantly not worth the price we paid.
