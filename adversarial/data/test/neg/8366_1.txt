Always fresh, they are great at delivering in a timely manner and the food is always hot. The wings are crispy with just enough sauce, we've tried all the flavors and each are unique. The pizzas awesome, I recommend light sauce because they still give you plenty. These guys are my go to indulgence and never let us down!
