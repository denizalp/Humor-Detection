Hands down the best massage of my life.\nI requested a guy and it was incredible! Although it is pricey for just 50 minutes. I wish they had more amenities for what you are paying for. I wish I would've known that we couldn't order food or even champagne in the spa that was frustrating. It is a little outdated but most of it is really beautiful. I just don't think I would've visit again I think I would try a different spot. Their customer service was awesome everybody was very accommodating.
