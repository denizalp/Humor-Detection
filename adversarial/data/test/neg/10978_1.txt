This Markham Night Club....\n\nI mean Golf Driving Range was BUZZING on this Wednesday evening barely able to find a parking spot.  We arrived to this dead-end road where nearby was a Public Transit stop as well as Garbage Truck stop.\n\nParked in front of the DOME we walked in and saw such a nice lobby in the realms of Driving Range spots.  Huge counter with big menu-board and even a small shop in case you need some accessories.  \n\nIn the same room was a dining\/seating area  where you can go up to the same counter and order some FOOD & Beverages then chill and watch TV on the LCD.  Food offerings at a Driving Range only spot is rare from what I've seen.\n\nYou can choose to use the Dome or go outdoors where you can choose from Grass or Turf.  Why did I comment on the Night CLUB??  Aside from night time when bright stadium lighting turning on, it seems that this scene is super hype and everyone comes here as there was barely an open spot in sight.  \n\nMost people come in groups of 5+ which I didn't know was the trend these days.  The WALKWAY was super narrow between the tees and the seats, and when these people watching their friends tee off they tend to block the walkway for others as if it was a line-up at McD's.\n\nThere is a PUTTING area for practice as well as a Mini-Golf area for the kids which cost $5.00 and second round free.  I didn't provide TOP ranking because I usually like my experience to be quiet and relaxing as if I was at a calm patio space.
