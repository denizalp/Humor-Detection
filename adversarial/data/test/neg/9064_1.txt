Review of dining experience:\nMy party of 4 and I were seated promptly upon arrival. We ordered drinks  for starters and my friend had a long piece of hair in his water! Gross! We asked a worker to change the water and it took about 20 minutes before his new water came out. The other drinks were served within a reasonable time but it took forever just to get water! We probably asked a different waitress\/hostess\/busboy\/supervisor a few times because we didn't know which one was our waitress. It was just water and not in the food so we forgot about it but I just realized that we weren't even offered a discount for an unenjoyable experience. Yes, no biggie for water but it would have been nice for a higher end cafe to offer something more than an embarrassed apology. Unprofessional for the setting but ohh well. \n\nReview of the vegan chickn with scallion waffles:\nIt's pretty good! I ordered this just to try it. The chicken is like a big crispy chicken nugget... Maybe tofurkey? I'm a carnivore though so it wasn't the taste I was looking for that day. \n\nThe scallion waffles (scallions are actually added in the batter!) are served with maple syrup and vegan butter. You don't really taste the scallions and its a good combination. I would definitely recommend this dish if you're vegetarian or vegan, but if ya love your chicken, the cost is the same for real chicken and waffles PLUS eggs! I kinda wished I got the breakfast non-vegan option with eggs instead. \n\nIf you're a carnivore but want to taste a more affordable vegan dish, the veggie burger comes with fries and a chocolate shake for $9! I kinda wish I tried that instead.\n\nReview of the coffee:\nWorth it! The aroma, the strength, mmmm so worth it to wake you up.
