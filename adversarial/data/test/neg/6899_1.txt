Always a good experience when I come here. The experience is unique, and the culture here is a must have. The service is awesome and friendly. Fooooood is allllways wonderful and the wait is never long. I left my hotel at planet Hollywood just to drive down here. My mouth was watering for this place since arriving. If u are in town don't pass up!!
