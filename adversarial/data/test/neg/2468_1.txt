I've been training at Thurston Personal Training for over a year now. The results have been OUTSTANDING! At first I was a little bit hesitant because I had never worked out before, but I'm so glad I took the step to train with Seth one on one. I've lost over 40 pounds and counting and gotten stronger than I expected!\n\nThe only downside is that Seth and the other trainers keep me so accountable and really push me to do my best. I can't get away with anything! From meal plan to push-ups! I've come a long way from when I started so I guess what they do works!
