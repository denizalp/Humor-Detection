My boyfriend and I both had two items on the menu that claimed to be awarded \"best of Charlotte\" and although they were not bad, I wouldn't quite say that they're the best in the city. He had the beef on weck and I had the jerk style burger. They were just average. \n\nOther than the food, I like the concept. We went on trivia night and although we left before it started, it got packed. It seemed like a fun neighborhood hangout.
