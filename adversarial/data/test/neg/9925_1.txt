Food was passable but horribly disappointed in the service. Our server was robotic and lackluster while explaining the meat cuts, acted like he wasn't even interested in being there. ?Manager in suit walked around to tables and asked how everything was to everyone except us. Happen to be (the only) young Asian couple.. suspect.  Will not be returning and will advise friends of the same.
