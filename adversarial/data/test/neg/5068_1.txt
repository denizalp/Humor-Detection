I'm only giving this review 1 Star because the system won't post without a star. Where do I begin?.. I switched to Homelife Protection home warranty last Sept 2012 since my other Warranty co price was going to increase sharply and previous service call experiences were unsatisfactory. Today I called Homelife to get service ASAP due to Water heater not working since Saturday. I even submitted a claim online. Never recieved an email reply showing recieved and being handled ASAP. Called Monday morning and was advised they would have someone call me shortly and explained it may cost me an additional $850.00 for replacement of water heater if has to be replaced. Now in the details of what is covered it states they cover up to $500. for water heaters. I had already priced water heaters at 2 different places and found them priced from aprox $218.00 and up.  The warranty co had advised the installation and additional parts needed are not included and i would also still need to pay the $45.00 service call. I advised I had read that they can opt to pay us the $ instead for the replacement. Now this is where it gets interesting. The warranty advisor checked our acct and stated there had been NO Payments since Oct 2012.  I advised that's impossible since I was set up on Auto draft since acct set up last Sept 2012. I looked at my checking acct on line all the way back to Oct and found yes indeed that was last payment they drafted. How I hadn't noticed ..not sure. I asked why they had stopped drafting my acct and they claimed there was a \"general error code\" and it effected not just me. I asked why didn't they contact me via phone and or email. They claimed they did try to call me. But somehow they had wrong phone # when I asked them to verify # they had been calling. I asked why they didn't email me then? They claimed \"we don't do that\" then why do they keep my email on file in the 1st place? Hmmmmm. But they  were prompt to state they could take 2 months payment over the phone right then to resolve the issue. I told them NO Thanks! You've already shown your Incompetence as a Company and I will No Longer be doing business with them! \nNeedless to say I got a Brand New Water heater for just $259.00 today from an appliance store and my husband installed it per instructions. So the moral of the story is:\nA Home Warranty is Worthless and will cost you more $$ in 99% of the cases!..Especially one like HomeLife.
