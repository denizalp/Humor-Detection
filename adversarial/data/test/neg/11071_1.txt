We would come just for the Truffled Potato Chips and we did just that the second time we were here! We have been twice over two  trips to Vegas recently. This place is really amazing. The Service is a 5\/5++. Everyone and I mean everyone is kind and attentive, welcoming you as you come in and saying thank you as you leave. It really made us feel good about the place. The food was also outstanding. The Truffled Potato Chips are one of the best things my wife and I have ever eaten. I also had the steak both times which was perfectly cooked. My wife had a pasta dish once and the chicken and she said she loved both. We had a side of corn which was great and also mac and cheese was amazing. Their bread is amazing.. We eat probably way too much bread but it was so good! :) The butter is soft when it arrives, not ice cold and hard which is a little thing but much appreciated if you like bread and butter like we both do. We had no room for dessert, but the offerings looked amazing. This is our favorite place in Vegas currently. It is easy to get to, little to no wait as they have a big space, amazing food and amazing service. The value for your money is also great considering the quality and that it is Vegas.\n\nWe can't wait to go back!
