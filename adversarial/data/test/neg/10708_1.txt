What happened? I read the reviews in Yelp and took advice from a local paper. The oven is wood fired and they claimed authenticity. So what happened? \nWe received half a dozen tasteless ,hard as a rock , dry , barely swallowable , if that's a word, bagels.\n I honestly thought I'd been slipped 3 day old. Or a more likely reason might have been the lack of yeast. Possibly they forgot to use it? A lack of salt and rise? Don't know. \nI paid $7 bucks for 6 which is fine for a top of the game bagel but...  I threw 4 out. I ended up walking to the Superstore to buy baguette !?             \n\nThe building and interior is lovely. Staff friendly. \n\n\n\nIm not saying this is the norm. It cant be. But I had a bad day.
