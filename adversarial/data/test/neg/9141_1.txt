Used to go here sometimes during my high school days. Overpriced food and really small portions (especially the rice). Some dishes just taste weird and totally not authentic.  My friend, who is allergic to mangoes, requested to have a mango-free dish but he was still served the mango salad because the server was not paying attention. Overall, there are many better options in the cote-des-neiges area.
