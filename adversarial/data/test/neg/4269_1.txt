I was excited that I found a place to get my hair done being new to the area. I was leaving town and wanted to have my hair looking fabulous. My appt was with Alisia and she seemed nice enough. I used to be a stylist so I was asking her questions about what she was using on my hair and she made it sound like it was all good. I went in for root touch up and highlights. When I got home I realized that my roots looked no different, so I called Alisia and told her my roots looked they hadn't been colored, (my hair was a medium brown with blonde highlites.) She admited that she thought that may happen and to come in again I was leaving town 2 days later. She fit me in and she did my root touch up, I had told her I didn't want to have her ruin the highlites, she said it would be fine. When I left, I had about 3 inches of black color on my roots and the highlights looked like they had been growing out a year. She new she screwed up, she kept doing other things, like deep conditioning, wouldn't let me see my hair until she was done, she curled it to help hide the mess she made, she waxed my eyebrows, I didn't realize at the time she had messed uo so bad. Once I got home and the next day when I had a shower, my hair began to break off, and it looked awful! I called repeatedly to speak to the owner Lorraine, but she didn't return my calls. Alsia was on vacation and I had left town. I paid almost $200.00 for this crap service and today I have to go get my hair all cut off because of what she did to my hair. I hope whoever goes to this salon and has a bad experience walks out without paying, they don't care about the customer at all. I will make sure I post this message on every social media and any place i can so everyone knows what a bad place this can be.
