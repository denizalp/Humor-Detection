Nice Italian place in Aurora! Order pizza there and you won't be disappointed! Bakery is outstanding and the whole place is something that you can call affordable eating out. But the service has to be improved. And I mean it! It is really ridiculous to wait for the orders as well as for such primary thing as cutlery! Guys, come on! You have nice premises, food is awesome, so solve the service issue and your place will be overcrowded!
