Tomasz cleaned three rooms, an area rug and a sofa. He was reasonably priced and from the looks of everything, did a phenomonal job. I have two dogs, and two toddlers so even though we have a new build...we have high traffic in our playroom and kids room. He was easy to reach, called before he showed up and was on time. All awesome business ethic!!! He explained the areas he targeted and gave suggestions as to how to maintain our areas to get the most out of our cleanings!! I have tried two other places in the past 8months...once while in an apt and the other when we pulled stuffy furniture out of storage. Tomasz did a better job than both those companies combined. Will definatly use him again!!!!
