This is the cutest French cafe! I always come for their salads, Sloan tea and cake loafs (so moist and gooey omg) The food quality is great but like other reviewers have said, the price is a bit steep and it wouldn't be something I would have every day...more like afternoon pick me ups or end of the week treats. They also carry my favourite ginger ale. Overall I would recommend it if you haven't tried!
