We went there for the first time on the reviews on YELP. It was very good and the service was very good. Emily was very friendly and she kept up with our drinks. She knew the menu very well and steered us toward the best tacos on the menu. \nWe will be back even with the somewhat limited menu. We would have liked to see burritos, but everything else was worth the visit.
