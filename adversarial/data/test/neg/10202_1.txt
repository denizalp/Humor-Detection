Overall I had a very nice experience. The decor was very elegant and modern. The hostesses were both very friendly and welcoming. Our server was great and made some very good selections. My friend and I went on a Thursday so we took advantage of happy hour and the half off bottles of wine!\n\nNow the food. We started with some Happy Hour apps. The Cheese and Salami board was fresh and tasty. I enjoyed the meatballs. The Zucchini Flowers with ricotta and a nice aioli was the best of the three. The Chopped Salad was nice, and the shishito peppers in there were a nice addition. \n\nFor entrees, the King Crab Bucatini was great. The Meyer lemon cream made the dish and the pasta was a perfect al dente. There was a small amount of shell, somewhat expected given the crab is fresh but still you need to be careful. The Pan Roasted Halibut was perfectly cooked and the carrot pur√©e complimented it nicely. The risotto was good. Only issue, there were a few bones in the fish. \n\nI will definitely be back!
