Excellent service! My friend and I go to this place and the staff is very friendly. The food exudes a homecooked vibe. Since the place opens at 11, my friend and I waited for them to open just outside of the store. But as soon as the staff saw us, she hurried to the door to open earlier for us! The portions are a great bang for your buck. Staff also gives my friend and I free treats like fruits when there is just us in the store. My friend and I both felt so welcome because of the hospitable service we received.\nThe food is great too! I've tried the basil fried rice, pineapple rice (? ), sweet and sour pork - its amazing how their dishes have consistency in the great flavours that play in my mouth. My friend tried the paneng curry with some coconut rice and the flavours balance perfectly! The spice from the curry blends well with the creamy coconut rice. I would totally tell all my friends about this place. Awesome awesome!\nShoutout to the great staff that are always nice!
