Came by for take out lunch since it was really busy and there were no seats. There were a few large groups and one person taking up a table for 4, even though the place was relatively spacious. Guess it's first come first serve. Take out was relatively quick (5-10 minutes). Got the lamb sandwich which was just over $10 (no drink), which is decent for Yorkville. It was reasonably sized and the lamb tasted pretty gamey (which I enjoyed!) I have been to the other Yonge location and it was pretty good. Expect similar standards from this one.
