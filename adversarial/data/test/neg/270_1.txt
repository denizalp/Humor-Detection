I came here with a large party for dinner one night and the restaurant was pretty empty. Despite that, service was pretty slow. Maybe I'm just spoiled with really delicious sushi normally or the one day I was here they were having an off day but I thought the sushi here was sub par. We ordered a wide assortment of different rolls and sushi and I didn't really care for any of it. The quality of the food was average to not that good and the look and feel of the restaurant just felt boring. Unfortunately I was unimpressed and doubt I will be coming back.
