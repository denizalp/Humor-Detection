Food is somewhat okay here, but the portion sizes are a tad smaller compared to other locations.  I found the order lady to be somewhat unfriendly and unhelpful.  It seemed that with some other customers, she connected well with them and went a little bit more.  But i've been here once and it seemed different this time.  As i was getting my tray, i had to reach out to grab my fountain drink.  I still will come back here, since this is the only mr. Greek express in this part of town (being close to Cineplax Odeon).  But it's only because it's the only choice.\n\nSome smiles and would be nice.\n\nTreat every customer with great importance.  This one lady did differently.
