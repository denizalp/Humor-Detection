This was my second visit there.  The first was really bad but thought maybe an off day.. food was ok but the service wasnt very good.  Well I was maybe right.. First visit maybe was an off day because the second visit was even worse.  Rude staff, not busy, couldnt get waited on, the staff were bickering it seemed.  FINALLY got our food--only 3 of us-- and then couldn't get refills or a check.  Done.  Cant even imagine what a third visit would be like.
