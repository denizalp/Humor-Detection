As a frequent traveler I am always reluctant to just have just any old meal if I can prevent it. I'm looking for the top of the line or either something I can go back and tell my girlfriend about via snapchat. Now let's just say there was a snap involved here but nothing that I was just blown away by. Didn't even make it to \"My Story\". \n\nI started with the Fried Mozz which was simply ordinary. I love fried cheese sticks of any variety and was not impressed--I should have tried the fried tofu instead. I decided to go with the BBQ Pig Burger, which again was \"any old meal\", simply a burger with what seemed like microwaved pulled pork. WAY TOO MUCH BREAD! I'd rather my burger reign over my bun, not the other way around. \n\nOn a brighter note--service was great, as I am from Austin and made me feel like I'm back home in a nice hippy, Freebird-ish atmosphere. As bad as this review sounds, the food was good and will probably come back I'd just stay away from the normal items. I hear the Monte Carlo is pretty good, but read a review about the serving of meat you actually have on your melt, order with caution!\n\nYours Truly
