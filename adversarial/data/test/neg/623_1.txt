Okay, I usually wouldn't give Best Buy a 4-star rating just because they're Best Buy.   And most of these stores have been downsized due to the economy.   But this one actually had good service and they didn't really bug you until you asked for help.  It also is one of the few that still carries everything.\n\nI went here for a Clear modem during the long labor day weekend since Cox decided to turn off all of my cable\/internet\/phone for no reason and wouldn't fix it even though I needed it for work.   So, I finally ended up at this store.   I'm not sure if he's supposed to do this or he cared, but he even went through the trouble of checking and making sure I was in coverage area.   That's nice!\n\nUsually, I don't really care for this chain due to price, but the people in this one actually made the difference this time.
