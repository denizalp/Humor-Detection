Cafe Hollywood took the place of Planet Dailies which was a great place. This was my first trip to Cafe Hollywood. One of the first things I noticed was the decor. The walls were plastered with older pictures of stars, which fits with theme but almost gave the place a clustered feel. I would maybe scale back on some of the pictures, it just was kinda overwhelming. \nOne of the best specials at the previous establishment was the steak and eggs. I think Cafe Hollywood needs to bring that back. \nI had the chicken and waffles, I should say the tender and waffles. True chicken and waffles should be actual chicken and not tenders. However, I will admit it was good all things considered. My wife had the omelet with toast. Again nothing spectacular but decent overall. \nCafe Hollywood is a nice stop but it won't be in my regular rotation of places to eat while in Vegas.
