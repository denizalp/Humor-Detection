I normally do not step a foot into best buy. I have no reason to go there. \n\nHowever, I have been having problems with the attitudes and lack of service at Sprint. I went here two times to add a new phone to my plan, and then to upgrade to my HTC one.\n\nThe first time was a breeze. The associate was knowledgeable, and didn't try to seriously \"add on\" ridiculous things we didn't need. \n\nThe second time, when I went to upgrade was even easier. I have to say, I truly love it when I do not feel as if I am being baited in just for a company to make money. When I got my phone, there weren't a lot of cases for it......Everyone is obsessed with making things for the iPhone. :l The employee told me where I could find cases, and for cheaper, too!\n\nI am not sure how the rest of their departments are really run, but I'll be going to Best Buy for all my phone purchases from now on. And their insurance on phones is probably $3 more than what we were paying, but there is NO deductable. With the way my husband goes through phones (4 insurance claims in the last 3 years) we don't need to pay $100 each time.
