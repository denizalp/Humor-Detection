Let the battle begin. Grand opening with $2.99 breakfast burros and $1 tacos priced to try and put Vaqueros next door out of business. So sad that one of these businesses will ultimately starve the other one out. The breakfast burros are good but slightly greasy and hard to eat the last few bites. Where is the passion for quality? Check out traditional kitchens like La Korita on the west side and taste the difference.
