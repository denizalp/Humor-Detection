I've been taking my dogs to Wesley for years. I normally NEVER have issues with this salon. Last week I took my dog in and they kept her from around noon till almost 7pm. I was never given a good explanation as to why my dog spent so long at the salon or an explanation as to why I was never give a single update as to when I could expect my dog back. I was so disappointed. It hurts me to do this because the cut looked fabulous. I'm hoping that internally this salon can figure out how to manage their schedule and their employees better to give better service. Leaving a client in the dark for that long of a time period when it comes to a living animal is just unacceptable.
