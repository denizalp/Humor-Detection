We were staying next door at Aria and found Eggslut on Yelp. Was definitely worth the trek! Everyone's sandwich was delicious. I had the Fairfax with avocado and bacon and it was SO GOOD. Didn't wait in line too long and managed to scope out some seating for five. If anything could have been an issue, it would have been seating, but we lucked out. Next time I'll definitely try The Slut!
