I took my elderly kitty here for shots and a check up, and the visiting vet said he had terrible dental disease and would need a few teeth pulled. They quoted me a really reasonable range of prices. When Sid came in to actually get his teeth pulled, they realized after a cleaning that he only needed ONE tooth pulled. He's like a new kitty, with young pearly whites, again! \n\nUnlike most vets in this town, the new price reflected that the work done was not as extensive as quoted, so the price was less. As a college student, I seriously appreciated that. Dr Roach took me to the back room and showed me the x-rays, as well as before and after shots of work done. He wanted me to fully understand what had gone on, and wanted me involved in the process so I could properly care for my kitty post-op. SUPER COOL GUY.\n\n I've had bad experiences with other vets and I am SO impressed with Dr Roach and his staff. They take great care of Sid and explain everything in detail with me when we visit. We're going back soon for grooming and a check up after dental work, and I'm happy to do so.\n\nHighly recommended for all your pet's needs. :)
