Eh, I've definitely had better. It was mostly rice, could barely taste the hot sauce, didn't taste that fresh, not very much chicken and what was there was pretty dry. Also thought it was a little lame that they were charging extra for saut√©ed veggies. I know that's standard for guac at most places but veggies too? Not horrible but not good, would sooner go to chipotle. 2.5\/5
