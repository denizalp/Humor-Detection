Ticket ordering is very confusing in Las Vegas.  Ticket prices can largely range. We sat on the main floor (all seats level).  Therefore, you tend to be sitting looking at a tall person's head---we'd of been better off in more comfortable seats around the parameter of the room.  Main floor seats were conference room \"type\" and uncomfortable.  \n\nGood talent, but I was expecting more of a rock show.  They sing a number of old hits but it is more of a theatre production.  Would not be my top pick of shows in the city for the price.
