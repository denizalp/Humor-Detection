Came yesterday and tried the truffle pie with the prosciutto. The pie itself was a 6\/10, could use some work, it was very bland. Love the owner though, he is a genuine guy and we had a conversation while my food was being made and he asked me some advice how to grow his business. I would go back alone just to see the owner, great guy.. you guys need to use some bolder flavors though.
