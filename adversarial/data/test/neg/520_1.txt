-10!! If I could give a negative number I would!!!\nSo I RESERVED just to make sure our Mother's Day would be amazing!! And also because we knew it would be packed if we didn't. Waited for 1hour and 37 minutes and we had it. Talked to people multiple times to ask why we waited for an hour already AFTER making a reservation. Thought maybe some water would be offered to us!!! Nothing, was not the only party waiting who made reservations, a party of 15 or 18 where waiting Even longer! And had kids and no water was given to them either, three families including mine left. We were so appalled never to come back again. The manager seemed so clueless? Like do you have no authority to help us? Standing there not knowing what to say to us. If you can't honor your word with reservations say so. don't ruin families day out. Don't believe me go to this place on a holiday and make reservations in advance. Horrible service. Please don't go here...
