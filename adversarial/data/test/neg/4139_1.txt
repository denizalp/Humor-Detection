I took my wife there for her birthday and immediately we were greeted by a wonderful server who had a ton of personality - she took our order and we waited 25 minutes in a freezing cold restaurant - we could tell they were not well organized and the servers look upset at the kitchen - when our food arrived i order the ultimate skillet and the wife a simple club with fries - the potatoes came out burnt the server knew it and I was missing one egg - she reluctantly placed the food knowing it wasn't the best product - but because we had waited she gave us our order - she came back to fill our drinks and then she said the foods bad isn't it - we agreed and she hen placed the order after another ten minutes we walked out - the manager didn't even argue or offer anything in consultation! If a breakfast house is not packed then there is a good reason!! DO NOT VISIT this restaurant!! Make corporate clean his place up!!
