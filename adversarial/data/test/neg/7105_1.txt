If you're the type of person who only reads the first few lines of a paragraph then pay attention to what I'm about to say; DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS STORE. \n   Let me start... we wanted to order delivery but decided to go with carryout after hearing about the atrocious 4 HOUR DELIVERY TIME. We ordered a few pizzas (one hand tossed..remember that!) some sides and a soda. Showed up 10 minutes after projected ready time to give them a little leeway. Was told our order was in the oven and should be ready in less than ten minutes. No problem! I don't mind waiting, stuff happens. 10 minutes later I'm told it's ready... I wait for another 5 minutes while the employee disappeared. I'm assuming he was getting my order together as it clearly wasn't ready. Finally I received my food and was on my happy way home. Keep in mind I live a short 2.5 miles away from this location and drove straight home. Our food was COLD, and both my pizzas were pan style. Now, why was I told my food wasn't ready but yet when I received it, it was cold?  We tried to call and speak with a manager but after 20 minutes of listening to the employees speak amongst each other and take orders (they never even put me on hold, more or less just laid the phone down).  Finally hung up. Not worth it. One of the worst experiences I've ever had. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy.
