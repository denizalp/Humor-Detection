Thank you to this Midas shop for taking good care of my wife's vehicle today while we're on vacation. I had my wife truck towed to this location based on the 4 star reviews and was Amazed by the real TRUTH and Honesty in these professional in this Midas shop. They make you feel really at home and treat you like u need to be treated with total respect. Their staff are straight forward NO BS here which is awesome. First this shop replaced a Fuel pump which was completed by Midas in Washington State near JBLM and yes I'm military; but less then 40 days it goes out again while we're on vacation. In Las Vegas heading to Texas. Attention All Military personnel if u need any great service and vehicle work done come to 365 Nellis Blvd to Midas and they will definitely take good care of u treat you with respect and fairness and I guarantee you will not feel robbed by their work.
