I've been here twice. The first time was amazing and the second time was completely awful. the lady tore the skin on the side of my big toe then continued to scrape her nail in there to get nail polish out. It hurt so bad. I'm tempted to go and get my money back because it was an awful pedicure,  but I honestly hate being that person. UPDATE : today I received a phone call from Kevin, and since I'm not able to come in and get it fixed (the big toe hurts too bad). He is going to take care of me the next time. This is why they will continue to have me as a client. They will always make the moment right and take care of their customers. I appreciate your call Kevin!
