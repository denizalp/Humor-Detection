Loved them! Well, as much as we can love a dental office. lol  The atmosphere is really neat and entertaining\/ inviting for the kids. Josh at the front desk has always been super helpful and most importantly the awesome dentist Dr Brandon Grieve is incredible with the kiddos and very personable. My three kiddos will be his patients for as long as he's in Vegas and as long as they're kids!
