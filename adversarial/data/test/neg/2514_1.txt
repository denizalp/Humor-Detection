Had lunch here today with my mom and sister. The green beans actually seemed to be older cooked mixed with newer not so cooked beans mixed together. My sister had issues with her ribs...I tried one bite and it was aweful, rancid. Tasted like it had been cooked the day before and left out overnight. The waitress did bring fresh ribs as we were leaving. The rest of the food was good. Service was good. There was a waitress in training...she was very friendly. Wish I could have given 5 stars bit not this time.
