I thought the buffet was good, lots of variety. When we got there, there was a huge line when i got there. It was $15.99 a person so it was not bad. About a good 10 minutes and we finally got to pay. Then there was a 3 minute wait to get to a table because it was crowded. \n\nThere was a Asian food section, salad section, seafood section, friend section, dessert section, pizza section...etc. There were a couple others, but i forgot. I started off with a big salad with blue cheese dressing. Then i have some pasta with a red clam sauce. The sauce was not very good so i didn't very much of that. I had some fried and baked chicken, and other assortments of food. They have a self-serve yogurt machine so that was awesome. \n\nOverall, like i said before, it was okay. I wish the food tasted better and i would have gone back for 3rds. Right now i feel hungry because i didn't want to stuff myself with OK food. It was Friday night so i think it was crab legs night so i got a plate of those to try and get my money's worth. The legs were hard to open so it was a pain in my ass to eat the crab. Also i forgot that the desserts were meh. The little cakes and stuff were probably from boxes from a freezer because it wasn't very tasty. cheap asses. :)
