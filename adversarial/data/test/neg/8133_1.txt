Prices are good and location is close to home.  The pharmacy is great.  Rainie is awesome and super nice!  As for the grocery store, the customer service is poor.  Nobody seems to be happy to work there.  Nobody asks to help you and they walk by you without saying hello or even smiling.  I have shared my concerns with the manager several times and now I know why nobody is happy to work there.
