This isn't the Dane County Farmers Market.  This is a lot smaller, the length of a small block inside a shopping center.  There's a decent variety of items to choose from--lots of fruits and vegetables, honey, maple syrup, meat, milk, baked goods.  The quality of the food is just as good as the big farmers market, and it is a lot less crowded.\n\nAlthough there's usually something going on, such as a cook-off or some musicians, I'd go here just to get some food for dinner, whereas I'd go to the downtown market as a bit 1-2 hour outing.
