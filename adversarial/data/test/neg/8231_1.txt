I stayed at the linq hotel, let me get to the point... I ordered room service which was $60!! For something I could've got at McDonald's and probably better service, they forgot half my order... they gave me watery eggs! Glad I didn't dare feed that to my son he could've got sick and to top it off the girl tried arguing with me saying I needed to let them know how I wanted my eggs, I clearly said scrambled!!! But apparently I gotta order eggs as if it were a steak... such bad service for what was paid. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!! I'm usually not one to go back and fourth but they had bad customer service just putting up a fight to try to justify what they did wrong. There wrong and that's it fix it!!! Don't argue with the customer when you know your in the wrong.
