Slow service. Bland food, the chicken on my tacos was flavorless and very dry.  They charge for chips and salsa, never ever have I been to a Mexican restaurant that has. Never refilled my soda.  Friends margarita had literally 2 flakes of salt on the glass.  Only gave it 2 stars because they took 5 dollars off my friends steak salad because she didn't eat it, it was really that bad.
