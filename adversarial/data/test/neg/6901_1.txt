Omar's Window Tinting did a great job on my little sisters Kia Forte. They went over the different shades and made it much easier for her to decide exactly what she wanted for her car. They completed the work on time and the tint looks great. Very great staff. The pricing was also competitive. I had called several locations and Omar's prices were very reasonable. We were very happy with the quality of the work and service. I would recommend anyone looking into window tint to consider Omar's Window Tinting!
