1 2-star review on 3 brewers 4 poor 5ervice and food. \n\nI've had wonderful experiences at the 3 Brewers in the financial district with the great food and beer selection so I thought this one would be no different. \n\nThe lack of attention from both the service and the kitchen staff is embarrassing. I understand it's busy, but when you service everybody around us and neglect us in favour of others, it's distasteful (get it?). \n\nOverall, would stick to other locations if you want your 3 Brewers fix.
