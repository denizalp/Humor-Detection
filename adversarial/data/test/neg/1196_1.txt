I received excellent service by the husband and wife pair, Paul and Debbie. \n\nThese kind people replaced my faulty water heater and brought my install up to code. \n\nThe cost wasn't much higher than the purchase price of a new unit, and included disposal of the old, and delivery of the new. \n\nI'm pretty handy and cost conscious but these two have this job down-pat, and it's just worth it to have this pair do the job right, quickly and with a very slight premium over self-install.
