How did I fail to review this place?! The Neon Museum cannot be missed. Doubly so, if you consider yourself a photographer. This strange graveyard is where all the old signs of bygone casinos go to die. It is a walk through Vegas history and modern design that you can't find anywhere else. Our tour guide was a totally laid back local, born and raised. He was so funny and knowledgeable about Vegas' history and past casinos. Th tour was so worth it. It is outside, so if you're going in the summer, consider the heat.
