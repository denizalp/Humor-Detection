Cafe 49 is recommended when visiting the Stowe gardens.  We had difficulty finding it on the highway.  Once we arrived we were greeted and our order was taken when we were ready.  I had the greek salad with chicken on top (it is not noted in the menu but they were able to meet my request.)  The chicken is grilled and not breaded-Yippee!  My husband had the special of the day, slow roasted beef with salad and vegetables. It was quite the serving and it was good too.  I would return if I am in the area again.  One note, they request patrons to check out when the waitress leaves for the day.  However, they don't require that you leave at the same time.
