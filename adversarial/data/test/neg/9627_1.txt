In TX we have two huge outlet malls next to each other in San Marcos.  One has all the stores you want to go visit, while the other one has ones you just go to because they are there.  Well the South Location is just that \"other\" location.  If you have time, you can visit both, but if you can only visit one, visit the north side one.
