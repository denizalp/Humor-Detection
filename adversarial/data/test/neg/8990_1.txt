Customer service was great, the restaurant was extremely clean and the food was amazing! Served 11 folks in our group and everyone enjoyed all the variety of options. Cinnamon roll rocked! The creamy spread can be portioned onto the roll as desired. Loved that it wasn't dripping with goop! Great value and generous portions. Only downside is the uncomfortable metal chairs and cafeteria-style layout.
