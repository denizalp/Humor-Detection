This is a long overdue review since I've gone here 3 out of the 6 times I've been to Vegas in the past few years. It's a popular spot after partying for diner faire. Not much else to say. The service has always been friendly and fairly attentive, even when it's packed at 1-2 in the morning. Waters get filled. Missing silverware is replenished if need be. I get my Tabasco before my meal arrives. Seating isn't too big of an issue either. Parking seemed not be much of a challenge on the weekends either. Don't let the pricing scare you, if the menu said it's $12 for an omelette, you really do get $12 worth of omelette and sides. Not a bargain compared to some other deals around the strip, but it's okay. If I had a choice to skip out on this place late at night and go elsewhere, I wouldn't mind. A change of pace from \"tradition\" or a routine wouldn't hurt anyone, especially in Vegas. If my friends want to go here, I still don't mind.\n\nAs for the food you get, it's not bad. It hits the spot at that time of the night. Always good times to crowd around a booth with a bunch of your buddies just to recap your night of partying and tell stories over a meal. LIke I said, the portions are huge. Unfortunately, having left overs in the middle of a Vegas trip isn't such a great thing since most hotel rooms don't have a fridge, let alone a microwave to reheat your food. If you're a normal eater, sharing your plate with someone else might be a good idea. Or if you're drunk and starving, perfect! I like the fact that a bran muffin is a choice as far as toast\/muffin\/biscuit options go with your breakfast. I usually save the muffin for the next morning for those really slow starts to the day. You know how it is when you party in Vegas. Sleep late, wake up late. Eat a ....bran muffin with your complimentary hotel coffee?
