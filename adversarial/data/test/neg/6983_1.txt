Not only do they have a lot of great products, Jill was a fabulous tour guide and host.  Using locally grown products, they have taken many of the old standards and made them even tastier with their recipes and approach to distilling. We also left with some great ideas for new drinks. \n\nDefinitely worth a visit!
