Having never been able to weather the line for Eggslut in Grand Central Market every time we're in LA, we were happy to know there was an Eggslut in Vegas and made it a point to stop by. The line went pretty quickly, and it's inside the Cosmo which is one of the higher end hotels on the strip. We ordered the Fairfax with bacon and the sandwich was good, even if it didn't quite live up to our expectations. The eggs are cooked really well and the bun is pillowy soft. Adding bacon was a good idea as it added a bit of needed saltiness with the creaminess of the eggs. I couldn't really taste the cheese, and we forgot all about the sriracha mayo and caramelized onions until the last few bites, where it all seemed to have gotten concentrated. All the prices are slightly higher than the LA locations, which isn't a dealbreaker but makes it difficult to justify a Fairfax with bacon and avocado for around $15.
