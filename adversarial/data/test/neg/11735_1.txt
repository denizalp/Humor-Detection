My brother, son and I went for a meal here after I taught a group yoga warmup at the Color Run and it was a disappointment. There was a significant wait time even though there weren't many people in the restaurant. The customer service was lackluster in addition to it taking a really long time for us to get our food. The glass for the specialty drink I ordered had lipstick on it, so rather than make me a new one, they just poured it into another glass. It ruined the effect of the colors of the ingredients in the specialty drink when they should have just remade the drink for me in a clean glass. The food was okay, not great. This isn't an establishment I would recommend to others.
