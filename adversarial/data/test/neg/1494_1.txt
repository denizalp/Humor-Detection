I came with a friend and ordered 1 schnitzel to share. When we got our food, we didn't get the \"how's your food\" question compared to the other guests. Maybe cause we were younger looking compared to the others? When we got the bill, $18.99 for the schnitzel with the potato salad plus a $1.50 charge for splitting the portion with my friend. OUTRAGEOUS. I felt like outcasts in this restaurant. Is not like they were busy. There were just 1 other couple in the restaurant at the time. Server didn't check up on us until our food was done. Suggest you skip this place if you're not white. 3 is a generous rating.
