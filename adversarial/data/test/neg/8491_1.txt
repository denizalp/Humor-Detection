Would have loved to had a beer, maybe even some food, but no such luck this evening. I sat down 20 minutes ago, and have yet to have a server come by. I've hit the prompt call button now three times, still no response. 4 other parties sat down after me and were all served. Tried to flag down someone, but it seems I am invisible tonight. Maybe I'll have better luck next time...
