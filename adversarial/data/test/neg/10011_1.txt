The food was decent.. Perfect to curve a hangover.\n\nYou can't go wrong when you put runny eggs on anything. The eggs weren't very seasoned though. I had the turkey sausage sandwich and it didn't disappoint. The fresh OJ was pretty good too. \n\nThe wait was only about 10 minutes. My only gripe is that it was $30 for two sandwiches and one OJ.
