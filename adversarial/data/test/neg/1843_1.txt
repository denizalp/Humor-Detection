I more than enjoyed my breakfast here at  Cafe Moulin . It's a lovely Breakfast & Coffee shop in Walnut, Shadyside . The Owner and the staff are very kind and friendly. Especially the server Nursu is always there with her cheerful smile to help you with your choices. I came here to have continental breakfast and ordered Sophia crepe and french toasts. Everything i ate was amazing. I really loved every single one. French toast and the fruits are very fresh and tasted so good.I also liked the combination of turkish sausage and eggs in the crepe.Beside the breakfast i also ordered caf√© latte. I loved it  all as much as i loved the portion size! I strongly recommend this place to the people who like French based European food or just want to try something different in Pittsburgh .I'm looking forward to come back !
