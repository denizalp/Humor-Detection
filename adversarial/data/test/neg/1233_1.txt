So I really really wanted to rate this higher. The experience itself was great: high tech and very clean facility, comfortable, my nail tech was sweet and friendly. The three stars comes down to the fact that it wasn't a fantastic manicure. I got the gel manicure and had Swarovski crystals put on a few nails. It looks darling however upon closer inspection the polish has bubbles in it and my cuticles were not cleaned up super well. The little crystals lasted one day on my nails and fell off which was sad cause they were super cute.\n\nI would really like to give them another chance and count this as a mulligan. For $40 I kind of expected more.
