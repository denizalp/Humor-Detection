Hakka legend is my most favourite hakka Chinese restaurant in GTA. I am a regular but at a different location. It's a shame this location doesn't live up to the committed taste. I will try and sugarcoat my words here as much as I can. \n\nThe most terrible experience I've ever had. Unprofessional and rude staff. Even the Manager doesn't give a shit. He will act like he cares but if he really did it would show in his gesture or in the service next time. Never ever work to make the customers happy. Just slammed the water on our table. Not even once I've asked if my food taste okay. Where do you think you guys are runnimg this restaurant? Hellloooo it's Canada. Doesn't hold even one quality of the Canadian Customerservice culture here. \n\nExperience here always makes me crawl out of skin. Whenever a concern is raised regarding the taste or quantity of the dish they just nodded and walked away saying they can't do anything about it. NEVER tried to fix it. We've been here now 5 times and came out unhappy every single time. One thing we always feel is they don't care if you're a unhappy customer as they're anyway getting the crowd by the name itself. I've overheard so many customers complain about the food. Try giving a feedback or ask them to make some change in their crappy food and you'll see what I mean. When one goes to a chain they expect to receive the same\/similar experience. \n\nGo to Markham\/Scarborough location from the exact same menu, order any item and it's comes out the same. However here it looks completely different. They made us pay for something that should have been already included in the dish. \n\nI'll be happy if I could save one Customer from having a terrible experience n would stop going here after reading this review. You'll understand why I'm so upset with this location only if you've been to other locations of Hakka Legend. \n\nFor anyone who needs proofs, pictures and videos of the same dish ordered at Mississauga and Markham that doesn't even look same hit me up.\n\nLong story short- These guys need to listen and act to the customers feedback. Also pull your team together and arrive to one recipe for all locations. And stop hiring \"JERKS\"
