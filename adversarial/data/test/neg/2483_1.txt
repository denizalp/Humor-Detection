I was taking care of Heather the customer at my workplace, and noticed she was wearing a massage shirt. My job at that time required 8 hours of standing on a concrete and tile floor, which was further aggravating a hip problem. Having had massage therapy in the past, I knew this was the right solution.\n\nHeather provides a comforting environment and offers several different options depending on what your personal needs are. Each time I have left after a session, the pain in my hip is gone, which is the happiest ending you can get.\n\nProfessional, clean and no funny business makes this a great experience worth repeating. I've had several sessions already, and plan to have more. And did I mention, Heather is a very attractive woman with a great personality. I'm really glad my old job connected me to her. You will be very happy with your sessions!! I can't wait for my next one.
