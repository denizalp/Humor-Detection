Can't say that it is authentic Mexican, but the food was very good. Before you get to your order, they will serve you flavorful crispy thin chips that are salted just right. And then of course, you have to try their salsas of different flavors and levels of spiciness-two of them we loved so much that we bought a small container to take home. \n\nThe entire staff was friendly and very willing to explain their menu...they make their salsa fresh everyday from organic ingredients!
