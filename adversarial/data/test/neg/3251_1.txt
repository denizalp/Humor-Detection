Great Thai Food! We walked in at around 7:45pm and the place was empty but by 8:15pm the place was filling up. Service was great, friendly staff. Everything our group ordered was delicious. We started with the crab lettuce wraps. Had a nice kick to it and the sweetness of the coconut flakes was a tasty surprise. We had the Panang Duck, Pad Thai with Shrimp, Pork Pad Gra Prow (minced pork in basil and chili) and Chinese Broccoli with Pork Belly.  Enjoyed it all and decent portions for the price. I thought the prices were very fair. They have a pretty good wine list. This place can normally be very busy I'm told, so make reservations if you don't want to wait- it's not a big place. Fist Visit and I will definitely be back.
