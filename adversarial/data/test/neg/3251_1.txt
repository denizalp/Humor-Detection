Great German food don't know what all the other poster's are talking about. Wife,daughter, and I were all pleased with the food...the beer sampler was great also.. I didn't get sick, my food came out hotter than hell I had to let it sit to cool, and the wait staff was excellent. We went on a Friday night and it was packed.. I expected worse for how crowded it was... We will be returning..
