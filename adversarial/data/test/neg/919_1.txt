Delicious food and great ambience out on the patio.  Upscale but not at all pretentious or \"Vegas-y.\"  The menu offers plenty of options whether you prefer red meat, chicken, seafood, or veggies.  Or if you simply want chips, salsa, and a beverage or two you'll be all set.  There's a special which includes a sampling of appetizers, a choice of several main courses, and a dessert.  This was a great value, as the apps and dessert were plenty to share with a few people.  The Green Chicken Poblano Enchiladas were great, even though I ended up mostly eating the chicken inside because I was saving room for the tres leches cake.  Yum!!
