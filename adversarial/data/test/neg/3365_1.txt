Came in on a Friday night around 6:30pm on the recommendation of someone I got to chatting to while bottling wine the other week.  I was told that they had 18 beers on tap, and full pints (20oz, not the reduced size they're pushing downtown these days) were always on for $6, so I was sold!\n\nThe place was close to half full already - a good sign that early in the night, though a Raptors game was coming on later.  The staff were great, and I was pleasantly surprised to see one of my fav (but hard to find) drafts on tap - Kronenbourg Blanc!  \n\nFood-wise, I had the nachos and they were quite nice - and probably one of the best layered I've ever had (chips underneath weren't bare).  Price\/value-wise, definitely a good deal.  Only exception - $3 for fruit juice - that seemed steep.\n\nThey also don't have a kids' menu but were able to strip down the chicken poutine to just a standard poutine (and charged less), which was quite nice.  They also apparently plan on having a kids' menu at some point.\n\nThe guy who chatted with us (dang, forget his name - he's a songwriter that's all I remember) was awesome - giving us some background on the place and about future plans.  Apparently the owner also owns pubs (Firkins) in Toronto as well, and it shows in the high quality of the setup and food here.\n\nOnly other negative - the tables are new but don't really match the other bar decor - wooden pub-style ones would match better and feel more appropriate than the current light-coloured tables.  See the pictures someone else uploaded to see what I'm talking about.  They told us they've had the same thoughts and are still thinking about these as well.\n\nOK that all said, this place has definitely 5 star potential - minor hiccups in the decor and pricing notwithstanding, I'm going to be back here soon and hope to upgrade this to a 5 star.  Even in its current state though, best pub in town!
