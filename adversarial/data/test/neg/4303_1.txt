This is a wonderful company. Even though I had only one item to move they made me feel it was important to them. They took great care in wrapping and protecting my cabinet for the move. I wish I remembered the names of the two guys who moved my cabinet as they deserve high praise. They were extremely professional and very friendly. I highly recommend this company and will definitely use them again.
