It's one of the best spots to visit in Vegas with great music, great beer and a fun time dancing.  The food is traditional pub choices, the servers are friendly, the Irish dancers on high tables are cool and not trashy or sleazy.  The music is stellar and the band is always into it, and I've stopped in about 5 times and have never been disappointed.
