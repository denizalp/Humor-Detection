I went to Pink Cherry for the first time today and had a waxing appointment with Shomari. She was FANTASTIC!! The girls are the front are super sweet and everyone was very understanding when I was a few minutes late for my appointment due to traffic. The appointment went so smoothly and I was so comfortable thanks to Shomari! The salon is adorable and clean and they use the best products! I will definitely be back!
