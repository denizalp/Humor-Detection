I attended a wedding reception here and it was a great facility for a dinner event.  Of course, the facility was beautiful  and staff was friendly. The food was pretty good.   The layout was perfect for an event like this -  there was plenty of room for lots of large dinner tables as well as a dance floor.  They kept the beverage stations open and well stocked.  The bride and groom were very pleased and the guests had a great time.
