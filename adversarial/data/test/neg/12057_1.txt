Decent place to hang out. VERY chill atmosphere. I like playing the computer games offered in the middle of the bar. \nTheir wings is what make the place, in my opinion. The jumbo wings come with the drum & wing attached. So for the money, a half dozen is really a dozen \"wing dings\". Their buffalo garlic parm sauce is on point, and you can't go wrong with it. \nThe sweet potato fries are plain though the fries are okay. \nThe Italian sandwich was big. I liked putting the Italian dressing offered all over the sandwich or dipping it. \nFair prices on drinks.
