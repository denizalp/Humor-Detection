As Misti, our Las Vegas CM, mentioned you could come here and chill and read a book and have some food or a beverage.\n\nHowever,... \n\nThe atmosphere is less than desirable. Yes, there are couches. Yes there's some tables. But the place needs more color and sound. I asked the manager to put on some music in the future. They had a movie playing on the TV when I arrived. Totally not a movie I would associate with Elixir, mindful eating or general well-being. Like,... put on a surfing movie at least. Not National Lampoon's European Vacation!\n\nThe space reminds me of a cafe that used to be in the Lower Haight in San Francisco called, \"Common Ground.\" The coffee was good. The music (which ranged from Reggae to Indy-rock) was decent and there were some good food choices. This place needs to embrace their cafe\/ lounge attitude and play some darn music!\n\nThe Caesar salad was fair. The blue cheese burger was overcooked like... well, well done, and I wasn't asked a temperature by the server. The server didn't bring enough setups and I was given the reasoning that the table was small so they try to conserve. Um... utensils are utensils. I need them to eat.\n\nSome things should just be a given when it comes to service.\nI think she saw two entrees ordered and brought just two setups because of it. But.... there were 3 of us. And yes, I had to ask for an extra plate. Good service should predict a customers needs. This place needs some serious training.\n\nBack to the food... as someone else said, they have good intentions. I liked the choices of bread, meats and veggie options for their burgers. Presentation of the food needs some work. Right now, I might as well be at the Waffle House and not a healthy choice restaurant.\n\nWith competition like Greens and Protein and the Raw Cafe, this place is going to need to pull it together with their atmosphere, service and food in order to stay in the game.
