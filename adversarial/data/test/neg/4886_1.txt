We come to Scottsdale once a year.  We discovered Cafe Monarch 2 years ago  when they were in the old building.   This was our most eagerly anticipated meal!   No one was disappointed.  The food was fabulous!  Each course was perfect.  \n\nI could only give 4 stars and debated about giving only 3 stars.   We were a large party dining for dinner at the later seating. We had a delicious meal with a hefty bill...I only wish the service had been as good.    For a restaurant of this caliber,  we expected much better service.    Little things like having to \"ask\" for more water to our table being cleared as we were finishing desert.  (As I said we were the later seating and the restaurant was still quite full.   In other words, we did not overstay.  In fact, it felt like we were pushed out). Considering the cost of dining here, this was simply unacceptable.     If they did not want a large party, they should not have taken our reservation.    Needless to say, we won't be returning as there are plenty of great options in the area that are the whole package..food, atmosphere and service.
