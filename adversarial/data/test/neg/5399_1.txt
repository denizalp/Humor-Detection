Excelente. Bravo. Encore. \nI wish I could've taken some to-go. mwahah..\n\nThe price (about $30\/each) was competitive with other quality dinner buffets in Vegas.\n\nThe selection of foods and desserts was wonderful. The juicy prime rib, and swordfish filets were DE-LICIOUS!\n\nI piled one of everything that I found particularly appetizing and savory on my plate, and I did the same thing with the desserts in an attempt to sample almost everything. That's what buffets are for!..It was all so tasty.\n\nThe one thing they can improve on is to have really fresh sashimi and\/or nigiri at the sushi bar. I have yet to see outstanding sushi at a buffet. Maybe that's not possible..=) But I did take a spicy tuna handroll for the heck of it.\n\nBellagio Buffet \ntruly is \none of the best buffets \nin Vegas.\n\nI also like Le Village Buffet at Paris (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/le-village-buffet-las-vegas). I still need to try Wynn's. It was too crowded when we walked past (also more expensive.)
