This place has really great mexican food.  Carne Asada is quite good and the three salsas you get with each order are all great.  They actually toast their burritos on all sides.  Nice touch that adds nice flavor.\n\nI orderded a carne asada burrito and one shrimp and one fish taco.  The carne asada part was great.  Thing is they put rice and beans in the burro so I am not getting that mouth full of the wonderful beef that I would like.  It is on the menu that way so can't really complain.\n\nThe shrimp taco was good, nothing crazy but I did enjoy.\n\nThe fish taco was great!  Great sauce and perfectly cooked fish.  I'll be ordering that again for sure.\n\nThe first time I went I also got an asada burro but got a barbacoa taco also.  The barbacoa is very good also and the burro was identical to the first time, which is a good thing.\n\nI have to say that I was a little put off by one of the owners over a Yelp coupon.  He eventually said he would accept the coupon.  \n\nMust say I'll be back though.\n\nPrices are a little higher than the norm (so is the quality) so buy the Yelp gift cert or groupon.\n\nEnjoy.
