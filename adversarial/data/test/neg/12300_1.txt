Came in last week celebrating my bday. We walked right up to the bar. The drinks were good and we just ordered fries and the bacon wrapped pretzels. Both GREAT I'm gonna miss the fries. The bar tender offered a bday shot and chatted with my and my husband. So Friday we went back for breakfast Hash House was waaaay to busy. We had a few more people but still got a tabel fast. The service was slow but Vegas never closes so we didn't have anyplace we had to be. I got the biscuits and gravy. Yummmy best biscuit I have ever had. Everyone is complaining about the price. Yes it was expensive it is the Las Vegas Strip nothing is cheap. I will surely stop bye again. I loved it the 4 stars was for the service lacking but no thing to keep me away.
