I have been a client since 2009 and this place keeps getting better. They recently started offering more treatments in their clinic and it seems they have extended their hours. Out of the other schools I've tried out, SWINA's clinic is open the longest and has the best schedule options. I have to schedule in advance but I can always get an evening (7:30pm) or Saturday appointment. They use awesome products and always have a product on sale. I have actually learned so much about my skin type from the all the instructors and some of the students who highly educated. There are individual\/private rooms instead of an open area with curtains like other schools This place can get really busy and they are running a real business and have strict client policies. It is clear their students come first (obviously bc they are a school) and I understand that. I've had an appointment canceled last minute bc a student was out sick. But they were so sweet about it and offered me a complimentary service due to the inconvenience. I had this happen to me at Ulta's salon and the Ulta manager could care less and did not offer me any accommodations due to the inconvenience.  I would rather give SWINA my business over any real spa because I always have a good experience.  I always treat my out of town visitors with a facial at SWINA. It does not break the bank and we still get to \"go to the spa\".
