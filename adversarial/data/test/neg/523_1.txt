Cool spot! \nI had a Vietnamese iced coffee with buba (free buba, thanks to the check in coupon) and it was really good. \nBe sure to go to the back yard so you can enjoy the  Asian style decor and play some giant Jenga or tic tac toe. They also have a photo booth set up inside in front of their mural.
