This was a really great ramen place with tasty food and reasonable prices. When me and my friend came all the tables were occupied but we only had to wait 5 minutes. \n\nThe soups broth was tasty; I've been to ramen places downtown that were much more expensive but tasted really bland. \n\nI ordered number 1 which is the most popular, it's just like the traditional style but also comes with milk in the soup broth which made it more creamy. There was just one server girl but she managed fine and the service was great. I would recommend this place. It's quiet and cozy.
