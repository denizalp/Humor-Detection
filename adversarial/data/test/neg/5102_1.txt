We love Triple D and Guy Fieri, so wanted to try his place while in Vegas.  We loved the atmosphere of the place and the menu looked really good. I had the Greek Salad and my husband had the wings.  They were both very tasty. \n\nThe wings were\"trimmed into \"lollipop\" shapes, to make them easier to eat\", in doing so they took  the one part of the chicken, with the least amount of meat, and cut off half of the meat to make the \"lollipop\" shape.  I don't know who thought that would be a good idea, but stop it!!  Wings are messy, give me a wet nap, don't cut the meat off the wings.  Maybe they thought by taking off half of the meat, you had less to eat, thus less time to get messy??  Not sure, but for those prices, I want ALL of the meat left on my wings. I'll deal with being messy. \n\nThe Greek salad was very good, but the lettuce was not cut up, at all, and by the time I finished cutting it, and was ready to eat, my husband had eaten all but one of his wing \"lollipops\".  Thankfully I looked up in time to stop him from eating the last one and was able to try them.
