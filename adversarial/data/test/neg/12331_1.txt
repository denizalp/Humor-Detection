I really love the sandwiches and the service at Philly's Famous, you get the feeling that (most of) the staff actually wants you to enjoy your meal. I will say there is room for improvement on the fries, but they're not bad by any means. Any place with a flat top can make a cheesesteak, but the quality of the steak itself and the bread separate the winners from the losers...and Philly's Famous is a winner in my book!
