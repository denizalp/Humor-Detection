First time trying restaurant and it was a wonderful experience. The waiter explained the four-course Prix fixe for $45 which sounded wonderful but was too much food for my colleague.  We both ordered entrees and shared the Dan Dan which was recommended by the waiter.  It was extremely flavorfull and I really enjoyed it as an appetizer. I thoroughly enjoyed the diver scallops and my colleague enjoyed her filet!  I would definitely come back again!  The service was outstanding and the employees were very personable!
