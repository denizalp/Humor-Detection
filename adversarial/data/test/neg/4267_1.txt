I have been a member of this Y for about 6 months. It has been a wonderful experience. I have been a member of many gyms but the Y if the first one where the sense of community is obvious and infectious. I started taking spin classes here (they are very popular here for good reason!) the instructors and staff really know how to make you feel at home. All the facilities are clean and the price is right. If you are looking for a motivating environment to get into shape this year this is the place!
