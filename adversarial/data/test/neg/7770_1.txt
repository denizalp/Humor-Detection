A cute and relaxed atmosphere.I got the American cheeseburger with mashed red skinned potatoes. It was cooked, like I asked, medium rare and it tasted fine.The potatoes, a huge serving, enough for 2 or 3 people, were good.I took most of them home. I got the cobbler of the day, peach, served with a,scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was good, took most of IT  home.\nThe very best part of my first visit was my server, Angelica. She was great!!!\nNext time, I will order breakfast ,
