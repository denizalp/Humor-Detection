I was skeptical of driving out to Steel Creek when Concord is much closer to me for outlet shopping, but I really did not want to brave the madness in Concord during the holiday season. Charlotte Premium Outlets is a smart choice if you are looking for some bargains, understand what outlet shopping actually entails, and are willing to go earlier in the day to avoid crowds. I've never had issues with parking by showing up around opening time. I also appreciate outdoor shopping even in December. I think there is a decent selection of stores with something for everyone, including some luxury brands and toy stores for the kids. It is also pretty easy to navigate. I haven't checked out the food court, but food courts are not really my thing...
