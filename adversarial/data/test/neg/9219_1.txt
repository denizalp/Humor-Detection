Heard of its famous name. Finally have a chance to try. Ordered a Matcha Tiramisu. There's a sprinkle of matcha powder on top of the Tiramisu and the bottom is another layer of matcha cake. It has a rich flavour of matcha and at the same time of the sweetness of Tiramisu on top. It's perfectly made. \n\nBesides, the cashier is very nice. She spotted there are seat available and asked the customers to move to the side to create space for us to sit. I would say both product and service are excellent here. I would want to come back to try their cheese tarts and other desserts.
