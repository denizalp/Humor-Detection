This place is pretty awesome for breakfast.  It was featured on an episode of Diners, Drive In's, and Dives with Guy Fiery.  Located on the the outskirts of Pittsburgh, no major issues with traffic in this area.  The restaurant setting as a whole is nothing really special, typical diner setup, tables pretty tight, and a few spots to sit at bar seating up by the cash register.  Service is about average, expect to wait a little bit due to the restaurants popularity.  We waited about 25-30 minutes for a table, but considering we got there 10:00am on the Sunday following St Patrick's Day, felt this was not bad.  It did seem to get a lot busier around 10:30-11:00 though.\n\nThe food was really great.  My daughter got the chocolate chip pancakes.  If you are into light and fluffy, these might not be up your alley, they are extremely dense, and I thought that they were crazy good.  Whatever my daughter couldn't eat, I was glad to finish for her, just really different and really good!  I had a the Spicy Omelette which had pepper jack cheese, onions, peppers and sausage and was really delicious.  Home fries were also good.  Also got a side order of the potato pancakes, and weren't bad.  My son had the raspberry French toast which are served with a raspberry cream cheese and raspberry drizzle and very good as well.  This seemed to be one of there more popular specialties.  My wife and one of the daily specials which was an Irish Hash, which she also liked.\n\nOverall very good, and next time we are in the Pittsburgh area will make it a point to come back!
