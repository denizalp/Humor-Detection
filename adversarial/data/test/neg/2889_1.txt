I feel weird reviewing a pharmacy,  but the service here prompted me to do so. I met one of the pharmacy tech's elsewhere and she clued me into this little gem. The location is nearly 30 minutes from my house and Dr's offices, yet I am going to continue to come back.\nThe fill time is super fast, like 5-10 minutes, they remember your name and welcome you as you walk in the door, the Pharmacist always offers you a bottled water and you know they did everything in their power to get you the best price possible.
