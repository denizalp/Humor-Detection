A new BBQ shack offering a variety of different sandwiches, combo plates, ribs, salads wings and more. You can also buy whole \"family sized\" meals and chopped BBQ pork or chicken by the pound.\n\nApparently by the name, the Ribs must be their specialty, though I opted for the smothered pork sandwich which was chopped pork with slaw on a toasted bun(see pics) Out of the 12 different sides I chose mac and cheese. \n\nI wasn't impressed with the mac and cheese, it was too processed for my liking but I did like the sandwich, the meat had a nice flavor and the slaw was crisp and refreshing.\n\nI would likely return to have that sandwich again. \n\nI'm gonna go with 3 stars for now until I have a chance to try some more items, but all in all it was a good experience,service by friendly staff in a clean industrial shack dining area. \n\nLooks like they have a Happy Vally and Glendale location too.
