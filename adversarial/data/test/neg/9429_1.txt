There are several great aspects to this company. First, I'll start with the downfall... because I can only think of one. The wait at the drive-through is extremely long, it could be sped up quite a bit because it doesn't actually save time from what it would take to park and walk in. I was the only customer in the drive-through, after placing my order I spent about 5 minutes waiting at the window -- longer than expected, but tolerable.\n\nHowever, on the plus side there's a DRIVE-THROUGH.  Although it may take less time to just park and walk inside, the benefit of having a drive-through is that you don't have to get ready in the morning or late at night. The drive-through and shop are open 24 hours a day...how many more ways can I say \"amazing\"??\n\nNext - I love boba tea and usually have to drive 20 minutes to Chandler for a decent one from Boba Tea House in Lee Lee's market place complex. Not anymore! This place also sells my favorite taro milk tea. \n\nFinally, not only was the staff extremely friendly (almost overly friendly, but in a positive way), the donuts are delicious and fresh -- I'd recommend this place over the big chains (Dunkin Donuts, Krispy Kreme) any day! Extremely cheap, but be aware: They will not accept credit or debit cards for purchases under $3.  \n\n5 stars in my book!
