I just happened to be in this area and decided to try this place out. I have no regrets!! The food portions are HUGE, prices are good, the atmosphere is so lively and aesthetic. We ordered the bulgogi, kim bap, and tonkatsu. The customer service is fantastic!! We came in around almost midnight and everyone was attentive and the food came quickly. Probably one of the best Korean restaurants I've been to in LV. I will be coming back!
