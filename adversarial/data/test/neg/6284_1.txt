Who doesn't love candles? I can admit now that I'm older I have more of an appreciation for candles. I never understood why my mom always had so many. \n\nNow that I have my own place, I am candle obsessed! Yankee Candle has a great variety of candles from car air freshener to candle plug ins to regular jar candles and many more! \n\nMy favorite thing about this store is that they always have promotions! Sometimes I'll go in purchasing a couple items for under $5! My favorite item here is their scented ball spheres. It's perfected for places that candles just can't do justice like laundry rooms and closets! \n\nThe workers working here are always so nice and friendly
