Amazing menu!  Seafood specials (or anything on the specials menu) are a must to try.  Didn't even order anything off menu - just specials which you won't know til you get there. Not too many tables, but would highly recommend reservations (ask to sit at bar so you can view kitchen). Service was good too!  Usually can find one area of improvement but not this time - will definitely be back. Only suggestion is to be open on Sundays.
