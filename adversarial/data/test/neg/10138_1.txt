2.5 stars. \n\nService was good. Coffee was OK, nothing special. I like that it's a wholesome place (Christian music in the background was nice), but the feel of the place is not that chill which is really what you want out of a coffee joint. The decor is all over the place. They seem nice so I hope they are able to stay in business but they really need some direction on how to design or arrange the place. I definitely wanted to just drink my coffee quickly and get out. I didn't finish the cup before leaving. \n\nSummary: Seems like a nice place but not what you want from a coffee shop and no where near the experience that some of the other local coffee places (Bergie's, Inside the Bungalow, etc) are putting out.
