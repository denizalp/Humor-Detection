Not a good day for service and food. We had to wait over an hour for our food. Took several try's but found out the kitchen was backed up and it was 3 pm on a Sunday. Poke bowl very disappointing- crunchy rice, absolutely no flavor other than the sesame oil to drizzle on the tuna and lettuce, complete lack of seasoning. Steak tacos equally as bad - no seasoning and tiny amount of beef. Not worth the price.
