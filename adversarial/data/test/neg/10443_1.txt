Finally tried after all the type of had heard of.\n\nReally wasn't that impressed. Food was okay only thing that really stood out was the fish tacos, and the skewers. Garlic chicken and kahana chicken was tender, full of flavor and spice. My daughter liked it. 808 specially was the only one i liked. When it came to the others. I've had better sushi.\n\n It was happy hour. We ordered food, that took over 16 mins, by the time we received it, it was after 4 and they tried to charge us full price. No we ordered it over 15 minutes ago, that's not fair,
