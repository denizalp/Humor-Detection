This was my first visit and let me tell you very impressed! As soon as I came in customer service was great! The cashier immediately greeted me, she asked if I've eaten there before I explained to her it was my first time and she helped me look over the menu and decide on the steak nachos which were sooo good! Even while being prepared it smelled sooo good. They even offer a free meal on your birthday, which mine is around the corner! Definitely will be taking advantage!!
