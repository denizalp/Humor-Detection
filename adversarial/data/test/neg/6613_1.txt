1st time here and it met my expectations of a bomb tasting donut.  Luckily there was no line when i got there on a saturday morning but it did start forming when i started my order.  I ordered a dozen: 2 taro coconut, 2 pistachios, 2 cookies n cream, 2 fruity pebbles, 2 bacon donuts, 1 m&m donut, and 1 churro donut.  \n\nUnfortunately i can't eat them all in one sitting so to keep it tasting fresh i would microwave 1 donut for at least 14 seconds and to me it would taste just like you ordered it over the counter.  I can't pinpoint which donut was my favorite but that's why i ordered these flavors cuz all of them were bombskis!\n\nThe cashier could've been more friendly but since she didn't mind checking my phone that i checked in or not into yelp to receive the 10% discount, i'll let the customer service still achieve a star plus i didn't have to wait long.
