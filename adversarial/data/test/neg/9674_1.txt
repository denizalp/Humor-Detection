Awesome salon and environment. Staff was really helpful and knew what they were talking about, plus took into account exactly what I wanted in terms of a look. Used scissors and not clippers with a great attention to detail. \n\nServe a variety of beverages including beer. \n\nJust a great all around environment and will certainly be going back. Great addition to the Southend Neighborhood!
