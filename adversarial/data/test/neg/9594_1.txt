So I have been debating to come to this location since I have been loyal to Blaze Pizza that is literally on the other side of bell road. Craving a personal pan pizza and said what the hey ! Ordering online and creating your own personal pan pizza is super convenient. I am a white sauce guy so went with the white sauce, fresh mozzarella cheese , bacon and mushroom toppings. I did like they have an assortment of sauces or dressing for the pizzas, so I went with the pesto sauce. I did fail to mention that I added cilantro to the mix and let me tell you that the cilantro was was set this pizza above Blaze or fired pie place ! All of the ingredients mentioned are super fresh and the pizza dough was thin and crispy so that made me feel better with the carb intake! Lastly, the unsweetened watermelon tea is the first of its kind that I have ever tasted and was delicious! This location is definitely worth a try and coming back repeatedly! Cheers!
