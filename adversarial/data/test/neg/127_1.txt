This is my favorite U-Haul locations.  I work down sizing seniors and staging, and this location goes out of their way to be friendly and helpful.  They always help load boxes in our car, and always have a friendly word to offer.  I also rent storage from them, and had no problems. .  Would offer one tip.. if you need something on Saturday morning, try to get in on Friday evening.  Line ups are crazy on Saturday mornings at month end.  Not the fault of anyone at this location... just renting takes time!
