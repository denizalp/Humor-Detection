Ryan the customer service representative at this location was wonderful . I completely shattered my iPhone over the weekend at a wedding in Lake Tahoe and he has made it look brand spanking new! Thanks a million for all of your help ! I'm off to another wedding this weekend and plan to keep my phone in it's protective case.
