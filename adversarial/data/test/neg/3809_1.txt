I was introduced to Great Harvest Bread when I lived in Virginia. It was very popular there, but it's not quite so at the one in Henderson. I was hoping to find the same bread that I got in Virginia--one that had all seeds, but they told me they all do their own thing. That bread was the best bread I ever had. I still get their white bread and honey bread. The bread is pricey, but I do love them. I love how they give free, huge slices of bread with butter on them to try. I've taken advantage of this to try some of their desserts. Sometimes I'll like them enough to buy them. Although I love their bread, this store only deserves three stars (possibly less) because they are seriously lacking in customer service. The cashier seemed plain miserable and needs to take some happy pills or find another job where she doesn't have to help people!
