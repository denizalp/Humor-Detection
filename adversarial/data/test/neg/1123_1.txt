I am writing this review because we came here for brunch based on a good review from what I consider to be a reputable source, a review I now find baffling. \n\nThe service was efficient and polite, and there was no wait for a table but the food was really, really sub-par. We had the Biscuits and Gravy and the Southern Skillet and found them both very tasteless and under-seasoned. The ingredients did not seem to be of a very high quality and the portions were less than generous for the price also. \n\nLike most people who live in Toronto I have been to a lot of brunch spots and this one does not hold up. \n\nI don't know if maybe the vegan and veggie options are the real draw here or if it was just an off day but based on my experience I would definitely not return here for brunch and I cannot recommend it.
