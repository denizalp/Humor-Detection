First time at this place and I was very impressed. I can be a bit too critical of places, but I can't think of one negative thing! Warm welcome, great waitress, amazing salsa and chips. This place was referred to me and my family, who were with me, would do the same. We all had a great time and meal here. The fajitas were on point...full of flavor, NOT dry (which happens a lot at other places) and had great sides. Not to mention the house made tortillas! I can't wait to come back.
