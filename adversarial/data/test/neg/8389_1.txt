We stopped in for a quick dinner\/drinks around happy hour and was pleasantly surprised! The happy hour prices are spot on for appetizers and beer while watching one of the many TVs. We started with the calamari that were coated in a much lighter batter than other places- yum! I wasn't a fan of the sauce it came with, but they were able to bring a side of ranch for me to enjoy. Our entree's came out quickly and I couldn't be happier! The buffalo chicken sandwich was the perfect amount of spice and I had upgraded to the potato soup to make the meal even better. My husband raved about the carne asada and the portion sizes were perfect. We will definitely be back!
