I ordered the chicken avocado wrap and side greens to go ($14). \n\nThe greens inside the wrap were wilted, soggy and brown. The wrap itself was grilled, which gave the unripe, hard, avocado a very strange flavor (who heats avocado?). The chicken in the wrap was way too spiced and there was a sweet sauce that I could not identify.\n\nThe entire wrap fell apart after one bite; it was truly inedible!\n\nThe greens on the side were just that - greens, with two small cucumber slices. The balsamic dressing did not even partly mask the intense bitter flavor of the greens.\n\nFriendly service, but unfortunately the food was inedible.
