First it is not obvious but there is a cover- charge of $6 per person. The drinks are way over priced considering the decor which is basic at best. However that, and the sometimes long wait to get seated are the only negatives. The \"games master\" when he finally arrived at our table, suggested a fun 2 player game, then very patiently and clearly explained how to play, and stayed with us while we got started to make sure we actually understood. There were loads of options from word to strategy games & classics like Jenga (which was actually very popular) and even the trendy \"Cards Against Humanity\". You could literally spend all evening there. Probably a great place for a first date. You can learn a lot about people from how they play games and how they behave when they win or lose. Maybe because we went in the evening on a week night but I didn't see any children or families there. And the cover charge is steep if you in bring a lot if children...seems like a more adult venue but at the same time I think kids, especially preteens would enjoy themselves. I didn't tip as I was feeling the sting of the $6 per person fee and the semi hidden charge for the flavour in the hot chocolate but I had fun. Would recommend you tryvit at least once. Great concept, could use a little finessing.
