I just went to O.Noir for the first time last night for a surprise birthday. The experience itself was really cool and also confronting. Having absolutely no vision meant we were very engaged as a group (with no one being able to text on their phones etc) and also humorous as people tried to feel their way around their plate to find their food.\n\nI enjoyed the service I received. Our sever was very friendly and a few of our main dishes were late due to a mix up so he offered us an inconvenience discount without us even asking. The food however was completely unremarkable. There were limited vegetarian options for the main so I decided on the portobello mushroom app and tomato penne pasta main. The pasta was so average - I would have expected this of a cheap pub rather than a $$$ restaurant. I also ordered a gin crantini and not only did it not taste like gin it did not taste like cranberry...more like a cherry starburst liqueur.\n\nThings I liked:\n- the novelty of the experience \n- nice service and server\n- the discount for the wait was a nice touch\n- the fact that they offer surprise mains and desserts (fun)\n- the servers themselves are visually impaired and it must be a rewarding experience for them \n\nThings to improve:\n- change up the food (this is a great opportunity to be different and utilize everyone's enhanced taste buds... So why be totally generic?)\n- offer more classic cocktails (what kind of full bar restaurant doesn't do mojitos?)\n- change up the wine list\n\nWould I go back? Maybe if they changed the menu. I don't intend to pay for that pasta again.\n\n* I would have liked to give this place 2 stars but I feel bad because the sever was so nice. 2.5 stars rounded up to 3 on the Yelp rating system ;)
