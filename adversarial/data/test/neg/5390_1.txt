We stayed in the suite with 1.5 bath, got a great deal PLUS a $100 dining credit. \n\nThe first afternoon there the shower started overflowing while I was in it and somehow the bathtub (never used it) started bubbling black-tinged water. I called down to the front desk and they sent somebody up to remedy the situation and housekeeping took care of the mess afterwards. It was very well handled in my opinion, and these things happen anyway....so many hotels with so many hotel rooms and so much plumbing in all of Vegas. Something's bound to happen eventually.\n\nThe rest of the stay went very smoothly and the concierge was VERY helpful in recommending things and giving us directions. They even helped us out with last minute dinner reservations. \n\nThe bed was so comfortable, so was the couch and the internet is included with the resort fee. There's a TV in the bathroom (didn't get time to use it unfortunately) and even a phone! The bathtub was huge and looked quite inviting even though I didn't get to use it, but the shower was awesome (black marble, standing shower with glass doors). Lots of closet and drawer space too and PLENTY of mirrors and a variety of lighting options. Two sinks too which was more than enough room to get ready.\n\nWhen we were waiting in the checkout line Sunday morning one of the staff approached us and asked if we'd like to use Express Checkout or wait to get to the desk and see our bill. We asked to see the bill, but the lady told us to 'wait a minute,' went and printed it for us and everything looked fine so she went ahead and did the express checkout so we didn't have to wait. SO CONVENIENT!\n\nWe used the rest of the afternoon enjoying some last-minute attractions and spent some time in the casino too :)\n\nLove the decor and their selection of available restaurants. The buffet here is AWESOME and I loved the sushi at China Grill. Next time I'd love to visit MIX lounge, i love this hotel!
