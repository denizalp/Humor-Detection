After seeing the reviews on Yelp and wanting a good chuckle, I was determined to eat at the Peppermill. After a L-O-N-G night of drinking and a bottle of whiskey later, we decided that the Peppermill was a good place to cure the hangover before we hit the road to go home. The food was just alright. I had the beef dip sandwich and fries. The man had the pancake special. Holly be-jezus...the pancakes were HUGE! I do have to give a shout out to our waiter although I didn't catch his name. He was super attentive and on his A-Game. Kudos. The decor is a throwback of the 70's, which is super cheezy but like I said, good for a laugh. Would I eat here again? Maybe...especially to soak up all the liquor from the night before.
