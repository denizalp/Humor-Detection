We were at the Border Grill on Valentine's day, the food was amazing!! I had the chicken poblano enchiladas and they were incredible!  Our waitress on the other hand was not so great! A man delivered our menus and chips and he was much more friendly and helpful than our waitress who referred to Him her assistant, should have been the other way around.  Once I got a drink it was great, but she was slow, rude and didnt even tell us the specials.  I asked for a side of something and my meal was over by the time she had it delivered.  Then we waited fifteen minutes just to get our check!  Great food!  Bad waitress!  Would go again and hope for a better server.
