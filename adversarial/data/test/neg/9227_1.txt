Location, location, location ... not going to lie, this is a tough spot to find. The forgotten end of sea of never ending strip malls. Once you're inside you'll find the restaurant is tropical themed with a few tables along the wall, a few more in the middle, and a \"specials\" board along the wall. \n\nThe food is all vegan and very, very tasty. The only reason I knocked off a star is that the french fries were a bit soggy. When I order fries, I want them to be super crispy. We tried the impossible burger as well as the tacos and it was all super tasty. I would say the burger was the big winner, not necessarily because of the burger itself, but the flavors that the chef mixed together were amazing ... peanut butter, jelly, other stuff, it was delicious.\n\nThe service is great, the restaurant is small and you feel the love of the family that owns and runs it. \n\nOverall I would say it's worth a visit regardless of whether or not you're a vegan. I just wish it was a little closer to my home and that the prices were a smidgen less (certainly wouldn't' keep me from returning)
