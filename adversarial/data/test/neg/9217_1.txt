First: I shop at this store, Stouffville WalMart, The nearby No Frills, and The Garden Basket.\n\nThe PROs: Their international section is fantastic, better than No Frills. I can get everything I need for a Mexican feast (enchilada sauce, soft corn tortillas)! Also the only place I can find Quinoa, parmigiano, and fresh pasta(ravioli, tortellini) at a reasonable price. They have cereals that other stores do not have, I'm talking Cookie Crisp...ah nostalgia!! The sales on ice cream, cookies, crackers and cereal are quite good and frequent. The employees remember you and are super friendly.\n\nThe CONs: No Frills produce is better. The selection of milk alternatives is poor, only almond and soy, no refrigerated Coconut Milk. The personal hygiene product selection (body wash, shampoo) is poor. They have two employees that stock shelves that have glaring body odour issues.
