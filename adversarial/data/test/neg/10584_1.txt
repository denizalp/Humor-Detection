Very nice higher end type of gastropub right in the stadium district of downtown Phoenix.  Food was restaurant quality on the entrees and bar quality on the appetizers.  The drink options were a little week in my opinion considering the pub-like atmosphere and location to a sporting venue haven.  \n\nWe began with the buffalo chicken appetizer.  Sauce was underwhelming, especially after the waiter hyped it up so much.  The wings themselves were dry rubbed rather than wet which I typically don't like anyways.  Tasty but not the best buffalo app I've had.  The cheese ravioli was cooked perfectly, slightly under-cooked, and huge portion size.  The scallops was an interesting dish at a pub, but considering Arrogant likes to promote their raw bar, I had to give it a go.  The entire dish was fantastic from the brussel and green side to the scallops themselves.  Big dish once again and very well presented.  We finally ordered the blueberry cheesecake.  Tasty graham cracker topping and perfect compliment dessert all around for our meal.\n\nDrinks were limited for draft and bottle beers.  They had some nice champagne and wine by the glass, but nothing too absurd.  We ordered an incredible rose sparkling wine for $50 and it was well worth the price tag.  \n\nIn total, the meal came out to about $130 in all.  Pretty cheap considering the quality and the amount of food and booze.  Arrogant Butcher is rightfully so a staple of Phoenix.  Crowds are expected so make a reservation.
