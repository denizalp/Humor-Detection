Its good that there is an Indian joint in the casino which holds the most conferences and more options for vegetarian people. \n\nFor me personally - the indian tea , its not great but is better than dip dip tea with no taste, you get in other tea and coffee shops for double price.  \n\nMost of the time I have only tea at this place which is also just okay. Its inconsistent and they don't keep brown sugar so I usually carry my own. \nI did try a few things here like masala dosa and papri chat. It feels like they server pre-made frozen stuff diluted as the species are less, salt is missing and everything is quiet tasteless. \nThey used chole gravy instead of tamarind chutney in papri chat - who does that ? \nDosa without salt, i had to use hot sauce to spice up otherwise it was unpalatable. \n\nI will still go back there for tea for lack of choice else where but i am done with eating any of their food. \nService is pretty slow too. \nThey need to have separate line for tea.
