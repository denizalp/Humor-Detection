I am very impressed with the professionalism and efficiency displayed in this Scottsdale dealership. There was no pressure from Gino, my friendly salesman, who insisted I test drive the car as long as I wanted and to \"see what it could do.\" Lisa, who handled the financing, was incredible in getting me the best rate possible. Though I worked mostly with Gino and Lisa, everyone I met at the dealership was very friendly. I felt comfortable during the entire transaction and would recommend Luxor to everyone.
