Update to my prior review:\n\nI have a Groupon to receive a pedicure and they refused to accept it because I've been there before. That's beyond ridiculous. Seems as if they are more interested in acquiring new customers and don't care about retaining business from current customers - seems backwards to me. Either way, they have officially lost me as a customer and I will not recommend them as a place to go.
