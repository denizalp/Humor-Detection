Ragstock is a weird but enjoyable mix of super trendy (think neon) and bulk thrift. \n\nRagstock carries both Men and Women's clothing. The walls are either painted kitschy or covered in movie and music posters. This place looks cool.\n\nThe price range for the thrift is reasonable. They aren't going to gouge out your eyes for a musty Letterman's jacket. I'v gotten a few cool pieces (kimono top) at reasonable prices. \n\nThe trendy stuff is sometimes oddly sized (I am a Medium\/Large and often cannot fit in the Ls they stock) and over priced for the quality, which is cheap($$).  \n\nThere is a basement of marked down items. Its a mishmash of stuff that didn't sell. Good luck.\n\nThe staff is very helpful and nice. Thanks, cool kids.\n\nI like looking around cause you never know what you're going to find. This place is especially good for Halloween shopping.
