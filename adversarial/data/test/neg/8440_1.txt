OMG!!!! A place to stop throwing it all \"AWAY\" does anyone know where away is anyway?? I was able to let go of so many things I had been hoarding because I felt bad and knew there had to be a better way to be disposed of. My cassette tapes, dvd,VHS, blow dryers, random small electrical stuff. Thank goodness they are here!! It was easy to find and they were friendly and ready help me unload my stuff. I was also able to bring reusable bags, they just dumped my stuff in bins and gave back the bags!! So wonderful to be supported in simple efforts and desire to live more in alignment with our planet and sustainable values!! Thank you so much Nevada State Recycle!!
