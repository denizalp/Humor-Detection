Love it here and the ambiance is quite charming and cozy! Love starting my day with their rosemary honey latte and for lunch all of their sandwiches are delish - especially the roast beef and the OMG. Happy hour is great with different options each day - my favorite being the wine and bruschetta! This place is close to my office and home so I love bringing clients here for a quick meet over coffee, lunch or happy hour - sometimes I'm here twice in one day! The service is great and the staff is always friendly!
