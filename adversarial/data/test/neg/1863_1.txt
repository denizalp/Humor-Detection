Ok so this place is consistently good and deserves 4 stars. It's also pretty much the only healthy food option in this immediate area. Love all the bowl toppings and their food is fresh. Service is always great. \n\nIf I'm in the mood for fresh, Mediterranean food and I'm in the area, it's definitely my go to! Parking is also easy, which is a plus.
