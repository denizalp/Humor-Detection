Choolaah has cracked it! I have always wanted something like this - an Indian place that allows me to select from a few options and experiment, but still is uncomplicated. And the flavors are spectacular and I know can be trusted to be consistent in quality. Wonderful ambience too, and having the tandoor ovens openly displayed is sheer genius. Well done...makes my top 3 Indian restaurants in the US. Please grow across the US...more people need to savor this.
