Service call went great. My upstairs ac was blowing hot and Sergei diagnosed a bad fan motor within minutes of showing up (on time I might add). Even better he had a replacement on his vehicle. Motor was changed in less than 30 minutes! Upstairs is nice and cool again. I will definitely use them in the future for sure!
