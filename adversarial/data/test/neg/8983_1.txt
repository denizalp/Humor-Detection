We ordered the Shrimp with potatoes & corn. Tried the Crawfish\/Dungeness Crab for the first time. It was tasty, but we're happy to stick w shrimp. The Calamari was awesome! The portions on the sides were good size. The service was awesome! We ordered the medium because we had read that spicy was really spicy, but we didn't feel it was that spicy. Next time we'll try the spicy.
