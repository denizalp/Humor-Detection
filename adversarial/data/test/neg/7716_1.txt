I really like the food here and the restaurant itself is very nice and extremely clean. Although I haven't eaten inside I've picked up two different combos. \n\n I'm not a coniseur of Chinese food but I know enough to when something is good. The first time I had the kung pao chicken combo which comes with fried rice(which isn't your typical fried rice but still really good) chow mein, egg roll, two cream cheese puffs, + your choice of soup. I didn't have the soup because they will only give to you if you eat in. So I can't judge the soup. \nThe second time I had the general tsos chicken. Same sides included. \nI enjoyed both combos but preferred the kung pao because of the spice and vegetables. \nMy one and only complaint-The Price. $9.55 for each one of these combos. But the price is justified because you get a lot of food, a lot. It's enough for two women to share. I'm a man and can finish it, gorging of course. But I'd prefer not to. \nAnd that's my tip to the owners-you need to offer a little less food on the dinner combo for $2 less. I'm retisent to order the combos anymore because of the amount of food. I'm a fan of combos so I'm at a loss. Maybe the lunch special is less food because the combos are much cheaper for those lunch specials??? But I'm not in the area around lunch time so I can't order that lunch. \nOther than that you won't be sorry if you can eat a lot of food.
