One of the best breakfast, lunch spots in town. (at least that i've found) The only one I like better is...well I won't say.  But staff and food are always good.  Wish they had longer hours, that's my only complaint.  I'm a breakfast type of guy and this place hits the mark.  Huge selection even though I always get the same thing.  When I do get adventurous and try something new I'm rarely disappointed.
