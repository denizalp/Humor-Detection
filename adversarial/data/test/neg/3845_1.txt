I absolutely loved it here and so did the kids that I nanny (ages 4 and almost 2). We went the week before Christmas so there Were cute little decorations up. But we all loved the two hours that we spent exiting the aquarium. The prices were slightly high but we got a coupon for a free kids ticket the next time we come (a coupon that lasts a year). My only issues was that the signage both entering and leaving were slightly confusing but I know the next time I go then I'll be fine. Plus the elevator were a little wonky and j was slightly concerned we were going to get stuck in one.
