My favorite coffee place. I'm not a huge coffee fan in general bc of the bitter taste but the beans they use here have the coffee flavor, is still strong, but it bitter. I'm only visiting from D.C. and I rarely review but this deserves it. Owner is very helpful too and doesn't just try to sell u the popular drink, he asks you about yourself to see what you might like.
