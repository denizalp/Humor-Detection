This was our next destination for our \"Buffets of Buffets\" pass. We went around 8pm and there was no line here as well.\n\nService was really good once again. Our waitress was sweet and checked up on us from time to time. \n\nThis buffet was much smaller than Rio's and the food was just decent. We came here for their Brazilian BBQ and was disappointed to not find it. Nothing stood out for us and the variety wasn't much. We did enjoy the take out cotton candy though!\n\nIn the future, I would not visit this buffet again because there are better options available.\n\nMy ranking of the buffets\n1. Le Village Buffet (Paris)\n2. Carnival World Buffet (Rio)\n3. Spice Market Buffet (Planet Hollywood)\n4. Flavors the Buffet (Harrah's)\n\nDidn't get to try the Paradise Garden Buffet at the Flamingo because we were too full!
