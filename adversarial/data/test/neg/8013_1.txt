This is a awesome Italian restaurant. The best food we have had at an Italian restaurant in a really long time. You can tell they care about the quality of their food. The service was excellent as well. My husband got the lasagna which was delicious and I got the chicken parm which was also great. They have the best sauce. We will definitely be back!
