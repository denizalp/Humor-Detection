This place is absolutely amazing.  The rating does not do it justice.\n\nI frequently have to feed large groups of employees on weekend work, and these guys ever fail to get the job done. \n\nI usually got the chicken skewers, and the shawarma dinners.  I get a mix of the rice and fries, which gives me the best of both worlds.\n\nThe meat is cooked to perfection and tastes amazing.  \n\nTheir fried eggplant and babaganouj are both excellent and they have tandoors to make fresh naan. \n\nOverall, the food is terrific, with excellent portion sizes.  They are quick and can handle large orders, even when crazy busy over the lunch rush.\n\nGreat staff, who are very friendly.\n\nDefinitely worth a visit
