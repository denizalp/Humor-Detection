After reading some of the reviews here and on other sites I was a little skeptical, but having just finished my takeout meal of Orange Beef and Sweet and Sour Shrimp, I am pleasantly surprised. \n\nThe beef was tender and pretty tasty, not as orang-ey as most places (in spite of the pungent aroma that came out of the opened container) but still very good. The shrimp were butterflied, battered and deep fried. And I'm assuming that since it was take out, they put the sauce in a container on the side to keep it from getting soggy. Good call. \n\nI cannot comment on the service since I went in and ordered take out. I walked in, ordered off the menu and my dinner was ready in less than 10 minutes... talk about fast. \n\nIf I'm going to be picky, I'd say the flavors could have been a little more robust. Overall it was very good and I'll be happy to go back and try more off of their menu.
