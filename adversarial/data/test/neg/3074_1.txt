I visited Cravings Buffet for lunch yesterday. Save your money, don't go!! There are so many other buffets out there. I came here because I thought it would have a good variety but it didn't deliver. I haven't been to a Las Vegas buffet in a couple of years so I was looking forward to pigging out. I was extremely disappointed with the food selection and quality. I would have given it no stars but that is not an option for Yelp. The sushi was probably premade and refrigerated since the rice was hard and didn't seem freshly made --just like the store-bought kind. I only sampled food that looked appealing but most of it wasn't. Looks can be deceiving, the decent looking food wasn't very good at all either. The only item that I enjoyed was the prime rib. I had two servings since there wasn't really anything else that was any good. I could have saved money if I just went to a restaurant where I just ordered prime rib. There were fish and chips and the batter was thick without much crunch. The fries were ok but like the other food just didn't seem freshly made. \n\nI have a sweet tooth so I saved my stomach for dessert since there wasn't really much else to eat but the dessert left me unsatisfied as well. Cookies were overbaked; they were hard and dried out. Oatmeal and chocolate cookies are supposed to be soft and chewy but not theirs. Just wasted calories eating their desserts. The cake was dry and stale. The fruit tart didn't have much flavor and wasn't crisp. I guess it was day old dessert or something. The dessert items were so bad that I never even finished any of them. The desserts look good but they are not even worth trying.\n\nI think the only thing going for the buffet is the free beer, wine, champagne, and mimosas when I was there. Maybe that might be the reason some people rate the buffet higher than it deserves. I didn't partake in the alcoholic beverages because I was driving home that afternoon but I would prefer good food over free alcohol.\n\nStay away from Cravings Buffet at the MIrage or you will regret it. It was Mother's day weekend so I ended paying a premium for that crap they called food. I really don't know how such a major hotel casino can serve food like that.
