I usually love going here but lately it's been an absolute nightmare! First, it's almost as bad as Walmart! Hire some dang cashiers and people to check your door. Standing in line for over 20 min to get out of the place is a little ridiculous!! Let alone standing in line for 45 min for a cashier! I am ready to ask for my membership mo why back, service is awful!
