On top of amazing food, the service and the servers were PHENOMENAL!!! Our server Ray was incredibly fun and knew how to make our night! It happened to my birthday week and they brought out a delicious dessert and they sang to me!!! 10\/10 would recommend going to this place if you haven't yet. Also the busser Ryan was a bright smiling face in the restaurant and carried on a conversation even after closing hours.
