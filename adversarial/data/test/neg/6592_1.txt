Amazing show. Enjoyed the fact it had a story line to follow instead of just being a circus of people jumping around doing tricks. The music was awesome, and the sound system made it even more amazing. My husband is a big beatles fan plus he plays music do he appreciated the way they put everything together and blended each song the way they did. The rollerblade guys were pretty cool, kind of made your heart jumo when they flew through the air looking like they were almost going to hit eachother. It was a great show and we will highly recommend it to anyone that asks what shows are worth it. Plan to go again and take our daughter to see it. Great job to all the people who put on the Beatles Love show.
