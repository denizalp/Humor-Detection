Found Carpet Monkeys in Yelp.  As a SoCal native who recently moved to Vegas, one big problem I notice with living in the valley is that its hard as hell to find service providers who are excellent. \n\nIn general - service providers are the following: 1) cheap\/inexpensive: ALWAYS, 2) good: SOMETIMES and 3)EXCELLENT - VERY RARE.\n\nWell here are the carpet cleaners who are both CHEAP & EXCELLENT.  I think it helps that the owner is from Chicago and has worked extensively in San Diego so he is not afraid of hard work and getting the job 100% right - the FIRST TIME!!!!\n\nI contacted Carpet Monkeys on Tuesday night and they were finished cleaning my carpets the next day at noon.  My master bedroom carpet was  a hot mess.  I had already started to look and price new carpet as I thought this was going to be needed soon.  \n\nTo my surprise, Carpet Monkeys got the master bedroom's carpet GOOD AS NEW!!!!  I was pretty shocked at how GREAT it came out.
