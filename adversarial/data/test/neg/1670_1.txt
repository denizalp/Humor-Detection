I've lived near this place for 11 years. In that time it's been several different names of a Chinese restaurant. Right now it's actually called Dao not Tao. \nLast night I ordered delivery from them and was incredibly disappointed. I got the spring rolls, crab puffs, orange chicken and Mongolian beef. It was edible but that's about it. The beef had more white onions than anything else which really killed any possibility of flavor. The orange chicken was blah as well. Only bright side were the spring rolls and crab puffs. However for the prices they charge the flavor should be much better. Needless to say I won't be ordering from them again just not worth over paying for blah food.
