ABSOLUTE WORST SERVICE EVER!!! I ordered scrambled egg whites. I received regular scrambled eggs. When I mentioned it to the server, she gasped, but did exchange them for the correct order, however the bacon she brought back on the same plate was very under-cooked. My wife also had bacon, so a comparison was available. The bacon on my plate was so raw, that it was inedible. I let the server know and she angrily stormed off to get some bacon that was actually cooked. My wife ordered hash browns that were never served. Part of my wife's meal included hash browns, but the server did not serve them. My wife mentioned it to her and she then brought them out, however when the server billed us, she billed each component of my wife's meal separately instead of in total as the meal she ordered. When the bill was delivered, I let the server know that she improperly billed us but she refused to make the adjustment to reflect a meal price instead of the individual pricing. I ended up paying much more for our meal than I should have. The waitress (Marisela) was very rude, but so were the servers who delivered our food and her other co-workers. Upon checking out I mentioned the bad service to the person at the register and she laughed about it. She also tried to take my receipt which provided an opportunity for feedback. I had to ask her to give it back to me after she set it aside in a box next to the register. INCREDIBLE!!! TERRIBLE!!! WORST SERVICE EVER!!!
