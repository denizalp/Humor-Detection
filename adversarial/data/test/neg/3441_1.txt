i love love love cafe rio! The best mexican place everrrrr. The shredded chicken salad is my all time favorite. The chicken quesadilla is also one of my favorites. They tend to get busy towards dinner but that's why their app becomes very useful! You can order online and walk in and pick it up. I also love their mints :)
