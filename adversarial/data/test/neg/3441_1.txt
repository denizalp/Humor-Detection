I just love that there is an LGO in the airport now. I always get the day breaker omelet. Delicious every time! And even though this place is always slammed busy they push the food out pretty quick. Good coffee too.  Bathroom is right next door in case you need to make a pit stop before the flight. Last note, the larger tables have outlets in one or two of the corners so you can charge up while you eat.
