After seeing the 'Check Please' episode, finally Centurion was open on a night that met our schedules.  Greeted at the door with a friendly smile, we were immediately seated at a white clothed table and attended to by Cole, a refreshingly skilled waiter.   Yes, the restaurant was 'clean'.  (if you saw the Check Please episode, you get it.)  \n\nWith the tapas menu, there is so much to choose from it is difficult to whittle down the choice.  Although the wife already ate dinner, it didn't stop me from ordering the stuffed mushrooms, pancetta wrapped gnocchi and of course, if there is pizza on the menu and a wood burning oven, margherita pizza for comparison sake.  Margherita pizza has become my benchmark pizza because it is difficult to mess up with such basic ingredients -- 00 flour, water, yeast,  tomato, mozzarella , basil and a touch of olive oil.   \n\nAs a waiter, Cole is on top of his game.  Probably the best service we had in a very long time from any restaurant.  Quick with drinks, recommendation, suggested order of dishes -- he was in command.   When the dishes arrived, I knew my wife would be stealing samples.  Amazing!  Delicious! The other critiques have nailed it and I cannot add anymore to which they have wrote, other than go there and you won't be disappointed in the tapas. At this point, I knew we would be back to explore the rest of the tapas dishes. \n\nAs for the Margherita pizza, I recommend calling the restaurant call its Margherita pizza something else other than a Margherita pizza.  With the name Margherita Pizza,  there are established expectations (ingredients\/product from a wood burning overn) as I previously wrote.   I took a bite of the flaccid, what appeared to be an undercook crust.  Sure the edges had hints of a browning crust but the crust was pale white, soft, malleable with no hints of browning\/toasting which traditionally results through the use of a wood oven.  Sensing the displeasure, Cole sought to correct the pie by offering a different pizza.  I asked just to stick it the over some more.  The chef's explanation was that this particular Margherita pizza has too much moisture so it will never be crispy.   I did note the topping had a post oven addition of balsamic vinegar circle and some greens on the top; it did appear to have a lot of cheese but didn't appear to be buffalo mozzarella which could be very moist; and some tomato slices.   To their credit, she did offer take the pizza off our bill.   To my fault, I should have paid closer attention to the menu's detail ingredients of the Margherita Pizza -- which is why, I recommend they name this particular pizza something else.   Did I mention, I am a pizza snob? I do make my own homemade and love the simplicity of the certified neapolitan pizza -- why change perfection?\n\nThe wine, drinks, tapas and excellent service is what we will be returning for.   I will explore the other pizzas but will seek Cole's and the chef's recommendation first. I'm  positive they have a pizza for my snobby stomach's heart.
