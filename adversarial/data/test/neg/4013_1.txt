Kind of a weird experience. Food was good but not as good as last time. Good but no wow this time. Service last time was outstanding, best we have had, perfect. This time service was terrible from the main server but good not great from the support service staff. It made a big difference in the overall experience. In a place like Mastro's service matters....A LOT.
