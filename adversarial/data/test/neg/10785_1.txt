Ok I'll admit they have reasonable prices on some of their guns, and they do have a good selection to choose from. The staff is friendly and helpful. They have a nice shooting range as well but they overcharge for ammo. This is a fine place to go shooting as long as you bring your own ammo. They have some hard to find knives as well but they are ridiculously overpriced. Also if you buy a gun they will not charge you to go shoot on their range immediately following the purchase.
