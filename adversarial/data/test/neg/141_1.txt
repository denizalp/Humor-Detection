Came here to use my gift card on bath rugs. I couldn't really decide what color I wanted, so I just got an absorbent white rug for outside the shower. Used a 20% off coupon (nothing is really worth buying without that). The gift card wouldn't swipe and the cashier had to key it in. As for the rug, it's not that great... not very soft or comfy under my feet.
