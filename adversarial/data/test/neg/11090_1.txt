One of the best Dental Practices I've been to, and I'm 61.  Front office to back is superb.  They seem to have the appt. times down so there's no waiting.  I have to get Periodontal Cleanings every 3 months, and I've been helped by a superior Hygienist in Laura D.  Laura is professional, friendly, patient and very thorough.  An expert at her craft.  Prices are reasonable and they even offer their own plans if you don't have insurance {a plan I needed}.  Stellar discounts available at Groupon and Yelp, that's how I found them.  I used Groupon for initial visit and Yelp to help pay for the plan.  Been going to Cherrington Dental since March 1, 2017. \n\nDr. Cherrington is great too.  Fortunately, I haven't had to see him much ;-)
