This complex is an absolute joke. We've been living here for 5 years and when Camden owned it, it was great.  The new owners and Pinnacle Management (read Piece of Crap Management) is more interested in nickle and diming you to death than your living experience. As stated by others they started this \"valet trash service\" which is mandatory and is an ADDITIONAL $25 a month on top of your ridiculously high rent to take your trash to the dumpster  which you could do anyway. But don't put your trash out in a different container or one minute late or it will sit there. Then they still charge you another $14 a month for Republic trash to empty the dumpsters (now you're paying $39 a month for trash!!). Add on another $4.50 a month \"processing fee\" just for them to send you your rent statement plus water and sewer and you're paying hidden fee after hidden fee. Just between these three fees they're making $11,500 EXTRA EVERY MONTH! You also have to sign up for their cable package with Cox that adds another $96 a month on top of your rent and includes channels that you probably don't want or need (I don't speak Spanish so why do I need the package that includes 20 Spanish channels??) They will increase your rent by at least $100 a month if you decide to renew your lease when it's up. The smell of dog crap is insane near the two dog parks because irresponsible owners don't pick up after their dogs and maintenance doesn't empty the receptacles regularly or at all on the weekends. The complex will tell you pet owners are required to pick up after their dog instead of actually doing something about it like installing cameras and fining these morons. Oh wait maybe because they're spending all that extra fee money remodeling their office which doesn't benefit residents one bit. They \"remodeled\" the fitness center which means they painted a wall and moved the equipment around and then opened it two weeks after the date they said it would open. Now they shut the pool right before Memorial Day Weekend to replaster it and said it would be open by the 25th. Now today there is a sign saying there was \"an unexpected repair\" and it'll be closed until June 1st. They NEVER hit a date they set and now our Memorial Day Weekend pool and BBQ plans with friends and family are screwed. But they feed you a line of B.S. about making living better at element instead of addressing the real issues residents have. Just do yourself a favor and spend your hard earned money elsewhere.
