Customer service is great but the dr is rude, I went in to get a pair of glasses n exam, this is my first time here. He made a stupid comment saying that I'm blind, I'm like no shit that's why I'm here overall experience I didn't like it much, so I would not come to this location. Maybe another location since they have afew!!!
