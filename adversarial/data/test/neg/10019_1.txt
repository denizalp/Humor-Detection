I don't like to spend a lot of money on clothes, especially special occasions that require formal wear or dresses that will be donned less than a handful of times a year.  So, when those events approach, I take myself to Ross and peruse their very nice dresses for even better prices.  The first year of my company holiday party, I scored a dress for $15; the second year my dress was $20.  Both received many compliments and were fully appropriate for the occasion, as well as fit wonderfully.\n\nYes, you may have to do a bit of hunting and back-and-forth from the dressing room to the rack to find just what you're looking for, but if you want a bargain and you have a little bit of time to spare it is absolutely worth it.  I also picked up my shapewear that went under my dress here for $10, so I was all set for my holiday party without breaking the bank.  The shoe selection could use a little work, but everything else I've browsed through has been solid.  I've even picked up some cute photo frames at a steal, too.
