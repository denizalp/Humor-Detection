A great place to get out of the ordinary Chinese food.  This place can get really busy on weekend nights, so if you don't want to get upset about service don't go on a busy night, but if you have patience by all means.  It is after all a family owned and operated restaurant with all it's quirks. I personally have not been disappointed yet....\n\nMy favorites...chow fun, duck dishes and whatever fresh Chinese greens or vegetables they have available that day.  Seafood dishes are great too, especially clams with black beans....
