My wife and I just returned from our first visit. I did say \"first\" visit. We are already planning our return to listen to a jazz band scheduled to play. We really liked this place. It is so close and so nice inside. We arrived during happy hour so HH pricing was a bonus. We both loved the lamb sliders. The flat bread was great too. The wait staff was courteous and our food arrived within a reasonable time. This is definitely a wine bar (which is awesome btw) not a sports bar. I'm looking forward to going back. So if you're in the East Valley and looking for a true wine bar, do yourself a favor a visit. I look forward to more visits so I can upgrade my rating to a full 5 stars.
