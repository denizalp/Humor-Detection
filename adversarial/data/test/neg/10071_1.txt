Words do no justice to how amazing the Machaca Beef Burrito is. Smother that bad boy in their Green Hatch Chili sauce and I am one very happy customer. If I get a water, I can get out of here for around $6, too, so it's not a heavy hit on the wallet. Their Chicken Quesadilla is amazing as well - loaded with cheese, seasoned chicken, onions, cilantro, and some other good stuff that I'm forgetting, and topped with sour cream and guacamole. \n\nI've been here a dozen or so times with coworkers and the service is always very friendly. \n\nOh, and you get to fill up on chips and homemade salsa while you wait for your food to come out. Om nom nom.
