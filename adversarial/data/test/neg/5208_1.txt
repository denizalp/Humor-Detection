only complaint, music way too loud on special occasions , store too crowded and cramped, turn around and you will knock something down. other than that great employees and great merchandise.  Lose the 75% off marketing scheme\/ploy  and just post the actual price, instead of trying to fool folks that they are getting a big reduced sale item.  those 75% off signs have been on most of the jewelry for the past 7 years I've been going.    . people are not dumb.at least most consumers are not. And definitely don't shop while Black...they will follow you around like White on rice.....
