Simple and easy to use. If you've never used an off-site airport parking facility, don't harbor the erroneous notion that they are less convenient. You get dropped off right in front of your terminal minutes after you leave the lot and your car is in a secure location less than 2 miles from the airport. When you return to Phoenix, it's just as easy to spot one of their shuttles to return to your car. I have used Sky Harbor Airport Parking several times, and paid between $6-7 per day for uncovered parking versus $9 at the airport lots.
