My husband and I discovered The Yolk thru Yelp and it was the best breakfast we have had in Rock Hill. I had the WWIII with buffalo wings and he had some pancake dish that came with eggs and bacon. Our kids got the silver dollar pancakes with bacon and a side of fruit (fruit had honey and mint mixed with it and they scarfed it down). I can't wait to have brunch there again in a couple weeks.
