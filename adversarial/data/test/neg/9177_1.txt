Thai green curry is one of the best I've ever tried. Thick consistency and simple. Good amount of chicken. Service is OK, too many menu items gets confusing. Crispy Mongolian beef is pretty good too. I go there almost monthly and they never disappoint with food quality. Staff can be sub-par at times.
