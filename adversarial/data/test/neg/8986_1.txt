Ordered from them for a late lunch and was pleasantly surprised at how fresh my food was! My boss recommended this restaurant months ago and after visiting several other places, it was their turn. I had the Greek Salad with Caesar dressing, Akropolis Feta Fries and Dolmades. The Greek salad is large and everything was very fresh and yummy, I split it in half for dinner or snack lol. The fries were delicious and topped with a great amount of feta, which I love. I haven't tried the dolmades yet but they look tasty. Not only was my food excellent, I ordered through the yelp eat app and the establishment delivered the food 20 minutes before it was slated to arrive and with a smile! \n\nMust try! Worth there 5 stars!
