I've been coming here a year now and it literally only took two trips before one of the waitresses remembered my face and drink! How awesome is that?! I always have really great service here. The girls are so nice and always have a smile on their face. The wings are my favorite. I get medium because the hot is REALLY hot. You can get 6 wings and a side for less than $7. This is my favorite place to eat and drink!
