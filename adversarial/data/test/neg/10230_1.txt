I am so excited Cien Agaves opened this new location! This is my favorite Mexican food restaurant in Scottsdale. They have an awesome variety of tequila and have the best Margaritas. I always get the fresh guacamole and queso dip. I love their fresh salads, burritos and fajitas. They also have a great deal for Taco Tuesday's! Great design inside, fun and comfortable. I am definitely putting this place in my restaurant rotation.
