This is a franchise we don't see often in this area.  So when one is found you are lucky to try it.  This time when I went here I was unlucky.  They didn't have any of the specials your see advertised on tv.  That was a first red flag.  The disorganized front counter and the dirty dining room was our second red flag.  And lastly the dirty, no soap and no paper towel bathroom was the third and final red flag!  How can a place operate when the place is a dirty mess?!  Trash on the floor, pop and water all over the drink counter...Apparently no staff member comes out to clean or do any thing there.  No mind you, we were there for probably an hour eating.  The food was ok... just under the level of Long John Silvers.  I will never go back to this location and always remember that a dirty dining room means the whole place is dirty.  Beware.
