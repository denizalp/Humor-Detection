I think the docs are good. I am someone who puts my pets health first and does not care about cost.  I have had several questionable experiences regarding the management. I have had a few bad experiences. Do not pay in advance for any service, test or appointment. You may not use it. And you do not automatically get a refund or credit unless you demand it. I have been a client for two years. I was asked to pay for medical tests or recheck appointments where the vet canceled at the last minute.  I have not gotten a refund or credit. FYI emergency services are very limited due to their schedule. If they can't fit you in even though they are open, you will have to go to the emergency vet. Sorry, I am originally from a small town where, if you always pay your bill, your vets are there for your pet in the worst of times, regardless of schedule.
