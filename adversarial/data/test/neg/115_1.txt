I always come here for my usual pedicures and it's always been a lovely experience. Majority of the time it's been someone new so sometimes I get a bit skeptical with new people just because you never how they will do. But all of them are great and give nice customer service. I opted for the sugar scrub today and it felt amazing! My legs feel smoother and who can say no to a longer leg massage ;) Very clean place and everyone is always so nice. Will be here next month!!
