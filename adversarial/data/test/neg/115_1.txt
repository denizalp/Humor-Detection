This place gets a high rating because the service is awesome and the setting is super cute overlooking the canal. I tried the mole chicken plate and the chinichurri steak, as well as the guac for an entree. Nothing about the food was standout but I could tell that a lot of regulars go there so the ambiance made up for it I guess. Prices were fair, for the two mains, guac and pitcher of sangria, it was just under a 100$ with tax.
