this place is overrated in my opinion. i've definitely had better sushi, and i was very disappointed. i had heard about sushi samba for many years, so i was very excited to finally try it out. \n\nfor our appetizer, we ordered the kobe beef dumplings which were very flavorful. for our main dish we ordered three different rolls: bobo brazil, el topo, and carnaval. the carnval was my favorite, but still average, compared to other sushi i've had. the bobo brazil is topped with thin slices of wagyu beef, which i thought i would enjoy, but it was just mostly fat that you couldn't chew through. the carnaval comes with melted mozzarella cheese at the bottom, which i didn't find adding of any value to the taste. the only thing i did like at the restaurant was the non-alcoholic watermelon drink. it was sweet, sour, and refreshing which i loved. \n\ni didn't care for the ambiance or customer service either; our waitress barely came to our table and the place was too crowded. i'm glad i tried this place out, but i won't be coming back.
