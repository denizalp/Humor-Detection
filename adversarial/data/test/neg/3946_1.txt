4 stars for this place because who doesn't love red ribbon. My favorite is the mango cake, a must have in all birthday parties, mamon is also a favorite for my family! I also get palabok and empanadas here. \n\nWe had 2 unpleasant surprises, one was last april and one was just yesterday, could not be ignored, so i had to complain about it. and the manager who was off duty yesterday made sure to reach out and fix the issue. Joseph did a good job in handling it. I do hope that red ribbon will look into this incident.. we all want fresh food!!
