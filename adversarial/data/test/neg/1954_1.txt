My daughter scheduled a visit to the Epic Escape room for the two of us on Mother's Day. I was concerned. Had no idea what to expect. Thought it was scary, thought the other participants would stay in their own circle and boy was I wrong! Our group was a family of 4 and a friend. They had been there before so it was very helpful to have someone else there that could show us the ropes. You have one hour to solve the mystery. There are many clues in the room but you have no idea how to find them. The host would offer clues and you had to work together to get the answers. It was sooo much fun. So great to do something different. Get out of the norm, go to a movie and eat dinner at a new restaurant. It gets old! This would be such a great team building event! There is one for kids as well. I want to experience all the rooms. I'm addicted! Hosts were great, adventure was great! I will be back!
