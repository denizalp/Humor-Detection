If you are visiting Vegas from Arizona and wanna have some Pakistani food - kabob n More's Nehari is a good option to opt for. We tried Nehari and Chicken Biryani. Nehari is good but Chicken Biryani needs improvement.\nKuki at the counter guided us well with their famous options and served the food pleasantly.
