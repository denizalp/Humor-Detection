A great place to get a sit down meal, with great tasting ingredients, but at a faster speed. This is not \"fast food\".\n\nI like that you can get breakfast all day, and you could order lunch or dinner entrees in the morning. Sometimes you need French toast for dinner, or a club sandwich for breakfast. \n\nThis location is located in SW Las Vegas. Whenever I'm in there it seems to be a mix of working guys on their lunch, and big groups of families. I'm not surprised,  since they have the \"kids eat free\" promotions on certain days.\n\nI also like that Farmer Boys is committed to quality. Use the app, to get coupons & special deals, plus earning points toward food by scanning your receipts.\n\nThe staff is always super friendly, and do a great job of handling the busy times. Here's a bell ring  (clang,  clang!).
