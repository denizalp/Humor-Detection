I love love love this place!! I would move in, if they'd let me. There is such a cool, clean, happy vibe about the surroundings. The nail tech that has done my nails & toes a few times is the best I've been to! (Sorry, I can't tell you her name because I need to see her :) ) The only problem I have is that I always end up buying something super fabulous from the retail area they have. Arrive a little early & shop before your paws are wet!!
