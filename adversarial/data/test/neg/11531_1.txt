To be honest I don't eat dessert very often but whenever I do, I generally only come here. I have tried all of the cheesecake slices and every single one of them is delicious! Similarly, with respect to customer service, I have had nothing but a positive experience; the cashiers always seem to be in a good mood unlike many bakery's. In fact, I once decided to sit down to eat my cake and almost immediately the cashier came over and offered me water, for a piece of cake that costs about $3, the gesture was quite nice!\n\nGood quality desserts, an extremely fair price, and a kind staff, where else would somebody want to go?
