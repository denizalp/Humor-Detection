Good service.  John did a great job of keeping me informed on the state of the repairs, what was needed and the cost.  Good to know:  If you have one of their charge cards (easy to apply for) anything over $249, even repairs, is 6 months no interest.\n\nOnly negative mark is that they charge $50 for a diagnostic.  But I'll be going back to this place.
