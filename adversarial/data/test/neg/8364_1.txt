For me, restaurants are 90% about the food. And the rest doesn't matter much. \n\nBut I have to start this review with:\n\nArrived Sunday night. 8pm or so. \nHostesses were not friendly AT ALL. \nBitch faces, doing me a favour by seating me. \nI think they thought they were really hot?\nUgh - hostess attitude is the worst. \nI'm asking you if I can give you my business. \nAnd you greet me with THAT?\n\nThey seat us at a high top table. There were PLENTY of more comfortable open tables but whatever. \n\nFood was decent if not overpriced. \nOrdered wings and had a BBQ Jalape√±o Burger. \nWaitress was pleasant and competent. \nService was good. \n\nI won't be back. \nBut probably you should put some friendly people outside your restaurant.\n\nUpdate: stomach not enjoying the digestion of this meal at the moment.
