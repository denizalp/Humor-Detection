Excellent service, yummy french fries that we always get two of them, burgers are deliciously full of stuff and greasy yummy, ya know the way a real burger should be. The only downside to the burgers were they were too small, more of a tease to me, an hour later you are hungry again. Always appreciate the great service and food though, we'll be back when we're not too hungry.
