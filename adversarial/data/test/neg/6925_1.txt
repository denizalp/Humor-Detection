got the trio dip as an appetizer which came out in less than a minute with stale chips. Really hate feeling like i was served something that was just out for God knows how long. we requested more chips\/pita which came out  25 minutes later with our mains. Was not checked up on once we actually had to call a waitress to even get our bill. Food was OK portions were good. Unfortunately the snotty service and atmospere left me with a bad enough taste in my mouth to write a review. Wont be back.
