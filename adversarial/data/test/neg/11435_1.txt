Just got back from Vegas and this place was recommended.  I don't mind paying $200 for a great meal but our tab came to $360 (incl grat.) and my wife (who was paying) just about fell off her chair.  It was so expensive because they sold us the smallest lobster they had which was about 4 pounds.  If this was the best lobster we've ever had I guess it would have been worth it but it wasn't.  I'm sure a lot of other people really like this place but it just wasn't for us.
