I came here for dinner with my sister after work. It was just after 6pm so the place was starting to pick up. It's a long cozy restaurant with a long banquet along one side with little wooden tables.\n\nWe were greeted with a warm welcome and allowed to sit wherever we chose. We went to a larger table towards the back along the banquet. Our waitress graciously brought over the menus and asked to take our drink orders.\n\nAs usually we ordered two Green Teas. It come over piping hot and served in cute decorative cups. This is the true green tea that I love! They kept the refills coming, I never had to ask once and it only cost 50 cents!\n\nNext we ordered a bunch of things to try.\n\nFrom the Spicy Crunchy Rolls we orders the Spicy Salmon Roll -\nWe got six hefty sized rolls, fresh tasting, good hint of spice with a subtle crunch to it which I really enjoyed.\n\nTempura Vegetables - 6 hot and crispy coated vegetables. It consisted of  2 big pieces of sweet potato, broccoli, eggplant, red peper, and acorn squash.\n\nNext we ordered two Bento Boxes - They bento boxes came with a simple salad with a citrus flavoured dressing, a sweet potato noodle salad, diced potato medly, steamed white rice, and orange slice + the choice of meat you select. I believe this was suppose to come with a miso soup but I guess they forgot it.\n\nThe meats for the Bento Boxed we chose were:\n\nChicken Teriyaki - It was pretty dry, I think they over cooked the chicken and it was floating in to much sauce which didn't compensate\n\nBulgogi Beef - A spicy stirfried beef was tender and flavourful.\n\nOverall service that night was pretty good. The only thing I didn't like was they brought out all the food way too fast, we were still working on the rolls when they brought out the tempura and bento boxes. But I have to give it up to them for turning out food soo fast! I would probably avoid the Bento boxes next time and keep a menu handy to order as I go because the wait time for food is not the long at all!\n\nFYI Bathroom are located downstairs.....had such a disgusting repulsive mildewy smell....they were clean....but the smell was intense.
