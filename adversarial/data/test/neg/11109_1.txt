Went in today for the first time. The ladies at the front were exceptionally polite and personable. I was immediately taken back. Everyone was so sweet to me. The treated me like I had been coming there for years, if you're looking for a dentist this is the place to go. I will definitely be back. I'm so excited to post my before and after pictures. I have complete confidence that they will do an outstanding job, thank you everyone! You've gotten a life time patient!
