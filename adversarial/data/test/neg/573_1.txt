Dishonest and unapologetic. My daughter's 2009 Mazda was having a intermittent misfire on cylinder 1. This shop said they completed a diagnostic analyses and told her that the engine was shot and needed to be replaced, cylinder 1 had failed a compression test and was between 90 and 100 psi. I called and spoke to John, he was not even close to solving any problem, instead, he wanted to take advantage of the situation by convincing my daughter that $4,000+ was a great price for a rebuilt engine. After my call to John, I called my mechanic in Tucson, he said that the shops findings were very suspicious-compression is not dynamic, if it runs fine most of the time, it's not a bad engine. I called John back to get the vehicle prepared for pick up and he wanted to charge her $180 for his diagnostic work. He agreed to accept 50.00. Took it to a reputable shop this morning and compression test was normal,175. They also isolated the problem as a faulty mass flow sensor and faulty\/intermittent fuel injector on cylinder 1. $600 repair bill and no other drama. Beware-do not trust this service providers ethics and quality.
