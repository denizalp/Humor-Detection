This is good food. Staying at the hilton close by and found this on Yelp. The two Pizzas we ordered were fresh, good toppings, great crust and delicious. The baked Ziti with meatballs was a huge hit and the two salads were huge, full of meats and cheeses and we had lots of leftovers. Definitely will be back on my next visit to Phoenix.
