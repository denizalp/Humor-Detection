My girls and I decided to stop by here after lunch and best decision ever! We've been wanting to try this place out for months and we finally got to experience it first hand. It was SO much fun! Luckily we didn't have to wait to get a table.\nTheir Lattes are surprisingly delicious... Actually better than the high end ones that I've had before. Definitely try the hazelnut latte or the salted caramel. Really looking forward to coming back for more games and their Nutella latte. \n\nThe staff are great and so helpful! I was too short to reach for a board game and one of the ladies' offered to give me a hand lol, so thoughtful! \n\nWhat you need to know:\nIt's $5\/ person, you can play as many games you want for as long as you want. They won't kick you out, I promise. If I could spend the whole day there, I would, which is what I plan to do some time soon! \nI recommend you all play Cards Against Humanity, if you haven't already. Its hilarious. You'll find out for yourself, eventually.
