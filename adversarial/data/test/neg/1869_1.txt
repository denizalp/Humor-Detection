Had family come in from California this weekend and after a little debate and discussion decided to try out this restaurant.\n  Wow! We were all so impressed! Friendly staff from the moment we walked in the door. We were seated immediately and our drink order was taken. \n   Our waitress was ERIN and she was fantastic!!!\nFriendly, knowledgeable, and attentive!!! \n She brought my daughter extra ice for her iced tea without having to be asked (never had that happen before).\n  \n     All of the food was delicious and fresh! And Erin's suggestion of a rice and shrimp bowl for me was perfect!\n\n   Thank you so much for a Great dining experience!!!\n We will be back!!!
