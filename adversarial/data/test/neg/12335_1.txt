I go here two to three times a week everything I order is great just had a incident twice where the teller forgot to put the receipt with the bar code each time was a $25 charge that I couldn't put on my rewards so I asked for the manager showed her how I get two receipts but none had the bar code and now it's twice. She was excellent great attitude and customer service skills . She took care of my issue I'm really happy they did the right thing would of hated to try and find a new farmer boys. Don't always Yelp but when the employee does the right thing I must share how great they are. Thank you guys really appreciate it.
