Only complaint of my wedding by guests were the bartenders. Completely unprofessional and so rude to everyone including bridal party. I could go into detail but I don't even want to waste my time. Wish I would have known how unprofessional they are. They were even caught complaining and talking poorly about MY wedding and some guests LOUDLY outside in the parking lot. Save your money, use someone else.
