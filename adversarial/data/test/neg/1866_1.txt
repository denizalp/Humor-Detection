Barrio is amazing. The tacos are always worth it and the staff is welcoming as well. I like the happy hour specials and the quaintness of the restraint on Literary. I give Barrio's food and staff five-stars but three-stars for the Mexican theme of the eatery but the lack of people who belong to the culture involved in the local businesses.
