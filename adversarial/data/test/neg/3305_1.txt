They cleaned my wedding dress and my husbands shirt and jacket. My wedding dress and the shirt came back still with dirt on them and they did take them back to be cleaned again with little argument. They came back much better after that, which makes me wonder why they didn't just do to that level the first time? They did a decent job.
