We went in late one night for dinner. Took almost 15 minutes for someone to come to the table and take our drink orders. Food is large portions...and not bad. Menu is so large it'll make ur head spin. And you question if they can do it all and do it well. Overall its just ok, and we may try it for breakfast in the future.
