Ordered a part on Sat,  they said it would be there the next day and would call me. I thought, weird having deliveries on Sunday. Having received no call, Monday I stopped in. The guy said, it would be Tuesday if I ordered it Saturday, said they would call me. That made more sence to me. Thursday came and I stopped in again. They didn't have the part and didn't know what was going on and would call me back. They did call me back, said the warehouse was out and would reorder. Part would be there Friday and they would call. Sunday came and still haven't heard from them so I stopped in.  They finally had the part. Wow, what a horrible way to do business. Eight days!
