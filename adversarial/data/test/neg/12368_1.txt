Tonight, I had a meal so delicious that it almost made me depressed, thinking of the mediocre meals that preceded it, and which will certainly come after it. Toast is my favorite local restaurant, and I'm a regular. I guess this might make me a bit partial, but then again, the reason I am a regular is that they always get it right. Tonight was no exception.\n\nFor starters, I had their delicious wedge salad. Now look. Iceberg lettuce isn't exactly the best tasting lettuce in the world, or the most nutritious. There are only two ways I will eat it- chopped finely as part of a sandwich, or chilled and made into a wedge salad. It's got to be chilled properly so that you forget how bland it is, and so that it provides enough crispness for the rest of the ingredients. This was perfect. Plenty of bacon, tomatoes and blue cheese dressing. A great way to kick off the meal.\n\nAnd then came the magnificent Chicken Scarpiello.. Thinly sliced (but not TOO thinly) chicken, lightly battered ( an egg batter, I believe) and sautéed in a rosemary lemon sauce so good that I made sure to enjoy every bit of it. This superlative preparation was served with roasted potatoes (very flavorful) and sautéed spinach, The soft and tasty bread and herbed butter on the side is always a treat.\n\nAs many times as I've been to Toast, this was the first time I tried the Chicken Scarpiello, It will not be my last. Kudos to Chef Kevin and the pleasant and efficient staff for always doing such a great job. Breakfast, lunch or dinner, Toast is a winner.
