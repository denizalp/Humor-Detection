I love Collins. They send you an email when your order is ready, and they are unfailingly polite and friendly. I mentioned I had a job interview, and the next time I came in, she asked how it went. She remembered, just like neighborhood businesses used to do. Everything I've sent there has been cleaned perfectly, and for the first time a difficult collar on a jacket was pressed perfectly. I really don't agree with the other review.
