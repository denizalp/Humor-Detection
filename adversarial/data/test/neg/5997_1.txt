It was a cold, winter night when I came here. It was Saturday night so of course, it was very crowded and the wait was around 45 minutes. When the wait was over, we were seated and greeted by our waitress. She was very friendly and seemed like she had a lot of experience with the food and restaurant business in general. (I wish I would have remembered her name!!) She helped us with the menu and I ordered some type of chicken pasta. It was really good. Like it has been five months since I've been there and I still think about it good. The location sucks and I wish there was a closer parking lot but the food and service definitely make up for it! If you're looking for a good quality Italian meal, make sure you give this place a try!
