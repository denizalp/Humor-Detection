This is an awesome consignment store! I stop by consignment stores often, and this one  has real realistic prices,is clean and has a very nice owner!\nBTW - ask about the building next-door; (if they have not expanded yet! )\nI don't know why they don't mention it in advance and sell more- I brought up a certain color couch, then the owner opened up a whole another building full of stuff!\nI plan on frequenting this one! :-) Happy hunting!
