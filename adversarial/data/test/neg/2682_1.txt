Surprised by the food here. I didn't really expect much! I had The Meat Cravers (thin crust pizza). Nicely toasted crust but because it's on a ceramic plate, only the edges stay crispy. A little skimpy on the toppings, but good flavors. Got there at opening time and the place filled fast. Good service and attentive server. First time to this chain. If I have a pizza craving while traveling, I'll look for this chain.
