I am so thankful that I  came across homers.  It happened when I came out of giant eagle(12 yrs ago) and had a flat tire.  Not only did JR drive my car over to the station, he only charged me 10 dollars to fix it. He just put two new snow tires on my car and rotated the back ones for under a hundred dollars. Tires are usually well over a hundred just for one.  Thank you!!
