We chose Ocotillo for our wedding on February 17 and both of us and all the guests enjoyed this place. The staff is so welcome, friendly and helpful and made us happy from the time we contacted them via emails and phones to plan (other places that we had contacted prior to Ocotillo had really bad communication -- they slowly responded to our emails) to the time the wedding ended. The most impression that we had was their thoughtfulness and care to us: although 6 appetizers that we had chosen were Amercian food, they prepared several Asian food (dumpling, dim sum, etc.) (we and most of guests are Asian, by the way). The grounds are green and so beautiful. Would highly recommend this venue!
