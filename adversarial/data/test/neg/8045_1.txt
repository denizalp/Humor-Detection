Hot day + traipsing around Tremont = some Tremont Scoops. We just happened to stumble upon this place on our walk around. Given my peanut allergy I had to forego most of their flavors. Although I did make it out with a scoop of raspberry sorbet. My friend decided on some vegan cookies 'n cream. Both were okay. The creative scooptacular-sculpture brought us in but we left thinking TS could've offered more. In a shift towards establishments emphasizing locally sourced ingredients, organic, artisan, made in-house -- TS is short of its transparency. Is this just bulk ice cream cloaked in a whimsically rehabbed storefront? \nI'm better off scooping out of my own freezer.
