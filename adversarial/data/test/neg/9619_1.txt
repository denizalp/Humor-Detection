Man you people were hard on this review.  While I agree it does not  have 5 star credentials lets look at it for what it really is.  For a neighborhood that is not overflowing with choices, it serves it's purpose.  Lets be honest there are not a lot of options in the area of  17Th Ave and Van Buren for coffee shops let alone cool coffee shops.  If you happen to work or play in this area and need a decent cup of coffee that's not served by corporate America this is the place.  Additionally, this place has vegetarian and vegan choices for lunch at a reasonable price.
