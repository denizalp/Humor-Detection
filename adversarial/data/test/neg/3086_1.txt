These guys are great.  We had issues with the electric in our bathroom turning on and off randomly. Of course, when the guys showed up, it was on and they couldn't figure out the issue. However, at the same time, the ceiling fan in my daughter's bedroom went out. Come to find out, it was very unsafe and the guys were able to let me know this.  They came back the next day and installed a new fan that was safe!  \nBack to the bathroom-for 2 weeks the power would go on and off. But when the guys came back 2 more times, it was still on. Then it went out for good and they were able to troubleshoot and fix it.  So happy!!!!\nI was expecting a HUGE bill for all of the visits and work, however, when I received the bill, I was extremely surprised at how FAIR the pricing was!\nI highly recommend Dodge. All of their techs are pleasant, knowledgeable and just great to work with. And Jordan in the office was great, as well, putting up with all my calls and emails while we were trying to figure this out. I will definitely call them again if I need more electrical work done.
