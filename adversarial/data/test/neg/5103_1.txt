I loved this place! The service was great and the food was even better! I had the \"pick 2\" and chose to have half of a salad (the raspberry chicken salad)  and half of a sandwich (chicken mozarella). It was like Panera but 100 times better and it was only $10.50! \n\nIf you haven't been, I highly recommend you check it out!
