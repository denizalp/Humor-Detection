I think it's great when an entrepreneur comes up with a new concept.  This whole idea of enchiladas and soup is really cool and I'll bet he opens several more locations.\n\nI had the tomatillo chicken and modelo braised short rib enchiladas.  Red and green sauces, honey vinaigrette slaw, jalapeno ranch dressing pico de gallo and cojita cheese.  Super yummy!\n\nI also had some chips, salsa and a beer.\n\nOverall it was a great meal.\n\nI'd like to see a little more selection of beer (craft) and the table I sat at wasn't bussed from the previous diner's mess until halfway through my meal.
