One of the best place to have Korean Style Fried Chicken. Actually this is only place where you can have legit Korean Fried Chicken in Las Vegas and its really good. It has variety sauces to choose and you can even order half and half. They also have many good other Korean dishes. When I crave for beer and soju with good Korean anju, this is my spot. Waitresses are very friendly and attentive.
