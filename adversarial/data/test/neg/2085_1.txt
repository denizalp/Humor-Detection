Entered the bar and waited ten minutes for a barman or server to present themselves.\n\nBarman finally emerged from the back. We made eye contact. Instead of coming over to see me, he chose to clean a table, despite the fact that the place is nearly empty.\n\nThis bar has been fighting an uphill battle for a long time, you'd come to figure that hiring decent service staff would be a top priority.\n\nGot so irritated I left before the barman finally decided to come over.\n\nReally starting to loathe Toronto's food 'scene'.
