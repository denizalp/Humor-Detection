The food here is very reasonably priced given that it is on the strip. The food served is delicious for it's price point. I ordered the ultimate omelette that comes with 2 toast at cost only $8ish after tax. Super worth. The restaurant is clean and all basic sauces are available such and ketchup, mustard, and Sriracha. There are 2 young boy and girl serving the floor and they are very diligent with their work. They are constantly running around and do not slack off. Service was fast and good. Overall, there is nothing I can complain about and in fact the overall experience is better than some of the more expensive restaurants I've eaten in.
