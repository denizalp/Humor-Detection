This shop is just the cutest! It may have been my favorite shop I visited on my recent vacation in Toronto. \n\nIt's located in the Distillery District in a building with a number of other small shops\/galleries. \n\nThe owner (I believe!) was so kind and chatted with us we browsed and kept browsing. The designs of the art is so cute, and you can buy all sorts of things here! Jewelry, prints, greeting cards, pins (flair!), buttons, cuff links, magnets... and many other things I'm probably forgetting. I just loved the style of the art and ended up picking up a few things, as did my friend. \n\nI can't wait to frame my print (panda bear with a maple leaf)! If you like cute stuff and want to pick up something for yourself or someone else, Mehoi is worth a visit!! (There is also an Etsy shop if you want to see stuff online.)
