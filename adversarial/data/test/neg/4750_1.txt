Visiting from Chicago and decided to try as it was close to where I was working. Went on a Monday night and it was very busy but no wait. Impressed with the size of the place; incredibly large for a brewpub. Ordered some teriyaki smoked wings and the hogzilla sandwich. The rub on the wings and the smoke flavor were excellent; definitely recommend. The hogzilla (pulled pork) was very good as well. Split a sampler of beers with a friend and closed the evening with a couple of the imperial stouts. Good beer, good food. Service was also very good. Will definitely go back if in the area again.
