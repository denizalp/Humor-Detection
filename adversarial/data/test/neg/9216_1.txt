We were a little confused by the separate lines. Lol. Finally figured it out. The food was really awesome. The michelada was yummy. Imagine a gourmet taco truck with seating. Street fare with flare. Don't go expecting some 4 star sit down experience. Don't be a snob. Love the mulas and tacos, on fresh tortillas. As for the PMS case on here, who downgraded the place because of the music, get bent. It's Mexican food, and therefore, Mexican music. I'm so sorry you had to get back into your SUV to hear Journey or Justin Beiber. If there is a band or DJ, expect it to be loud.
