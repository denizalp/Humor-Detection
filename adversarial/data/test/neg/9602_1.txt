Good for the price and portions you get.  Was the lasagna awesome? No. But it was OK. Was the pizza awesome? No but it was OK. But you get a huge portion. Kinda the story with this place. Half the tables had not been bussed and it just makes the place look messy, which is not a good look for a restaurant.
