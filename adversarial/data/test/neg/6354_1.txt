Great small intimate place for any kind of setting. This was my first visit and it was with a bunch of my girlfriends! We sat on the spacious patio.  We each had one or two glasses of wine. And about half the table ordered food. Everybody feel in love. I love this place. Delicious menu! And very accommodating staff. I will come back!
