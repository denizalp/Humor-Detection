$20 dollar pedicure.  Can't really beat that.  I found this place while driving around looking for a place to get a pedicure that took walk-ins.  Its probably not anyone's first choice in a nail place.  Its a little rundown.  But the people were friendly.  The man who did my pedicure did a great job.  When he went to put on my sandal he noticed a mistake and immediately fixed it.  I was impressed because sometimes nail techs don't want to fix it or they give you attitude.  There wasn't a big selection in nail colors--most looked like they were dried out or empty, but they had a color I liked and it worked.  I will go back here when I'm in town next and in need of a pedicure.
