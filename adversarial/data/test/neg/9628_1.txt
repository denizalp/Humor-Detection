Quaint little place next to p.croissant. They've got a bunch of savory and sweet creeps as well as some damn good coffee. The ingredients are all so fresh it makes it easy to love. I had ordered the duck Cuban but they were completely out of duck. We switched it up without any problem and they gave me a dessert on the house for the trouble. Really great customer service. Far exceeded my expectations. Everyone who works there is nice, chill and helpful.
