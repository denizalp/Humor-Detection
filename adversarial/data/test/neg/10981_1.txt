My daughter is one of a few Black female golfers on collegiate level. I thought we would experience racism and disrespect from this place. Thank God I was wrong. We REALLY had a fantastic time. My daughter was very happy with the customer service and the top quality personalities working at Topgolf. I was impressed. Topgolf made my daughter's birthday weekend THAT MUCH BETTER. Can't wait to go back.
