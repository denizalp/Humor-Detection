This Lab is getting worse by the visit, shame on Sonora for not recognizing wait times, and ridiculous appointment offer. 1.5 hour with for 5 min procedure, I was told, well you could make an a appointment. But it's 3 weeks out! \n\nThis is ridiculous, and it's needs to be addressed. 3 Stars is not an accurate rating for this Lab.
