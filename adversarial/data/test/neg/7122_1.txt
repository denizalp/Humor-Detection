This place is awful! My husband and I had just moved to the area. So this being our first time we came in hopes of getting our brand new expensive comforter cleaned. The lady behind the desk was very unfriendly and unprofessional. Upon its return, it smelled of cigarette smoke and the material between the outer layers was shriveled and bunched together without being able to be fixed. The comforter was ruined! I would advise staying away from this cleaners.
