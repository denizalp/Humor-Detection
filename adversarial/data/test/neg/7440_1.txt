This was my first visit to Higley Center for the Arts and while I enjoyed the venue and the performers we came to see, I was disappointed that the two volunteer ushers who were working our section (row 3), allowed the couple sitting directly in front of us to use their phones to Facebook Live the entire concert. It negatively impacted our experience at the concert.
