Blackfinn is your very average sports bar\/restaurant. The service was fine, not great but not bad, the food was mediocre at best, very basic bar food. Two great things were the draft beer selection as well as the outdoor seating. if you're a beer drinker looking to catch up with some friends over some snacks, go for it.  But if you're looking for quality food, look elsewhere.
