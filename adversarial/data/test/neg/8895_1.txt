Peter, Lance and crew were fantastic.  From initial communication to the finished product, I'm thoroughly impressed.  And grateful.  We're in town for the week and reached out for pricing on a mobile detail...our Subaru has logged 25K miles over the last year, cross-country trekking, hauling 7-year old twin boys, a 90-lb lab and all the funk & filth that comes with them.  The crew rocked our tan leather interior like miracle workers!!  Professional, friendly, convenient, attention to detail...now I've got to find a miracle crew in North Phoenix.  ;)
