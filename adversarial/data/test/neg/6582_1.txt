The food here is on point! My colleague and I went here for lunch while attending a conference in the Venetian. We were so impressed! We ordered the miso Chilean sea bass and the moqueca mista plus the green envy roll, carnaval roll and seaweed salad. Everything was delicious, well prepared... Unique, exotic flavors! I highly recommend!
