Very nice set up with a group of friendly staff. I came in on a scheduled appointment to have my AC looked at. It would blow warm air for a few min. before blowing cold air so I wanted to get it checked out. Got there at 8am and was out the door by 915. Turns out there was a small leak so they replaced the bolt? or whatever and refilled it with Freon. While I was waiting, they would call other customers out to the garage to show them what was going on, they didnt do that with me but that left the impression that they could have said I had a \"leak\" but really didnt have one, I dont know. Would have been nice if they offered to show me the area that needed replacing. I went ahead and got that fixed due to convenience and not wanting to drive to another shop. Overall, the experience was good. Got in and out in about an hour and had it fixed for $134.78. Check in on yelp and theyll knock $5 off. Hope this helps!
