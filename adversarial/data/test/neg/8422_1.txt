I work in Henderson so I got a groupon for this restaurant. \nThe food is VERY good, everything tastes delicious.\n\nNot ok - the waiting was so long, we waited at least 20 min\nfor the waiter to come to us, then at least 15 to 20 for our order.\nThey need to hire more people because the place is cute and food is great\nbut service is NOT ok.
