I absolutely LOVE this restaurant. You might have to wait for a bit to get a table, but once you're seated, you're in for a great time, every time. We normally sit in the bar area since it's a lot less noisy than the other dining area. The bartenders are friendly and attentive. Vinny is THE BEST. When they bring out the jalape√±os and onions, ask for them to be extra crispy and put some lime on them. Delicious!! There isn't one thing on their menu that isn't fantastic. Hands down, one of the best Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas.
