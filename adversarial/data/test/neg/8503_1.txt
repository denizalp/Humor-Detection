I think this is the only place I will eat a burger(not a big fan of in n out).\nI can't find one flaw in any of their burgers or side oh my goodness.\nA regular burger is freakin great as well as a cheese burger but my favorite is the mushroom one! It was just love at first bite.\n\nAlso I can't decide if I love the onion rings or the fries more..you cannot go wrong with either decision so I guess it's alright.
