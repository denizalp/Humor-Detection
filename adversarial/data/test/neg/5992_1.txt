Ordered a burger cooked medium well.  Burger came medium if it was cooked that much.  Made server aware of it but said we didn't want another one.  Burger had no taste.  Manager came over to see if there was anything he could do for us.  Explained what we told waiter and showed him picture of undercooked burger.  Didn't comp anything off of bill.  Not going there again.
