The food here is delicious and I agree they have the best fajitas in town. \n\nI have mixed feelings about their service because I've had good service and I've had horrible service here so it depends on who you get and how busy they are.\n\n I will say that this place absolutely sucks for big parties because they have no room the waiters and waitresses are very irritable and they will not split checks whatsoever which I thought was ridiculous. \n\nI'll stick to a table for 2
