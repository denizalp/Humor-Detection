All the hype and all the great reviews for this place gave me high expectations. But unfortunately when I come in here to make a to go order the lady was very short and rude Just the look on her face tells it all I'm sorry that you're  having a BAD day but please treat your customers a little bit better. Was definitely not pleasant when I walk into a restaurant I want to see smiles and happy people. Not people that look like they're pissed off and not happy with their job
