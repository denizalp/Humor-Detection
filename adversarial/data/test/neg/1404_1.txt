Our dining adventure continues through Downtown Summerlin. Public school 702 offers Brunch on weekends along with the regular menu. The restaurant is a large space with an enormous outdoor patio. Indoors the room has high ceilings and hard surfaces but was conversation friendly. \nAt check in we requested a booth and only waited a few minutes for one to be cleared. Service was prompt with our server offering water while we perused the menu.. Refreshments include bottomless Bloody Mary's and Mimosas. If you drink more than two it becomes a money saver. Review the large chalk board at the entrance if you are beer lover.\n\nWe chose the Ahi tuna Tacos as a starter. There are four to an order with avocado salsa, and lemon aioli served in crispy wonton shells. The Ahi Tuna was fresh and flavorful. The shells provided a nice crunch.\nChicken Sausage & Cheddar Grits are on the Brunch menu and come with two fried eggs, blistered tomatoes, grilled corn, bacon, greens and a beer sauce. The chicken sausage has a little heat and the entire dish is a nice mix that will fill you up. \nGrilled Salmon with Summer Succotash is on the regular menu. Our server did not ask the degree of doneness for the salmon, however it was prepared to my satisfaction, cooked all the way through with nice grill marks. The salmon is served with roasted  vegetables, edamame, corn, squash and citrus butter.\nPublic School 702 has a Happy Hour in the bar and extends to part of the patio. Since the patio faces east I would recommend it for when the sun move across the roof and adds some shade. Ceiling fans help with the circulation. The beer menu has a wide variety of choices. \nA return visit is a must to further explore the offerings.
