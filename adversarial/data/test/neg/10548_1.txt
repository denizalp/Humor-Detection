Excellent Chiro\nPhysical Therapy is part of the package\nThey have a great cash price if your insurance doesn't cover you.\n****\n\nThat was my original review about 7 months ago.  Here is a more in depth follow up.  I am much better now, and have a lot more energy and can work full time + without physical pain.  I was a candidate for back surgery, but now I'm cured.  These guys deserve the credit.\n\nIt's great to have found a chiro who cares much more about my well being than his wallet.\n-------\n\nThese guys are NOT your average chiros.\n\nI started seeing Dr Dominic on the recommendation of friends who drive in from the town of Maricopa to see Dr Dom.  They drive over an hour to get here and must pass at least a thousand chiropractors in the process.  In addition, at least 5 family members and additional friends drive in from Maricopa also. These folks can afford to see anyone.  In itself, I thought that it was a pretty good recommendation.\n\nWhen I first came to Dr Dom I was in a lot of pain.  My right front thigh would go numb, both my shoulders had huge knots under the shoulder blades and i would constantly get headaches.  I was missing 1 or 2 days of work out of every 3 due to pain.  In addition, I had lousy insurance so I knew I was going to get killed financially.\n\nDr Dom did my first consult and because i was such a mess, he wrote me a scrpt to get an MRI.  He was able to secure a discounted price with SMIL to my relief.\n\nA week later, armed with my MRI, Dr Dom went to work.  He adjusted me on his table, then put my on a NASA machine that reads your vertebrae and adjusts gently, and adjusted me some more.  Finally he prescribed Physical Therapy and electro stim  for me and electro stim for me.  This was all done then and there and took an additional 45 minutes.  My final bill was an astounding $45!  I hadn't expected to get out for less than $200.\n\nI went multiple times a week and then on an as needed basis.  I have been treated many times on a drop-in basis because my schedule varies a lot and is hard to predict.\n\nOn a few occasions, Dr Matt has helped me because Dr Dom was sick or on vacation.  I was a little nervous to have someone else treat me, but Dr Matt turned out to be excellent.  So often there is one rock star and then there is the substitute.  Not the case here!  Dr Matt is also a rock star.  Both he and Dr Dom have excellent skills and instinct, and they listen to what you are saying.  I have had my neck, back, shoulders, elbows, wrist, fingers and even a knee adjusted by these guys.  \n\nTheir physical therapy team (Kasey and Vince,) is full-time, consistent, competent and pleasant.  Today Kasey used a graston?? tool to massage my forearms as they get sore from typing.\n\nDr Dom carries a lot of physical therapy tools that you can buy (S hooks, neck wedges,) at Amazon prices.\n\nThey also have a futuristic traction table (decompression table,) that has computer sensors that a√±os it to pull just right, not to hard and not too gently.  It costs $55 per session.\n\nThey also have in house massage therapists for $49\/hr.\n\nFinally they hold classes on a regular basis after hours.  Sometimes classes are free, and sometimes not.  Subjects range from CPR Training  to how to do trigger point therapy.  (Dr Dom teaches trigger point therapy to doctors at Mayo.)\n\nIf you are older and have brittle bones, go see Dr Dom.  His NASA machine can adjust you gently.\n\nI still go to Dr Dom about once a month because an adjustment keeps me in top shape.  He and his team have fixed me.  It's been a much better (and cheaper) option than fusing 3 vertebrae.\n\nDr Dom and crew saved my quality of life and are making sure it stays safe.  Do yourself a favor and go see the folks if you have back, neck, shoulder, hip or knee pain.  If you are considering surgery, go see them first!  They will probably save your life too.\n\nPS. They are at 36th St and Indian School\nJust to clarify, the adjustment, NASA machine, physical therapy and electro stim are all included for $45.  The traction table and massages are reasonable but cost extra.
