An awesome tour!!  The cast of Tanked are exactly in person the way they are on the show.....great, down-to-earth people.  We got an insight into how Tanked started, the inner workings of the organization, and got to take pictures with Wade, Heather, the General and Bert.  Trisha was an outstanding tour guide and everyone was very gracious.  These folks are very busy, so you may want to check first to see if who will be in the day you schedule your tour.  Hopefully, you will be as lucky as we were.
