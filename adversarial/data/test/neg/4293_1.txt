I wanted to love this place since it is so close to my house, but it thoroughly disappointed.  \n\nI got Tiffany, who I couldn't understand and she spent a majority of the time speaking in her language loudly to the rest of the staff.  I decided to try the Aloe Pedicure and it came with hot stones at the end.  The massage was half-assed and she mostly rubbed the top of my feet...... Not the bottoms where it hurts! By the time she got to the hot stones,they were so cold it was pointless.  The hot towel on the legs was cold too.... \nThe polish job was a shotty one and now my toe is infected because she cut the sides of the nail and I am prone to ingrown nails.... \n\nI also noticed the next day that she scrubbed my feet raw because it hurts to walk now and it feels like my heels are on fire and tender to the touch.  \n\nThey also didn't know how to work their card system and I watched them constantly screw up and had to show people their cards didn't get charged twice because people were getting a bit upset. \n\nThe reason for the two stars? They are clean and use liners in their pedicure machines and because of the 15% discount.  The lack of stars? Only one person spoke English that was understandable - The lack of basic services on the menu - The lack of ability to shape nails correctly - shotty polish job on both toes and fingers, polish on skin etc - No offer of beverage - high prices - Not a relaxing environment. \n\nI might try this place again in a few months when I forget how much my feet hurt......
