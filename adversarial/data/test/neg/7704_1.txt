I'm very hard to please as a chef and culinary in. Service was fantastic, food was amazing, atmosphere was Electric. This'll be my Friday night spot from now on with my wife. Coming from Tucson and having good Mexican food this is the first place I can honestly say I feel good and can't wait to come back and try another dish.
