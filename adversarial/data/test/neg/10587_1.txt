I had a very nice visit to this location.  I visited with my friend who kept on reading me the FISH items off of the menu - I kept telling him I don't eat fish (I am blind by the way).  I finally decided on a steak taco and it was really excellent.  The corn tortilla was fresh and really tasty.  I really wanted something like a guacamole taco, but don't know if they offer a selection like that.  I will have to use NVDA to read the menu so next time I will know what to order.  They are a disabled friendly restaurant and I appreciate that very much!
