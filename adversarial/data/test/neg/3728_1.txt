After years of being a faithful customer since it opened to today to have the attendant argue with me on past transactions. Than to grill me on who did the transactions. Normally I have coin with me or bills today like a few times I didn't have any. So I go in and ask to get 20 on my debit card to be told they don't do cash back. They have for me in the past. They do offer cash cards or timed sessions in which I do not like. Never has been a problem before but today will be the last time going as the staff member was so argumentative it blew my mind.
