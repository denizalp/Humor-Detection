The sandwich is delicious, but other things were just alright. Caesars food court has free wifi, way to get on board! Sandwiches are $7.49 with a players card. Pretty expensive for a sandwich. the drink was $4.19. WTF! That is expensive for a fountain drink. I don't care how many \"free refills\" you get. haha. The processes of ordering and getting your sandwich is a drag. They give themselves 2 POS opportunities when ordering and paying. The employees I encountered were nice, the food court has been renovated.
