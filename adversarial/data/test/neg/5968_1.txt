When it comes to Izakaya, I think of loud and lively Japanese pub-like restaurants, accompanying bite size, tapas-style portion food. Here at Tsuki Izakaya, I'm surprised to learn that they are quieter than most Izakayas I've been to. It's good to have a change of ambience as I find the bustling noises could make it difficult to have a conversation. I came on a Sunday and it wasn't busy at all. The portion of their food was quite generous as an Izakaya and also slightly pricier in comparison. They have a diverse menu, including both Japanese and Korean dishes, rice, sushi rolls, sashimis and grilled meat.\n\nTsuki Don was definitely my fave with generous amount of fresh, diced sashimis. Imagine California roll but deconstructed into a bowl of rice. My second was the Cheese Buldak, very appetizing and zesty on the hot plate with lots of melting cheese. If you enjoy spicy food, this will be a great one to try. I find the food in Tsuki is decent but lacks creativity in general. So, if you are looking for something inspiring, unfortunately you might not find it from the menu at Tsuki. Overall, their food was still great and filling. I would come back if I'm in the area but it wouldn't be something I crave for.
