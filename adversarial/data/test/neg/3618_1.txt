Went for dinner the other night. Over-all table response was 3 stars. \nEverybody who ordered steak or a burger loved it! Super flavorful, tasted really fresh, cooked perfectly. Oddly, anything that was not beef was not very good. Pasta was blah. The lobster was gummy and obviously pre-frozen, it tasted like it was defrosted under running water. yuck!\n\nThe decor is cool and rustic. The service was really great.  \nIf you go, stick to what they do best. \nMeat!
