I want to give this place the benefit of the doubt that we visited on one of their \"off\" days. I visited Montreal this month with my boyfriend and read so many raving reviews about this place that we had to stop by. I was disappointed to say the least. It's dated, smelt of sour beer and my chair was wet from an unknown source lol. Upon arrival nobody greeted us, nobody told us where to sit, and we weren't given menus for a good 5 to 10 minutes. Finally after ordering and receiving our drinks, we thought about actually leaving. My Kronenbourg was not a Kronenbourg (maybe a Keith's or Stella) and it was beyond flat and warm, then my boyfriend's Guinness draft was sloppy and served in a generic glass (not to our standards). And maybe avoid this place on hot days as there is no air conditioning. \n\nHowever, in good-old Canadian fashion, we decided to give the restaurant a fair chance and order some food. I ordered the classic fish & chips and my boyfriend ordered the beef stew. Both dishes were good, but nothing extraordinary. \n\nI hope to visit Montreal again soon, and hope to visit this particular place again just to see if we can out-do our first experience. \nCheers!
