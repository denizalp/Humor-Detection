Fun show but hard to review.  I thought the Cirque part of it was disappointing - not many cool stunts and tricks.  The cooler stuff were the special effects and there was a lot of dance numbers.  So if you are expecting a great Cirque show, you will be kind of disappointing.\n\nHowever, if you are expecting a great Beatles show, you will love it.  The sound is fantastic, and really gave me a new appreciation for Beatles music.  You could kind of look at this show as the closest thing to a Beatles concert you are going to get.
