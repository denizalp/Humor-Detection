I drive a 2001 taurus and have used this location of Pep Boys since my extended warranty expired. They have done the oil changes, scheduled maintanence, inspections and major suspension work. They have been excellent. The  car, by virtue of design and use, is out of spec for rear camber. They reported the deviatiation to me, told me it wasn't adjustable, and that it wasn't a concern. I took it to the dealership (Biondi Lincoln in Monroeville), they promised to return it to spec and charged me $1500 for a \"camber kit\". The kit made no measurable difference --and then the dealship, $1500 richer, told me it wasn't a real concern and I could safely ignore it. Pep Boys was trustable and the dealership wasn't. Today, fast same-day service on an oil change, annual inspection, and 2 tires. After years of experience with them, i am still very pleased.
