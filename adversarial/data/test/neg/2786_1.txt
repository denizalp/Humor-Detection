Good food for a food court, i took a chicken sandwich with a lebanese (crepe like) bread so delicious. They had the option of a regular pita but this is much better. The tabouleh salad was just ok as with most fast food places. I  am usually reluctant  about food court food but would definitely come back for the same sandwich maybe to try the meat version instead. 4 star for the sandwich i tried. 2 stars for the tabouleh and food court. 3 stars overall.
