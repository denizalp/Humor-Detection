The cookies here are scrumptious and a good item to bring to a house warming for dessert or a sweet treat! While they are not a peanut free facility, they do have cookies that are made without peanuts. Grab one of their loyalty cards when you're there and keep on coming back for those cookies. \n\nThey also have cute tins at the front of the store to peruse while you're waiting in line. I haven't had to wait long and I would say that the cookies are very affordable. :)
