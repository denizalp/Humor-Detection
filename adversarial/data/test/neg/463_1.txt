If I was able to leave negative stars I would gladly do so. I have never dealt with more incompetence that with this company. I signed up for a month to month package, and the billing methodology seems to escape everyone as to how it works. Every time I stop in my account is locked because some different amount is owed. You call corporate and they \"fix it hopefully\". I have no intentions of giving another dime to this company and especially this location! Way too many other choices in Las Vegas to choose from that are not so difficult to do business with!
