Concept good, execution could be better, but really very little to complain about. Our server was an English guy, who was very attentive. It was a Sunday night so the place was not full, although  there were lots of people in the main area, we requested to sit in a quieter location. The hostess also turned down the volume in the room we were in, without being asked, which we had all to ourselves. The food was 4 out of 5. Will go back again for sure. Lots of choices of beer!
