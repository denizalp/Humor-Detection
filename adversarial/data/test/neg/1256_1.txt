Scheduled to rent a truck the day before I needed it, on a weekend. Normally I go through U-Haul for truck rental, but when they didn't have anything available last minute, I needed to check my options. Penske was there to save the day! \n\nI reserved a 12' truck. I was just moving a new sectional couch from the store to my home, so I didn't need something huge. $34.49, plus tax and mileage was estimate. \n\nWhen I arrived, I was told that the 12' was not available as it had something wrong with it and was being worked on. They bumped me up to the next size at no additional charge. It came with a loading ramp which was very helpful. \n\nI was charged $274.53 initially. This included a $150 deposit, and 50 miles. I returned the truck, and my charge was then adjusted to $49.82, as I got the deposit back, and had only gone 13 miles. Not bad!\n\nThe gentleman I worked with at the office when picking up and returning was very nice. He explained everything very clearly and I felt good about the overall transaction. \n\nI will probably use Penske again in the future. It's closer than the U-Haul I typically use, and the pricing it pretty similar.
