My husband and I have a membership to this massage envy on Rock Springs. We love all the  therapists here. \n\nWe usually go the the couples room and get the hour massages and leave so relaxed. I refuse to go to any other therapist but, Danny. I don't like deep tissue and he will do the best relaxing light pressure massage I've ever had. \n\nMy husband loves Katherine as he sometimes need a harder pressure and she knows exactly how he likes it. \n\nI can't say anything about the other massage envys but, as far as we're concerned we can't imagine going anywhere else.
