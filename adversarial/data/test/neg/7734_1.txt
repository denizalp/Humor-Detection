In town for a fun weekend and a buddy took me here for a morning cocktail and a bit of food. The free breakfast with your purchase of a drink is awesome. The menu is simple and to the point. \"Scrambled or regular eggs\" and you get a big helping of hash browns, toast, sausage and bacon. Drinks were strong and crowd was good. 4 stars. Service could have been a bit faster. Overall highly suggest this place if you are looking for a quick drink!
