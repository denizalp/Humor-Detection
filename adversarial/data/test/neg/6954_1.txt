I wish I could give them no stars at all but alas, I guess only 1 will have to do. I used to be a VERY loyal customer and went there with friends all through high school. I adored the owner and often shared conversation with him or the other employees during their smoke breaks. I'm not sure what happened but it was around 2008 that new employees as well as the owner's relatives began to take over more. The customer service became horrible and was more about money and get a certain \"crowd\" to the point that they would ask people to leave even if they were not finished with their drinks or food that they had purchased there. My friend had accidently left a Starbucks cup (empty and in her purse) into the patio area and an employee saw it and immediately started berating her, told her it was like bringing McDonalds into a fine restaurant and asked her to leave due to her disrespect. I understand that it was not the most ideal thing to do on her part but it had been a complete accident and was INSIDE her purse (you could see the Starbucks logo through the small opening, hence the employee spotting it) plus she had personally purchased multiple drinks that night from coffee rush. PLEASE do not support this business. Try Bunna Coffee on Power Rd. in Mesa. Much better atmosphere and coffee.
