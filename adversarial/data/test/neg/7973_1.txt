Santa Barbara is a great brunch. This should be a 5 stars review and it's only a 4 because of the (long) wait. Besides the wait, I loved everything about this place. Fresh and delicious food, a little bit more original than usual brunch fairs. To find out more, check out my review: https:\/\/delifeed.ca\/2016\/05\/01\/santa-barbara-fresh-and-creative-brunch\/
