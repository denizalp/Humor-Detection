Scheduled within 2 days, arrived early (with notice), didn't haggle over exact square footage (gave a phone quote), great price, phenomenal pet stain\/odor treatment, protected wall corners, mopped up drips, carpet is soft, dried quickly, even power sprayed my street where there were a few suds:  above and beyond -- couldn't be happier!  Thanks again guys!
