I live in the neighborhood and was looking for somewhere to eat dinner on a Friday night with a big group of friends. We hoped (correctly) that Salud could fit us in. They rearranged seating for a table of 14, gladly split checks, and even offered to let people order on a rolling basis as they arrived. The server (owner?) could not have been more accommodating. \n\nThe mojitos were delicious and our party ordered most of the items on the menu. The empanadas would make a great large bar snack if you came in to do some drinking. I had the picadillo beef- the hamburger was deliciously seasoned, the rice got compliments all around, and I devoured the plantains. At $12, it was a deal for a large dinner portion. My date had the watermelon gazpacho and my taste of that was also yummy. \n\nThe atmosphere looks like a dive bar. So what? The service was great, the food was fast and good and affordable, and I look forward to going back. I almost hate to give this place a good review- I don't want it to get packed like the rest of Lawrenceville! But I think this place deserves more attention for its good food. I'll be back for more.
