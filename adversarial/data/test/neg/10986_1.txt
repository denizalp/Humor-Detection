Solid three star from me.  It is Cantonese style Chinese food with mix of Macau, and western fusion.  Worth a try for sure.\n\nFood: 3\/5, I've gotten the chicken cream corn baked dish and the chicken cutlet.  From other baked dishes I've had, the cream was a bit too much here .  The cutlet was ok; too bad they used dark meat for this though. The portions are however huge so watch out.  They also give you free soup for lunch (Chinese herbal, cream of ham or Russian bortsche) I wasn't a fan of the soups to be honest.\n\nService: 3\/5, the two ladies working here are super courteous and fast. However the new guy there is super slow, lazies around and not too great to get your orders to come.\n\nAmbience: 3\/5, a little odd seating with Chinese TV. It's just a typical table\/chair format\n\nPrice: 3\/5, around $15 per person
