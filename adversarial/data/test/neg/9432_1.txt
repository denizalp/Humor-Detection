We wanted to get breakfast at Hash House a Go Go, but there was a 30 minute wait and we were flying out. We decided to go here for something quick. For a quick breakfast sandwich it was very good. We split a cinnamon roll and it was also very good. Lots of white icing and rich. I'd recommend it if you're wanting a quick breakfast.
