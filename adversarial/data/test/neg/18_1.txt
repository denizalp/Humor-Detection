Staff is great from valet up to room. Room service was slow and more than 45 min  room mediocre. Old room pillows and bed not soft. The bathroom fan is broken   No music paid for tv music but selection is limited no iPhone plug in. It is just outdated.  They need to update room. Oh and no coffee maker ugh
