Went through AHS warranty to replace my water heater and they referred me to advanced home services. They called right at 730am to schedule appt but didn't have any early morning appts. Came to house to inspect and confirmed that water heater needs to be replaced. So told me needed to get approval from AHS before work can be done and what my coverage will cover as for expenses and my payment due. Was approved by Friday morning and told us our payment would be $550 which I thought was a little bit high for having a warranty. But called plumbers around for estimates got any price from $750-$1200 so just went ahead with Advanced Home Services for the $550 to cover the city codes, permits and modifications. Was told can't replace to Monday and that's when I got little upset but they were fully booked and Monday afternoon was the earliest they can get to us. So no hot water for 4 days which my family was not happy!  But after all the wait Sam the technician did a great job in replacing the water heater and now we have hot water again. Thanks for the good job Sam!  They did what they came to fix. No complaints except for no hot water for 4 days. Lol
