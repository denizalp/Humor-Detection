I know that people have already reviewed The Farm Kitchen in the separate listing for the Farm at South Mountain, but since 2 of the 3 eateries at the Farm (Morning Glory Cafe and Quiessence) have separate listings, I wanted to break out The Farm Kitchen and give it its own listing as well. Morning Glory Cafe offers a delicious breakfast and brunch, Quiessence is a formal restaurant serving local and seasonal dishes, and The Farm Kitchen is a casual lunch spot with sandwiches, soups, salads, and baked goods. We went for lunch with high hopes since our experience at Morning Glory Cafe was so good, but we were a little disappointed with the food we tried, especially given the high prices. \n\nWe ordered the Grilled Flank Steak Sandwich ($9.95), the Chicken BLT Sandwich ($9.95), a side of potato salad ($2.50), a side of sweet potato salad ($2.50), and a piece of pecan pie ($4). The Steak Sandwich was the best of the four things - the steak was well-seasoned and tender, the bread was freshly baked, and the Gorgonzola spread really complemented the meat. However, the chicken on the BLT sandwich was flavorless and a bit dry and the mayo was really standard. The sweet potato salad was also really oily and the sweet potatos themselves were undercooked and even a bit chewy. The potato salad was fine, but a really small portion for the price. The pecan pie was definitely good, but not better than anything you could get at Marie Calendar's or a similar bakery chain. \n\nThe atmosphere is definitely unique (where else can you get your lunch in picnic baskets and sit outside?), but to really experience the deliciousness of locally grown ingredients and feel that the food is worth the high price tag, you'd probably want to go to Morning Glory Cafe or Quiessence (which we hear wonderful things about and are excited to try!).
