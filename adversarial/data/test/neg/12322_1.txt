Free to enter and walk around and look. You don't find that in many places in Vegas. They have a wide variety of cars, trucks and motorcycles just like show. We actually ran into one of the cast members when we were leaving. The staff was knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. Five star because it was FREE!
