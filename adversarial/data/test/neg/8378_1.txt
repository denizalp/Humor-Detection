I have been going to North Scottsdale Laser & Skin Care for 4 years. It's a very friendly & clean environment and the staff is always so sweet. I go to Dr. Anderson for my treatments (botox, filler).\n\nDr. Anderson really takes her time with you and I always feel 100% trust and comfort with Dr. Anderson, therefore I would highly recommend doing your treatments with her. They also do monthly specials which is great for your budget!
