I feel that the fountain deserves 5 stars because the fountain show has always been consistent each time I've watched it over the course of 4 or so years. I like the diverse music choices ranging from Tiesto to Frank Sinatra. It's amazing to watch the water sort of dance along to the music. It's definitely a must-see show, especially since it's free and only about 5 minutes long, which is a great length of time.
