My friends and I went to the Brew Garden on a Friday night this winter. We were seated and waited for over fifteen minutes for some one to take our order. This surprised me because the other half or the restaurant was empty tables.\n\nNo one even said \"We'll be right with you\".  After about 10 minutes we tried to flag down a waitress just to get a drink order in, but she didn't look our way.\n\nSo after 15 minutes we left and went to The Cornerstone in Berea, which I would definitely recommend.
