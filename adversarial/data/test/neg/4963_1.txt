After trekking though some unsavory parts of Mt. Washington and battling the Grandview traffic is not my cup of tea, this place makes every bit of the drive worth it. \n\nBe warned. This is not a fancy restaurant. They believe in good food and an unpretentious atmosphere. You may be seated at a long table on vinyl chairs, but the food that appears in front of you is your Nona's Italian cooking as you remember it. \n\nThe service is slow, slow, slow!! They are fast to uncork your wine or beer (it's BYOB), but the food took such a long time to actually arrive at the table. \n\nThe pasta is phenomenal, the cabanara is my favorite. Don't be afraid to ask the waitstaff questions. They are all very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu and preparations. \n\nFinal thing is the price. It's wicked cheap if you don't uncork wine like a maniac. The quality of the food is far above what I'd expect at those prices.
