How hard is it to screw up not once but twice\nWe ordered a deep dish with Italian sausage and Canadian bacon deep dish\nwe knew it would take time [its 820 pm]  at 915 the waitress brings a complimentary appetizer saying it will be here soon [that was nice]\nthen the pizza arrives  green peppers, where did the meat go?\nShe confirmed that she put in the ticket for  Italian sausage and Canadian bacon \nShe apologized saying she will rush it, confirmed again our order\nshows up 25 minutes later [10 pm] only Canadian bacon.\nHow do you screw it up twice.  Asked for the manager and said that is it we are leaving.  He \"agreed\" to remove the pizza charge but still charged us $12 for 2 beers, Thank you!\ngreat experience!!!!!!!!!!
