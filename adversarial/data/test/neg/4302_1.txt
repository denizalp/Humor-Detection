Came in tonight for the Elite event and had a blast. The kiddos loved all the shark exhibits and all the interactive features. It was a little shorter than I expected but that is ok because it was jam packed with life sized sculptures and many many cool fossil of ancient sharks. I am sure the entire Science Center is on par with this exhibit and we are excited to come back and check it out. Thanks a lot Yelp and Arizona Science Center!!
