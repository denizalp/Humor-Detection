Ordered delivery.  First impression was the toxic styrofoam containers that were melted into my food.   Not too happy about that.  There's a reason styrofoam is banned in New York state.  Should be banned here too!  We ordered the gyros dinner & chicken legs dinner.  They came with rice, 1 roasted potato, & small salad.  \n \nThe gyros were inedible due to the salt content.  Chicken was ok, although extremely salty as well. \nBoth had great potential if it werent for the handful of salt in each plate. \n\nWont order again due to the styrofoam & salt content.  The wait for decent Greek food in the area continues....... \n\nGreat value tho, if you dont mind melted styrofoam and lots of sodium.
