Had thanksgiving dinner here and then came back again. It is comfort food, but extremely high quality and very tasty. Service was great and food was delicious. Most comfort food places use the cheapest ingredients to make cheap dishes... this place has traditional \"cheap\" dishes, but the ingredients are top quality and the final result is amazing. I enjoyed each visit and will for sure be back for more.
