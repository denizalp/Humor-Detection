Normally I avoid Marshalls because it always seems way more crowded than a TJ Maxx or Ross. I don't feel like I get to take my time to browse and find treasure, instead being rushed like a Black Friday sale and having to rip something out of another shoppers hands. Luckily, this Marshalls was way more low-key than other ones I've been to. The square footage is pretty large and there is plenty of space for product and customers. They have a lot of clothing with a few home goods items mixed in. I was able to find a nice t-shirt and some dishes. I'd definitely come back if I was in the area and had the time to browse.
