Located right at the entrance of the Las Vegas South Premium Outlets, Body Kneads is an answer to the prayers of anyone in need of some self care after a few Vegas days and nights.\n\nService fees scale with intensity and massage time.  At the bottom of the massage menu is foot reflexology.\n\nI decided on that massage.  On top of my skin and joint issues, \nI had been walking up and down Las Vegas Blvd for the past two days.\n\nDavid, the owner, attended to me after focusing on his client at hand.\nSat across from me, he had me prop my feet up on an ottoman and began to cleanse and apply oil to my desert-weary feet. I chose a citrus blend oil after hearing an explanation of the importance and effects of essential oils.\n\nFor 20 minutes my feet were awarded David's undivided attention while customers showed up and added their names to the \"next\" list.\n\nI'm a reflexology convert - I'll seek it out every week if I can, but I will miss David and his conversation. I hope to see him during my next visit.  I probably will since he's been at that location for 12 years!
