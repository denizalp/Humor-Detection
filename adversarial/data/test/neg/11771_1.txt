Some of the staffs were rude and not friendly at all. When i asked for the wifi password they simply said \"no\" and walked away. Then when i asked why, they explained it gets slow when people use it, so i assume they dont give out password cause they wanna use it all for themselves but not the customers. Food was good but a little overpriced. I really like and recommend the fried calamari, the best I've had. Good atmosphere and decorations. Will come back, just for the fried calamari and thai tea.
