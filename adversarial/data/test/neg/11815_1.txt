Like most chain restaurants, the service is hit or miss, it depends on the waitress\/waiter you get. Food is good, most of the time, it also depends on the cook. Sometimes it's cooked to perfection, other times it's not. \n   The manager is super attentive and stands by the door to ask everyone who is leaving how the food was. One thing that they never get right is the soda. My husbands likes to drink soda when we go out  except at this location. For some reason it is ALWAYS flat. I don't know why, it seem that they serve soda from a bottle rather than from a tap. Their tea is always diluted and taste like water. So for us, unless we are drinking coffee or oj, We just stick to water when we come to IHOP.
