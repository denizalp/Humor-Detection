This is a father and son used car sales business. They advertise on Craigslist as an individual. BEWARE- the cars are very nice looking and extremely clean, including the engine. You can't tell if there are any oil leaks or anything going wrong with the engine because of the excellent detail work. I bought a Mini Cooper from them that had an oil leak (couldn't tell it was leaking because the engine had been cleaned) We ended up having to replace the turbo oil line (a $900 repair) because it was leaking so badly. The owner told us we might have to replace the brass o ring on the oil line if it started leaking. He already knew the oil line was bad. \n\nThe people are very nice but that's their job. Would not buy another car from them.
