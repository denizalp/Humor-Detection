I was disappointed here. There is SO much great food in Vegas that this place just didn't make the mark. I went cause my hotel gave me some dinner credit here, and I was craving scallops so I ordered scallops with quinoa along with a side of asparagus..The asparagus came out dry with too much blackened charring on the outside, to the point where they were wilting.\n\nThe scallops came out a bit cold, but I was too tired and hungry to ask them to be reheated. \n\nIt wasn't bad here, but I would say, seek out memorable meals that will knock your socks off.
