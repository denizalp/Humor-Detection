Bradley Ogden's prix fixe menus are great values. I have eaten here twice and enjoyed both dinners immensely. The last meal I ate started with a cheese souffle - I'm not an egg eater, but this was the bomb. The Duroc pork loin is amazing. Imagine a steak that tastes like bacon. You'd love it. Hell, you'd marry it. Then for dessert, bananas foster cake. Ok, wheel me out in a chair.
