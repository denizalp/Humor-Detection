I've eaten here several times & have always enjoyed the atmosphere, the service & the food in general. However, I found this Sunday's corned beef hash subpar. The beef was in large cubes, not minced, & filled with chewy fat. The potatoes, bread, coffee, etc,. were top-notch. The sorbet dessert deserves 5 stars. But the poor quality beef brings the total rating down to 3 stars.
