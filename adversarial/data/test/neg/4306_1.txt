So this is my third time here. Both previous times I have complained on yelp about how slow the service is. On the weekends, forget it, you will wait for an hour if you are lucky. But the other two times it was middle of the day on a weekday. Not too busy. Food took 45 minutes for one thing. Today I was told 15 minutes after I ordered a Turkey burger that there were no more. So I ordered a shrimp salad. A few minutes later the manager came to me to apologize but they are out of shrimp. Im not sure how a kitchen doesnt communicate this to staff???? Anyway, I gave them 2 stArs because they are friendly and the food is usually good. But I wont be coming back again!!!!!!
