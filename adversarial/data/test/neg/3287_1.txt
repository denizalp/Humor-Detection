Update to my review: Finally got to try this place. The staff is SO friendly and service is great. My cold-brew was tasty and they offer coconut milk along with the creamer\/sugar selection so that was really nice. I'm leaving the review as 3-star because I found my sausage and egg breakfast sandwich to be pretty dry and bland. Also the menu online doesn't match the menu they offer in the store, so don't be one of those people who looks ahead and decides what you want... they may not offer it. My experience doesn't really seem to match all the good reviews so maybe I will try it again down the road.\n\nOriginal review: I would love to try this place out but the two times I have stopped by before work they have still had the doors locked at 7:10am even though the sign on the door says open at 7am. :( :( :(
