This Vietnamese Restaurant has \"Value\" written all over it. Tasty eggrolls to start and really big menu with all the possible Vietnamese delicacies to continue, all good and for a cheap price you can't beat! Don't expect fancy place or neighborhood, of course, but if you're fan of Vietnamese food you should absolutely try this place!
