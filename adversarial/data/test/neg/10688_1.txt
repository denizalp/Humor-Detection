Came here on a Wednesday night for a pharmaceutical dinner presentation. I was early as usual and was shown to one of their private dining room. This room was nicely decorated with a nice big flat screen tv in the front. The problem arrived when the rep came and found the room set for 20 people when her contract was for 25. The server was no help and got the manager. He was very calm and polite and quickly tried to find a way to solve it. The room supposedly fits 28, but I think that would have been pretty damn tight. After making some arrangements, he was able to set up the room for 25 with a few square inches to spare. The AV was not an issue. From that point forward, service went well. The server was great in taking orders and bringing out the items. The guests all had a good time and the food appeared great. I am unable to comment on the food because I didn't get a chance to try it. So this review is strictly based on service and facilities. \nI would return and give them another shot at it.
