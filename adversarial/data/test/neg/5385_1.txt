It's a typical Chinese eatery that serves solely noodles along with a variety of toppings such as wonton, shrimp wonton, sliced beef, cuttle fish etc. Definitely one of the best shrimp wontons I've tried. You can combine it with yellow noodle, vermicelli or rice noodle. Its cheap, yummy and great if you're planning for a quick bite. If you're a fast eater like me, guaranteed you'll be served once you sit down and finish your bowl of noodles within 10minutes max! It gets quite crowded during lunchtime so be warned.
