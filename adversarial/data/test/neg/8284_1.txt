This place is a great for its Tuesday $6 cheeseburger special. A HUGE  cheeseburger with fries or house salad for half off, and you can't beat it! The servers are nice n friendly too and it has become a regular for us. You can actually cut the burger in half and still be full (did I mention it's a big burger?) The Philly cheesesteak fries and the Filet nachos are worth a try too. I understand they have a good breakfast too but haven't tried that yet.
