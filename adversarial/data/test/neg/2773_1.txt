I've been banking with NSB for about 18 years and have not had any major issues. Their new fee schedule and charges for services are starting to annoy me, really... a $5 fee for a notary when they are my primary bank? I'M sorry but this is ridiculous, I'm glad that I have another bank that doesn't charge me for this service. I could be slipping away NSB. I am now requesting an update on a HELOC that i am waiting on. I stated that I need it to close by 5\/13\/2015. In the last 2 days I have sent 2 emails as to the status and no response. Well,it is now 5\/12\/2015 @3:18 p.m.. I stand to loose quite a bit of money if this doesn't close on time. It may be the straw that broke the camels back.
