If I could just bring in a sleeping bag and live here, that'd be great.\n\nI love these comfortable local bookstores. They know every title on their shelves, can recommend just about anything to you, and are actually interested in your likes and dislikes. We stopped in just so my sister could show it off to me and I ended up spending like $75, mostly on board books for my niece and friends' kids. \n\nGreat selection, excellent variety, and staff is top-notch.
