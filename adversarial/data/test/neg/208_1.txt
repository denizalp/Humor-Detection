I have to say usually I go to Wag N Wash to use their self service dog wash. Today I did not feel like driving the extra 40 min to get to Wag N Wash, so I decided to give this place a shot. I walked in and the place was so hot, clearly the A\/C was not on and the doors were not open. The young girl at the front desk asked if I was there for the Self Service and I said yes. She then said the tubs where in the back; did not bother to get up or anything. I then told her that this was my first time here and am unfamiliar. She then got up and walked me over to the tubs, told me to use the one closest to the wall and that the blow dryer was on the floor. I then had to ask for the towels and conditioner. (thank god I brought my own shampoo and ear cleaner). Instead of grabbing me a towel she just points to a rack with some towels. \n\nWhen I first walked in I should have just walked back out and drove to Wag N Wash but for some reason I stayed. This place is one of the dirtiest places I have ever stepped into. The place was covered in dog hair, I know it is a dog groomer but come on this place probably has not been swept since it opened. It was also covered in dirt and dust. The tub I was instructed to use was covered in dog hair and mud. The box that had the brushes that I could have used were wet and again covered in dog hair ( can you see the running theme). The cotton balls that were also available to use were as well covered in dog hair. No way I was going to use the brushes or cotton balls on my dog. I used their conditioner and after pouring it my dog had black hair on her ( my dog is all white). THERE WAS DOG HAIR IN THE CONDITIONER THEY GAVE ME. After rinsing my dog off I dragged the blow dryer to the tub to dry my dog. \n\nI finally finished and went up to pay the $15 for the self service. What a waste of money. I should have just gone to Wag N Wash and drove the extra 40 mins. For $16 I would have been able to get their premium dog wash. Which includes: clean facility, clean equipment, friendly staff, shampoo, conditioner, leave in conditioner, cologne, and clean brushes. Wag N Wash is WAY BETTER than See Spot Clean, which is not so clean. \n\nWarning to all, do not come here. Do not bring your dog for the self service or the groomers. I could only imagine what the back of this place looks like if the front is so filthy. Worst dog grooming place I have been too. I should have just walked out as soon as I got there but I do like to try and support local business. This local business is the worst.
