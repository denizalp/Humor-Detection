3 1\/2 stars.  good korean super market.  like all other asian markets in the china town area it has asian type veggies you don't find in  nonasan markets.  although, some of the veggies look bleah!  there are a wide assortment of korean eats, from prepared meats to pickled vegetables.  alot of seafood,  make pokee buyin the mix in their small hawaiian section.  will go again.
