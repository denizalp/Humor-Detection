I've been looking forward to trying Doan's for a little while. Not sure what it was that piqued my interest. So I stopped in to grab some pad Thai. Not sure if going to a Vietnamese place for Thai food is the wisest decision to make. \nI've had pad Thai from all around Charlotte, some good, some bad. The pad Thai from here left me wanting a lot more. It was really dry and had a few extra ingredients that I don't normally find in the pad Thai I've eaten. Also, the order had the word spicy in parentheses and it was anything but spicy.  Would go back? Not likely with all of the other choices around town for this type of food
