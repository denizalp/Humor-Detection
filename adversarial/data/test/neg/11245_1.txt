My best meal in Vegas!  I love crawfish boil and this did not disappoint. The servers, Tia and Billy, we're both very knowledgeable and attentive, and provided some recommendations for added spices that were out of this world!\nThis place isn't fancy. Think plastic forks and cups, but they have it that way because that is what a seafood boil is!  Everything should be able to roll up and throw away when you are done. \nPlan to get your fingers dirty!
