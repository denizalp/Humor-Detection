Horrible service! Waiters ignore you when you attempt to ask them a question. If you have a reservation you still have to wait an hour when the entire place has empty tables everywhere. Waiters have an attitude like if they are bothered they have to do their job. I come here often because I love the food but I have to sacrifice the service and the long waits even though there will be tables available. Horrible customer service !
