If you are considering a home birth, first and foremost, I recommend it 100%! There is no comparison to how laid back the entire experience is. Even with my story.\n\nJill is the absolute BEST. The way my labor went is right up there with one of the WORST things you can expect to happen. My daughter decided to put her arm up with her hand next to her head on the way out. This caused her cord to cinch tighter and tighter the further she progressed. With Jill, NOT A PROBLEM! Never once did she say anything to get me worried. Obviously my husband and mother were aware of what was going on. She told me, \"push\", I replied \"I'm not contracting right now\". She said, \"push anyway,\" the picture of calm, so I did. And wow did my baby blast out lol, but she was perfect and in one piece! \n\nTHEN... Again.. Jill, cool as a cucumber, begins to massage my abdomen. Had I not read up on every possible thing that can go wrong and solutions for them, I would not have known that I was hemorrhaging until the massaging didn't stop the bleeding and Jill told my husband to call 911. Then she very calmly and sternly looked at me and told me that if I worked hard and pushed and delivered my placenta, I would NOT have to go to the hospital. I could stay with my daughter, my family, and continue to nurse my new baby without much incident. The paramedics were just a precaution. So I put on my big girl pants and pushed with Jills constant assurances. She also had a bunch of tinctures at the ready that she was squirting into my mouth all the while as well as crushing smelling salts under my nose to keep me conscious. She was prepared for anything! We successfully delivered the placenta. She told me to open my mouth so I complied! And before I knew it, and before the paramedics had even had the chance to arrive, there was a glob of placenta in my mouth and I was no longer bleeding! She immediately started preparing me more of her magic concoctions to drink and within a few hours, though I definitely felt I had just bled out, my blood pressure was stable and everyone was able to call it a night. Jill stayed with us in those hours after the birth to monitor me and weighed my baby, helped my husband and mother give her her first bath, gave instructions on how to care for me and our new daughter. And, as was through my entire pregnancy Jill is available 24\/7 to answer any questions or concerns you may have. No waiting for appointments, no 15 minutes with the doctor and you're rushed out and forgotten questions having to wait until next time, JILL IS ALWAYS AROUND TO MAKE SURE YOUR EXPERIENCE IS THE BEST IT CAN BE. This was my first child, and even with all that went amiss, if she is still practicing when we have a second child, we want Jill! You will not find someone more knowledgable with herbs and as prepared and as calm as Jill! I'm convinced she can handle anything.
