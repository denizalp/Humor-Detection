Went here with friends to grab a few drinks.  The it was early and not that packed but grew as the night went on.  Pretty soon it was packed but service was good even with crowd and the prices were reasonable and they have a pretty good draft list.  A good place to get your drink on with a crowd of rowdy friends.
