My experience with this business has been BEYOND AWFUL. We ordered 1 sticker from LUIS and it was an absolute NIGHTMARE to have completed. Upon competition and pick up I come to find out they actually made the sticker wrong and forget 1 letter in the logo. \n\nI then called back and LUIS was very understanding and said he would fix the problem right away. He said come the next day to pick up a new sticker at 2pm. I then asked my assistant to meet me there the following day at 3pm (1 hour after he said, wanted to give him extra time if needed). The following day we end up going at 4PM, 2 hours after he told us to arrive. We walk in and THE JOB WAS STILL NOT COMPLETE. We then waited for 20 minutes, and I ended up having to leave so I asked my assistant to stay as he said it would only be a few more minutes.\n\n20 minutes later I get a call from my assistant that it couldn't be finished that day for whatever reason, and that it would need to be picked up the following day, yet another let down. \n\nBut the story is just getting started....the previous day he also agreed to have 3 hats embodied for me by 3pm. The following day his receptionist calls me and says that their guy went on vacation and they didn't know about it so the job couldn't be done until the following Tuesday. I said have LUIS call me right away, I speak with him and told him my experience thus far and he could not have had less of a worry. I asked him to outsource it somewhere else given all my troubles, he turned that option down. I even said take it to galleria mall 5 minutes down the road and he said he wasn't going to waste money doing that. \n\nNeedless to say this will be the last time I EVER do business with this establishment. This will go for myself, my large network of friends, business partners, ect. There is a right way and wrong way to run a business and LUIS doesn't seem to understand that. I gave him every chance to make the situation right but he absolutely refused to do so. Everything in this review is true and stated as occurred.
