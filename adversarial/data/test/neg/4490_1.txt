Ok, let's start off by saying the food is delicious. What makes this place really shine though is the customer service. The people who work here are consistently friendly and helpful. They're always asking if you need anything, holding the door open for you, and are generally pleasant. I have two young kids who tend to be messy in restaurants. Every time I go to clean up after them, the staff insists that they will take care of it and not to worry. This location also offer free kids meals on the weekends (Concord Mills does NOT, FYI).  Child friendly restaurants are always a win in my book.
