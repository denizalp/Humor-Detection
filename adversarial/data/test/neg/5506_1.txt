Great place for taking kids to get haircuts.  It is a bit pricey (21.00 per child), but you have to look at that as hazard pay.  They have little cars for the kids to sit in and videos for them to watch while their hair is getting cut.  The stylists are great - very patient and have a bunch of tricks to get the kids to cooperate.  We took our 2yr old for his normal cut and our 3 yr old for her very first one - no tears from either kid.  I'd highly recommend for anyone with small kids that are nervous about first cuts.  One note - they specifically request cash tips.
