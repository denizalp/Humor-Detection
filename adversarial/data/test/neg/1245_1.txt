A great car buying experience. No pressure, and no attitude. Salesperson was agreeable to allow test driving multiple vehicles. Completed the purchase in under an hour, as compared to 5-hours at a Harley Dealer bike purchase. Caution: Only $1500. trade offered on my vehicle which I sold within 12 hrs. later - for $5000 cash. Be smart.
