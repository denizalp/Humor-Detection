Whatever the occasion you can find something to wear here.  I have bought great sundresses, long sleeve t-shirts, great scarves, tub top bras, and much more.  I love this place.  The staff here is really great about helping you find what you are looking for or giving you advice (if you are unsure about the way something looks).  The quality of clothing is on par with Forever 21, so not great but nt bad by any means.  They have great sales and really offer great benefits to regular customers (special sales).  I know I will continue shopping there, but I recommend ladies stop in and look around.  Oh, and it is ladies clothing only.
