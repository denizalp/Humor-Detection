One word, Wow!  This place was absolutely outstanding.  I had heard good things and I was finally able to stop in during my latest trip to Montreal.  I've tried eating here before, but I had never been able to get in because I always forgot to make a reservation.\n\nWe started with the venison tartare which was absolutely mind-blowing.  For my main course I had the steamed cod with smokey broth which was also excellent.  I've heard that the menu here changes pretty regularly, which makes sense for a place like this that aims to serve the freshest meats.\n\nOverall, I will definitely be returning here the next time I'm in Montreal.
