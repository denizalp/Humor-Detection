This is my favorite place to get subs! i always get the number 1. the bread is perfect italian bread, crusty on the outside and soft inside. the employees are always super friendly and i dont mind waiting for them to make my sub because the atmosphere is so cool and interesting. definitely my fav sub place in mentor.
