I came here because the last time I went to Petsmart, I watched them almost drop my dog off of a table. I was expecting good things given that it's in Seven Hills, the store was clean, and the staff was pretty friendly. However, I specifically told them that I wanted my dog to have a teddy bear cut with 1\/2 inch left on the body. I came back to pick up my dog and he was shaved so short I can almost see the skin under and a little poof on his head. He looked like a goat. So disappointed. I guess I need to keep looking for a good groomer.
