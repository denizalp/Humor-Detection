This place will become my usual after having my hair dyed and cut here. The people are friendly, place is clean and they do a good job. I had Sonny as my hair stylist and he was great. He was attentive, very detailed, would tell you exactly how he's going to cut your hair and would give you suggestions on how to style it.\n\nI recommended my sister to get her haircut there. Sonny wasn't working on the Wednesday that she had planned to go so she went with a hairstylist named Sam. She told me she had a positive experience, so I think overall, this place is awesome.\n\nDefinitely will be returning in the future. Oh, the prices are definitely reasonable too. $32 for a female haircut with tax included! Thanks!
