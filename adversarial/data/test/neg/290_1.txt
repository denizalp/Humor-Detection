This place is so small that it's really easy to miss despite being literally right next to the road.  It's very small inside so be prepared to play footsies with your neighbors.  \n\nUpon walking in, there's a distinct feeling that you're supposed to know what to do buf if it's your first time, you just stand there feeling awkward and hope that someone helps you.  Eventually someone did and we were seated for lunch.  The food was good.  \n\nIt's not a bad place but I wasn't overly impressed.
