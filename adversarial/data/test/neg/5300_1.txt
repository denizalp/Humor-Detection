I have leased two Mercedes from Lou Gordon in the internet department over the past several years. Lou is very knowledgeable and makes the experience very simple. Most people dread buying a car but Schumacher and Lou in particular make it a pleasure. The service department is friendly and fast. \nI would recommend this dealership and especailly Lou Gordon to anyone I know looking to have an awesome experience while buying a car.
