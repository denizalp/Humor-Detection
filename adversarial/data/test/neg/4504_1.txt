I come here every couple of months for the past few years and I must say they are doing pretty well (i.e. maintained the food quality and portion) while also adding new dishes\/options to their menu. \n\nThey are typically pretty busy despite having a fair number of tables. Would recommend coming there slightly before the peak lunch\/dinner hours just to avoid the potentially long lineup.
