I LOVE taking the classes here! Alyssa is wonderful and keeps you pushing and motivated the entire class. There's no prior experience needed as she will provide guidance for you the whole time. You get your butt kicked in the best way possible and leave feeling extremely accomplished, I know I do! I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone.
