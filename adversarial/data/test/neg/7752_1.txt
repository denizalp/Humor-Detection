CUSTOMERS BEWARE....Their rewards system was devalued....another AIRMILES SCAM.\n\nThis company's reward system was devalued ..... they have devalued their customer's loyalty. Instead of having two hotel days, I am being told to buy merchandise that I can get from Walmart. In a province hard hit this is how THE PEOPLE care about us.....not one bit.  SHAME on the Staybridge and the IHG chain of hotels and the PEOPLE who made this decision.
