Same as others - BS cleaning fees after we spent 10 hours cleaning and took pictures of a place that was cleaner than how we got it. Apparently clean enough while we were still there to show endlessly with no complaints. Very specifically told me no access to storage at move in until we needed to pack when they were showing the unit and then acted like we should have known we had access to storage all that time. Nice. I didn't have time to pursue the BS \"cleaning fee\" back then, but I'm still mad after 3 years.
