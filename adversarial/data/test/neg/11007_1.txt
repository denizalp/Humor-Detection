I was very excited to eat here but the whole experience was ruined with the horrible service. After walking in and seeing the bartender look at me, a server look at me (neither of whom said a word to welcome me in) and no hostess\/host at the front, I stood there and waited to be greeted. Well, after 10 minutes of standing, with the staff fully aware I walked in, there was still no acknowledgment. They were scheduled to close 40 minutes from when I walked in so all I can think is they didn't want another customer. I was dining alone so it wasn't as if I walked in 40 minutes before closing with a party of 10. Don't waste your time...lots of other sushi options.
