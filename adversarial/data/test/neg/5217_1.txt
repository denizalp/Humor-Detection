Nice outdoor patio and service was nice, so those earn stars. Now for the unfortunate food: the bison burger was a bust ... lots of awkward ingredients meshed together with the stinkiest cheese you'll ever smell (and I mean stop the conversation level stink). Just disappointing and overpriced for lunch. The fish was descent but served at room temp. Why can't I find hot food in this city? Anyway, that's a different story. Also wish they served warm (instead of cold) bread. All in all, not worth the hype that precedes this Calgary 'institution'.
