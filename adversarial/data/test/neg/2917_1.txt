The work that was done by this business has been fine so far.  However, I was told that because I was unable to afford repairs and they were so expensive, I could apply for their partnership with \"Acima credit\" and they would approve me for a \"loan\" that had no fees or interest for 90 days.  So I did it.  After paying an initial $50+ tax the day of service, I received an unusual bill that did not reflect what the staff told me at the Midas shop.  I ended up having to pay nearly an extra $150 to finance the repairs- all so the shop could get the repair and make the sale on that day. I did this the day after the repair because if I waited any longer, the credit company wanted to charge more taxes, fees, and other ridiculousness.  I am utterly disgusted and would have been better off just throwing this on a credit card but was ill-advised by the Midas staff.  I will never go back to this location or any other Midas business as I now find practices to be misleading.
