We stayed here on a timeshare through RCI. The rate was $208 for an entire week but we only stayed 4 nights. After reading some of the reviews, I can attest to most of what others had to say. The parking is horrible however there is a parking garage next to the Daisy #4 building which is one of their newer buildings...that's where we stayed. Three pools, a fitness room, a business center & a shuttle that takes you to & from the store (Walmart), Fremont Street & 3 hotels on the strip. \n\nThe decor is nice. The sheets.... there were small spots of what appeared to be blood stains on one side. The iron was cheap, water kept leaking out of it & the labels for cotton, rayon, polyester etc. had been rubbed off. They provide less than 2 oz. of shampoo & conditioner so bring your own. Turn down service is done after 5-7 days. They do try to get you with signing up for breakfast or brunch for something free. It's a sales tactic & I wasn't interested. The rooms are equipped with washer\/dryer, full kitchen, dishwasher, microwave, stove & a jacuzzi bathtub, that I didn't get to experience. As a courtesy to the neighbors it's suggested that the jacuzzi is used between 8am-10pm. Overall the suites were nice but I doubt that we'll stay there during our next visit.
