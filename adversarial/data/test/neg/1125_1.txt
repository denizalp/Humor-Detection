My wife and I went there using the Groupon mentioned by others. It was a gift she gave me for father's Day. She wanted to try it based on favorable recommendations from her friends. We went there tonight (July 3). We called ahead for seating and when we showed up early we were seated right away in a cozy corner in the rear. We had a nice view out the side street window and enjoyed watching the first haboob of the season blow through. The atmosphere was very inviting and the overall appearance well decorated. My wife thought the lighting was a little dim, which only got worse when the haboob rolled in. Eventually they did brighten the lights. \n\nJeffrey was our waiter and was very helpful and pleasant. We ordered Steve's Shrimp Cocktail for an appetizer. The only difference between that and the regular shrimp cocktail is that the shrimp are grilled instead of chilled. Having said that, the dish (either one) is simply 4 shrimp plus no frills cocktail sauce and a lemon wedge. The presentation seemed sparse. The shrimp were very large and you can order more at $4 each. I'm glad we're tried the grilled shrimp because the seasonings were very tasty but once you get past the seasonings and taste just the shrimp itself, there wasn't much flavor, and that was how the rest of the meal went. My wife ordered the grilled swordfish with loaded baked potato, and I the boneless  ribeye cooked medium well with thin French fries. I chose not to order a side of saut√©ed mushrooms because the menu says they come with all steaks. My steak came with 3 small mushrooms. On a 14 oz steak I'm not sure that qualifies as more than a garnish. Medium well was a little redder than I would have preferred but I chose not to send it back. The flavor was just okay, which was disappointing for the price. My wife tried it and she thought it was tasty. The thin French fries were excellent. My wife wasn't impressed with her swordfish but I thought it was tasty. She did like the baked potato. In addition to a potato, a salad is included and is served with bread after the appetizer and before the entree. We weren't aware of that so my wife asked for bread which was delivered promptly. On my salad I went for the wasabi dressing which was milder than I was anticipating. The salad did include a pepper which made up for the lack of spice I was expecting in the dressing. My wife doesn't like as much spice so I asked her to giver her opinion and she thought the dressing was fine for her palette. For dessert we ordered the cream puff with sea salt caramel glaze a la mode to share. The ice cream was good, the pastry rather plain. My wife and I agreed on that. This came from a local bakery as the only dessert this restaurant makes in house is tiramisu. \n\nAs a point of reference, we like the Keg Steakhouse. The prices and service are comparable but the taste definitely is not. We won't return to DC Steak House.
