I have a few complaints... \n\n1. If you go before 9:30ish pm, your hour workout will take at least two hours. It is so crowded you'll be waiting for everything. Sometimes I go Saturday morning when they open at 8am, and there's already up to 15 people waiting to get in. No big, not until 8:30-9am and it starts getting busy. \n\n2. The hours. Being such a busy gym, why not open 24 hours? I usually workout at night after work, so around 10pm. Unfortunately due to the gym closing at 10pm on Fridays and 8pm on Sat\/Sun, this forces me to either skip the weekend or have to try and wake up early on those days and screw up my workout schedule. It's hard working out Thursday night, then turning around and working out again Friday morning, esp. when you have to get there early enough to beat the crowds.\n\n3. Since there's a bunch of douches that workout there and can't seem to be able to re-rack their weights, you can't depend on staff to do it. The kids working at night are too busy hanging with friends or playing basketball. They finally put up signs in a few places, but that doesn't work. So what's on the bar when I get there, stays there after I'm done; I only re-rack what I put on. They also like to leave dumbbells lying around throughout the facility. Need that one handle for rows or tricep pushdowns and can't find it? Take a stroll through every corner of the gym and you might find it.\n\nThat being said, it's a decent facility with good equipment. Few things need repair, and probably only takes them a week or so to fix it. The locker rooms are also fairly clean. The frontdesk staff aren't super friendly, but like I said, they're kids; at least they aren't rude or anything.
