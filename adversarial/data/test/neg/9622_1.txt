This place is my guilty pleasure. I find myself ordering at least once a week. House Lo Mein (no vegetables), house soup (or hot and sour) and a couple egg rolls. The delivery guy knows my house and my dogs. The ordering, paying, and tipping online makes it super easy. They are super busy most of the time (cause it's really good), so be patient... Or do what I do and order before you get home. Keep up the great work guys!
