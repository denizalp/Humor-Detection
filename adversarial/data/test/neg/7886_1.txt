Always a good place to come in and just get a lot of hearty food. Normally stick to breakfast items here, as I have been let down by some of the other entrees. Today had Meat Lovers Omelette, which was fantastic. Any meal you can get that comes with their large biscuits also is a plus. The family is always happy when we decide to eat here.
