The service here is pretty good. They screwed up my order and gave me a free drink. It wasn't a hard-to-fix screw up at all so that was nice of them.\n\nThey also include toppings like roasted red peppers and caramelized onions and specialty sauces free of charge, unlike Burger Shoppe and Craft Burger who charge for the special toppings.\n\nI usually get the lamb burger. Sometimes it's nice and juicy, sometimes it's greasy, and sometimes it's dried out. The quality of the burgers is inconsistent. It's still a good burger but I'd prefer if they paid more attention to quality and not drying out the meat.
