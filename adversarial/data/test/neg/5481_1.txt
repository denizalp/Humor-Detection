I recently had to go to an urgent care and decided on MedPost on 51st Ave. I was pleasantly surprised. The staff was all friendly and efficient and I got right in after a 30 minute wait. They examined me, took x-rays. But be advised. There is only one PA on staff. Not an MD. I know a little about PAs and how they are educated and how they work. They only go to school for 2 years to become a PA and they are normally supervised by an MD. And I could tell the PA at Medpost wasn't that experienced or knowledgeable. His recommended treatment was odd. He refused to give me a referral to a therapist, saying he wasn't allowed to do so even though other urgent cares have in the past provided a referral. And he gave me instructions that my Cardiologist questioned. The PA also gave me a prescription that my insurance company rejected. Will I go back to this Medpost? It's better than most I've used.
