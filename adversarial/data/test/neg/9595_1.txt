My husband and I were so excited to have a date night away from the kids and try this place out after we saw the reviews on this place. The menu is short of..... Well it's just short, which growing up in south Orange County, CA I was ok with. Our server was very nice. I wanted to sample a couple things off the menu so I ordered the tuna tar tar and mac and cheese, my husband order the steak and for an appetizer. Our server was talking about some peppers and said he would throw some on top of my husband's steak. Our food came, it was ok for the high prices. No peppers on the steak, they came after we finished. Then the bill came along with the $3 charge that we weren't informed of. So what were we supposed to to with a bowl full of peppers that came after our meal??? Personally I won't be back, our meal came to $89 for basically two appetizers as part of line was order weed off of the appetizer menu and the side menu, my husbands meal, a beer and a soda. Oh and of course peppers!!!!
