I came in before Adele! The host stand was prompt and polite. They opened and greeted me at the door really making me feel welcome. After an appropriate wait we got a booth in the main dining room. Xavier greeted us and told us about all the features of the evening and all of his favorites. Our meal arrived in a timely fashion and it was delicious. The manager Nat even came by to check on our table. Even though it was super busy our service was excellent! See you soon!!!
