There is a good reason this place is #1 on Yelp in this area. We ate there 3 days straight for lunch while at a business meeting last week. The patio is very pleasant this time of year. The food is fantastic with reasonable pricing and their \npresentation is beautiful. Great job to all the staff. Thanks!
