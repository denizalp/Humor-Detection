Went to Bob Taylor's for a steak and was disappointed in the whole experience. The service was very slow and the food was sub-par. It's comparable to outback, but a little more expensive. My wife had the smoked prime rib and it was hard to choke down because the flavor was overpowering. Not sure if we just don't have a taste for smoked prime rib... I had the sirloin and it was very salty and not a high quality cut of beef. Overall it's nothing special at Bob Taylors.
