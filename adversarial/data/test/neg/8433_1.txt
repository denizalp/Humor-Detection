So I usually order a Trenta black tea shaken with 6 agave no sweetener. Tell me why the cashier ask the other worker if she has a knife to cut the agave packets. The other worker said she couldn't find the knife and than proceeded to bite the packer open with her teeth. I stopped her and said I'll open it. I stood at the counter opening my own packet of agave while the workers watched me. I am calling Starbucks cooperation about this. I will not order from this location ever again.
