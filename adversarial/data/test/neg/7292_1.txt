Went there last Saturday night, had a blast. the food was pretty good. If your looking for fine dining don't bother. That is not why you come  here. The place is fun, energetic and hilarious. That is if you can take a joke or two. Will defiantly go back. Just don't take anything too serious. It is a bit pricey but it is in a casino and you are going for the entertainment.
