I don't go for the avocado spring roll. I like the spicy pork sausage with sticky rice. The pork sausage is very flavorful. You can taste the spices and ginger. It's not super spicy you cannot enjoy the meat. \n\nTake a bit of sticky rice, dip the sticky rice into the hot sauce then pair with a slice of sausage and shove the entire combo in your mouth. YUM! \n\nI could careless for vegetables in general, but they taste fresh and were still crispy. It's a good way to cool off the spice if you can't handle spicy food.
