The food is mediocre. Just passable. But some of the employees who work here have a serious attitude problem. One time, I was on a date here and the music (which was hard rock) was very loud. We politely asked them to turn it down a little. Instead, the kid cranked it up to top volume. Ughh.I hate it when you're treated like a rash.
