The atmosphere is really great. It was refreshing to find such a trendy place in this area. The service was quick but could be more knowledgable on their drinks and food. The chef nailed it! I got the special; crab stuffed salmon on tomato risotto with lemon drizzled green beans. It was full of flavor. My party of four all really enjoyed their time and food! Pretty nice selection of drafts to chose from as well!
