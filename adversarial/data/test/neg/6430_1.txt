I'm not sure about the previous reviews, but after trying their services for my two small dogs, we were really happy. Scheduled the service two weeks in advance, and on the day of the appointment they called me to let me know they would arrive soon. Rose was very polite, and did a great job. Our dogs were calmed and happy. No signs of being scared or aggressive.\nI will definitely use their services again.
