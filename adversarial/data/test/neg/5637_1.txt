Was really disappointed with the service here. The activity itself is fun and has a great vibe but the servers were just awful. Came here on a double date last Saturday and not only were our orders incorrect but the server never checked back on us afterwards. My friend had to eventually wave down the server after waiting 20 minutes since she was just talking the whole time to another coworker on the other side of the bar. Would suggest coming for the golf games but get dinner beforehand at another place nearby.
