I don't really expect too much from a key-cutting business. All I need is for the copies of my keys to work.\n\nThe proprietor of this business goes beyond cutting your keys, and provides service with a smile. Standard keys cost $3, they are fully guaranteed: the keys have a stamp on them with their name on it, so you don't even need a receipt. If your key doesn't work, just bring it back.\n\nI only wish they had slightly longer hours of business. They close at 5:30 on most days.
