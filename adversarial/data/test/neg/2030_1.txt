I will say this. Not a huge fan of brisket. This place had best fatty brisket I have ever eaten so far. The BBQ here is great. The long lines are insane. Best advice get in line at 930am, wait for 1.5 till they open at 11am and enjoy. I HATE giving 5 star reviews by the way but I have to. Downside is long lines and the price, BBQ is ridiculously expensive. Would I do it again no. Just because lines are too long. If i lived here maybe.(from NC) - bottom line BBQ here is top notch.
