I had never understood the need or the benefits of having Colon Hydrotherapy done. I was so appreciative of the time that Jolli took to set me at ease. She took her time because she knew I was nervous, never having done it before. She explained the difference between the open and closed systems. I know now from my experience, that I was so glad she did the closed system. She took her time to massage my tummy which also helped a lot with the results I got. She not only took the time to explain what she was doing, but why she was doing it.  I have not only been back for other treatments, but I get regular maintenance that has helped me greatly with my weight loss and understanding more about the right nutrition to eat (she even had fresh fruits and veggies to eat!) I also have more energy and I don't feel the bloat or have the gas that I used to. I wish more practitioners would care about their clients as much as Jolli does!
