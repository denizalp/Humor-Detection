so i always seek out new places to eat in the city so i spent some time on the computer looking for places to visit on my lunch break. i stumbled across mod and im glad i did. i love the pizza, love that its set up almost cafeteria style, and love that you can pile on as much toppings as you want FREE OF CHARGE. i got the Tyler. and it was delish. when i go back i wanna try the white pizza's, yes.... when o go back. because i plan to. One bad thing was the staff, hot and cold. some were super friendly, some didn't wanna be there. lol
