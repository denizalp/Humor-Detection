Our friend was craving for a Peruvian food so we decided to give this place a shot. Service was great from the moment we stepped foot in this place. We were greeted with a friendly smile and escorted to our table within 2 minutes of walking in. Waters and drinks took a few minutes but not anything to complain about.  Waitress made some great recommendations and we ended up ordering (for our hungry party of 3): \n\nAPPETIZERS:\n\n1. Papa a la Huancaina, (potatoes Huancayo style): Potatoes with a Peruvian with an aji amarillo cheese sauce. This was pretty tasty although I wish it had a bit more punch in the flavor. This dish I've had better at other places although still tasty.\n\n2. Choclo con Queso Fresco, (LARGE peruvian corn on the cob served with queso fresco and ahi amarillo cheese sauce): This isn't your standard corn on the cobb. The texture is ENTIRELY differently. Color is a light yellow and the size of the kernels are about 4 times the size of your standard white or yellow corn kernels. This is no joke LOL! The texture is more chewy, al dente and that's honestly what I loved so much about it. I recommend cutting the corn kernels off the corn and taking a bit with the quest fresco and cheese sauce on it together. SUPER NOMS - HIGHLY recommend this dish!\n\nENTREES:\n\n1. Arroz con Mariscos (Peruvian Paella): I honestly was very leery to try this when the waitress recommended it because I figured it would probably be overcooked, the rice would be mushy, and overall it would be blah and bland. I was more than pleasantly surprised!  They don't skimp on this dish AT ALL. It was a HUGE plate and the paella was surrounded with beautifully pickled red onions and tomatoes chunks. The rice was perfectly cooked, still al dente, packed full of flavor, and LOADED with FRESH seafood. The seafood was perfectly cooked and not rubbery surprisingly! It came with baby scallops, mussels, clams, squid, Octopus, and shrimps.  We eat ate 2 bowls and still had half the dish left to take home. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this dish as well!!\n\n2. Pollo a la Brasa (Peruvian Rotisserie Chicken): You can order a quarter, half, or whole order. We got the whole chicken and it was AWESOME!!! I'm not a huge fan of dark meat but it was very flavorful, moist,  and juicy. The only thing I was missing was the crisp on the skin. The fries that it came with were blah but dip the chicken in the two salsas they provide and it's a game changer!! The white beans it came with were surprisingly delicious too. They were more watery, but super creamy and packed full of spices and flavor.\n\nDESSERT:\n\nI forgot what they're called but they're essentially (2) flaky buttery shortbread cookies stuffed with dulce de leche. They were definitely good but very rich and not anything super special. I wouldn't go out of my way to order it but if it was ever in front of me again, I would definitely eat it :P\n\nCome give this place a shot my fellow foodie bears! I'll definitely be back!!
