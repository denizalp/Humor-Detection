VEGAS BABY!!! I am sure we have heard that enough so I will be sure not to use it again in any Vegas related reviews ... but I had to get one in there for the heck of it. \n\nI have been to N9NE a few times (located inside the Palms Hotel & Casino near the front desk). The entrance is actually leading to an elevator right past the entrance to Ghost Bar (which is also pretty cool). The staff is very friendly and welcoming from the initial greeter to the waiter and his helper. In a town with a lot of great dining, service is the next thing to look for and N9NE delivers on both from beginning to end. It is very pricey but what \"A\" or 5 Star quality restaurant isn't? You definitely pay for what you get and it is worth it. \n\nFood is fantastic here and if you do not like something, they will not hesitate to correct that. Portions are smaller but funny thing, I walked out of there completely full. N9NE is primarily a steak house but the seafood is outstanding here as well. I didn't make it to desserts this time around but did see them at other tables and they looked amazing. \n\nI would definitely recommend N9NE for a special date night or a business dinner to impress. The atmosphere is dim lighted but not terrible and you never know who might be dining there either ... after all, it is Vegas. \n\nFavorite dish: Rock Shrimp Appetizer, these bite size gems are amazing. Be warned though because the container they come in is misleading as it is only half filled. \n\nGo out and EAT!
