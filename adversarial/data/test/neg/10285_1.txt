Arrived about 11AM on a Friday, found out they did not have my first choice for breakfast, found out they did not have my second choice either, the home fries that came with the omelet appeared and tasted like they were cooked for the third time, dark and greasy. The coffee was not that great either. The tab was $25.00 for two people for two omelets. I do not plan on returning !
