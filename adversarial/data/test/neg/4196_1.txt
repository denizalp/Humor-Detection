I've been coming here regularly for the past 6 months, you cannot beat the lunch deal, 5$ for a huge plate of food! The mutton somosa's are great (4 for a dollar), if you get them hot out of the oven they are to die for! The guys are always super nice as well. The curry itself is average, if comparing to a traditional dine in experience; however considering its fast food, it's superb!\n\nSome more combo's, and samples I would give the place a solid 5 stars!
