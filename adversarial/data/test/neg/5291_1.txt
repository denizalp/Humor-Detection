Several thoughts after dining at Liverpool House because I could not get a reservation at Joe Beef:\n\n- It was your typical Saturday evening for a popular restaurant such as this; busy crowd of people looking for a good dinner in nice setting.  I had come to the Liverpool House with my companion after not being able to get a reservation\/drop in spot at the bar at Joe Beef next door.  We were recommended by the Joe Beef hostess to try Liverpool House since they do not accept reservations.  \n\n- After walking into Liverpool House the man responsible for greeting and seating guests was kind enough to find seating for my companion and myself within 10 minutes after first questioning why we didn't have a reservation.  We were told we would need to order, eat and be out within the hour becuase the table was needed for a reservation, although, as the our time at Liverpool House dragged on it was 40 minutes before our waiter even took our order and there seemed to be multiple tables opening up all ove the restaurant.  (I still have not been able to get a straight answer from anyone working at Liverpool House whether reservations are accepted or required) \n\n- My companion and I ordered wine and beers by the glass.  The options are not abundant but they are unique.  There is an extensive list of wines if you choose to order it by the bottle but I would have liked to see some additional beer selections across a broader spectrum since those offered by Liverpool House were reasonably similar in taste.\n\n- The menu is written on a chalk board, paper menus are not provided.  You are expected to make your selections from here which can cause for an awkward moment when you will be standing next to one of the tables that sit directly under them.  Do not be surprised if you receive some annoyed stares from the patrons sitting at these tables if you need to hover near them as you read the menu.\n\n- My companion and I were seated in a position that was obstructed from viewing the menu options.  I have a reasonable grasp of French and am able to get by quite well, especially at a restaurant, but my companion did not speak the language.  Consequently, I was able to read the majority of the menu offerings but we had also asked the waiter for his recommendations after having told him which menu options we had been considering.  Instead of the menu options we picked out he suggested we order the lamb, a Liverpool House speciality, instead of ordering 2-3 plates to share between us.  The lamb was NOT listed on the menu under the \"Plates\" portion of the menu but we decided to take his recommendation as well as oder the tomato salad as an appatizer. \n\n-  The tomato salad was just as good as some of the best I have ever had.  The lamb was expertly prepared and the accompanying sides of steamed seasonal vegetables were equally as good.  All of the ingredients seemed fresh.  \n\n- I will admit, the lamb was HUGE.  There was enough meat to easily feed hungry 3-4 people, far more than the serving for two it is advertised as and we were lucky to have eaten half of this.  We had wished that our waiter had accurately described just how much meat would be part of the meal becuase we would have stuck with our original plate selections.\n\n- My less than stellar rating comes from the service provide by our waiter.  After seeing the size of our meal we had the discomforting feeling of having been upsold on the lamb and that our waiter had taken advantage of my less than perfect masterly of the French langugae and my companions complete lack of knowledge of the langugae.   When we told him this we during our meal he protested in the middle of the restaurant trying to justify his suggestion as being no different in size or cost than us having ordered two plates; one each.  \n\nFor us, the cost was not the issue, more rather tha we felt he took advantage tof the lanuage barrier to upsell us on the most expensive menu offering that was clearly too large for the two of us.  Further, the lamb was listed under the Desserts on the menu, far away from the listing of Plates where we had been looking - which had been communicated to him.  We both found his behaviour to be both awkward and rude as he continued to protest and argue while patrons from other tables began to stare, making for a more than awkward remainder of the meal until oour eventual exit from the restaurant. \n\nFinal thoughts; the food was excellent but the service of our waiter was terrible making for a sour note on the evening and will discourage me from ever returning to Liverpool House.  I will plan to share my experience with my friends and others in the hope that they will take note and either avoid Liverpool House or be better prepared.
