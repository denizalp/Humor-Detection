This place has declined with its service and food quality. Tacos where lightly served with meat, pico really was bland, no seasonings. Waitress seamed like she didn't know what she was doing. And for the price very unreasonable. Also rice took thirty minutes to bring. Overall wouldn't go back and wouldn't recommend unless you like eating taco bell this would be good to you but we are mad ethnic personally and with all honesty this some walmart tacos if there where walmart tacos.
