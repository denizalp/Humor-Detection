BlackBear is a good place to eat breakfast items. Rest of the menu. Nothing special regular food rest of time but breakfast is good. Not cheap, average to higher price.No alcohol served. Open through out holidays like Christmas y New Years it will be open y packed because it is only place open on actual holidays for those wanting to eat out! Will\nbe packed! Tip well or you will disappoint hard working people,who gave up their family holiday to make $ waiting on you! Merry Christmas y Happy New Years!
