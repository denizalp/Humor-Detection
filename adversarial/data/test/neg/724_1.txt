This bar is a divey version of a Gameworks or Dave & Busters. They have a decent little happy hour with $4 drafts- lots of good options to choose from. There are also food deals- we had personal pizza, bacon wrapped corn dog, and pork sliders- all of which were lackluster. Games are free on the food\/bar side and they have Golden Tee, Dig-Dug, etc. There is a bar only side with fooseball and video poker which allows smoking. Great place for beer and games- don't bother ordering food.
