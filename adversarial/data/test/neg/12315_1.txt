Hey, not bad.\n\nI was actually dreading coming here initially. A huge group of us just flew in to Vegas and now we're starrrrving. We wanted a place closeby, and somehow we stumbled upon it. \n\nI'm happy to say my food was not drenched in tons of oil or MSG, like usual Asian restaurants! The portions are deceiving, too... it doesn't look like a lot, but it's filling! Especially noodles, since they're carbs.\n\nI recommend the spicy peanut noodles. I'm a sucker for those... definitely not as good as the ones in the bay area, but not complaining. I split it with my friend actually, and it didn't seem like enough, but after a few minutes of sitting around waiting for the check, I felt satisfied. \n\nI didn't get to try any of the soup noodles, but they all looked pretty good. Seemed like everyone enjoyed their food... lots of leftovers, too!
