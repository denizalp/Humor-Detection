The people were rude, no one was available to help, everyone was busy talking behind the counter.  No one looked up to acknowledge customers. I asked for help and no one seem to be interested in helping me just whatever they are doing. Greet your customers and acknowledge them when they're in your store. I have been in customer service for 15 years, a small business owner myself, I always try to support my local business but not this one after how I was treated
