The food was good. I was a little disappointed with my po' boy shrimp sandwich because it only had 4 shrimp inside. For the size of the bread and sandwich seemed like very little, I left half the sandwich bread cause nothing was inside. The soft shell crab was ok and the fries I felt were a bit under seasoned for being cajun fries. We also ordered the shrimp étouffée but when we got it, there was sausage inside which we don't eat so we sent it back. The fried calamari was good, a little salty for me but still good. Our waitress was quick and efficient, service was quick. Service better than food.
