For a chain, it's pretty decent BBQ. There's always more food than you can eat too, so prepare for a doggie bag (does anyone call it that anymore?) The meat combos are the way to go if you want to try a variety. If you know what you like you can narrow that down to your fave. If you have an ass made of steel, try the Wilbur's Revenge sauce...you'll feel that the next day, I guarantee it. Personally I mix the Texax Pit and Sweet Zesty, nice smokey sweet kick. Give it a try and give me credit ;)
