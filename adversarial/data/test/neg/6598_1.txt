I took my dog there to get groomed and this poor mark on my pup! I didn't get a call or even a heads up. I called to complain and they denied it and then became incredibly rude when I told them there is no other way he could have gotten that besides them (literally the same day). Unless you want to get your loving pet hurt I wouldn't suggest going here. The staff and management could care less how they treat your pet. They didn't refund me or pay my vet bill after telling them I had to take him in. The vet described this being a burn mark or cut from clippers. \n\nUpdate to owners review. I have added photos of the \"puncture wounds\" that they are denying. I also want to state that I did give my groomer gratuity due to asking the customer pay for the service before actually seeing your pet. As for seeming satisfied when I left the place of business, I am not sure any person would inspect their pet for wounds after taking their pet to the groomer. This post is 1.5 months later due to having a newborn.  I would never even think of coming back to their business but it is clear how important customer service is by reading the response of the owner.
