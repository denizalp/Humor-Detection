Tried the Bacon Double Cheese Burger topped with lettuce, tomato, pickles, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, green peppers, and mustard. Also had the Regular Fries\n\nThe Good News:\nThe burgers had a nice charbroiled flavor and cooked well as advertised.\nThe cheese and the toppings were tasty and plentiful. I liked idea of crumbled bacon instead of strips.\nI would agree with the published reviews that their fries are the best I've had at a fast food hamburger franchise. The serving size was also generous and a good deal and I liked eating my fries from the cup, which made it easier to add plenty of ketchup the way I like.\nEnjoyed munching on the free peanuts while we waited for our order.\nService was quick and pleasant.\nTheir drink dispenser, what I have decided to call a \"Coke Replicator\", was cool.\n\nThe Rest of the Story:\nThe burgers were not juicy as advertised and, therefore, not as flavorful as some other fast food franchise hamburgers.\nThe bacon on my burger was overcooked and, therefore, did not add as much flavor to the sandwich as I would like.\nThe green peppers would have been better grilled like the other toppings.\nThe bun was rather limp and not what I would have expected from a place like this.\n\nThe Verdict:\nThe most important reason for going to burger joint is to enjoy a juicy, flavorful hamburger and that was not achieved. The fries compensated a lot, but not enough to make it a truly memorable experience. I do intend to try at least one more location.
