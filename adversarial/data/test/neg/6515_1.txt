Stayed here multiple times , usually with family and friends.  We loved staying here until this last time... Went to the pool with my son. I'm a smoker and I did not realized that there is a no smoking sign on the door so I was smoking in the pool and this security named FRANK ... Security guy that was seating by the door .. Yell at me and said that this is a non-smoking area and take that out right now... Open the door and said now.. Take that out now...repeatedly.  I have no problem following rules but this security guy is so RUDE... It's not what you are saying it's how you say it... I am after all a guest . Smoker or not. I told him that he does not have to yell and he can say it nicely and do not have to be rude. ... Employees like him ruin nice hotel\/ resort like this... I understand that the security was not employed by the resort but by the owners HOA  ... But still since this guy is a part of the resort , He carry the name of the resort. Again... FRANK ... Enough reason not to come back in a nice resort like this. Will surely tell everyone I know about this.
