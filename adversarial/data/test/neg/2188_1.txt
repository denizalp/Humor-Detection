The players club change their rules when they feel like it. It's funny how I receive an email for \"new member promotions\" on the 27, it's good for 7 days, I go in on the 2nd and they say it's when they \"sent it\" not when you receive it. They do nothing to rectify the situation and don't give a shit. I'll take my presidential status elsewhere.  Ridiculous.
