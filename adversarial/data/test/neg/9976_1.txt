Disaster .. Wishing I could give 3 negative stars . Had asked for a bid for 2 panes that had the plastic panes slipping . First bid was high and I had SR Windows and Glass give me another .. What was missing in their end bid was a job half done .Now I only have one window with drooping pane..Just nuts !\n If you are crazy enough to deal with these people get everything in detail and in writing as they are super 'smoke and mirrors show' with this aspect.\nWhen I told them that \"both windows had the bronze 'panes'\" and mentioning I wanted \"them\" fixed I received a bid ,but seemingly only for one pane ..Now it looks horrible as only one was fixed and paid more than 60% of the previous bid ,what a rip . Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder could have ascertained what was needed and what I wanted but now it looks junk . My advice is shop around and if you feel the need to support this business get  detailed estimate on exactly what is happening . Better yet choose another company with better dealings and customer service . I give SR Windows & Glass = huge FAIL .
