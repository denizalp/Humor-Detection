Sandy Margolin is the most professional and knowledgeable realtor my husband and I have ever worked with.  We have bought 8 houses in the past and we know what it struggle it can be.  Not this time!  She is a true pleasure to work with, always returns calls, texts, or e-mails you back.  She stayed one step ahead of any problem we might have had, and we just can't say enough good things about her.   She made purchasing a home enjoyable, and we would highly recommenr her to anyone.
