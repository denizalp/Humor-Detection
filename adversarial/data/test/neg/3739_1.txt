I was thrilled to find out a Panera was opening in the East Valley. Every time I'm in California we seek out a Panera for that salad and sandwich fix with awesome iced tea. Paradise is ok but no amount of rebranding or bringing Panera items to the menu really did it for me.\nThis location...was a bit disappointing. They could have done so much better. The most glaring difference between this Panera and others I've visited, the staff is completely missing the signature customer service and efficiency. The first visit, the cashier didn't know the menu, the tables don't have the location pagers so we had to flag down our food. The employee cleaning the soda machine was chatting with friends and people behind the counter and we had to interrupt just to ask if we could get to the ice. Another visit when we used the drive through, every part of the order was wrong. I know food allergies are a pain to deal with but it's just a bummer to get all the way home and find out I couldn't eat most of my food. Especially when I double checked that the items I ordered didn't have cheese.\nI'll probably come back if I'm in the area because the food really is good. But I'm not making the drive just for a Panera fix anytime soon.
