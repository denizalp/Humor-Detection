32Shea used to be a drive through coffee business.  The coffee is still yummy and the drive-in  remains open through lunch.  \nThe kitchen and eating area inside are tiny - maybe 8 tables. The menu includes homemade baked goods, sandwiches, many on fresh ciabatta, salads, and a single entree each night... it's a tiny kitchen. \nI have tasted about half the menu items, including caprese, bruchetta, different daily flatbread pizzas and haven't found one I didn't like.\nOne unexpected aspect is a bar with an excellant selection of alcohal. My favorite is a a minted lemon drop martini. My friend enjoys a manhattan or Crown Royal.  They serve an honest pour.\nOutside is an enclosed patio which is dog friendly. It's a great place to relax, listen to the occasional band, or read a book.\nWhen you go in, it's easiest to order at the register. Then they bring your food to you. The staff is friendly and informed. You do have to get their attention once in a while, but it is worth it.\nEnjoy!
