I needed to get some work done on my car recently, and Goodfellas did incredible work on my 2005 Hyundai Accent! I hit a pole a few years ago and decided it was time to get it fixed and have my windows tinted. Not only did Goodfellas replace the fender and repair the bumper, they fixed some dents and scratches on the side of my car, replaced the headlights and 2 axles, and flushed and changed the transmission fluid as well. They went above and beyond my expectations: when I came to pick it up, my car looked absolutely brand new! The entire car was buffed and detailed and the tinted windows looked perfect. \n\nFor all the hard work they did and extra time spent fixing some major issues they found, they gave me an AMAZING deal, and I am extremely satisfied with my car and experience with them! These guys are friendly, professional, and give excellent customer service. You cannot beat their quality of work and prices; you will not be disappointed! I plan to return again in the future. Thanks Goodfellas!
