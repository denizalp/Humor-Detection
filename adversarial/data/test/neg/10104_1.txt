I recently had to get a crown and was amazed at the technological advances: Dr. Gombert has invested in the technology to make crowns in-house, thus eliminating the need to wear a temporary crown and make a return visit. Equally impressive is the technology allows him to view the tooth \"under-repair\" in his office, thus offering an added quality-control measure. The entire pain-free procedure only took around two hours! To top things off, Dr. Gombert called that evening to check up on me!
