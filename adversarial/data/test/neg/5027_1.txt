This place never disappoints. We had the filet mignon with lobster tail all cooked to perfection. The chipotle Mac n cheese is simply the best and topped off with the cheesecake which is to die for. I usually dine at the one in Los Angeles and it is great to know that the same great service and outstanding food is available here in Vegas.
