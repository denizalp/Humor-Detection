I really wanted to like this place. I was super excited to try all the delicious sugary brunch foods I saw on the website. But after my experience I will not be returning. Our main server was very curt with us, missed some orders and spilled boiling water on my lap blaming the \"over filled tea kettle\", the apology was nice but I wished she had run over a towel or some more napkins without having to be prompted. Our group was excited for the food but only my friend who order the beef bacon hash was satisfied. My other friend who ordered the sausages did not like them and found the little sausage medallions very rubbery. My French toast was very soupy, the bread had almost dissolved into the syrup before I could finish it. I had one soggy slice left over and the server said she would pack it up for me. But she never returned (which was fine by me). I think I would be willing to return if it was only a food issue (maybe the kitchen was having an off day - it happens to us all) but the server was so short with us and kept trying to take our plates while we were eating it has turned me off White Brick Kitchen. Oh well, on to the next sugary delicious brunch place :)
