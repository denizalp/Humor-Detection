I'm generally not a fan of buffets but this one isn't so bad for the price. For the breakfast buffet, without a players card, it's $7.99 and $2 off with one. Made to order omelets are the highlight. There's a sweet bar for those with a sweet tooth and of course beer for breakfast, if that floats your boat. (I mean really... its Vegas!) My disappointment was in the fruit selections and otherwise healthier breakfast options. It really deserves 3.5 stars.
