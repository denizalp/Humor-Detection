The food here is really good.  I really enjoyed the smokey Joe sandwich.   My girlfriend enjoys the carver.  Hob Nob's is conveniently close to where we live, but we have stopped going due to consistently bad service.  I get better service at the gas stations in south central Phoenix than I do at this restaurant.  It took well over an hour to get our food (Two sandwiches?).  When I finally approached the cashier about how long our food was taking, I noticed several baskets of food waiting to be dispersed.  The cashier offered a lame excuse about how busy the restaurant was, but there were maybe 10 people inside.  \n\ntl;dr version:  The food is good, but the service is consistently terrible.
