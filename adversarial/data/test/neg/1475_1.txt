Amazing Caribbean flavours. So good, I can't even. I love how the takeout is served in cute boxes rather than styrofoam or plastic. The jerk chicken is so savoury and smokey and yet it is moist and falls off the bone. The rice and peas with oxtail gravy is perfect and you can taste the fresh spices and scotch bonnet. The plaintain tastes like dessert and the slaw is so freshly made as if it was picked from the garden and tossed. I think of mama's cooking. Can't wait to go back and taste the other offerings! So glad this place exists.
