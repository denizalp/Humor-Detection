I went here on Friday night with my family and it was a pretty meh experience. I think outback is one of those chains where somehow they fool people into thinking their food is good, but, in reality, it isn't. They do have good bread and good caesar dressing, but all of the steaks I have had there have been mediocre at best. This particular visit was not so great because my Grandma ordered lamb chops, but they turned out to be too spicy for her, so she asked for a less spicy version and they were very nice about it...but when it came back it was raw....not so awesome. So she had to send it back again and everyone else was done with their meal before she got hers. Also, I had the teriyaki steak and it was super sweet....not something I would want again. The meat was tough and it was just covered in the sweet sauce. It came over some odd tasting rice....not great.  I got it with a sweet potato which was drowned in butter and sugar. It just isn't someplace I would want to eat again if I had a choice.
