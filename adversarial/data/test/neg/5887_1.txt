As an Arizona resident I am truly jealous we do not have this place.. The Island\/X game vibe tandem up nicely. Branded as a t shirt & flip flop ambiance, I actually saw a few white collars pop in for an assumed lunch break. Food here is delicious and low priced. I've had fish, shrimp, steak, and chicken in a variety of tacos, bowls, and burritos- all equivocally satisfying. Personal favorite has to be the Scream'N Chicken burrito as I prefer spice.  Highly recommended as a self described foodie. Even exploring franchise opportunities in AZ.
