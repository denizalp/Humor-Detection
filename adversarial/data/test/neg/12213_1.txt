Love this place for a healthier brunch or lunch!  Order at the counter and they are pretty quick to bring out your food, making it a great spot for a weekday lunch!  They have kombucha on tap and an excellent coffee menu. \n\nI love their sandwiches, breakfast burrito, grain bowl and breakfast biscuit!  Tucked away just off of South Blvd, makes this a great go-to in South End!  Greta addition to the neighborhood.
