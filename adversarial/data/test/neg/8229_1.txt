I come here once and a while when I don't want a burrito from Fat Bastards, in the past three four years that I have been coming I always recieved cold meat. It is a health regulation for shawarma places to warm up the chicken on the grill or pan since the rotator does not get it up to proper serving temperatures. Every single time I want to give them another chance I'm left disappointed from the coldness of whatever I've ordered. I really hope they change that and up there standards since everything else is quite good.
