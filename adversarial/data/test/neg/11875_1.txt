This pizza was great!  You can order the lunch menu 2 slices (huge) whichever way you want.  You can do the specialty pet slice and it's made to order not just sitting under a light.  I got the chicken and blue cheese one and also the all meat one.  Very good crust and toppings were of high quality.  Well done Stumpys!
