The art of the purple roll. Best sushi I've had. Wife was craving sushi and needed her fix. Came in right before they closed and it was packed. Luckily got right in, had great service. I had the OMG roll and oh my dad was it great. Had a smoky taste, came out on fire, all boxes were checked. Highly recommend!
