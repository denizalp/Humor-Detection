AMAZING!!!  I eat out multiple times a week while traveling for work and as a result am usually disappointed when trying a new restaurant.  Fin and Fino is one of the best places I've been to in a LONG time!  \n\nTook a friend here for her birthday and the \"Treatment\" is by far the best way to go!  $5 is donated to charity and it gives the most well rounded tour of the menu.  We had 7 small plate courses including oysters, shrimp, pork belly, beef, tuna tartare, scallops, fish and the most unbelievable cheesecake!!  \n\nInterior is well designed (minus the step when you first walk in) and spacious!  Seating is comfortable and service was excellent! \n\nTake advantage of the option to reserve a table because this place isn't going to slow down any time soon!   Can't wait to go back!!
