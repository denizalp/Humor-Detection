Super friendly staff and the food was very homey. I loved it! The biscuits and gravy taste just right and the prices cannot be beat! We ordered for for two and the bill was just over $16. And just found out that 100% of the proceeds go towards feeding hungry kids! Wow! I'm blown away! You can tell the staff here are very happy to be here. Made me feel great knowing they were a non-profit establishment. Highly recommend.
