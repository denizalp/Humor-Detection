I love this Y so much! I have developed a soft-spot for it in the short 6 months I've been going to it. My work situation had recently changed, making the Dowd a less convenient option for me, but I've decided to keep my membership just so I can go whenever I can. \n\nThe facility is full-service, and it has just about everything I need. Everyone who works there is very nice and helpful. I still have to wait for a machine every once in a while, but that's to be expected at such a popular place.\n\nI love that the Dowd isn't overrun with kids like Harris is. Dowd still has a child care center and kid-centered activities, but I can go to this Y, be an adult, and not have to dodge 500 kids in the hallway.\n\nThe women's locker room is huge. I don't lounge around in the buff like some other members do, but I appreciate the shame-free environment. At Harris, I feel like I have to constantly cover up and worry about offending people. At Dowd, I can change my clothes without acting like I'm rushing to go on stage in 30 seconds. \n\nI'm constantly on a search for nice steam rooms, and Dowd's is very good. It's large and the cleanest one I've seen so far. It's a tad too hot for me, but not a huge issue. The showers are kept very clean, and I appreciate that.\n\nI am always recommending the Dowd to friends and family. It's a great place, and I'm thankful that it is in Charlotte.
