DDD got this right! We frequent this gas station but never dreamt of eating there. I always thought eating at a gas station was, well, gross but decided to try this place after seeing it DDD. Tom's food is actually really good food! The BBQ is tender, the Mac and Cheese is ON POINT and NOT DRY, and although we can't stand Cole slaw, theirs is darn good! Sampling most, or all, the barbecue sauces at the bbq bar is a must if you are trying any of the meats for the first time and like variety. \n\nThe sweets in the glass case, although I don't think it's necessarily part of Tom's Thumb (the beautiful display case as you walk out), are all prepared a real pastry chef! She is AMAZING! About $5 per piece per dessert, and although small if you aren't stuffed, it's all WELL worth every single penny.
