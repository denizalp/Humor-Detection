I have only had mani\/pedi's at the Red Door, but they are the best I've ever had anywhere. I don't have artificial nails, and I've always had problems with the polish on my nails chipping - like the very next day!!!  I don't know what Gina does, but the polish on my fingernails lasts a full week, and then they don't chip, they merely wear at the tips. And the toe polish lasts weeks & weeks! \n\nThe warm 'bucky' on the shoulders is an added bonus as are the complimentary neck\/shoulder massages (when the masseuse has time)
