If you are looking for a hip place with great food and cocktails, this spot is for you. I went here on a Saturday night with no reservation and they were able to accommodate us immediately. The cocktail list was unique and had many options worth trying. I had their interpretation of a boulevardier, which had a nice blend of spirits. The menu was a la carte with nicely sized entrees. The mussels here are by far my favorite in Madison, which surprised me considering the other places I have been to specifically for mussels in the area. I would go back for drinks and appetizers.
