One of my favorite places in the area. Good service and food, at a reasonable price. Sometimes you might get a bad server.. One that caters to the better looking tables. But.. The spinach artichoke dip and steak boxy are my favorite items from their menu. Can't ever go wrong with Hooley house for the night out or dinner. :)
