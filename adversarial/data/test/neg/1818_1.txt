This complaint is specifically for one of your \"dog trainers\" at this location. I don't know if there is more than one trainer there, but he is a Caucasian male with dark hair and HUGE gauges in his ears. I didn't happen to get his name and I REFUSE to go back to that store as long as he continues to work there. First of all, it's bad enough going in there with this annoying, obnoxious guy working. He generally stands there making weird, loud noises or singing... but he crossed a HUGE line the last time we came in. He came up and started talking to the cashier while we were waiting for another employee to grab something for us. He was standing about 8 feet or so from us. He looks over at my dog and rings this loud bell he had in his hand right at him.. My pup backed up behind me with his ears pinned back (I don't blame him). The guy then proceeds to say \"Awww.. you don't like that?\" Comes up to us and rings the bell right in his face, scaring him yet again... You'd think he'd be able to read signs of scared\/uneasy dog behavior considering he is supposed to be the store's DOG TRAINER! What kind of piece of filth purposely tries to scare someone else's pet for no reason? Do you not require any sort of training before you hire these people? He is in no way fit to be teaching your customers how to handle their dogs when he goes around your store, representing you, acting in such a repulsive way. He has no business working there and should be fired.
