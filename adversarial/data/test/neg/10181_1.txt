I love Kaya.  It is a cool place with an interesting atmosphere.  I've dined here several times and have thoroughly enjoyed my experience every single time.  \nIt is a long, thin restaurant with a slightly larger room in the back.  When you walk in, there is a long bar on one wall and a long series of tables along the other wall.  The tables are easily configured so that you can have parties of two or move tables together for larger parties.  I've come with parties as large as eight and they were accommodating for any size party.\nThe menu has a variety of options and although it changes seasonally, there are some items that seem to be staples and always on the menu.  There are a wide variety of appetizers, really something that will please every palate.  What I like is that although entrees are on the pricier side ($20+ each) there are appetizers that are substantial enough that you can make a meal from one or two of them.  \nMy favorite entr√©e I've had was a steak with chili rellenos.  It was packed full of flavor and a pretty substantial portion size.  In terms of appetizers, my favorites have been the yucatan bean dip and conch fritters.  Both are unique and full of flavor.\nThe drink menu offers many tropical options and standard fare as well.  I did find the drinks a bit overpriced for the size you get, but they were very tasty.\nKaya is an enjoyable dining experience and I will be back\/
