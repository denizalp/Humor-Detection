If you're in the mood for ramen - Futo Buta is the place to go! I love their Rice Crispy Squares app (fried rice cubes with spicy tuna & wasabi soy sauce), the Duck Confit Bun, and as for ramen - go for the Tonkotsu! The broth is crazy flavorful, there's pork belly (my fave!), and it'll give you lunch for the next day. \n\nTip: Ramen tastes even better the next day!
