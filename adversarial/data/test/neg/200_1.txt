I've been a few times, okay like 200 times and it's still just as lovely each and every time. The food is always consistent and well, the complimentary garlic bread is scrumptious. (Get yourself some of that until you can't move any more.) \n\nI'm the boring customer that gets the same thing each time but hey when it's good why get something else?!?!  I get the RWB pasta, and to reward myself the creme brûlée. I did try the peach cobbler once but it wasn't my favourite, rather it tasted like warmed up cobbler that wasn't made that day but sat in the fridge for a day. But this is my opinion so, take it for what you want. \n\nBack on the topic, this place is great and worth the wait. Heads up: You can always stalk the bar area and I've been lucky to have people leave after 5 minutes in the bar area rather than the 20 minutes for the dinning area.
