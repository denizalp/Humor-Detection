The good: - Their macarons are amazing. Not only are they super cute, they taste wonderful. I liked them more than the macarons we had at La Duree in Paris. \n- The decor and packaging are on point! The cake boxes look clean and hip, and open up in a way that's easy to get the cake out, and a perfect background taking Instagram pictures. They really paid attention to the little details here.\n\nThe Bad:  They did not do my customization like I had asked even though they told me it wasn't a problem. \n- They were going to charge an extra 2$ to put on \"happy birthday\". At 38$ for a 6 serving cake, I feel like you should be able to provide that for free. \n- There were large cracks on the side of the cake. Again, at this price point, I expect the cake to look perfect, and this is a huge miss. \n\nConclusion: I was really excited to try this place out because the flavors looked really unique and those cute macarons. The cake overall was disappointing, the flavor combination sounded great (I had the Lady Earl), but in practice the chocolate overpowered the other flavors. With a name like Lady Earl, I would have expected the Earl Grey flavor to shine through and it didn't. I would give a pass to the cake, but definitely come back for their macarons.
