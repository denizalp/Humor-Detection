After a bad experience with their Scottsdale location, I called the Phoenix branch and spoke with Tim and set up an appointment to \"buy\" a car. All I needed was to test drive a couple models to decide on which one would be the best fit for me. I show up for the appointment and I'm told Tim is off today. The one guy working already had a customer and wasn't available to help me out. This is similar to my complaint with the Scottsdale location. They have plenty of vehicles that they do not want to sell.  I drove 30 miles for today's appointment only to be told \"No Car for You!\" Hertz needs to redesign their business model towards a model where Car sales is actually part of the overall plan!
