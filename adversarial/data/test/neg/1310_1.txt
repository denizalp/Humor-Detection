This store had a decent selection of fabric and all the same patterns available at other JoAnn stores, but I was totally unimpressed. \n\nI signed up for a sewing class and the instructor was 15 minutes late. Then, she decided to change the project for the class so we ended up spending the first 30 minutes of the class buying new fabric and patterns (which could have taken longer, but thankfully there were only 2 of us enrolled in this class). The projects ended up turning out well, but it was a disappointing experience as the class was stopped promptly at the end time and I feel like I didn't get my ful allotted time. \n\nThe store is in a strip mall of not-so-great stores, so with that taken into account, the inside of the store looks fairly well maintained. The day I was there, there were 2 teenage boys working in the store who were unable to answer my questions which is less than ideal, but I guess if that's all you can get to work in the store... \n\n*sigh* I'll stay in my corner of the valley to shop for fabrics. If this is your corner of the valley, head South to the SanTan location - it's great.
