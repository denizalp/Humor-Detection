Nia was amazing!! She was so helpful and knew exactly what I was thinking. All the staff was so friendly and accommodating. The gowns are gorgeous and I found three gowns I am in LOVE with!! So excited to see Nia again if you go definitely ask for her. She picked out a gown that I thought I wouldn't like but now it's in the top running!
