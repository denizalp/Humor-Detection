I've been wanting to try this place for awhile since I kept seeing their signs for 'street tacos'. I finally went in today to check them out. Ordered a couple barbacoa tacos and a chicken quesadilla with some salsa from the salsa bar. Everything was really good and the people working the front counter were very nice. I wouldn't hesitate to go back and try more dishes.
