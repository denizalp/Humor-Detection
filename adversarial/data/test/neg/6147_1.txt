Have not been to Sakana for a while but have liked it a lot for a number of years.  Wow, have things changed in just a few months. Prices higher....that's okay.  My favorite dish prepared in a  completely different manner....  We were there with a group of 7...we had invited 5 others.  My husband was kept waiting for his order quite a while after everyone had been served.  First told it would be here in just a minute.  Then the waiter came back to admit it had not even been prepared yet.  Everyone went about eating and I finally shared my dish with my husband and said we could cancel his chicken salad.  Just then it came,  so he gave it a try.  No dressing....frozen chewy chicken on top.  I gave him back the other half of my meal and we continued to share and brought the chicken home to feed to our dog.  WHAT a disappointment from a restaurant we have liked so much.  My husband quietly told the waiter to bring him the check and immediately he went to the other end of the table and asked....do you want separate tickets....which made everyone uncomfortable and reaching for their wallets.  I motioned to the waiter NO....my husband wants the bill.  It was just a BAD DAY.  Sorry to say enough bad things happened that we will move on.  We have lots of other choices in Scottsdale.  PS  And going to the ladies room was dark and dismal and the hallway was filled with things that should have been stored elsewhere.  Disappointed!!!
