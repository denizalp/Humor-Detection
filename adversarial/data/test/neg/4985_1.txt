We bought our dining room table and chairs in 2014.  On Halloween my brother, who had just had back surgery, sat on a dining room chair and the leg snapped in half and he fell.  There is an obvious flaw in the wood running down the leg and the bolt went through the defect to hold chair together.  After a long time waiting to talk to warranty company we were told to take multiple photos and either a tech would come to repair and if not repairable  they would replace, however, it would take 6-8 weeks for us to have a chair.  Right in time for the holidays, no chair.   Today we received a phone call from the warranty company stating in the fine print of the warranty Living Spaces sold us is stated if Living Spaces no longer uses the warranty company they sold us they do not repair or replace.  Apparently, they no longer offer this warranty. What they are willing to do is cut us a check for $28.00, as they did determine it was defective wood that caused the  break. They suggested we return to the store, which we will be doing,  but I am not very hopeful it will be resolved.  I have several friends lately that have had very bad experiences returning faulty furniture.  I will write a follow up after the experience.
