Nate's serves authentic Lebanese food. I was introduced to this place when I worked on Franklin about 12 years ago. I since left the area, but returned twice over the last 10 years. The baba ghanoush is exceptional...very flavorful and made with care. I recommend the Hummus and Shawarma (beef or chicken). You will not be disappointed!
