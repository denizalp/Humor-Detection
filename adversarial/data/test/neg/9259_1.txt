It's ok. The food is alright but I don't like the business model.  Wait in a very long line to order your food, then hope you find a table before it's ready and the server comes to try to find your number.  What if there aren't any tables available, or you're stuck in the sun, with a baby or next to barking dogs on the patio?   Oh well!  They have your money and why should they care if you eat it or not?  I don't like that kind of pressure and having to rely on jackwagon Joe Public to be conscious of others waiting.  \n\nSure this is the VEGAN spot for all vegans in the valley and if you don't mind the stress of the waiting in line, finding a table and battling for a good seat, then by all means; but it's not for everyone. \n\nFairly expensive for a breakfast spot. Most is a la carte. There is a very messy and sticky beverage station where you get your, flatware, coffee, tea, soda and water.  Wait staff is too far above doing anything other than bringing your food but they will drop and scurry off with a smile.
