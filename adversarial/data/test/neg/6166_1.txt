I hate to say, One Nevada is really awful. If I could give 0 Stars, I would..\n\n\n\n1. The branches are ridiculous you have to write your name down and wait for one of the not so eager bankers to assist you. \n\n2. So hard to find an atm. Have atm's posted on their location map that are no longer there. Took me to 2 dead ends.\n\n3. Lack of customer service. No help after 6 pm and forget the weekends. If something happens friday at 5:45 .. well Your screwed.\n\n4. Fraud department is wack. Wanted to report an incident where I entered information in a spam\/scam website, they said they couldnt help me unless they called me first. Needless to say they didnt call. Couldnt take a note down for my bank or offer me any sort of assitance.\n\n5. Card sometime deactivates for no reason. I just recently got a new card and it was deactivated for an entire weekend... No reason at all.\n\n\nAll in all, save your time and go else where. This is a very small credit union and their resources are scarce.
