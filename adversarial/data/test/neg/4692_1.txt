I brought my 69' Camaro in with chip in the corner of the windshield, which i'm told can be pretty tricky to repair and being an older car I really wanted to avoid a replacement. Dan down at the shop not only got the repair done without incident, but took exceptionally good care of my car while doing so!! He's obviously not someone who just punches a time clock, but takes pride in his work, which is far too often lacking today. Thanks Dan!
