Have known about this place for many years, tonight was the first visit. Had the prime rib 16oz. It was temp as ordered and so tender and flavorful. My chosen accompaniments were salad and saut√©ed mixed veggies.  Watch out for the basket of cheesy toast, you can eat your weight it in. Sad I waited this long to visit. Will definitely return.
