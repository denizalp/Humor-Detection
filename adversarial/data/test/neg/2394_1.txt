Combo plate is the way to go. You ain't from Hawai'i if you don't remember meat jun, bbq chicken, and kalbi. The guy who took my order very welcoming and he offered me some soup while I was waiting for my food. The customer service was amazing and it reminded me of the warm aloha feeling that I get back home. I will definitely be back. For those of you who are curious this location is in the Korea town plaza food court. They also have another location on sahara
