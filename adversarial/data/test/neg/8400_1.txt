Sooooo.... I wrote another review for a Denny's in Payson (that was not shining) but it reminded me how awesome this one is.\n\nWe (my family and I) have been to this location probably 2 dozen times. There have been a couple of issues here and there but its always very clean, the help is always great and the food is always good.\n\nVery consistent.
