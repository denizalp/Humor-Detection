Very pleased with the service. Friendly, attentive, and fast. I had vegetable egg rolls and Pad Thai. Pad Thai was exquisite. Not too oily or too dry, just perfect. Just the right amount of food on the plate, the tofu was baked to perfection and made the flavor stand out. The egg rolls were crispy but not over fried and not oily either.  Definitely coming back and recommending it to friends.
