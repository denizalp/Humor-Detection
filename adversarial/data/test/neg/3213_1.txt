Their dessert crepes are pretty decent but their service is WORST TO NONE!!!!!  My wife called them at 9:50 pm to check and see when they are close and if there are any seats available, the person said they close at 11 and come on by.  Got there in 15 mins and then they told us \"sorry, we r close at 11 (which is 50 mins away), you can order from the takeout menu if u like\".\n\nEnough said.
