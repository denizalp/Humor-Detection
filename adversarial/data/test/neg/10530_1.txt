I wish that I could give negative stars for this place. I have been to this place a few times, and literally every time, there is a problem.\n\n1st time I went through the drive through for an iced coffee, and the gave me the wrong size, and it was hot. I went inside to get it fixed, and they forgot about me. I waited 20 minutes and they tried to charge me again. I told them thag I was just getting it fixed and she rolled her eyes and gor the manager...really?\n\n2nd time I went theough the drive through again. It was really slow. I finally got my food and when I got to school, I realized they gave me someone else's food.\n\n3rd time was today. I asked for a jr cheesburger no onions and no bun. They gave me my burger without cheese and with onions. I took it back and asked for them to fix it. They were annoued, took my food, took off the onions, and threw some cheese on it. They didn't  apologize or anything. The cheese wasn't even melted, and I hate the taste of onions. They seriously make me sick. I asked them if they could remake it with the cheese melted, and they got mad. I didn't think that I was asking for a lot here. I was nice about it. I didn't yell, or get angry, or ask for a manager. They have no idea what customer service is whatsoever. \n\nThere is a McDonald's and Burger King across the street!  Stay away from this place and go there!
