I've been here twice while traveling for work. Had a burger that wasn't too tasty the first time I was here, and completely disappointed by the wings on the second visit. I don't need a third strike to know I won't be back if I'm ever in town again. The service was decent and the prices are ok, but if you like food, look elsewhere.
