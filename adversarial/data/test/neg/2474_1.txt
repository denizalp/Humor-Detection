Like all the other Yelpers- I took my car here for the convenience and because they were listed as approved by my insurance...I will never take my car anywhere else now for body work!\n\nThey are a very honest shop and they do quality work!  I even took my car there for some \"cosmetic upkeep\" not through insurance.  Paul went through and found the cheapest solution possible for me, knowing I was self pay. \n\nThanks to all there!
