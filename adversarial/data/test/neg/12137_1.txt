The food is good and the restaurant is very clean.  The only reason this place didn't get 5 stars is because the staff and manager.  The manager yelled at the staff person who was across the restaurant applying the sauce about not putting it all the way to the edges.  They aren't very friendly to each other and it made it an odd dinning experience.
