I had read the previous reviews and all I can say is they must have gone through some major changes. The room was nice for the price, less than 100 after taxes and the room had a fridge and microwave. Staff was super friendly especially Tina. They have a shuttle,  which was a bonus. Beds were good, linens were crisp and fresh.  They also have a nice clean pool and spa and laundry facilities.  There was even an attached sports bar type lounge. all in all I would definitely stay there again.
