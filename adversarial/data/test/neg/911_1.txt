We had dinner here before the Cavs game last night. Although I'd emailed on their webpage for reservations, it was never answered. The manager was immediately apologetic and had a table for 6 right away.\n\nFood wasn't anything inventive, but it was solid and quite tasty for all of us. There were 3 Game Day burgers, a fried walleye sandwich, a BLT wrap, and a chicken caesar salad. Portions were quite large, and their fresh-cut fries are peppery and very good.\n\nService was very good without being at all overbearing or cutesy, and they are directly across the street from The Q -- great location.
