This is one of the best barbershops I've ever been to. Lee understood exactly how I wanted my hair cut from just a picture and a very crude explanation. The shop is clean, modern, and easy to get to. In fact, Lee designed and built it himself! Same with the website: http:\/\/www.hansenco.net\/\n\nThere is also plenty of parking in the lot behind the shop. The $20 (haircut with complimentary neck shave) is money well spent for the quality service. I can't imagine going anywhere else in Urbana-Champaign.\n\nOne catch - Lee is the only barber for the moment, so there are no walk-ins. Schedule a time online quick because you may have to wait a few days. But it's worth the wait.
