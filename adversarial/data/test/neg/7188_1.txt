First of all I would like to say the guys who came to pack our stuff up were great and worked all night. The guys who delivered our stuff were great too. \n\nWe also moved around Christmas and we moved to western Montana in winter. \n\nThat being said be warned....know how much cubic feet of stuff you have. That is crucial. \n\nWe originally received an estimate for 1300 cubic feet. We had basically two apartments to move. A few months later,we called them to set up a date for pick up and they could not find the estimate. They had no record of it and the guy we originally spoke to was no longer employed there. \nSo I stayed on the phone while at work with a gal who had only been working for them for 2 weeks. An hour later we came to basically the same cubic feet. They quoted $4900. The day arrives and their guys arrive at 6pm on a Sunday. It turns out we had a lot more than 1300 cubic feet. More like 3200 cubic feet. Oh and packing up stuff was not included in new estimate. \n\nSo our $4900 quote was more like $13,000! And if I sent them away I would lose my deposit. With the possibility of escrow closing in less than a week we were stuck. So we used them. \n\nWe had to use their boxes at $6.00  a piece and had to pack our own kitchen stuff. We had multiple pieces of furniture with glass in it and were charged extra for those pieces because the gal didn't included them in the \"quote\". \n\nWe had more stuff than would fit in the truck so they would have to send another truck to get the rest. I hounded them on when that day would be. They showed up after we had hit the road so our awesome real estate agent met them there to get the rest almost a week later. \n\nWe were told we could call a week in advance and change the delivery date. I called on 8 days ahead of time and changed the date. 3 days later I get a call saying oh well your stuff is already on the truck and they will be there by the weekend. \n\nWe got everything unloaded and the fun began. We had lots of totes. Many of them crushed. Gouges in a few pieces of furniture. Boxes crushed even if they said fragile. I have never seen anything like it. \n\nIt was a comedy of errors. I have never had to use a moving company before. I hope I won't have to again. \n\nWould I use them again. No. I knew the reviews were bad but I was hoping to give them the benefit of the doubt. I don't know if all companies are like this. \n\nWhen they pick up your stuff they take it to their warehouse and unload it. Then they reload it on to another truck to send it to you. Maybe it would be different if it stayed on the truck and went straight to you.
