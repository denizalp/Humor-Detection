What an amazing little spot and place to eat. The food was extremely fresh, the service was fast and the food tasted excellent! The Greek fries are amazing and to die for-simply delicious! You have to get the Gyro egg rolls, they are out of this world!! \nThe staff was so pleasant to even offered us a military discount on our order. That was extremely nice and we are very grateful- thank you for supporting our military!
