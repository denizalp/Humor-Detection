Fun time! Took my 6 yr old here for indoor mini golf the other day to escape the humidity. Only 9 holes but it was perfect for my lil man and myself as well!  It was crowded but that didn't bother us too much. Gave us time to really enjoy ourselves at the slower pace due to several groups ahead of us
