Big portions and reasonably priced compared to other restaurants on the strip. Had 2 appetizers and 3 drinks for $75, and the portions were big enough even at lunch to fill us both up. True interior Mexican food and great service! The huitlacoche (corn truffle) taquitos were phenomenal and so was the ceviche.
