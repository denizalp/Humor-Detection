3.5 stars\n\nThe staff was very friendly and seemed pretty fast.\n\nOrdered the Buffalo wings which were small but pretty good (and pretty close to a meaty texture). I ordered the mooshu po boy which was kind of disappointing and definitely not worth the price. I've been to plenty of vegetarian and vegan restaurants and don't mind paying more money for quality food, but I just felt I've had better.
