Robin took care of our kitties over Christmas and we couldn't be happier with the experience! Our fur babies got the attention they needed in the comfort of their own home. Robin sent us daily updates via text, and even a few pictures, which really helped to make us feel at ease that the cats were doing okay. She also left a detailed \"report card\" to let us know what they were up to each day. We will definitely be calling A Loving Leash again next time we have to go out of town!
