Date night. We decide to stop into Humble Pie, they always have great food. Tonight, we walk in and it's 89 degrees in the restaurant - why?!! Because they have the patio windows open. Why? No one is sitting outside. Not sure why in the dead of summer you'd have the windows open and not crank up the AC to compensate. Not to mention wait staff was sweaty. Bad experience
