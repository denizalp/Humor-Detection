I must give credit to Dr. Cherrington himself for quickly contacting me by email, more than once, re: his front office charging my credit card and not informing me of such.  He seemed sincere, apologized and said he took action to correct my situation by instructing the front office to refund my card right away.  He then emailed me saying it was done, however, the credit never appeared on my statement.  So, this went on for the last 2 months as the Cherrington front office never responded to Capital One's request for a response to my disputed charge (which would have ended everything right there).  I never knew if the credit had been issued or not due to this, hence my updating this review so late.\n\nAccording to Capital One, with no statement credit, the dispute will not be over until the number of days run out without a response.  That said, I have not been billed while waiting...fortunately.  \n\nI raise one star for Dr. C's quick sincere communication\/effort, and one star for Laura's excellence as a hygienist that was never in question.
