I don't know what's up with some of the poor reviews, but this place rocked!  We went for lunch on a whim.  Just happened to drive by and decided \"let's stop here.\"  We haven't found very good Korean food in Chandler\/Mesa since moving from Portland last year, but this was the best by far.  Very generous lunch portions and very friendly owner.  My 6 yr old gobbled up the bulgogi and fish cakes, my kalbi was amazing, and my hubby's spicy pork was delish.  The mandu (sp?) was the best I've had in a long time and was so good with the house soy sauce with jalape√±os in it.   It's a little hidden gem of a place with a mom and pop feel.  We will def be back.
