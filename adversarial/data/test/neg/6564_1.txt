I've been to this location a couple of times and this time I feel the need to leave a feedback. I walked in and finished the whole circle without anyone asking if they could help me. I see multiple SA's standing around doing nothing. Finally, a man named Yuri (while helping another customer) turned over and said. \" Someone will be with you shortly\". I said \" oh thank you, I was just looking around\". He was then finished with his customer and tried to help me. He was very friendly,joyful and obviously love his job. There was a few purses I wanted to try on but I asked for one. He was going above and beyond by suggesting I should try other ones too ( not in a pushy way). He was very fast and came back with a few wonderful choices, he knew my style within 2 minutes of talking to him. At this point, I was feeling guilty that my intention of going in that day was just to try on the purses instead of purchasing. He probably sensed this and told me nicely that I didn't have to make a decision right away. He then asked me (this never happened at any other location with other SA's) \"Can I offer you anything to drink\"? To which I politely declined.People who shop at LV know damn well, they don't ask you this unless you say \"ok I'm ready to pay\". This is something I've noticed over the years of shopping with LV. This awesome man got me spoiled now, I don't know what I'll do if he ever change locations. More SA's should act like him and this place will receive way better reviews. If you shop here, go to Yuri. He'll definitely treat you right with his amazing customer service skills.
