This place makes really great Chinese food.  So good, in fact that we drive from Desert Ridge over to where they are and get take out.\n\nWe ordered the first time and asked for delivery and they agreed.  But none of us knew where the other was -- it took the poor guy 40 minutes to deliver it to us and he just kept apologizing.  Dude - our fault for sure!\n\nTheir Moo Shoo Pork is to die for and their fried rice is fresh and yummy.  When I tell you we order $75 in Chinese take-out, you can imagine how much food that it.  We've had their honey Garlic Chicken, Almond Chicken, Beef Lo Mein (a total fav), both pork and beef fried rice, and the soups.  One thing we had that we weren't nuts about was the orange beef, not bad, just didn't love it.   As for appetizers, we LOVE their crab puffs - and i want some now as I'm typing.  Had the egg roll, and eh, it was just an eggroll.\n\nI would definitely recommend New Asian Kitchen to anyone who likes fresh and tastey Chinese food.  I keep telling them they should open up a location in Desert Ridge - heck, we'd probably keep them in business all by ourselves!
