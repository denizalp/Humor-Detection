Highly recommend this place. I got my nose pierced in Austin at Shaman a number of years ago and was in the market for some new jewelry. I was in luck because HTC sells the same high-quality pieces as Shaman and they were able to easily assess the correct size that I needed. I cannot stress this enough: they are on the pricey side, but their jewelry is worth it. The staff was helpful, professional, and fun. Basically everything you would ever want in a piercing place. It's officially the only place I will go for my piercing needs. :)
