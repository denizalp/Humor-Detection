I read the reviews and decided to check it out. As I walked in I was greeted by the sales guy.  I walked over to the dog food that I had researched  and the sales guy came over and we began to talk about it.  Very knowledgeable it was nice to talk to someone who was not reading the bag I can do that to.  We talked for a good 10minutes and his name is Canton...I will be back the prices were cheaper than the bigger pet stores.  I love the Macaw they have his name is Thor..and the other associates were friendly too.  Ask for Canton...
