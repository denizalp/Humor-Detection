I I'm converting electrical stove to a gas range. For that I called my gas company to give me a estimate for a running gas line.\nTechnician came did not have much customer service qualities. Told me that he well run gas line, no inspection needed and I need to find a electrician to put 120V outlet. He did not sound very professional, will spend more time to get second opinion.
