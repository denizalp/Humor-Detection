I got a pedicure here. First, i sat in the spa chair for an hour before anyone ran my water, mind yu, there was only 3 customers ! A lady started on my feet and stopped to tend to my friends hands and she didn't even wash her own hands! Ew! And when she came back to finish my feet my water was cold! She half scrubbed my feet and I had to remind her to get my cuticles, and then she left again for another 20 min and a young guy came finished my feet, I had gotten white gel on my toes and he did a horrible job, the paint was all over my nail bed and cuticles, it looked like I did my own pedi, my feet were so dry and 3 days later my feet peeled horribly for days.. And then my gel chipped in a week! NEVER AGAIN.! Beware! It should never take 3 hours for a pedicure in a place that had a total of 3 customers with full staff!
