I love that it has old school ambiance.  You think that all the old vegas gangsters dined here.  The food tastes homemade like from Brazil.  The yucca potatoes are delicious and the meats are savory.  The black bean soup is very tasty also.  The waitstaff is nice too.  The raspberry capriohana is the best fruity mixed drink ever!!!!  Its top quality and is worth the $10.00.
