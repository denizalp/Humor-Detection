Ox tail rice and peas $13. The meat was soft and tender. Flavours were great. Portion of meat was decent at best and the overal size of the meal was pretty average. The meal comes with a small side salad. \n\nOne thing which I really didn't like was that there were black pepper balls (I believe) in the sauce which was spread all over the rice. So almost every bite of rice I would get a black pepper ball which really are not eatable. \n\nOverall the meal was good though and the service was fast.
