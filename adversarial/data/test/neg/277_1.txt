This place reminds me of the classic New York diner from back home. A huge menu with any food you can imagine. Breakfast for dinner? Italian? American bar\/grill? Greek? They have it all. I had the \"Big Fat Greek Omelete\" and I thought it was absolutely terrific. Good service, nice, comfortable decor- this would be my go to place in Pitt. Good find!
