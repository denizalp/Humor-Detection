This was my first time eating shabu shabu in the US and I can say that I was not entirely disappointed. I know it's not going to be as good as the real deal that I've had plenty times in Japan but it's pretty close. I give this place a thumbs up for authenticity. We ordered a king size of the basic shabu shabu and everything tasted very good. The only thing I didn't like was that the pieces of meat were stuck together and it was very hard to pull the pieces apart from each other to put into the broth. A very small location so it's a good idea to have a reservation. Overall, it was a good experience and I would come again
