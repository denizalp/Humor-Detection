Buy a drink and get a free breakfast?! \n\nI'M IN!! \n\nMy friend mentioned Jimbo's over drinks one night. She mentioned there was a bar that offered free breakfast with the purchase of a drink. ANY kind of drink. Soda, Coffee, shots of Whisky, Champagne...WHATEVER!!\n\nJimbo's is a bar with several dart boards, a juke, M&M machines, dollar change machine and other odds and ends. Waitress arrives at your table in minutes and asks 2 questions. \"What would you like to drink and how would you like your eggs cooked?\" I always order Champagne with a shot of Jager and sunny side up. Breakfast always arrives within minutes of placing your order and the drinks seconds before that! It comes with: Sausage, Bacon, 2 eggs, a huge serving of hash browns and toast.The breakfast is along the lines of a greasy spoon diner. Don't expect anything fancy.\n\nService is always good. Kids are allowed during breakfast hours of 8am-12pm. It turns back into a bar as soon as breakfast is over. Plenty of parking out front. Condom machine in the women's restroom. It get's pretty packed, so there might be a little wait if you plan on going with a big party.
