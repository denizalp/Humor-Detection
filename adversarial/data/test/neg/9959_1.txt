Stay away! Stay far away! The owner, Scott, came to my home on 11\/3\/14 and provided a quote to repair two leather couches that had scratches, cracks, and discoloration. He promised that he could make the couches look like new and that his repair would permanently resolve the issue. He told me that if there were any problems that he would take care of them. Shortly thereafter, I hired Scott to repair the couches. He came to my home on 11\/18\/14 and performed the work by painting the damaged areas with dye. When he was finished, the couches looked like new. Within a week, the original scratches started becoming noticeable as the dye either faded or was absorbed into the leather. Scott returned to my home on 1\/14\/15 and repainted the damage promising that the issues had been resolved. The problems persisted and Scott came to my home on 3\/20\/15. He took the cushions from one couch to his shop to sand down and refinish. He returned those cushions on 3\/24\/15 and took the cushions from the other couch which he returned on 3\/27\/15. The problems persisted. I contacted him on several occasions to make additional repairs, but he stopped communicating when I requested a refund.\n\nUnfortunately, due to the lack of responsiveness, I am currently suing this company is small claims court. \n\nYou should be aware that when Scott came to my house to work on the couches, he smelled like a chimney. It was totally unprofessional. The smell was so bad that I told him that I was opening our sliding glass door due to the paint smell, but mostly it was because of the disgusting cigarette smell.\n\nFinally, check the 5* reviews that this company has. Laura N. is\/was the company's office manager. The review from Alicia S. that was removed from the site for violating the policy is from his co-owner (check AZ Corporation Commission). There's another review from Alicia R. which may or may not be from that same person.\n\nPlease look at my AFTER restoration pictures below to see the quality of work this company provides.  Please do yourself a favor and find another company to take care of your leather repair needs.
