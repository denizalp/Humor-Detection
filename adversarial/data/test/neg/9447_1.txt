We finally got to the Salt Cellar!  \n\nWe have lived in the area for a little over a year and have heard great things about it, but hadn't been there.  It is as good as we have heard.  \n\nYou would not realize that you have arrived, except for the smallish sign on the property.  The restaurant is actually below ground.  You walk down a flight of steps to get to the restaurant.\n\nThe selection of seafood, for both appetizers and entrees, is extensive as is the wine list.  The preparation and presentation are exceptional. The service by Scott is very good.\n\nMy wife had a halibut dinner with lemon and caper sauce.  I had a seared Ahi with some sipices.  Both were excellent.\n\nTo find seafood and service this good will bring us back.
