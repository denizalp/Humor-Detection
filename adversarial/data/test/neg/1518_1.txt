I'm what is commonly called a \"senior citizen\" and a guy and have never in my life had a pedicure until about 6 months ago. My back is really bad and I have a hard time bending over to trim my toenails and I have the most gnarly nails ever.\n\nI was at the post office across from UNLV one day and saw this place in the same strip mall, so I took a deep breath and went in. Keep in mind, I have nothing to compare it to.\n\nI didn't know what to expect at all but was nicely surprised at how pedicures are done, with the foot bath, etc. I like the time they took and the foot massage was really nice.\nI went back today for the fourth time in about 6 months and it was a nice experience again. Granted, the ladies who do the work (different one each time) speak very little English but they seem to know what they are doing. \n\nI will agree with another review that the floor is a little grungy--needs a good machine scrub but that's a minor point. I've never had to wait and am usually out within 30 minutes or less.
