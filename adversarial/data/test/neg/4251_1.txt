Great prices, especially for lunch, large portions, wonderful food. I was driving over 20 minutes for take out Thai before this place opened, now only about 7 minutes. Quick service, we ordered in store and waited less than 10 minutes, will call in next time just to be more efficient since there isn't a lot of seating space. I got the yellow curry and crispy spring rolls, both amazing. Boyfriend got the spicy noodles and enjoyed it.  We both had plenty to eat and enough for lunch the next day too. Will be back.
