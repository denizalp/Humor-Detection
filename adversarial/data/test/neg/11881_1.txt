I thought I had reviewed this place before since my friend owns it, but I guess I haven't. I'll admit that I'm a meatetarian, so this place isn't for me - but WAIT! It is for me... this place aims to make vegan food that tastes more like what \"normal\" people are used to since most \"normal\" people can't stomach most vegan cuisine.\n\nI'm one of these people that can't stomach it. I prefer my meat and cheese and gluten and whatever else vegans cringe at. Not everyone is cut out to be a vegan. Some vegans I know of are kinda fat - they get this way because with the restrictive diet, they end up loading up on carbs eating nothing but chips and bread and candy and bean burritos and pasta. I'm not going to argue on how healthy or unhealthy this lifestyle is, but I'll say that the food at Green isn't diet food. It's rich and flavorful and a good. It's a perfect place to go if you're a couple and only one of you is vegan.\n\nI dated a vegan once... I'm used to normally being the picky eater, but holy shit. We couldn't eat anywhere due to her \"diet\" restrictions and it was terribly annoying. Eventually, I got her eating burgers and steaks and real food again. Before that, of the few restaurants we were allowed to eat at - this was one of my favorites. \n\nThe menu is creative and there's something for everyone (unless you're allergic to veggies and tofu). I dare say my friend is a culinary genius and I suggest you all check out That's a Wrap (his other restaurant) as well.
