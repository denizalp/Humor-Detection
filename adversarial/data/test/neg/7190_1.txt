I will say that I was not really expecting much from this place, but my girlfriend wanted to go to a close Italian place, so I picked this one.  Much better than expected.\n\nDecor was average for a mid-priced Italian restaurant.  Service was OK, though not great.\n\nBut they made up for it with the food.  I had never had a calzone (many strombolis, but no calzones).  Got one with artichoke, and it was perfect.  Puffy, with just the perfect amount of ricotta, mozz and artichokes, with a side of marinara that, while not mindblowing, was very good.   GIrlfriend enjoyed the Fett Alfredo she got.  The price of hers was typical for this sort of place (overpriced in my mind, but still typical).  Mine was super cheap, especially for dinner.   If I remember correctly, they only had bottled beer.  Vegetarian friendly.\n\nNot bad at all  :)
