My family and I had some free time on a Monday night, heard about happy hour here, and it was well worth the visit! We ended up at the beer pong tables outside, it was winter season and Jane always made sure to check up on us, and even turned on the heaters outside to make sure we were comfortable. Amazing food, and amazing service  we'll be back forsure
