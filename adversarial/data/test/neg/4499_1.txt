It's a highly entertaining way to satisfy a sweet tooth. The shop is a giant warehouse, but what it lacks in decor, it makes up for with a huge selection of candies. If you need a specific color of candy for an event, this is your place. \n\nWe really enjoyed the wide variety of sodas that are available, and you can mix and match sodas for a custom 4-pack sampler. \n\nThe prices are high, but there are lots of items you won't easily find in other places. So many throwback candies from every generation: candy cigarettes, Necco wafers, Fruit Stripe Gum, Big League Chew, Allsorts, and more. \n\nWe had a great time here and would highly recommend a visit if you are nearby!
