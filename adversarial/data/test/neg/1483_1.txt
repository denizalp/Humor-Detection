I've been meaning to Yelp for a looong time now, and after having brunch at Scramble today, I thought it only fitting that I give them my Yelp virginity.\n\nMy boyfriend and I arrived around 1pm and it was pretty quiet. There was a young lady at the counter, taking orders, and another stocking juices nearby. Both were very friendly. \n\nI requested a vegan menu (the vegan options didn't seem to be listed on the large menu near the door), which was quickly furnished to me. There were 2 tofu scrambles, a soy chorizo breakfast burrito and french toast as possible choices. I couldn't decide between the veggie scramble or the french toast, so... I ordered both! My boyfriend went with the bacon and mushroom omelet (off the regular menu). We were offered bread options of white, wheat, rye, or an english muffin. The side dishes were fruit or sweet potato hash... and I think a lot of the menu items come with rosemary potatoes, but we both opted for the hash. The cashier gave us our number. It was a beautiful day, so we found a table outside.\n\nIn a matter of very few minutes, our food had arrived. I noticed that the vegan items were on red plates to differentiate them. My scramble was yummy, with a good enough amount of veggies in it, and a bit more wet than most other scrambles I've had. I did find myself wishing the portion was a bit larger. \n\nThe order of french toast came with 3 good-sized pieces and was super duper good.\n\nThe highlight for me, was the amazing sweet potato hash! It's served in a patty and is chock full of onions, zucchini, carrots (I think) and seasoned with rosemary. I've never had anything like it. I highly recommend it.\n\nMy boyfriend did seem to enjoy his omelet and definitely agreed with me on the hash.\n\nScramble is a great place, especially considering their vegan breakfast options, which are far too few-and-far-between in the valley. We will absolutely be back!
