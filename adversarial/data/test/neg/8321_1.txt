Their ice-cream is one of the best ones I've ever tried.\n\nThe chocolate and sweets are amazing, too - I love their dark chocolate almond clusters with dried cherries (or cranberries?..)\n\nBut I'd caution against ordering a coffee or anything from their menu like waffles unless you are in no hurry. It takes them at least 5 minutes to make 1 cup of coffee. The slowest latte services I have ever encountered.\n\nVERY festive-looking for each holidays. Green chocolates, anyone? :)\n\nLove this place.
