It is one of Chef Antonio's restaurants in Westmount, and unlike Lavanderia which is just next door, Cafe Bazin is offering lighter meals and have a café vibes. It's a really chic cafe and everything they offer looks so delicate. The cuisine is French style but the menu is quite unique and innovative. We tried their lemon pistachio étagé and tout choco, both were excellent, giving me a feeling that I am back to France again. Then we took Paris-Brest au foie gras (normally Paris-Brest is supposed to be sweet) and Boeuf Bourguignon with homemade pasta, which is very typically French, I love both dishes, but not the vegetable soup that my friend ordered, which tasted like Campbell mushroom cream.  I would say that the price is also quite high for a cafe lunch, but the quality is definitely guaranteed!
