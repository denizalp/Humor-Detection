Excellent. Kind and knowledgeable staff, clear and concise menu with special care to keep it simple. The pizza was as phenomenal as was the pasta. 4 stars only because the seating was uncomfortable after 30 mins, minor gripe but this restaurant deserves a good investment in furniture. Fabulous restaurant for sure.
