I love this place! \n\nI went here the other night with my friend\/business associate and we brought our laptops to get some work done. \n\nWe set up shop on a very large plush leather couch. There were plenty of outlets available for electronics and the wifi is free and fast! \n\nI had the Nutella iced latte with almond milk and WOW was it good!! My friend had the BerryBerry Ade and that was delicious too. \n\nThe staff was helpful and friendly. They serve you your drinks on a cute little tray. \n\nI love this place and can't wait to go back again!
