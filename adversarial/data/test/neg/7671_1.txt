I do not have enough great things to say about this practice! I have been a patient for years and Dr. Deka just delivered my first son a few weeks ago! Each and every office visit the front office staff greeted me by name and asked how I was doing, all of my questions were answered by Dr. Deka at each visit and she prepared my husband and I for delivery ! She has AMAZING bed side manner and is so encouraging about everything. During the delivery she was so positive and explained exactly what was going on.  I felt 110 percent comfortable with her and I so appreciated her helping to make my first pregnancy so awesome! I definitely recommend this practice and Dr. Deka! She is amazing and AWESOME at her job!
