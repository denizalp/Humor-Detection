If you go here be ready for long wait times and pointless appointments . They only care about a copay here. Every time i wait 10-15 minutes in the lobby even if i am on time and then anywhere from 20-45 minutes in the exam room waiting for a doctor. Warner family practice is the most disorganized practice i have ever been to . I have had 3 panic attacks set off just by trying to deal with their practice. They have lost and mixed up many of my records (i have been there for years and they dont have a record of me ever going in for a physical which i have done every single year). they have also called and given me test results to tests i haven't even taken . I was also prescribed birth control and the next office visit was asked who prescribed it to me by the person who prescribed it . I'm always having to do acrobatics in order to get a prescription refilled as well as receiving threats to stop prescribing my medication unless i take a test that i know for a fact is unnecessary and not mandatory(this test will get the practice more money so im sure thats why they are pushing so hard for it) . In one instance with doctor crandall, i was exactly 2 minutes late to an 1130 or 1145 appointment and she told me to be on time next time because i was cutting into her lunch hour . My final straw was the last time i made an appointment they decided to split it into two appointments without my knowledge and then not warn me or give me a courtesy call about the second which resulted in a 45 dollar fee .This practice does not care about my health whatsoever.
