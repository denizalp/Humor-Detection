5 stars for sure. Love this place. A red neck setting in side and some of the best beer you will ever have. I am not much for lager but I drink it here. And their smoke food is the best around for sure. When we came here the first time we ordered their Abby cakes and were so mind blowing they could've been the meal them selves. A mixture of pulled pork, bell peppers, and other stuff lol and fried. Make sure you get these as your appetizer. You won't regret it, I promise!
