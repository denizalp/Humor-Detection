Horrible first impression! Pick-up Time was TWO hours?!? Doesn't your store understand what your company markets?!? So I pay for uber to pick me up and the store has ONE guy? Seriously? Had a reservation for 8.  Didn't leave till 9:30 with a car. \nI've never used this store and won't again.\nI should clarify the young man who helped me was trying his best. He was left in the store alone! Then when another male employee arrived he did an awful job at diffusing a situation with an angry customer. This customer was steaming about waiting too long for a pick up. Your other responded with \"I'm not going to explain myself\"?!? Really? Well that wasn't effective.
