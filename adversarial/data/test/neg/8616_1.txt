Walked into the store on 2\/28\/18 at 5:15. Three sales associates walked by us as we browsed the store making no eye contact or greetings. \n\nThere was only one customer in the store and and they were relaxing on the sofa with a sales associate giggling and laughing as we walked by. Still no eye contact, greeting or acknowledgement of any kind. \n\nAs, we browsed around the store we noticed 4 items that caught our eye in which we wanted to purchase. Still, no eye contact, acknowledgement and now no assistance. \n\nSo, after 15-20 Minutes we walked out and decided to take our business elsewhere. We should've worn our suits. (Lol) \nWord to the wise, never judge a book by its cover. \n\nYou'll never have a second chance to earn my business. \n\nMinus 5 Stars
