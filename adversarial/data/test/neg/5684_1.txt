Amazing! We ate here on our first night in Pittsburgh - by the end of the day we decided to move across the country. Everyday Noodles helped seal the deal. \n\nWe had the dan dan noodles and the cold sesame noodles - both managed to be comfort food but not boring in the slightest. The potstickers are a must try - made in house and delivered as one large sheet to be divided up.  My boyfriend hates onions and even he enjoyed them despite scallions in the filling. \n\nWill definitely be eating here regularly.
