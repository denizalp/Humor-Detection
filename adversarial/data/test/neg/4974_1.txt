Not your average sandwich! I have been coming to this place since before they moved to Central and Camelback and I love it so so much! Sandwiches are these warm, toasty, flavorful rounds of goodness! They have the best potato salad in the world, the chickpea salad is to die for and I have yet to try a sandwich I don't love. The owner is also super sweet she comes around the tables to make sure everyone is doing okay. \n\nZooks is a must try!
