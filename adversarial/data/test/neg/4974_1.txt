I ventured to Money Mart on a Friday night after encountering troubles at the Money Direct store across the street when trying to pick up a Western Union money transfer.  The folks at Money Mart were able to get me my money in less than 10 minutes, unlike Money Direct, whose agent literally disappeared from my presence after repeatedly asking her to return.  After an hour of waiting, I had enough and made a mad dash across the street to this location.  Good thing I did or else I would have probably spent the entire weekend stuck at that other store.   Service was quick, agent was very cheerful, and I would definitely come here again should the need arise.
