First time leave a review on yelp just because the food was unbelievable terrible. Totally ruined our honeymoon date night!!! They run out of two dishes we wanted to order, then we were served cold truffle fries. Cod has no flavor and straight from the cane, pasta taste worse than what they serve at Pizzahut. Come here only if you want to pay $150 Canadian for terrible food.
