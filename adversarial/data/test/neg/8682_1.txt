The Hickory Tavern is a solid local chain to go to for some good pub food. I have hosted many work events here and tried a lot of the menu items. I will highlight a few of the ones that I can speak to.\n\nChicken Quesadilla 5\/5- Comes with a jalapenos, sour cream, etc. to add into the quesadilla if you want!\n\nCharred Plain Jane wings 5\/5- AMAZING. They are such a hit with anyone I've ever gone here with\n\nLobster Roll- 5\/5 My Go-to item... I swear its the best one in town. You wouldn't expect it either. The bread is tasty and the price can't be beat\n\nCrab dip- 3\/5 Average\n\nSliders- 3\/5\n\nTavern Potato Chips- 5\/5 the sauce is addicting!\n\nChips and Queso- 3\/5\n\nBlack and Blue Burger- 5\/5\n\nThe service has been solid at all of the locations I have gone to. Most of the time, it has been excellent!
