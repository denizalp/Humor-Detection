Went in for dinner and it was delish and service was great.  Beers were cold too!\nOrdered honey BBQ and medium wings for an app.  Wings are very meaty, flavorful and taste fresh.\nDinner was a 14\" pepperoni and sausage pizza.  Cooked perfect and hot out of the oven.  Our server was Tammy and she was great.  \nCan't wait to go back!
