Purchased all three packages from \"Randy\". While chicken seemed ok, the beef was terrible, we even had gristle in the filets! Messages left at all three numbers provided for the company have went unanswered and a request for service on their website also has went unanswered. Filed a complaint with the BBB. Poor quality and non-existent customer service. Don't walk away, RUN!
