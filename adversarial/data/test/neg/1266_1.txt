My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this gem. Lou the owner is hands on, knowledgeable and has created something truly special. The cozy atmosphere and high quality food is evidence that Lou never overlooks any detail. Everything is hand made and fresh. Lou himself does it all from cooking, to cleaning andenjoying conversations with guests. This is a placed not to be missed!
