I really wanted to like this place. The location was good,  decor was quaint and service was prompt and friendly.  They also use true cnd shellac, which I love. Now, I am a regular to shellac manis and get cnd quite often at various salons and they have always stayed on chip free for at least 2 weeks, and the longest has been 5 weeks. Unfortunately, to my disappointment, my shellac mani chipped the next day. Not a small chip either, the top half of the shellac polish ripped off. The technique and application was poor, the tips of the nails were not capped, there were bubbles on the polish,  and dust particles on the nails. The nails were not even filed evenly.   Will not be returning or recommending.
