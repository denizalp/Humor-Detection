I love love love this place! My favorite thing there is the hummus and the chicken kebab dinner with a side salad  (which comes with lettus tomatoe cucumber & onions) with italian dreassing.The owners are wonderful people and the place is so calm and a good place to take a date without braking the bank. I could eat this everyday but unfourtunately I can't afford to :(    So if you ever go check this place out tell them shortie sent you :)
