I'm happy to say that after 2.5 years, and a change of ownership\/management, my family and I have returned to Hogtown Vegan.\n\nThe new owners are much (much!) more considerate, thoughtful, and responsive than the previous owners. The new location is cleaner, bigger, and much more efficiently organized. The menu is stronger than it was a few years ago, and the kitchen is much more consistent. Service has been great, too.\n\nWe're glad to have Hogtown back in the rotation. If you had a bad experience in the past, we suggest that you give it another shot under the new management.
