Gelato trip right before seeing Le Reve.\nCashier looked as if she had better things to do. She didn't really engage us but mostly just stood there and stared at us. We got a few samples to narrow down our choices and placed our order.\n\nI had the Carmel crunch in a waffle cone.  Aside of the cashier the gelato was good. Check it out if you're in the area of the Wynn.
