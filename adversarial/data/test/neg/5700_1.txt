A terrific Italian meal.  I'm from Philly where we get great Italian food. Never expected \"South Philly\" in Pittsburgh. Nothing better than home cooked Italian! Family restaurant run by family. Waitresses were incredible. Sat and talked to us like we were regulars. Great experience. Recommend it highly.
