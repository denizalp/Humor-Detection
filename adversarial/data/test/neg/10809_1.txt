There is only one reason to give an otherwise-mediocre convenience store a review. And that reason is Slurpees. Coming from a state that doesn't have 7-11s,, you had to pay for a $10 movie ticket, then shell out about $5, to get Icees- and that was as close as you could get to a Slurpee.\n\nThis convenience store is conveniently located and gets multiple visits from me. On good days, I'll celebrate with a Slurpee. On bad days, I'll seek one out as comfort food. Needless to say, the convenience has made my frequent Slurpee habit border on addiction.\n\nBF gets lucky when I stop here, and I'll often grab him some sunflower seeds, beer, or a treat from the pastry case for something sweet. Downside to this location is that they inconsistently stock some of their foods and it's always hit or miss whether or not they'll have the whole seeds in stock without having to grab some bizarre flavor like dill pickle.\n\nStaff here are friendly in a way that you don't usually see in a convenience store- they'll make conversation and remember you after a few visits, unlike cashiers I'm used to getting who look like they hate their lives and wish they were anywhere but work.
