I initially discovered this place through Postmates, and I'm so happy I did. I've tried a variety of things off the menu, and I have yet to be disappointed by anything (however, my fave is DEF the smothered chicken). After ordering off Postmates a few times, I decided to actually dine in, with the added company of my boyfriend. The service was great, the food was amazing (boyf loved as well), and Armadillo Grill has some pretty happy customers here who are set on returning many many times. :)
