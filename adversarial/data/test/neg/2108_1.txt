This is what I imagine prison food to taste like. We ordered two different chicken plates with various sides. Everything we ordered was watery and tasted like mystery mush. Even the stir fry veggies were bad-- how do you mess that up?\n\nOn the plus side, everything was timely and service was very nice.
