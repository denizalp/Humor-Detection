I orderd the kona precept 120 and they didn't have my size but they called the other store and  it was delivered really fast I belive it was here in about 2 days. it was put together for me and ready for me to ride that day it was delivered, also got a 10% discount on parts and they are giving me my first tuneup for free will defiantly buy all my stuff from them.  Also the kona bike is an awesome bike I'm a beginer at mountain biking and couldn't be happier with the bike that I purchase.
