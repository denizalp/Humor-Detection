Very good food. The setting is a bit loud, and it is a bit expensive, but the food is great and there's a nice selection too. \n\nThe Mac & Cheese was fantastic, as was the chicken. Drinks were good as well, though mine came out a little warmer than I would have expected. \n\nGood service and decent turn around times on food and drinks. I would definitely come back.
