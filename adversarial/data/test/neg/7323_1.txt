I went here on the advice of a friend who saw it on the over rated Guy Fieri show on Food TV. I think that this place is over rated, really over rated. It is a dingy place with dingy food. I had a chile rellano with stir fried rice. It was not worth $8. \n\nThe food was hot. I will give it that. \n\nThe cookie that they call a Snickerdoodle does not even come close to a true Snickerdoodle. My cookie was tasteless and I tossed it in the trash with my aluminum tin and all the Styrofoam drink containers that they use for soft drinks. They should try recycling or start using reusable plastic plates and glasses but then they would have to pay a dishwasher. Maybe they should think about a little  about the environment.
