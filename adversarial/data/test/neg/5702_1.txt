Pure luxury!  I can see why GVR is consistently rated the best local spa and, having just moved to Henderson, I'm so excited that this place is MY local spa!  My husband and I have been here twice and we've only lived in the area a month and a half.  There are many other reviews that describe the spa to a tee, so I'll just say that this place is perfection!  The ambiance and design are so tranquil and relaxing.  Locals receive a 30% discount during the week and 20% on the weekend, and I almost feel like I'm STEALING the treatment.  Even if you're not a local, this place is worth it - I promise.
