Lived in the area for years and years and never knew this place was around.  They only do breakfast and lunch, and now they're closed on Sundays, which is a little odd.  A lot of people (like us) only get a chance to go out to breakfast on the weekends, so I'd think that that would cut into their business, but they seem to be doing fine, so what do I know?  Most days are \"seat yourself,\" so there's always interesting jockeying for position if there's a wait.  Counter seating is fun for kids to watch the goings-on in the open kitchen.  \n\nNever had any lunch items, but breakfast is always consistently good, and the servers are fast with a coffee refill.  As the previous review says, there's only one cook at the grill, so things can get a little slow sometimes.  Just chat with the people you came with or bring a book if you're solo.
