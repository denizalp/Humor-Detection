My daughter and I just tried this place on a groupon.  I do not drink wine but thought it would be a fun thing to do with her.  I was so pleasantly surprised how nice and delicious the fruit and meat board was.  The waiter was so nice and helpful and picked out the wines he thought I would like because my taste is on the sweeter side.  He was right on.  The presentation of the wine was a nice surprise.  We also ordered two bruschetta's that were delicious.  The owner came over a few times to see that we were enjoying everything.  I am told Unwined is under new management and I would say they are doing a great job!  Their food menu looked delicious and I can't wait to come back to try some of their specials.  I would highly recommend this place.
