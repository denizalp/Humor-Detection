Listen, living in Boston, ya crave a good pie -- and believe it or not, there just isn't any! So being able to blast in to Glass Nickel (nice to see it's broadened its horizons beyond that first shop since I left) in the middle of the day and order a fresh pizza is amazeballs. Then, the crust is everything you hope for, and the fresh Mediterranean flavors are, in a word, delicious. Service with a smile and I'm all in. Thanks guys, that was great!!
