Well, I am apparently the minority but I will not be headed back.  I picked up many items and were not thrilled with any of them.  I even had to take one item back for a re-do.  I had other items to take back but the owner and I didn't agree on what was \"even\" so I didn't waste my time arguing.  They were all very friendly and helpful, but the money, I am not impressed.  Their prices are high and they only accept cash.  To most their work is probably fine.  But, if you are like me and am super picky with your alterations, I would keep looking.
