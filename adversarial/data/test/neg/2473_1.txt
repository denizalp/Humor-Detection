The good: Their fries and onion rings were on point, though the rings could have used some seasoning. Nothing a pinch of salt won't solve. \n\nThe bad: The Big Smoke burger was boring. Patty was overcooked and bland, even the horseradish mayo and caramelized onions couldn't resuscitate the burger. That meat was dead I tells ya.\n\nThe Ugly: $14 for an average burger\n\nAlways on the hunt for great burgers, I passed by Big Smoke on Friday on a friend's recommendation. He said this was the best burger in Toronto, well, he's full of smoke!\n\nYou get a relatively thick patty done up on a grill, but the burger came out overcooked. Browned through and through. \n\nI'm the kinda guy who likes their burgers a bit pink inside and I'm a flattop kinda guy, so if browned through over a flame is your thing, then give this a shot. But it's pretty much a more expensive version of Harvey's in my books. \n\nThe Big Smoke Burger came with caramelized onions and horseradish mayo, but the mayo didn't have much horseradish in it, which was disappointing. \n\nThe friends and rings are good, though the rings weren't seasoned.
