This place is just off the charts. We mainly ate ceviche and sashimi, they came with such great creative sauces. Service was outstanding and restaurant manager stopped by couple times to make sure we're doing fine. While I wasn't impressed with tuna (a bit of tuna snob here) I can't take any stars from this review. 5\/5\n\nBtw, drinks are great too. \"Nashi\" was such a perfectly balanced one.
