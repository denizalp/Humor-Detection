I got a beautiful gardenia done by Tyler. It was my first ever tattoo so of course I was nervous, but his friendly personality made me feel right at home! He actually took the time to listen to what I wanted, and shared some of his awesome ideas as well. The tattoo came out EXACTLY how I wanted it to, and I couldn't be happier with my experience. Great staff, great atmosphere! I definitely recommend checking this place out.
