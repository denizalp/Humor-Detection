I stop by here quite often.  The food is great and the family that runs the cafe  are amazing people who care about their community.   Procedes go to feed families in need.  Where else can you go to enjoy tasty eats, for a great price, and helping the community as well.  Also I just booked them to cater an event for me and it's going to be great.
