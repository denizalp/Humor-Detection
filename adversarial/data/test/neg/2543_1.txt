Loved this place! Stopped in with family for an early dinner while taking a break from Vegas. They have a great kids menu with a very good variety. Enough choices to satisfy the kiddos without overwhelming them with too many. They were very happy with the ground steak, chicken fingers and the awesome grilled cheese. The kids loved the variety of fries  offered, being the great french fry connoisseurs that they are. My Mom had wonderful huge bowl of clam chowder that was so creamy and delicious. The Chicken Cordon Bleu was to die for-absolutely magnificent. My NY strip was very yummy, cooked to a perfect medium rare. The restaurant is a very small and quaint. It was very interesting to me that they had a drive thru pickup window. I love that! I'm not a fast food\/chain restaurant food lover so places that have great food that you can pick up and take with you are a huge bonus. One thing I haven't mentioned was the person that made the experience exceptional was the waitress Jacklyn. She was very friendly and attentive. She was great with the kids, didn't even wince when we walked in with four in tow. She was very good talking to them instead of over them. She was a hit with our lemonade lovers when she offered to make them strawberry and cherry infused drinks. Very good waitress. If you are in Boulder City, this is a wonderful place to dine. Can't wait to see how they do breakfast.
