I love them so far.  They offer a gluten free sub made by Udis and it is not bad.  It's a little on the crumbly side but that is what you get with that kind of bread.  They can always toast it.  We get the philly cheesesteak and the Ham and cheese.  Friendly service and fast efficient hands run this joint.
