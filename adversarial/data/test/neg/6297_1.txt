We are a fan of Metro Pizza but not this location. Service was slow and hostess is completely lost. She started be wanting to sit us next to a group of 20 right next to the small kids side of the group. I asked to sit elsewhere as the place was not busy. The next group of 2 she did seat next to the kids, they looked upset. Next pizza was coming out to tables that were after us and the group of 20 even got their food after several groups that came in well after them. We just sat and watched how everyone was working. This location compared to the Tropicana and Henderson location needs some serious help. If you like Metro Pizza as we do stay away from the centennial location, go to the other locations.
