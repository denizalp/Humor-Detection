I absolutely love this place!  One of the only legit healthy smoothie place in the burgh.\n\nI always make a visit after attending a yoga class and any time I'm craving something healthy.  My go to smoothie is the greenana bread smoothie.  It has all natural, healthy ingredients and protein!  All of that blended together tasted like a masterpiece.  I've also had the ifu like pi√±a coladas.  LOVE that smoothie.  The only qualm I have about it is that it doesn't come with protein and when I added it, it made the smoothie gritty and didn't taste as good.  I've had the PB acai smoothie bowl as well.  By far one of the most delicious things on the menu but can be a bit pricey. A small smoothie is around $5 but totally worth it.\n\n\nStaff is always super friendly.  The environment is very trendy and fun but when it is busy, the place is packed because the space itself is on the smaller side.\n\nI will continue to keep coming to Salud !
