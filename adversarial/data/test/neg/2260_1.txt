Located inside the Whole Foods, you can walk up to the window outside or order inside.  They have a selection of burgers or you can make your own.  I had the Mediterranean & hubs had the South of the Border, both very good.  They also have sweet potato or regular fries, both good but the sweet potato fries were my favorite.  You can add toppings to your fries and get pretty creative with your heart attack selections.  (But hey, my purchases from Whole Foods should offset this, right?)\n\nTons of outdoor seating, corn hole & such or you can cozy up inside. Great spot to grab lunch or dinner.  Nice addition to the LKN area.  Enjoy!
