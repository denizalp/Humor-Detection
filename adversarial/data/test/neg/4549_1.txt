So, we have eaten here 5 times since it opened. Every time it has been great. Even working through the normal new restaurant kinks (like training servers) had no impact to us as customers. Today I opted for the lemongrass pork chop with a side egg and side spring roll, which was very good and so filling. My husband had the red curry with beef (also delicious) and we shared a chicken satay banh mi. The banh mi was inhaled before we even thought about pictures... service was great and usual, oh and all that did not cost a small fortune.
