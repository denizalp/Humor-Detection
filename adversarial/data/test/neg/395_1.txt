I really enjoy this breakfast restaurant... That during my one week vacation, I stop here 3 times!!! Order the hog and chick generously portion eggs, hash browns and oh yeah the XXL bacon which is worth the sometimes long wait, but hey there's water outside to cool you down during the Phoenix dry heat... Staff were also very helpful and with a great attitude at all times
