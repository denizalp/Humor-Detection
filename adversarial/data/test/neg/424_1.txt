I don't live there thank God but cousin does it's has been 2 weeks now to fix the patio screen door and under the sink cabinet base is broken ( two weeks to fuck it but not yet have been fixed) the leasing office girl couldn't spell (level ) to place the order for the under the sink cabinet!!!!\nIf there is a zero star I would have used it, I have lived in an appointment complex before and they were very polite and helpful ( the management I mean) so I was telling my cousin leave this complex because they are not fixing any simple things.
