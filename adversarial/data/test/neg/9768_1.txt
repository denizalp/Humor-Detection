I would like to give this hotel a 0 rating.  We booked online and went with the Deluxe room because it looked updated and clean in the photos, however, when we got there, the hotel was a complete dump.  There were stains on the carpets in the hallways and trash lined the walls.  When we got to our room it became apparent that the only difference between the Deluxe room and the Classic room was the comforter on the bed.  There were stains on the blankets, carpet, chairs and towels.  It didn't look like the room had been cleaned at all but rather someone just made the bed.  To make matters worse, there was a loud squeaky noise coming from the bathroom walls that kept me up at night.  Oh and both the sink drain and the shower drain were backed up causing the water to sit in the shower up to my ankles while I was in there.  The ONLY good thing about staying in this hotel other than the cheap price and good location, is that Hash House provides room service to the guests.  Overall, this is THE WORST hotel I've ever stayed at and I would have immediately relocated had it not been for my short stay and busy days that kept me from being in the room for long.
