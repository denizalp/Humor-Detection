Can't got wrong with a late night visit to the Peppermill. It can definitely be a \"theater of the living.\" The food is pretty good and comes quickly. The prices are a little high but not crazy considering the restaurant's location. I got a basic egg and bacon breakfast. The bacon was thin and cheap.  Overall you'll be able to find something to eat and have a good time.
