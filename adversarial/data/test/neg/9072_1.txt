DO NOT GO HERE. I called the week before with my problem --- and they assured me they had the part in stock and that my appointment would take approximately one hour and quoted me a reasonable price. When I came in AT MY APPOINTMENT TIME,  it took an hour for them to tell me that there was no problem (even though my car had failed inspection).  I told them what needed fixed and they did not have the part in stock --- and that it would be a few hours before they could fix it. AND the price was 2-3x more. They were extremely rude when I said that is not what they said on the phone and the guy just shrugged and said \"Well you didn't talk to me.\" Terrible customer service. PASS ON THIS PLACE and go somewhere that will treat you well and follow through.
