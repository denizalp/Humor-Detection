First time trying a raclette and i wasn't so bad. Its a BYOW restaurant which is a good point. We were four people.\nI was the only one who took the grande table d'hôte so i had the beef tartar with two bread croutons that were burned.So i asked for a waiter, not ours, if i could have other croutons and my boyfriend asked for more bread and butter and the waiter was so rude and so sarcastic it wasn't pleasant at all. When he came back with my appetizer he said that these croutons were the last ones in the kitchen.. Something i hardly believe. The other people took the petite table d'hôte and they liked their potage à la courge. I tried it too it was good indeed. Two of us had the Raclette duo and the two other took the émincé de veau and another main dish i can't remember the name but i know that the meat was lamb and that it was grilled. My boyfriend who had the grilled lamb dish asked for it to be medium cooked and it wasn't, it was more like well done. The restaurant itself is noisy but you can still have a conversation, it's dark and cozy just not a place for a romantic dinner, more like a dinner with friends.
