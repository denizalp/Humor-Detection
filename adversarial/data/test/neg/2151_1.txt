This was my second time here and I trusted them with my puppy. I came to go get my puppy while I was on break from work. I paid for it and everything went back to work while my parents took him home. My parents told me that they noticed something on his paw and tried wiping it and it was blood and it kept bleeding. Also second of all we paid extra for a flea and tick treatment and my parents found a tick on him after they told us \"He had no ticks or fleas!\" I paid $70 just to have my puppy come home with a bloody paw and ticks and fleas. I left him in their care and look at the result.
