The croissants are amazing. Like real French croissants. Soft and flakey with perfect buttery layers. The danishes are delicious with homemade jam (the cherry is the best). The cheese horns are good as well.\n\nI haven't tried ordering off the menu because the pastries are so good. It's nice to have a proper bakery with yummy pastries and good coffee.
