Stopped in once again for the mason jar mug of Blue Moon.  Waited about 10 minutes for a table. Not bad for a Saturday night.   Very nice atmosphere. Not loud but not quiet at all.  Seats are widely spaced apart so your not sharing food with your neighbor.  \n\nStarted with the fried mac and cheese balls.  $10 for 4 balls.  They were lightly beer battered and not too greasy.  Came quickly in about 7 minutes after ordering the app and our dinner. Absolutely delicious.  I almost wanted to cancel the dinner and order some more. Recommended. \n\nNext came dinner.  I got the pulled pork sandwich with fries. Good but not over the top.  I was in the mood for good so it worked for me. The waitress asked me if I was ok with the coleslaw.  I was , but glad she asked.   The coleslaw added a crisp bite to the chunky pork lathered in the slightly tangy sauce.  It was a nice medley to compliment the soft chewy bun. \n\nMy girlfriend got the old West cheeseburger and she says 10\/10.   The bun was buttery and soft and the party cooked to perfection. (Well done).  Not my choice of doneness but whatever works is what works.   We finished everything so that must mean we liked it.  \n\n\nOverall. 9\/10.  Beer was cold.  Food was delicious. And the environment was country.  Just what we like.   Baseball and football games all over the place on about 20 televisions.
