We are new to the area & pizza is one of our favorite foods! Not only were we pleased with the taste of the pizza (it's our new favorite) but also the atmosphere & kindness of the staff! They acknowledged we were new, gave us free garlic knots, & thanked us for coming in! It's because of this that we now call Casanova Brothers Pizza our go to place!!
