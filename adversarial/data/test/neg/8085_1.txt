Let say the service was exceptional and the wine list was great BUT the food was terrible. The duck was really gamey and not as described. The French onion soup was room temperature when it came out, we sent it back and after 10 minutes it's was maybe 3 degrees warmer. Needless to say when we left the buzz from the wine was intense because our belly's were empty.
