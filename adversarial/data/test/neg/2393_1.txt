Best margaritas I've ever had! They were not syrupy and fake and they were strong! The prices are higher than your typical \"pick a meal 1-50\" but it's evident they use high quality ingredients.  The chicken was so tender and juicy and smokey from the grill, and the jumbo shrimp were HUGE!  Everything was wonderful, I was trying to be healthy so we skipped the chips and salsa but I'm hoping to come back and try them because everyone around us seemed to be inhaling them and they looked delicious! This is definitely elevated Mexican cuisine and we will put this on our list of places to eat at monthly.  I felt like I could eat a real healthy meal here too which most times I feel like crap after going to for Mexican.
