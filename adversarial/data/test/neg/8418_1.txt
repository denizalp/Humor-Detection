2.5 stars.\nHonestly, it's average. \nI realize we don't live in Champaign and our Chicago based palate may be a bit biased but we LOVE pizza. All types. We were hoping for a lovely experience so even the scary prices didn't fend us off. $14 for a personal size pizza and $3 for a can of Italian soda? Ooof! \nThe flavors were definitely bland. \nOf the four pizzas we ordered only the most standard satisfied- pepperoni! \nI will say their dough is very good, the only problem being it is served so hot on a metal plate so it doesn't have space to breathe and gets soggy so very fast :\/ \nThe steep prices aren't helped by the fact that this place is self serve. You grab your own plates and your own utensils as well as glasses. Cool cafeteria concept, minus the cafeteria prices.\nIf you live there and have few options plus are used to the oddly expensive food, I guess this is great. \nOr you could save your money and come up by Chi for the weekend and have something better :)
