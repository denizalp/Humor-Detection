I wanted to see what the hype was all about. I still can't believe there was a 2 hr line up when it first opened. The store is located at the north west corner of Yonge\/Dundas. So convenient and pretty much just a few steps off the subway (exit westbound, stairs on the right side when u get off Dundas subway).\n\nWhile Muji provides nice simple functional items such as  gadgets, clothes, houseware, etc. but they are ALL OVERPRICED. It has been a few years since I've visited Hong Kong's Muji, I do feel the prices are so much better there. If only the same can be said for Canada. It's a good thing Muji only opened one location thus far or it will be another Target USA. \n\nThe store was very spacious and clean. But a lot of items were sold out. I was mainly there to look for makeup accessories (jars, containers), chopsticks, pens for a friend. There was almost nothing in the stationary section for pens and such. I browsed the clothing section but it was pricy as well. Material was only about average. I wouldn't buy anything here unless there was a sale. \n\nLeft empty handed but that is ok :)
