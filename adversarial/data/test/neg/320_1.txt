We definitely wanted to try In-N-Out during our Vegas trip, so we checked this one out on the way back from Red Rock Canyon. It's pretty much everything a burger joint should be, with friendly, fast service, those silly little paper hats, and ingredients that taste really FRESH. They brag about their lettuce being cut the same day and the buns being fresh, and you really can taste the difference. \n\nI wish I could get myself a Double Double and an order of fries back home!
