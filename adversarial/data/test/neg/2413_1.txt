I have eaten pizza from Sal's twice and both times I thought it was awesome. The first time, I had the Carbonara and it was absolutely amazing. I needed to go back before moving away, so I returned and tried the special, which included short rib, roasted garlic, cherry tomatoes and onion. It was also delicious, although the Carbonara still reigns as my favorite. The first time I did carry-out; this time, we ate at the restaurant, seated outside. Don't let the nondescript storefront (literally there isn't a sign) fool you - this is some awesome pizza.
