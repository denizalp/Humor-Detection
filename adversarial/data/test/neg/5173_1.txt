Just grabbed a hot dog from the cart on my way to class and it was surprisingly good! I've never had one on toast before and they used melted nacho cheese instead of a slice of cheese. I'm definitely going to stop by their cart more often  \n*Pretty messy so you're not gonna look cute eating it, just saying.
