It was mentioned below that this place is not fancy, but that the value is hard to beat.  I went for dinner a few days ago, and the place is cheerful, staff is friendly, the food from the eclectic menu is pretty good.  Value, however is great.  The prices are as though this is the 80's.  \n\nMy only complaint is a lack of Vegetarian options.\n\nThis is a nice neighbourhood spot.
