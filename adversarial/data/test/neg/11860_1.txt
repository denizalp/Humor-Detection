Pros: \n-clean facility, been here a while and it's always clean\n-staff is nice. Understanding and easy going. Helpful when needed.\n-affordable. Any golds gym in the world for only $15 a month and no contract. Annual fee of $40. It's quite affordable from what I've seen around the country. Though admittedly some of the more expensive gyms around here are legitimately better. If you only care about price this is a good place to go. \n\nCons:\n-every day is chest day here. It is ridiculously hard to get a good clean chest day here. You will always be waiting on someone.\n- Gym etiquette is not enforced here. Weights are constantly in the wrong spot. Weight trees will have several different weights on one limb so you have to dig through 45 and 25 lb plates if you want a 10 or a 5 (obviously that's not always the exact scenario, the point is you often have to remove one weight to get to another because people just put them wherever, instead Of together with like weights.) ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS have to remove other people's weights when you get to a machine. It is a combination of the guests being very inconsiderate and lazy and also the staff being a little lazy. \n\nI know it's intimidating for a staff member to approach a guest and ask them to put their weights back when finished but that's what balls are for and it's apparent none of the staff has any. \n\nIf the gym etiquette was fixed here I would call the gym a 4 star gym for cleanliness and kindness of staff but gym etiquette is a huge part of the gym experience and it's severely lacking here. This is old school super basic gym etiquette and it's not being taught or enforced at all. Without some kind of order and regulation people will just do whatever they want and usually the path of least resistance is lazy and inconsiderate of others. There's more to managing a gym than solely focusing on sales and wiping down the equipment. Just being honest.
