Reasonably priced dim sum. Came here on a Saturday around 11 and it wasn't crazy packed. \n\nPersonally I rather pay a bit more to enjoy myself, not feel rushed, and not be waiting an hour to eat. This place was quite pleasant given it didnt get packed until a bit later around noon\n\nFood was tasty and came out fast and furious and hot
