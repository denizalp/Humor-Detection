What a joke. Overpriced bland food. I ordered a 10 oz Strip and it was tough as nails, bison might actually be softer. Now normally in most establishments when you order a main meal it should come with a side or a salad. Well guess what. I was charged $4 for a side and $4 for a salad which tasted like raw seaweed. The mash taters tasted a day old and there was no amount of spice or garlic that made them taste any better. I've been to classier steakhouses and none of them were such a complete waste of money like this one. And don't charge extra for regular sides. If you do so please inform the customer that they are buying the steak and the sides are extra. Service was good though, hence the only star I'm giving this place.
