Went fir early dinner around 430. Took advantage of the $2 taco\/margaritas, cerveza Tuesday special. First off, the complimentary chips are served warm and are excellent! I ordered the baja fish taco and the side ordered the asada taco. Both tasted great but the meat in both of them was lukewarm, and it didn't Ysidro long for our food to arrive. Margaritas were excellent. As far as the length of time to be waited on, it was a little slow, and they were not busy.
