The space is very well designed and looks like a great addition to the neighbourhood, especially when food offerings have bee stagnant in the neighbourhood. I ordered the cheeseburger with fries and a drink. The service was fast and the gentleman that took my order was very nice. \n\nI took the food to go, this I will not comment on the fries since the texture of French fries tend to change for the bad when it's taken to go. \n\nThe cheeseburger was well layered, the potato roll was fantastic and the condiments really complimented each other. The burger was cooked to perfection, and they accommodated my request of cooking it to a medium. I wish the burger was well seasoned, the lack of seasoning on the burger really lacked the punch of the overall experience. I will be back for the chicken sandwich.
