Very nice remodeled and inexpensive hotel. Great service great staff. Won over $600 in 30 mins on $30 playing slots. \nMyra at the commissary bar was amazing and very knowledgeable on the craft beer selection she was engaging and helpful in recommending local places to eat. The pool was a huge hit with my teens. The whole experience was very good overall. But Myra deserves special praise.
