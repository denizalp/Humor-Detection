My fianc√© was experiencing extremely bad abdominal pain.  We just moved to the area and this hospital was the closest to our home.  Late that night, I decided to take him to the ER after a full day of discomfort.  We got there and everyone was very friendly except for one nurse.  She ruined the entire experience.  She was complaining to other employees about a mandatory hospital meeting coming up and that she has to reschedule her dentist appointment.  Every time we asked a question regarding his care, her response was always extremely short and very rude, never made eye contact, rolled her eyes constantly and at one point asked him to step outside the room and proceed to yell at him about asking so many questions and about putting a cath in if he didn't give a urine sample.  He was so upset that he ended up signing an AMA and we sought care elsewhere.  I wish I could remember the nurses name, I just know she was working the night shift in the ER, had brown hair and wore an excessive amount of makeup.
