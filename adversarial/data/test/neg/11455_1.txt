Out of all the places I used to work, Sammy's is probably the one I come back to the most. I can't get enough of their amazing duck tacos and the ingredients in the good are always fresh! They sure know how to pack flavor in the salads. For pizza I would have to go the artisan route though, I like I pie thin and crispy! Definitely worth visiting on your lunch hour or after the gym.
