We ordered a bed & couch from Living Spaces (ordered the same color\/configuration couch of their floor model-literally were sitting on the model and told the sales person, we wanted this exact same couch), spent almost $2,500 at the store, and were told from the get go, it would take 7 days for our items to arrive, as they were ALL coming from their California location.  No problem at all, we completely understood and scheduled our delivery for seven days later, a Sunday from 12pm-6pm.  As promised, the night before our delivery date of 3\/18 we received our confirmation call, narrowing down our delivery window from 3-5pm.  At this point, all was still good, we were happy and excited for our items to arrive....as we were sleeping on a mattress on the ground and had nowhere to sit in our house.\nSo, Sunday at 5:15pm rolls around, no delivery, no update on timing, NO COMMUNICATION WHATSOEVER.  I had to call Living Spaces, after waiting three hours for them to show up, to figure out where our items were.  I had to get to a supervisor to finally find out what was going on, and she informed us that a piece of our bed had not arrived, since it was coming from their California warehouse.... well yes, we were told that everything was coming from California....\nTurns out the couch arrived, and most of the pieces for the bed, but since there was one piece of the bed missing, they were not going to bring anything. Why on earth didn't they call us to inform us of this, no idea.  She finally offered us a gift card for the store after repeatedly asking her to refund a % of our purchase price...but according to her, she couldn't do this.  Clearly they didn't want to lose out on any profit in this process, we are the only ones who had to suffer.  Finally, the supervisor said she could have the couch delivered Monday (the next day), between 6pm-12am but we would still need to wait another week for the bed.  Fine with us, at this point we just wanted whatever items we could have delivered.  I hoped that we had been through enough hassle that they might put as at the beginning of their delivery window for Monday night.  BUT THAT WOULD MAKE TOO MUCH SENSE AND  SHOW MORE CUSTOMER SERVICE THAN THIS COMPANY AS A WHOLE CLEARLY HAS.  \nOur delivery driver arrived at 11:30pm....WITH THE WRONG COUCH!!!!!!  This was now the second time we spent hours waiting on Living Spaces (8 total at this point) and ended up without our purchased items yet again.  The salesperson had ordered the wrong configuration & after almost just settling with the couch he had, our driver encouraged that we paid a lot of money for this couch, so we deserved to get the right item.  He said that he would request the right couch for us, & send a note to customer service to call us at 10am the next morning when the store opened.  \nSo, the next day, 10am rolls around....no call from Living Spaces.  11am rolls around, still no call.  Since they have no sense of urgency in helping their upset clients, I (again) had to call into them to figure out when we were going to get the correct couch we ordered and paid for (over 10 days ago at this point).  I asked for a manager as soon as I called in, but the customer service representative said he tried to page them, but they were all \"in a meeting\" and I would get a call back within 24 hours (seriously?!!).  Fortunately, though, this customer service rep, Ray, actually understands how to help people and took the initiative to solve our problem.  He set up the delivery of the correct couch for us, assured me over the phone it would be the right configuration, and emailed over another confirmation just to give us more piece of mind.  I asked that he still have a manager call me, because at this point, I was so fed up with the entire purchase experience with them, their management team needed to know. \nFast forward to 3:30pm... I get another unhelpful call from manager Laura....who says that because we were already sent a gift card (which we still hadn't received) for the bed issue, all she could do was take $50 off our purchase total.  So according to Living Spaces, 8 hours of both mine and my husband's time spent waiting for this couch to be delivered is only worth $50...\nI asked if Laura had a customer service manager I could speak with, she said she could put in a case to get a call within 24-48 hours.  Not surprisingly, we finally get a call at 5pm on the second day of waiting (clearly no urgency to resolve this issue on their part).  Finally I speak with Gwen who was able to provide us the refund I have been asking for from the get go, on our purchase, since we STILL haven't received the gift card, or the refund promised from Laura.\nWORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EXPERIENCED.   Looking at the past reviews, I highly doubt this review will result in anything from the company itself, so I hope that customers considering shopping here read this and make the right decision NOT to spend their hard-earned money at this store.
