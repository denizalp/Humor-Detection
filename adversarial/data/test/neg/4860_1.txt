I dig it but it's a bit pricey for what you're getting.   I got a good looking fried chicken on an open biscuit,topped with bacon and a white heavy sauce.   \n\nThe biscuits were good but I wouldn't say they were orgasmic or even close.   \n\nGood brunch spot if you're looking for something new.   I'd try it if you're looking for an alternative to hash house a go go
