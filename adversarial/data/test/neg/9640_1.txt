Massage envy started as a a Valentine's Day gift to ourselves.  Now,  we go regularly as much for therapy reasons as for relaxation.  From deep tissue to pure relaxation,  I haven't been disappointed.  We always make our appointments in advance so we always get a time that works for us. Parking can be a challenge,  depending on day and time. I can't think of one negative from any of my visits.  Staff has been accommodating and helpful and therapists have exceeded expectation.
