I recently went to Glo Medspa for a chemical peel and left truly pleased with the service. Megan made me feel extremely comfortable during the treatment; everything there is setup in a way that ensures people feel that way before and during their procedure. She exceeded my expectations after the first visit and will not hesitate going back for further services and\/or recommending her to others.
