I have a herniated discs and had really bad problem with walking and standing. Had the pleasure of working with Sabrina and she is great, very knowledgeable. After a couple of sessions and recommended exercise, I was in walking condition within a couple of weeks. Very professional and accommodating. I would recommend it to everyone. Money well spent.
