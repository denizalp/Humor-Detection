Terrible customer service. Terrible return policy. Bought something for my mothers birthday and turns out she has the exact same thing and they won't even allow you to return it for a full refund even though you have the receipt. My mom lives in California which makes it extremely difficult for her to come back to the store because all they offer is a store credit even with a receipt showing item was purchased within five days.  Nothing like wasting $250
