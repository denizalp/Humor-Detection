Never again. I came here because it's nearby. Their prices seem decent to start off. I gave them a shot. Initially I just wanted a pedicure but they wanted $35 for the deluxe pedicure. Out of curiosity I asked if there was a pedicure manicure special I could get since I wanted to just get a cuticle clean up and buffing I didn't want a color on my hands. I was told the combo is $35.... but the buffing is extra $5. Thinking this is due to having to apply cream and buff to a high shine. NOPE!!! It ended up being quick rushed job. I could have put that toward my pedicure upgrade because there was hardly any shine on my nails no cuticle oil, I left that shop with ashy hands and unevenly shaped nails and scratches on the surface that he made when he first started but didn't buff out completely. They were dull.  I ended up going to sally beauty supply and bought a buffing block to get the shine I wanted. The guy was rushing and took me even though he knew he had an appointment coming in. They charged me in advance and had nerve to ask if I wanted even amount or add tip, so I wasn't even sure that it would be work that was even worth a large tip so I added a modest amount. He didn't ask if I wanted the cash to hold onto til he was done or anything. I guess he assumed it was preemptively justified? They didn't charge a lady who walked in while I was getting my manicure. Is it because she's a regular or some other difference they based it on. Let's get back to my feet. They needed love. I'm not gonna lie. However I didn't have thick calluses or anything that needed the actual callus remover. Just a decent scrub with the pumice bar and that gel they put on it would be good. So I thought. He went over my foot so quick and soft like he used it to spread the gel. That's it. My feet are not smooth even in the most easiest to smooth out areas. Normally I could have done a better job at that but can't reach my feet due to my belly being in the way and some carpal tunnel during pregnancy which is why I treated myself today. The chair he seated me in was not working or off. But the chair two over was on. I fumbled around to try to turn it on. He didn't even acknowledge that I was looking to turn it on and make that possible. He did not engage or even act like he wanted to try to get to know me as a new customer. I'm new to Vegas and I use to spend a decent amount on my services. Look at my other posts for nails in San Diego. Also, I'm not sure if there are any sanitation issues or guidelines but there was no liner and the chair basin was mediocre. I hoped they cleaned it with bleach and thankfully I hadn't shaved my legs immediately before. It was pretty slow so I'm thinking they should all be cleaned. Although I'm used to them using liners or having them cleaned and a towel covering them to signify they've been cleaned. All the chair basins were exposed to open air and I thought maybe that's just how it is up here. Overall It felt like a mistreatment because I didn't get their high end pedicure for 35 or 45. I told him in the beginning I just wanted the combination for 35 because I'll be back in a few weeks because I had an event coming up and I wanted it to be fresh. I'll get the other one next time and I just want to try them out. He totally missed the mark and didn't care to retain me as a repeat customer. Not very good service at all. He acted like I bothered him when I went back in to have him clean the side of my toenail that was rubbing on skin looking messy. Of course he had already seated his next client. Is this how shops are in Vegas? I'm used to better service and for these outrageous prices I thought I'd be getting that service. It felt like a $10 pedicure and $6 manicure. I should have went to the beauty college if I would have known I would get ripped off for such crappy service and work.
