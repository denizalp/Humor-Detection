I can't speak more highly of this vet (I have seen both father and son) and their amazing staff. I can get appointments in a breeze and its clear that everyone here loves their job and cares so much about their furry patients. The office is clean, modern and well designed.\n\nNever have I been pushed into getting a service or a test I didn't need, yet if I ask them to be thorough they would go to the ends of the earth (or contact every medical lab in the area) to get a diagnosis. I have multiple dogs and cats and so vet visits are a huge necessity - I have brought in strange issues as well as routine checks and dr Walker has handled everything in stride. \n\nThese guys are brilliant,  constantly smiling and so warm and welcoming. They deserve all the business they can get and you can be assured your furbaby will be in loving hands. Highly highly recommend.
