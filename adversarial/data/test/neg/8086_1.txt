Zero degrees was okay. Definitely a place I'm glad I visited. Staff was friendly and fixed our orders when they weren't what we liked. Honestly though, this place is definitely more for the drinks than the food. For the price $14, I def think it should've offered a little more than just a pile of corn and cheese covered in Cheetos. I was NOT impressed at all with the elotes. It was just nasty. You could only take a few bites of it, but eating it as a whole meal? Nah. The wings and fries, however, were a hit! Drinks were delicious as well. But fair warning don't spend all of that money on the food. ESP not the corn. Just pay $2 when the elotes man comes around, waaayyyy better lol.
