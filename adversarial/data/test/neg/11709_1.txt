Great food, amazing service and they usually have something new on their menu. The restaurant owner runs the shop with his mom and his wife (and their adorable son) who always greets you with a smile on their face. The food incompasses a modern taste of cafe sandwiches, soups, and snacks made with a mixture of flavourful spices. They also have a variety of baked goods depending on the day too, so make sure to ask before cashing out!
