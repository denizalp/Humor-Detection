Been privileged to stay at many of the hotels in Las Vegas - name it and I've probably stayed there at one point. Fortunately, we have a place up there now, but if choice came to stay at hotel outside of the place we have in Vegas... without hesitation it would be The Hotel. This is the first hotel where there bed is more comfortable than mine at home. LOL\n\nNevertheless, the whole interior decor from its lobby to the elevator to the suites its a place of such contemporary beauty. The lobby area lounge music playing while you're checking in, there's a bar, coffee shop, and restaurants... feels and sounds like a cool lounge, maybe it has to do with the fact that there's no slot machines chiming sounds. The rooms are as comfortable as they can get and flat screen TV's. Very impressive hotel!
