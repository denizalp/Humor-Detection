I have been to a number of Chili's in the past and they do have decent food for the dollar. This particular location did not. We had three orders of fajitas, two with chicken and one with steak. All the chicken was under cooked and the shrimp in the one combo was very very chewy, almost like rubber. I would have liked to thought the server would have said something after seeing the chicken was untouched. Upon exiting the restaurant the manager(I think) did ask if everything was satisfactory which I responded no go look at our table. The response was \"sorry have a great evening\".\nOh well, bad food, bad service = no return visit...
