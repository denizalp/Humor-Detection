I have only been for drinks, I'll have to come back for food.  The location is an unusual hybrid of a Scottish pub and something... well, more upscale.  I am not sure what I thought of it.  I think of a pub and I am looking for something more relaxed and less stuffy.  I am not quite sure where it fits if I was looking for a place to go.  In all there was nothing bad about it, just felt a bit ambivalent about the space and experience.  I did like the chaser shot of pickle juice.
