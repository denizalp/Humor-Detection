What I have come to expect. Actually there are some things on this menu I get a real craving for. Their pastas are so flavorful and the integrity of the dish does not diminish when you take it 'to go'.\n\nThe salads and soups taste so fresh. And the sandwiches are so jam-packed with flavor and ingredients that one is not left feeling hungry.\n\nEvery time I go I have to pick up a fresh loaf of sourdough. It makes THE best sandwiches (make a late night grilled cheese and tell me just how yummy it is!) or side to a great bowl of pasta or soup.\n\nTry the iced tea. Delish!
