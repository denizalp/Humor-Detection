My wife and I have only eaten here once, but are already trying to clear our schedules to make it back. The service was excellent. Our server even suggested something off-menu when my wife had questions. \nThe Sinatra is nothing short of spectacular. If you ask for veal instead of chicken, they're more than happy to oblige. Both were so tender, a knife was not necessary.  And the sauce?! You could put it over styrofoam and leave the table satisfied! There's an underlying peace of feeling welcomed in this establishment that's refreshing; if you've ever been herded to a table at a \"nice\" restaurant on the Strip, you know what I mean.
