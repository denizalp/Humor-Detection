I just moved back to town, and the Spot is across the street from my place.  I loved having my salon down the street in Boston, and was hoping for the same here.  That probably won't happen.\n\nIf the question is if my hair was better when I went out than when I went in, then answer is most decidedly yes.  Much better.\n\nI have short hair, and the back grows stupidly fast, so I was getting the Carol Brady Mullet.  The front needed a little shaping, but not much.  All-in-all, Martine cut maybe 1\/2-3\/4\" off the front (so, a trim), and 2-3\" off the back.  \n\nThis, combined with a shampoo that had the added rough \"massage,\" cost me $62 (plus tip, of course).  The cut is cute, but leaves no room for growth at all, which means that I'll need another haircut in a few weeks.  \n\nThe massage chairs were okay, but strangely positioned to the hair sink, so it wasn't really making any contact.  The people in there were friendly, and Martine did his best to connect with me.  He seemed very nice, and knowledgable.  Really, my only problem is the price, and that head massage.  I seriously thought my scalp may come off.  I don't remember the shampoo-er's name, but I literally had the thought of how much hair he was probably pulling out during the shampoo.\n\nTL;DR: Cute cut, too expensive.
