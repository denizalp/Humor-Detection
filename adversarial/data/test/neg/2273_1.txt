I avoid this store like the plaque but I had to come to this one versus Kierland store since it's close to my job and my phone won't charge. I was told walkin's are accepted for emergencies and the manager Mike was very rude. He said my phone not charging so I have no alternative means to call 911 if needed is not an emergency. I clearly understand I didn't have appointment but how do you schedule a appointment when your phone won't charge all of a sudden? I'll never return to this store with this arrogant manager. I'd give no stars if that's an option.
