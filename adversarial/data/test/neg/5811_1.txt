Good service because servers are always right now top of your table due to the cramp space but good service none the less. Paid just under $60 for two people at breakfast. Based on the quality of the food would have gladly paid $18 before tip but not a penny more.  If you are bored and have no reguard for money and or food quality Served is a very viable option.
