WOW! This place is just amazing. The brisket is where they truly exceed, but all of their offerings are delicious. The brisket, though. Holy shnikes. Tender. Moist. Just enough smoke and seasoning. This stuff does not need sauce, at all. Their sausage is a work in progress, but was pretty good considering they are still changing it and improving.\n\nBeware! This place sells out pretty fast, but seems a little slower on Saturdays. I went around noon and was able to have my pick of the place before it started picking up. \n\nI can't wait to go again...maybe Saturday!
