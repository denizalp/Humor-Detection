Worst manicure, pedicure ever!  For manicure, nails were filed unevenly - different shapes and lengths.  He didn't clean up cuticles at all.  I have hangnails all over that I didn't have when I went in.  He missed sides of several nails when he polished.  \nFor pedicure, hot, hot water when I put my feet in.  Again, nothing done for cuticles and polish is smeared over bottom of toes on skin.  WORST part, no massage on feet at all and no lotion on hands!  I couldn't believe what I was sitting through.
