When did this store become \"meth Safeway\".  Elderly customers and women with kids getting hit up for money and banging on car windows. Advise management but was told outside the doors not their problem.... Ouch. They must have a great legal team! Shop at your own risk! The zombies will follow you in the store!  This store really has slid... Dirty!  Other Safeway Sores much better!!
