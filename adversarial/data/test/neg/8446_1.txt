after 3 trips to vegas we never visited a buffet, so did some yelp searching and decided on this one at the Bellagio. Thought it was decent enough, could be organized better with all the breakfast food in one spot\/lunch-dinner in another\/etc. Overall variety was decent, wasn't really knocked out but got my fill!
