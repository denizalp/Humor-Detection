Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto. Ignorant & arrogant thugs. Went inside to have them correct my order from the drive-thru (give me what I paid for- forgotten 20 piece chicken nuggets), to be followed by 7 staff members (including the \"manager, \"Kathy\") physically threaten me in the parking lot, allow her 6 staff (and 2 teenage loiters\/customers) to verbally and physically threaten me, and threaten to call the police on ME. I have it all on video...eat\/dine at your own risk.
