The car wash was fabulous. They got all the bugs from our trip from IL to AZ off of the car. I did ask for the tire pressure to be checked but they must have forgot to do it. The woman at the bakery counter where I paid for my wash was very nice. I tried the Smoked House Chicken Salad. The chicken had good flavor but I thought the salad was very cold. The salad was missing a crunch factor. Most of the yummy ingredients were at the very bottom of the bowl. The bowl tips over easily if you don't eat for the middle of the bowl. BEWARE! lol I really like the dining tables.\nI will return and try something else while getting the car washed.
