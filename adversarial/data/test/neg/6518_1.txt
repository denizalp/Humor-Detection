I want to thank Jim, the gunsmith. I brought in my Ruger Mark III for a cleaning. I can take apart and clean my other 2 weapons but the Ruger is not an easy gun to take apart. Jim took his time and walked me through the process of taking the gun apart and putting it back together. We went through the procedure 3 times until I was comfortable doing it on my own, all of this free of charge! This tutorial was unexpected as most shops would take the gun, charge you for the cleaning and return the weapon to you several days later. Thanks to Jim, I cleaned the Ruger on my own at home and can do so in the future. \nI've purchased a pistol here before and I also used the shooting range, both were positive experiences. Thanks, Caswells!
