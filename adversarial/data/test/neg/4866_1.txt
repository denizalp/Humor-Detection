The other night I went here with the family at 7PM.  90 minutes later, we received the wrong pizza.  I complained to a self absorbed, preening, 20-something who claimed she was the manager (who actually wasn't), and she could not have cared less.  I then got a lecture from the waitress that replaced our original server, who quit and walked out in the middle of dinner in disgust, telling me that I should complain to the real manager, who wasn't there.  I have managed my own businesses for 38 years, and I can't tell you how excited I was to be lectured by an 18 year old.\nThis place is pathetic.  According to another server, the owner doesn't care either.  If you eat here, you are wasting your money on an expensive, inconsistent meal, delivered to your table after you starve waiting.  Two days later, I ordered a pizza from Dominos for delivery at my house.  It was great, came in 28 minutes, and cost 1\/3rd the price of Rosati's!
