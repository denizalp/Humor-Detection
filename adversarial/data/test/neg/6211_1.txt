If you have a special event this is a great place to check out.  They have a very large selection of unique dresses and the prices are not too bad (good selection on the sale rack).  They will custom make for you as well, so you can choose a different fabric or colour or length if you're so inclined. They're also very good at recommending the right shoes & costume jewelry etc to accent the dress (which is important if you're clueless about accessorizing like me). I found something super glamorous yet still comfortable to wear and got tons of compliments at the black tie event I wore it to. The only downside was I didn't want to take it off at the end of the evening.
