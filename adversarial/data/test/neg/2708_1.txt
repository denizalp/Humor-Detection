My family and I wanted to do something fun while we were visiting Las Vegas for my daughter's volleyball tournament and we also didn't want to break the bank.  The Pinball Hall of Fame met both requirements resoundingly.  This for sure will be a must visit destination  whenever we're in Las Vegas.\n\nThe Pinball Hall of Fame is located towards the south end of the Las Vegas strip, heading east on Tropicana Avenue.  It's located within a nondescript building that has only a plain banner with the words \"Pinball Hall of Fame\" hanging on top of the building.  Considering all of the neon lights adorning the closeby casinos, this fun and entertaining building should be similarly adorned to let everyone know about it.  When we visited around 5pm, there was plenty of parking available and minimal amount of people inside.  For a holiday Monday, I was kind of surprised by the lack of people inside, but I was okay with not having to worry about a throng of people.\n\nMy entire family loved experiencing the Pinball Hall of Fame.  There is no admission fee.  This building houses a large amount of nostalgic pinball machines from my youth and other eras as well as old school arcade video games.  As we first entered the Hall of Fame, it was like going back in time and caused me to remember fondly the days when I would go to an arcade and just play pinball machines and video games for hours on end.  What I really love about the pinball machines and video arcade games is that most, if not all, are just a quarter to fifty cents to play.  Talk about value for your money.  For about $10, my family of four played a multitude of games and spent close to two hours having a blast.  I really enjoyed going down memory lane playing Frogger, Ms. Pacman, and Cruisin'.  My son and I played on this old school, fooseball like hockey game, and just enjoyed trying to hit this small puck into each other's goal.  For spare change, we had some quality father\/son time bonding over this antiquated game.  Loved every minute of it.\n\nI'm all about value for your money.  I also love having fun with my family.  Fun and cheap sounds like an oxymoron in Las Vegas, but it definitely exists at the Pinball Hall of Fame.  This is a must visit destination and you'll love reminiscing about the good old days.
