This place was interesting.. heard lots of good reviews so wanted to give it a try. They didn't disappoint - everything was fresh & hot off the grill. My only complaint is we asked for ours to be packed to go (no seats - it was crowded) after seeing a customer ahead of us ask for his 1 sandwich be packed to-go & the woman calling out the orders packed his nicely in a box which she then put in a handled bag for him to carry out. But for ours she just gave us the actual sandwiches individually packed in handle-less paper bags (like old school paper lunch bags) which she folded over and was awkward to carry out.
