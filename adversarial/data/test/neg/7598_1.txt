Today for the first time we ordered a Vegetable Biryani as a takeaway order from Yuva. When I opened the box and started eating, I saw a chicken piece in my food. Generally, I am not very severe on a mistake in serving the wrong food item. But providing non-vegetarian meal instead of a vegetarian meal is a grave mistake. Especially since it is an Indian cuisine place. An Indian restaurant should be aware of the Indian sentiment when it comes to vegetarian & non-vegetarian food. \n\nThe worst part actually was the owner's reaction to this mistake. They didn't seem very apologetic either about it. This was a very sad experience.
