If you enjoy good food, live music and great beer this is the place to be. \n\nThis place has it all if you're a country music fan with live bands both new and established. The food is great I haven't found anything I haven't liked yet. The flat iron steak is delicious as is the alabama bbq chicken. Great atmosphere and a fun drink menu. You have to try a signature drink like the \"Stubborn Mule.\"
