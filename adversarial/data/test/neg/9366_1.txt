Most bars in Old Brooklyn that I've visited are dives: usually aged, don't have food beyond doritos or hot dogs, don't offer micros on draft. \nMemphis Station bucks the trend. Not as much of a dive as others in Old Brooklyn, but not exactly a sports bar, or anything sophisticated. \n\nThe menu is relatively small and consists of the typical bar foods [burger, 2 salads, less than 4 or 5 sandwiches] but they were done well. My comrade was pleasantly surprised about the House Salad, it contained fresh greens, more than just the typical iceberg lettuce. The wings, a dozen for $6.50, were meaty and crispy. \n\nSet in the middle of the space, the bar is a square with flat screen screen tvs placed above the bar on each side. On the maroon walls, there's some fire station memorabilia, but not overbearing like most other places that have any memorablia on its walls. It's relatively freshly painted and not dirty or sticky. I didn't ask for their full beer selection, but there were a host of domestic bottles, and Dundee Festive Ale on tap, 22oz for $3, a good deal. Two dundees, a domestic, house salad, dozen wings, and a buffalo chicken wrap for around $25. \n\nThe place was dead on my only visit with a small group of some younger regulars on another side of the bar. The owner asked us to put on whatever we wanted on the TV. \n\nThere's also a Golden Tee Machine and arcade bowling [the version where you use buttons and a ball built-in to the machine to bowl on a video screen].  \n\nMemphis Station isn't noteworthy but deserves a visit if you're looking for a cheaper bar with food in Old Brooklyn. I'd go again and personally prefer it to Dina's. A very high 3 stars.
