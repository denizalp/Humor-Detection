I don't know what it is, but I have NEVER been a huge fan of Zipps. Everyone chats up the food, but I feel it's very basic.  The only reason why I continue to go back is because the wait staff are typically really nice and wonderful, as well as attentive.  Customer service goes VERY far with me.  If their staff wasn't as good, they'd get a one and I'd never go back. I wish I understood why people loved the food (I've had burgers, wings, etc) but I will come back for the service alone.
