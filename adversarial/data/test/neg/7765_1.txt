I was in Vegas for Labor Day weekend, and sitting on a bench outside the salon when Lauren approached me and offered me a free blow out. I wasn't sure what to think initially and assumed they'd try to upsell me on a bunch of services and products, but decided to take a chance and made an appointment for later that afternoon. My blow out was scheduled with Armando, and Lauren gave me a tour of the salon first. It's a beautiful salon, and all of the stylists were friendly and smiling. Lauren told me about the history of the brand, and a little bit of information on Kelly himself. \nOn to the blow out...best I've ever had. Armando's technique made my recently bleached hair look and feel soft and shiny. I showed him a photo of what I wanted, and he copied it exactly. The cost of the blowout would normally have been $60, and I tipped him $30, that's how good it was. No one tried to upsell me on products, and I left feeling beautiful. I'd visit this place again in a heartbeat next time I'm in Vegas.
