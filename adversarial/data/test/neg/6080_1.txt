Went here for dinner and the place was deserted.  Service was excellent and server and bus girl were friendly and accommodating.\nFood was good, if greasy, but you get what you order in large portions.  Was very surprised to see strict limits placed on beverage refills noted in the menu; that can be a real turn-off to diners.\nDon't go in here expecting a warm, sunny decor: the 1970's dropped a bomb in here and it's now growing things like fake plants and baskets hung on the walls.  Table surface was clean, but the booth I sat in was broken and my backside plunged into a hole that kept my feet from touching the ground the entire time I was seated.\nIt's the decor and shabby seating that keep Katherine's to 3 stars.
