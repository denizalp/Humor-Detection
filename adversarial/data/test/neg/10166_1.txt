Alis truly works magic with hair.  I came to her with a color that I just didn't love, and she knew just what to do to make me smile again! Not only does she make you feel completely comfortable with the process, she is absolutely one of the sweetest people you could ever want to spend a couple of hours with. You won't be disappointed!
