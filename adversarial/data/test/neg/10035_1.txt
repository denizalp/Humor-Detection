Starting off with AMAZING BRISKET!!!!\n\nI was walking around this side of town and stumbled upon this deli and I decided to pick up some lunch for myself and my boyfriend who works in this area. Well I walked in and it was empty which usually isn't a good sign but it was 2:00 PM and I figured the lunch rush had come and gone by then. Besides the lack of people I did notice how clean and organized everything was, I liked that! I spoke to the gentleman behind the counter and asked him what the most popular item was and he said the Pastrami or the beef brisket. Since the boyfriend eats anything I got him the Brisket and he offered up some fries with that. I had a hard time understanding much of what he was saying like types of bread for the sandwich or whether I wanted a pickle with the meal but no big deal. Well to put it lightly the Brisket was friggen amazing. I am a very picky eater, I cook well so it is tough for me to eat out because I know I can cook better.... but this sandwich was out of this world tasty. The roll was soft and fresh, the beef was tender, full of flavor and juicy! I will be back!
