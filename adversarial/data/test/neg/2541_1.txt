a lot of things to choose from. prices vary from great bargain to way over priced. \nMy tip is if you are looking for something in particular (say costume) shop online to check prices before going so you can compare! \nFOR INSTANCE- we were looking for werewolf fangs- here they were around $30+ i think and i didnt get them. instead i bouth them online for $11 plus a few bucks shiping
