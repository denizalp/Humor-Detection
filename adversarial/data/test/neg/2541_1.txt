Well, I can't speak to the quality of the food... I was really looking forward to trying a new place.  We waited in line to order and the cashier (my receipt says it was Lesha) barely looked up.  Since you can get two different sauces for 8 or 12, I asked if you could get 4 flavors on 30 wings.  \"No we can't\" ummmm okay.  I continue to order with 3 flavors as well as a kids meal and two sides.  I ordered 3 waters...bill comes out to $48.  Seems a bit steep, but it's our first time and I still want to try Wingtime.  I get my receipt and see I'm charged $2.79 per water.  When I question it, the cashier again barely looks up and mumbles that \"I have to charge you for a cup.\" I asked what size water is free and she again reiterates that there is a charge.  At that point, I've had enough.  Cashier sighs, calls for a manager, and he then comes out and says nothing.  We get a refund and head across the street to another wing restaurant.  In a town with so many options for food it's a shame that the service is so lacking here.\n\n**Edited to add that the owner reached out to me last night; it sounds like my experience was definitely not the norm.  I truly appreciate small businesses and especially when owners are responsive to feedback.  We're going to give it another shot.  To be continued...\n\n***Edited again.  We returned to Wingtime after a few weeks later, and I'm so glad we did.  I seriously couldn't believe it was the same place.  The cashier\/server was very friendly and helpful.  The service was prompt, attentive, and the food was excellent.  The wings were crispy and cooked as wings should be.  The sauces (Cajun, salt & vinegar, and medium) were very good and it wasn't sauce overkill.  Our kids had chicken tenders, and both said those were great, too.  They were large, filling, and the portion was great for kids.  A big thank you to the owner for reaching out; I really appreciate the gesture and I don't know that we would've come back had he not done that.  We'll definitely be back again, though!
