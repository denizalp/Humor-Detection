Last night a few of my friends and I decided to try the new rolled ice cream trend. I personally do not eat ice cream very often, but I had watched hundreds of videos of the unique dairy dessert being made on Instagram over the last few years. I had to try it for myself!\n\nWe get to the storefront and the sidewalk was PACKED. Despite this, we were inside the restaurant within fifteen minutes and were ordering after another 10. The menu features cool combinations of classics, such as s'mores and cookies and cream, with cute names and unique twists (for example, the cookies and cream featured blue icing since it was called \"The Cookie Monster\"). \n\nI did not order one of the specials, I made my own with strawberries, banana and nutella. The cashier ushers you over to your \"rolling station\", where a chef (for lack of a better word), makes your unique ice cream order. I must say, the service is most definitely the highlight of the experience. Each chef treats you as if you're the first and only customer in the packed ice cream shop, and answers every question you have (including \"are your arms freakishly strong from working here?\"). They patiently guide you through the process and, when you whip out your phone for a picture, they tell you when they'll start rolling so YOU can start rolling (the camera, of course). Talk about instagrammable.\n\nThe ice cream has a unique texture that can only be tasted first hand. At first it's icy and features a delicate sweetness (since my order was primarily fruit, I imagine that it is one of the less sweet options), and as it melts in the bowl the flavors and texture become richer. I recommend getting the whipped cream with your order. A few extra calories, but you already made the decision to get rolled ice cream so why try and count them now?\n\nLike most novelty treats, its pricey, but you won't be going here on a weekly basis. Spend the cash. Indulge. Experience amazing service. Enjoy your rolled ice cream.
