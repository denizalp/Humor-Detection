I usually come here to grab a quick lunch from the salad bar or deli. The deli area sometimes gets crowded and if numbers aren't taken it can get kind of hectic. I love their salads and soups but I do not love the employees working there. Multiple times I have encountered rude employees at the deli counter when ordering something as simple as an iced tea. I'm a friendly polite person so it throws me off when someone gives me attitude for ordering an iced tea with lemon.... That's all....
