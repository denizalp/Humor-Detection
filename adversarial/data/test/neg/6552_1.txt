No doubt you will get so well taken care of here. Brian handled our party of eight with several special requests perfectly. He made us welcome and cared for. If you have a choice of wait staff, it's  Brian in the lead.  The entire staff looks out for the whole dining experience and provides appetizers, drinks and food at your pace and sequence. We felt important and the quiet atmosphere allowed old friends to catch up and share stories.  We are very grateful for the service, quality food and value. You helped us make and share great memories. The Gonzaga Gang.
