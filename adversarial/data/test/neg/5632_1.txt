OMG FANTASTIC!! The French toast was soooooo gooood...I special ordered it with just bananas and strawberries, the idea of grapes and melon on French Toast didn't sit right with me. We ate there two days in a row. Both days we sat at the counter because the wait was 20-30+ minutes. They have giant coffee cups which was great - no waiting for refills. Atmosphere is great - old school neon and such. You can even have a cocktail with breakfast. Go it is work the wait.
