What a fantastic experience. I was in town buying a vehicle when I decided I wanted to get an iPod cable installed. After finding this place on Yelp I stopped by to get an estimate. Ryan researched my vehicle and told me that due to its age the cable wasn't possible, however because head units have come down in price so much in the last few years I could get a killer unit for a decent price. I ended up with a great Alpine head unit with Bluetooth\/USB support and a speaker phone for a very reasonable price. What's more, after learning that I was only going to be in town for one day, Ryan was able to schedule me in to their already packed schedule and even stayed late so they could finish their work on my car that day. Overall I am very satisfied with Sun Valley and would definitely recommend them to anyone looking to upgrade their car stereo.
