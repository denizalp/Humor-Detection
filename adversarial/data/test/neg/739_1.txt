Of all the places I could go in Montreal I somehow ended up at Davids Tea while killing time before our Dinnet reservations at La Salle Ã  Manger.\n\nI ordered the Matcha because I've always wanted to try it and have heard about how expensive it is. I had to add honey to it because I felt it was too bitter without it. \n\nI like the fact they also had agave nectar.\n\nTables are limited but staff are very friendly.
