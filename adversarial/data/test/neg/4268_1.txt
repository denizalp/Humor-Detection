Hooray! A macaroon place in CLE!\n\nHad been hearing about this place from so many people, so just had to stop by last night as we were waiting for some friends. It's cute inside- I love the artwork, the tables, the furniture- there's some real love put into that cafe.\n\nAnd when you look at the display case, it just invites you to try their amazing sweets. From macaroons to gourmet chocolate or fruit desserts, coquette patisserie has it all. What was cool too is that they're open somewhat late. OH YAYYY!! I get so frustrated in CLE when nothing is open... and sometimes, you just need some sweet in your life late at night.\n\nWhat's cool about coquette patisserie too is that they serve wine, drafts, and french press coffee. And it's all quality stuff. Along with my macaroons (which I'll get to in a minute), I asked them for a cup of their french pressed coffee to go. It wasn't on their menu (it looks like they serve mostly in house french pressed coffee), but they were like, \"sure, we'll do it for you!\" Out come my delicious dark french pressed coffee. The owner asked me if I wanted cream or milk (I said cream), and he even came around the desk to check if there was cream out (awwww so sweet!). There wasn't, so he gave me a little cup of some delicious cream, measured out to be just right for my coffee (how did he know??), and man, that was one delicious coffee. I couldn't stop drinking it. It was REALLY good, and believe me, I'm a coffee snob, and it was a really great cup of coffee. :)\n\nAnyways, now the macaroons-\n\nwe just tried 4 of them:\n\n- Giandaja: Two thumbs up (and my big toes too). Delicious, soft, just the right amount of sweetness, yep, I like that flavor.\n\n- Cafe au Lait- my fave. It really DID taste like a cafe au lait- I bit into it and was like, \"omg, it really tastes like a cafe au lait!\". Yep- that was my fave by far.\n\n- Lemon- this one was pretty good, not my fave though. I think they do their sweet macaroons really well, but their fruity ones are good, but not as good as the sweet ones. The lemon one didn't have as strong of a taste that I would have liked (but then again, I like my lemons real sour), so it was alright.\n\n- Lingonberry- this was also good, but not one of my faves. I think I prefer the sweet macaroons...but that's just a personal preference.\n\nAnyways, we chatted with the owner for a little bit about the place, and when I asked him how he liked having a storefront now, he responded with \"I love it.\" That's true love and happiness in a business, and it made me want to support them even more.\n\nSo yay! I approve. When I need my fix of macaroons- no need to beg my other cities friends to send me them, I'll just take a walk over to Coquette Patisserie, where my craving can be complete!
