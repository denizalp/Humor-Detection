This place is simply fantastic. Lee and I have been going to a different ice cream place in Etobicoke for a while, and we decided to change it up. I'm glad we got a chance to try this place.\n\nFirstly, all the chocolates and desserts look gorgeous. It's a feast for the eyes, and my mouth was watering as I took a look at all that was on offer. They have candies and chocolates, ice cream bars, beautifully decorated cakes, and then of course their own ice cream.\n\nIt wasn't busy when we first came in, but we both hemmed and hawed too much over what we wanted, and by the time we were ready, there was practically a line out the door. It's a pretty popular neighborhood spot, and also one that people seem to like to make a special trip to visit.\n\nWe both got double scoops of ice cream, and they were really nice. He got strawberry, which he really enjoyed, and I had a dark chocolate, which was very rich with a good chocolate flavor. One of the things that's nice about Olenka's is the flavors aren't overly sweet, and they have a lot of interesting flavors that you won't see at the run-of-the-mill chocolate shop.\n\nIt's definitely worth taking the time to come visit here if you're anywhere in this end of Toronto.
