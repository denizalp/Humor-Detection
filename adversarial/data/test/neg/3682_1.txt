Best place for SoCal\/Baja style Mexican food in Vegas and it's inside a gas station. Go figure. Ben the owner and his wife are really friendly and will make sure to keep you happy. The food is outstanding and the portions are huge. A bit of advise, call in your order. The food can take a while sometimes because it's fresh and the place can get packed.
