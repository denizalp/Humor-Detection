Not only did I fall for the crap furniture deals, but my son thought my stuff was so nice, he went there and got himself a large sectional.\nWe are now BOTH sorry. \n\nThe finish on the recliner sofa is almost completely worn off of it, I did not use cleaners as instructed by Conn's.\n\n I had them come out to look at this and thought sure it would be covered under warranty - the lady on the phone when I was making the appointment to have Conns come look at it - cut me off as I was telling her the color of the couch was quickly wearing off. \n\nShe abruptly said you cant use cleaners on it. Who said I used cleaners on it? This statement, I believe, is just the standard reply to those calling in to complain about the material they know very well is below standard. She was in quite a hurry to determine my issue before ever seeing it.  SKETCHY\n\nMy son bought a sectional that has broken underneath within a short time and he will now have to repair this himself -take the bottom material off, just to get to the broken wood.     Conns does not respect nor support their furniture customers. Terrible Customer Service. \n\nDO NOT BUY FURNITURE FROM CONNS - stick to electronics or appliances.                       SO Disappointed!!
