Took a little drive over here for lunch and it did not disappoint! They let you try the different meat options beforehand which was awesome and great for a first timer like me. Got the combo bowl with jade red chicken and carnitas over pork fried rice and black beans and it was all amazing and so flavorful! Definitely coming back again and very soon!
