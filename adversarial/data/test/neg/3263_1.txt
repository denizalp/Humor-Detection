I have stayed here several times.  The staff varies on friendliness and helpfulness - sometimes great, sometimes pretty bad.  The breakfast is pretty good.  The last time I stayed I was told I had a nonsmoking room.  When I opened the door to my room I was hit with very powerful odors -  a combination of heavy cigarette smoke and heavy perfume that was obviously meant to cover it up.  It was disgusting and gave me a headache.  The lady at the front desk just insisted that it was a nonsmoking room, didn't apologize and didn't offer to do anything to make it right.   Ugh.
