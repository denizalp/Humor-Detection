NEVER AGAIN.  Two stars only because the staff was quite pleasant, despite the lines and ridiculous waits.  Yes, that's WAITS, plural; as they have long lines coming, going, upstairs, and downstairs with this company.\nThe car itself was as expected, no problems there.  Apparently if you book through Hotwire, you must return to the rental desk to get your deposit back when you return your vehicle.  I wasn't told about this at checkout.  A heads up on this policy would be appreciated, as with your long lines, this could be a big problem for travelers.  Personally, I would rather pay a bit more and go with another agency that won't waste my time standing in line.
