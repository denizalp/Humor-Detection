Got some gift cards from a friend first time at an outback had the porterhouse and filet and lobster tail, lobster tail was the highlight, steaks were pretty decent, the filet was over cooked, porterhouse was on point, our food was really good just nothing extra ordinary, would return if I get some more gift cards
