Great spot for breakfast and lunch.  Service is always quick.   The pastrami is excellent, as are the bagels.  They are always fresh and taste like a traditional New York Bagel.  The bakery in the front of the restaurant also has great cookies and pastries.  They make an excellent Black and White cookie, in 2 sizes no less!
