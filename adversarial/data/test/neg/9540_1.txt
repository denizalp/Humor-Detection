Our 11 year old son recently started collecting baseball, football and basketball cards and we thought he'd like to visit this shop. We were right-he loved it!\n\nMike, the owner, was so nice. He was genuinely interested in us and what we were looking for. He was happy to show us items from any case. \n\nThis shop has so much more than sports collectables. I really enjoyed looking around the store. The prices seem very reasonable as well. \nSo glad we finally stopped in, we will definitely be back!
