Lovely lunch spot. Took over old Sushi Club location on Kensington road. Decor is clean, bright and a very low inviting sushi bar greets you along the wall in full view as you enter. Two large TV screens behind the chef; one with the menu, one a tv show I'd not seen before. Photos of the menu items were mesmerizing. A dozen tables for 2 or 4 people fill the restaurant. \n\nAs I can eat a lot of sushi and sashimi, I have to clear up the understanding of gluten free\/celiac with the staff right away so I can read the menu properly. Gluten free rice wine vinegar used in their sushi rice. We confirmed on the box. Sadly the California roll is not, (imitation crab), however they do have a gluten free soy sauce if you do not want to bring your own. It's a sweeter taste than my usual brand. Not bad, just different.\n\nOn the day of our visit they were out of Ika (squid, and my favourite) since my coworker was on a food adventure - I try to introduce her to a new sashimi every time we dine, we opted for hamachi (yellowtail). Our combo came with surf clam (hokkaigai), a second new meat for her to try, and it did not disappoint. Steamed perfectly. Tooth tender and not chewey at all. Texture of all the sashimi was good. Fresh, or well thawed and prepared. \n\nA large and unique variety of rolls and house creations. \n\nRamen as well that looks great but isn't usually gluten free so I can't comment on it. \n\nTea was delicious, and very hot. Seldom were our cups empty. Water served was lemon water today. Not that Calgary has bad tap water to hide, (ok, sometimes in the spring), it was refreshing. \n\nWe'll be back to explore other menu items soon!
