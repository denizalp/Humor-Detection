GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!\n\nI wish I could give 0 stars. Nothing but problems for a chair I tried to have recovered. Took months to have it recovered. When I received it the fabric was on inside out. When I called to let them know they had the audacity to tell me THEY MEANT TO PUT ON BACKWARDS stating it would wear better. What a joke. They took it back and said they discontinued the fabric so they couldn't fix it. Now I am left with an uncovered chair and a waste of 6 months as this whole process took that long!!!\n\nWorst part about it is the complete lack of customer service! They will only communicate by email and a response takes days and days to get. I have called them many times and have yet to get a call back. \n\nIf you end up unhappy you will have a complete waste of 6 months and immense frustration and effort to get them to fix anything.
