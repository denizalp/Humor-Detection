If you're looking for something fun and different to do, lumberjaxe is the place to go! My husband and I recently went for our anniversary and had a blast. The instructors are super helpful in showing you how to throw and coaching you through different techniques. Definitely a great place to grab a beer and have a new experience with your friends!
