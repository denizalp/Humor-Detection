No one likes going to the dentist but I can tell you the ENTIRE staff here is spectacular and truly cares about you as a human and your health. It had been over 10 years since going to a dentist and needless to say I was scared my first visit a few years ago. They are very attentive and do an awesome job of making sure you are informed throughout the entire process. We even moved about 45 minutes away and still see Dr. Choules and Genie (sp?). Their service is extra ordinary!
