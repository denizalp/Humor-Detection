My kids have been seeing Dr Abrams for about 4 years now and they love her!  They are very good and patient with them.  \n\nWait time is not too bad...just remember they are working on kids time (as noted in their waiting room) so be patient.  Their waiting room is kid friendly as well, with a tv, game consoles, and other games.
