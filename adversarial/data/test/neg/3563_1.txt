I went here after a friend recommended this place and I have to say, this is quite a hidden gem. \n\nWe came here on Friday night and vibe was casual. You wouldn't really have to call in to book a table because it's a order then find your own seats kinda place. When we went in, we were greeted by a guy who works there and he was super enthusiastic about food, taking his time to explain to us everything on the menu. \n\nWe ended up ordering 9 tacos and two drinks, the store gives you free chips on the side for you to enjoy while you wait for the order. The food was very delicious, the flavours were good and the combinations were perfect in each taco. I would personally recommend the Mexican sausage taco ( I forgot the actual name but if you ask, he'll know which one )!!! \n\nOverall the experience was superb - staff were friendly, and the food was good!! Definitely recommend trying it out.
