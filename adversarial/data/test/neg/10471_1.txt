When I walked in it was immediately uncomfortable due to the hostess who couldn't even crack a smile and remained completely monotone. The Hostess first ignored us then finally looked over and said \"just two?\" Then turned around to take us to our table before we could get a response out. No one seemed happy to have customers walk through the door. The girl behind the counter looked completely unhappy as well, very depressing environment. The only good workers seemed to be the guys on the grill. Food is great but seems like just about anyone can get hired here, the personality and social skills are as flat as can be. YIKES.
