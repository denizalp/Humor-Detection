After admiring a friend's eyelash extensions, I decided to try them for myself when lash spa offered a groupon deal. I booked with Alex in Wexford, and couldn't have been happier. My lashes looked AMAZING, the process was totally relaxing, and she had a lot of good info when I wanted to switch up the length, etc, when I went back for fills. It's not in my budget to always have extensions, but definitely worth it for a special occasion, vacation, etc. I would also strongly recommend Alex. She really knows what she's doing!!!
