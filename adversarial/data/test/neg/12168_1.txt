Loved everything about this place, from the quality food to the service to the ambiance. Not inexpensive, but worth every penny. Ordered the oysters and shrimp cocktail as appetizers (should have ordered 6 shrimp instead of 20 for just two of us). The cocktail sauce was spicy, but not too much so. Oysters were plump and tasty. I ordered the 10 oz filet and wife ordered 6 oz filet and scallops scampi. Filet was perfectly cooked (medium rare) for both of us, and scallops were equally delicious. Server was very professional and paid us the right amount of attention. Will absolutely be coming back.
