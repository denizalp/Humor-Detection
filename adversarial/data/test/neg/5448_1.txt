Read other reviews and so decided to try it out for Happy Hour. Glad we did!\nFirst, the place itself is a cool small main floor and and upstairs. We sat at the sushi bar. \nOMG you have to get the garlic edamame! Wow so yummy. \nAnd since we both like unfiltered sake, we tried a new to us label. We now have a new favorite. \nThe sushi, sashimi and rolls were all fresh and delicious. \nAnd got to hear a cool story of how one of the sushi chefs got here to Vegas.
