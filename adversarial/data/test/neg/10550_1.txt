A pleasant contemporary atmosphere.  The menu offered standard choices and nothing struck my fancy.  Although my field green salad with balsamic vinaigrette was excellent.  As a final note, I would not eat here again.  But I would walk by to gaze at the awesome steel columns of the US Steel Tower which this restaurant resides.\n\nMy actual rating for this restaurant would be 2 1\/2 stars.  So I gave rating a boost and rounded up.
