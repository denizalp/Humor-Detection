It's sad when we have to admit that \"the best\" BBQ comes from a Wisconsin chain restaurant - I mean, what the heck does Wisconsin know about BBQ? \n\nBut being \"good\" BBQ in Vegas is a dubious honor, when there is NO good BBQ to be found anywhere in Vegas.\n\n Still, the food is not that bad, although the service could use some serious adjustment.
