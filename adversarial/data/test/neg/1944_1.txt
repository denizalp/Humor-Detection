I love the Genghis Grill in downtown Chattanooga, so I was excited when I saw this GG open at CLT.  I am happy to share the food was excellent. The line was long but moved fast. A five minute wait for my food, which wasn't bad considering the line. The employes were typical of the airport and it was priced like it was in an airport. Those two issues cost the review one star. Worth the stop if you are passing through CLT.
