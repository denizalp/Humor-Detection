The thing about the Chelsea is it is incredibly difficult to find. Up two escalators, down a long hall, find yourself in some random room, then up another escalator and at last you have arrived. I wish that were an exaggeration. . .\n\nOverall the place is pretty nice. It is in fact a ballroom turned into a venue but it works. \n\nDrinks were on the pricey side which is expected. However, there are an abundance of bars which made it quick and easy to get drinks. Something I don't usually encounter at a show. As far as I know, all the bars are cash only so heads up. \n\nThe overall sound was ok, it could be better. \n\nThe restroom situation has been fixed.\n\nUnlike most of the reviewers so far, I had a seat. I was actually very pleased. As long as you are in the first 10 rows (A-J) I think you can see fine. I was in row F and my view was great. I actually think I prefer it over GA because unless you are in the very front I think you'd be struggling to see (unless you're tall). Btw, once the show started, nobody was sitting. We were all too busy rockin' out to the strokes.\n\nI'd definitely return to this venue.
