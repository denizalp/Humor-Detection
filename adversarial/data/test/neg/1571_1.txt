I am a big fan of this place in spite of its location in Crocker Park, I'm not into the manufactured commercial \"neighborhoods.\". But, I will put that behind me to come here.\n\nSince I hate waiting around for a table, I've only been come to the B Spot at low traffic times.  Not easy to do unless you are able to be flexible.   \n\nI think these burgers are fantastic.  I don't mind the slightly smaller size, it's prefect for me, I don't need a giant half pound sandwich to be satisfied.  I love the pickle bar, it's nice to add what and how much I want.  It would be nice if there were a couple more options, just for fun.  Another fun bonus are the various sauces right at the tables.  No reason to go with standard catsup and mustard.  My favorite item on the menu is the Lola fries.  I don't think that I've been to a Michael Symon restaurant without ordering them.  I agree that it would be nice if they had a burger\/fry combo.\n\nI'm not a big drinker, but a beer goes so well with these burgers.  I don't know a lot about beers, but the list seems pretty good to me.  I would appreciate a few more bottled choices, but I've always been able to find something to drink.\n\nHaven't tried the shakes yet, but I'm looking forward to the experience!
