This was such a surprise. I'm usually skeptical over places in strip malls but this was some of the best food I've had in a while. I tried out the mix Kalbi short ribs and this fried chicken(it comes with this sauce that starts with a \"f\"). Food was off the hook. The portions are overly generous. Had enough for two meals. Definitely gonna take that hike out there again soon. Delicious. Also, most importantly, not pricy at all.
