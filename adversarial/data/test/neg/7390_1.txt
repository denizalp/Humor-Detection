I've been going to Sushi Shop since they opened. I was so glad they came to the neighbourhood! The staff is super friendly. They even know me now when I call in my order.\n\nThe sushi is fresh, and they have a ton of neat kinds. I also love the brown rice option, which is surprisingly not mushy and very tasty. The seaweed salad is really good too.\n\nFor a quick sushi option in the neighbourhood, this is the place!
