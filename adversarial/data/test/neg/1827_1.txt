DO NOT RENT HERE!!! If you want to experience inefficiency at its finest this is the place for you. I have never in my life seen a business operate like this....I'm wondering how they stay even stay in business. \n\n1. They advertise that they are at the Las Vegas airport rental center. It's not. Upon arriving at the airport rental center, my family of 4, plus 6 pieces of luggage had to squeeze into a minivan and drive an additional 10 minutes away from the rental center into a janky strip mall location to rent the car.  Sign #1 that this wasn't going go well. When we arrived to the strip mall, I knew this was a low budget operation. People were waiting around for cars. \n\n2. I confirmed it was a low budget operation when an employee driving the shuttle said \"wait til those people find out the shuttle is first come first serve\". I then saw people ordering Lyft and Uber rides to the airport after dropping off their cars. Folks were literally trying to be the first in line so they could get back to the REAL airport rental center to take the REAL shuttle back to the airport. \n\n3. What kind of rental place closes at 1130pm in Las  Vegas. We needed to speak to someone to confirm our rental return time and they NEVER answered the phone or returned the message we left. I even sent them a tweet. This is 2018, how do you not have anyone available to answer the phone on a Saturday or Sunday in Vegas!!!\n\nBottom line, rent a car from a reputable car company and don't waste your time or money using this janky, inefficient business.
