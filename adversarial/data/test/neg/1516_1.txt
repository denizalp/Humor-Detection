I've been craving Indian food since I moved from Boston to Phoenix two months ago, and tonight I finally caved.  I got medium-spice chicken tikka masala from Maharaja Palace.  I will not be returning to this place (unless the other local Indian joints are even more disappointing).  The food was totally adequate, and the medium spice is fairly spicy, which I like, but the dish just lacked the richness I grew to expect in Boston.  That's not the real reason for my 2-star rating, though.  Chicken tikka masala plus rice--which they charge extra for--came to $16.42.  I'm giving the low rating because this is not good value for money.  I love Indian food--I really do--but let's acknowledge for a moment that a lot of Indian food--or at least this dish--is basically slop.  Slop that should be absolutely delicious.  This wasn't absolutely delicious, and it was expensive--and all the more so because of the slop factor.
