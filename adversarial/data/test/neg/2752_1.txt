I can think of nothing I enjoy more for lunch than a well-crafted, hot sandwich. Bertha's sells a mean panini, and I can't bring myself to order anything but the one that features asparagus. It's that good. My wife surprised me with the asparagus panini on Valentine's Day, and it was the perfect gift.\n\nFor those of you who like sweets, this place has some fantastic cookies and dessert bars.
