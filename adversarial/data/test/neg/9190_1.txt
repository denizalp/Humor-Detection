This place is amazing.  We were short on time due to having tickets to see David Copperfield. So we asked before we were seated if there was anyway to get out in less than an hour. We were told the salads, spaghetti or the lasagna were ready in a very short time and boy were they! In less time than it usually takes to get a drink, our food was served. The waitress was very attentive without hoovering. And the food was very good.Would definately return
