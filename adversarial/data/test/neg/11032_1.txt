Absolutely amazing! I went for the first time on a Wednesday, got there about 1015 and was about eighth to open at 11. Everyone working was so nice, and the food was amazing. Don't miss the brisket! I also love the jalape√±o grits, even though grits are usually something I'm into. Got a pecan pie to go, which was phenomenal. Can't wait to take any visitors into town here.
