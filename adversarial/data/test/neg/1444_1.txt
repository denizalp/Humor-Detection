I had the one of the best steak I have ever had in my life here and it was only 40$ It is the Grilled Top Sirloin that is served pre-sliced with lightly buttered garlic french fries on the side.\nOur server was great and fast, there was always someone there to refill drinks and ask our status. \nAlso, we had the house made donuts with beer dipping sauce and it was Mind Blowing! you could actually taste the beer but it was not overwhelming. \nMy only recommendation is that you call ahead and ask for a table away from the casino.
