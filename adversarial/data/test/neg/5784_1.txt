The ambiance in this place is really fun and sexy for sure. I went hear with 12 people to celebrate a friend's 30th bday and we had a great time. We gave the waitress a $50\/person budget and they asked us for food allergies likes and dislikes and the check went to it!\n\nThey brought out 5 rounds of food I believe and there was a ton of it!The food over all wasn't anything amazing, but the DRINKS were fantastic and there were a few food gems as well. \n\nIf you eat here and are not allergic to fish you HAVE to try the Sea bass it is served on a skewer in this teriyaki type sauce and it is hurt me so good AMAZING! As I said the food here in general was pretty good, but nothing that I was impressed with but one bite of the sea bass and I was so so so happy we came lol! Other food gems were the string bean fries (the sauce was the clencher for this) and these firecracker shrimp situations yum!\n\nThey also have hundreds and hundreds of different types of sake so if you are a fan definitely come try!
