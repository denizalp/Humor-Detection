SO RUDE! I ordered multiple ranches with my pizza. When I got the pizza there was only one ranch and it had spilled all over the pizza. Pizza was cold. When I called to complain I said I would pay for more ranches the lady refused and said \"why does it matter if it spilled, you're gonna eat it with ranch anyways\" so rude. Will not order again.
