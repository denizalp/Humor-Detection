This review is for an older visit with my friends. We went on a Tuesday night and still had to wait for 2 hours for a table which I think is ridiculous, but at the same time expected for dinner at a busy popular place. Finally it was our turn and I ordered a mushroom chicken. It was really good and the mashed potatoes were my favourite part. The service was alright, but it seemed like everyone is always super busy. We also ordered cheesecake to go and as always those are really good. I probably wouldn't go back again for dinner until the hype has died down or visit just to buy some cheesecake.
