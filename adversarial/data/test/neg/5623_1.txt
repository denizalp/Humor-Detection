I would put 0 rating if I could. Worst customer service ever. The car broke down and we lost 1 full day without the car. They refused to refund us the money for 1 full day that we didn't use. Not only that, the manager Ken Lane didn't give a crap about our problem. He only gave us a small discount that didn't even cover for the full day that we didn't use. It's ridiculous!!! Do not rent here!! Read the comments and trust the ratings.
