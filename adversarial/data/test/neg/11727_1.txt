Red Lantern Kitchen is not what you would expect. \n\nFrom the outside it seems that the inside would look like a lot what it used to look like for years prior: A shabby little strip mall diner with cracking vinyl booths, old carpet, water-stained drop ceilings, sticky menus, fish fries and dated fare. \n\nBut these days, Red Lantern Kitchen is anything BUT what it used to be. The space has been updated to a modern gastropub vibe and so has the menu. \n\nMy guy and I stopped in here for dinner a few months back. We were looking for a restaurant\/bar to hang at and grab dinner while we (our chairs) waited in line for Free Comic Book Day preview night at Carol & John's Comics--located a few store fronts down. I wasn't expected much, but was pleased right off the bat with the interior updates. There is no sign of the old diner it used to be.\n\nWe decided to sit at the bar, which is typical for us. We prefer bar service. We ordered two tequilas on the rocks and I was pleasantly surprised when the bartender offered us ice balls. Yep! No wimpy ice chips to water down my beverage. This was a treat! We then ordered some fries and two bacon cheeseburgers. The fries were tasty, but rather unmemorable. That's not a bad thing. The burgers came out in a bowl-like dish, which was strange. The patties themselves were thick, juicy and properly cooked. I wish they would have had American cheese, but I know that's not a knock on them according to the rest of the human population who isn't a Garbage Pail Kid, like me. \n\nOverall, the items I had were tasty and made with quality ingredients. I just wish everything had a bit more umph to it, as far as the taste went. However, my opinion is limited to the two measly items I ordered from their vast menu. I also agree with some Yelpers who thought the prices were a little high. Regardless, I'll certainly be back to try more--especially since Carol & John's and their midnight release parties are a normal occurrence for us.
