Found this spot our first time exploring Fremont St.  We walked by and playing on the speaker outside was someone singing \"Gin and Juice\" and playing piano.  If you've never heard the lyrics \"pimps up, hoes down\" over a piano melody, let me tell you, it's pretty awesome stuff.\n\nAll the bartenders sing, and they are all dope.  Dre is amazing, despite the fact people kept requesting her to sing Lady Gaga.  Which brings me to my next point.  Tip them (them = bartenders, piano players) and they will sing  your requests.  \n\nDrink prices seemed ok, although we just had beers ($6).  Either way, that place is definitely good times.
