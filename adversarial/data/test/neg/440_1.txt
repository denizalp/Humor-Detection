My group and I ate here Sunday Memorial Day Weekend 2012. The wait was a long one, but the service was worth the wait. Our server was Leilani Q., if you are lucky enough to get her, thank your luck stars! She talked to us and she has been with the company for 19 years and Day 1 at the Buffet. SHE NEEDS A RAISE!!! She was on top of everything and made our meal delightful. For a champagne brunch the price was very reasonable compared to other places, I was shocked at how much less it was to other buffets. The food was okay, but just based on our server I will be back!
