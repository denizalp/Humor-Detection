Terrible customer service and like everyone else said unprofessional. I like the pizza only reason why we keep giving them a chance. If they would just be honest and say delivery time will be an hour or so because they are busy or due to not enough drivers, I would completely understand. I explained this to the manager but he just got upset and raised his voice. No apologies and continued to say it's only 20 mins late! Never again
