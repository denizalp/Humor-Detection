Really good take-out. Good quality meat and pieces of vegetables. I get the beef hakka noodles. I think they are getting better over time!\n\nI haven't tried every Asian takeout place in the area, but this is at the top of my list for Meadowvale\/Churchill Meadows. Keep up the good work. Will be back often!
