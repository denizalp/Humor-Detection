Drinks are great, service is great, wait time is minimal. For those complaining about the art wall... just because it's not ideal for you doesn't mean open your mouth and whine. It's not all about what you want\/like. This place is great, there are games and markers to express your creativity and the environment is wonderful. Definitely recommend!
