I have great hopes for this recently opened restaurant.  In our six years living in the area we have experienced four restaurant attempts on this great location.\n\n701 is Greek owned and operated:  a real plus.  Menu has gyros, spanakopita, baklava and Greek salads and daily lunch and dinner specials.\n\nFurther, the menu covers salads, appetizers, and Italian dishes like lasagna and assorted pastas.  Good, diverse selections.\n\nThe bar is large and well stocked.  Separate from the dining area you could party with friends and enjoy their daily drink specials.\n\nTwo connected party rooms have been hosting a number of events.  Most recently an eighty person graduation event.  Our book group has used this party room for luncheons to great success.  You can order off the menu and get individual bills.  Super!\n\nPrices are very reasonable.  And parking is plentiful.  You are out if Waxhaw's congestion.\n\nAnd it is open every day if the week, even on Mondays when most if Waxhaw is closed!\n\nWe will be coming back.
