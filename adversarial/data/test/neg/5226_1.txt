1st time with Janice yesterday and it was an excellent experience for both Micah and myself! ... Janice is kind and did a beautiful job!  I have a border collie with lot's of hair and she being a rescue has had a rough time in her earlier life ... she needed TLC and a gentle hand ... Janice was awesome and Micah and I will be back in a few months!\nMicah is a happy dog today and feeling so much more comfortable!  Most definitely recommend her to anyone for their pet! ... SO glad I found her! ... did it with help through YELP!
