I've sat high, I've sat close.  It doesn't matter, there isn't a bad seat in the house.\n\nI'm a biased reviewer as I am a die hard Steelers fan.  However, I love the way this stadium was designed.  The south end views of the rivers, hills and city are stunning.\n\nIf you're a Steelers fan you have to bite the ticket price bullet and spend a Sunday watching the black & gold here.  There's nothing quite like it.
