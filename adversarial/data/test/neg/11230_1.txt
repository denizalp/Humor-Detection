After reading about the fire safety concerns if you do not clean your dryer vent (and not just the one on the unit--the wall to outside vent) I scheduled my first dryer service. Every aspect exceeded my expectations from scheduling to Mike, the professional who visited our home. I learned a lot and my dryer is working much better. Amazing company and customer service. I will use again and recommend to all.
