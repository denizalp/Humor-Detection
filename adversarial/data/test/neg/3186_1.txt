Very unsatisfied with our experience! The variety of meats were disappointing, goes against their menu on website. No lamb, chicken was in buffet style, majority of beef was dry & overcooked! Bottle of wine that comes with meal originally costs $5 at your local food mart. Salad bar was limited & small but to top that off there was mold in the baby corn! Service was not great, water remained not refilled until the end of our meal. We discussed our service & quality of food with the manager, he chose to not take any action to compensate our bill in any way to make it right. If a customer finds mold in your food I would think you would do something to correct it to keep your customers & uphold your business! In addition, they said there were no reservations available at 7 or later & the place maybe had 5 tables occupied, hmmmm!?! Despite the unpleasant review above their grilled pineapple & garlic bread was delicious! I am unhappy that this app makes me select even 1 star!
