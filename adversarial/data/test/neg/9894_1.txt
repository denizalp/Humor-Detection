Although service was good the food was below par. The steak and lobster being advertised nationally was a huge disappointment. My wife's steak was full of fat and gristle and came with a tiny lobster tail. The restaurant did replace the steak however it's was so far into the meal that we took it as a to go item. My meal was lobster tail, three lobster stuffed shrimp and two crab cakes. Could not eat the crab cake ... worst I've ever had.
