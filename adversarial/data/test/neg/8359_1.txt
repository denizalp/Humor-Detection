Staying at a fancy hotel in the area, there was no way we were paying thirty dollars a person for breakfast in their lobby serving some stale banquet food buffet. So we took a quick walk down Saint Catherine and visited Mister Steer. Eggs, oatmeal, breakfast meats, Montreal bagels, local tomatoes, crisp toast, fresh fruit and high octane coffee served quickly and cheaply with a smile in a no nonsense atmosphere with well-maintained 1950's booths and tables. And don't forget s side order of those Suzie Q potatoes. Unforgettable.
