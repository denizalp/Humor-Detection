Ok this I'd my rant had my fiat towed there they said it was my clutch and that it wasn't covered under warranty 42,000 on my car  they said that's normal for a clutch to go out me being me towed it to findlay for a 2 opinion they said it was the clutch but a part of it so it was covered they saved me 3200 I will never go to findlay again
