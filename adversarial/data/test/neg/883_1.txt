Excellent experience with this company.  I had a leak in the drain pan, and called for a service call.  Received a return call almost immediately and was able to schedule a service call for the next morning.  Technician was top notch.  Knowledgeable, professional, courteous, competent.  He diagnosed problem, presented solutions, told me wha to do until repair part was available.  2 days later I received a phone call saying part was in, and scheduled the service call for next day.  Technician arrived promptly at scheduled time, performed the repair, and asked if I had any questions.  Overall excellent service.  I would rate them 5 stars.
