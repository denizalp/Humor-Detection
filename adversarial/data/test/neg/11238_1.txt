I have had 2 very horrible experiences here and I will never go back again. i had a 2:15 appointment and they didn't acknowledge us until 2:30ish and then finally at 2:50 they were ready for us to come back to take pictures. I had to fill out paper work for the photo shoot which had what type of pictures i was taking, however i had to explain to the photographer what occasion it was and help her with ideas as if no one ever looked at the information i previously wrote on paper. i figure they had Easter ideas down packed since Easter is at the end of the month, and its their job to have ideas, take the pictures, suggest poses, etc.  i didn't have anything in particular in mind. i went into this experience trusting that the photographer knew how to do her job. To make a long story short, we took about 38 pictures and only 2 i liked, however half his head was chopped off! the others had props chopped off or it was fuzzy because he moved. it was a horrible experience i had to do most of the work to get him to smile. I wasn't at all impressed with the pictures so i asked for the manager. it was 3:20 and i was pressed to take these pictures because i drove all the way from union sc and had to go back. the manager took the pictures around 4 something, we reviewed the pictures as i vented to her my previous experience. she explained in her co workers defense that it was previous management fault that she didn't do her best. the manager said the co worker wasn't trained correctly, and that is why previous management was fired. I thought that was a poor excuse and unprofessional to tell company business. after i pondered over my pictures i gave her my 'new baby coupon' which made my package free. by this time it was 5:00 i had been there since 2:15. I asked her if there was anything she could do for my wait and to have to retake his 1st Easter pictures and because i been there since 2:15. she said since i had a coupon to get  pictures for free that i could not get anything extra. I was shocked, it wasn't my fault you have a new baby free package online. its also was not my fault old management didn't train the employees you have now. it also isn't my fault i waited over 3hrs to take pictures. its definitely not my fault that the pictures had to be retaken by management. I DON'T RECOMMEND ANYONE GO THERE, THE WAIT TIME IS CRAZY, THE MANAGEMENT IS HORRIBLE, THE STAFF DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO TAKE PICTURES AND THEY ARE VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.
