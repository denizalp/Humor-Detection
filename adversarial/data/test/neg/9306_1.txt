We were feeling lazy and I'd had a taste for Indian food for a while, so we decided to order in using one of the many food-delivery apps. Marigold seemed to have a strong assortment of dishes, so it didn't take long for us to settle on this joint.\n\nFor my meal, I decided to go with the Beef Vindaloo (\"A fiery hot goan curry with chilli, vinegar and potatoes\"). At first, I was super impressed with the spice level of the dish. I mean, this thing is not kidding around. Was it too spicy? Probably, but that wasn't my biggest issue.\n\nWhen they list vinegar in the list of ingredients, they're not talking about a touch of vinegar. They *drowned* this thing in vinegar. The first few bites weren't too bad - I was more distracted by the immense heat - but as I ate more and more, the sourness of the vinegar become increasingly prevalent. There basically reached a point at which the dish became inedible, and I found myself mixing it with my dining companion's food.\n\nSpeaking of, the other item we ordered was the Saag Chicken (\"Chicken cooked with rich spinach curry\"). This was a vast improvement (ie it was edible). It was a fairly decent spin on Saag Paneer, and although it was a little on the bland side, we gobbled it up out of necessity.\n\nI doubt I'd ever order from Marigold again.
