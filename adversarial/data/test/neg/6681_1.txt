I visited using a Groupon for a facial with hand and foot scrub. I was unable to get an evening appt before it expired, but Ping offered to honor it a week later. This was amazing to me because typically the Groupon merchants are firm on all the fine print. I arrived just a few minutes before my appt time and the spa was what I envisioned in reading the other reviews. No frills, older building, small, but she couldn't have been nicer and I was welcomed with a smile. The facial room was small but clean and adequate. Bio elements products were used. She decided a classic European facial would best suit my skin. It was so nice, very relaxing and soothing. Yes you can hear street notice but there was also spa music playing to help you relax. The hand and foot scrub (a $20 value according to Groupon) wasn't really worth that and was only a 30 second quick massage per hand\/foot w a salt scrub. But still a nice service. This isn't the most glamorous spa and some probably would be put off with the dated, worn look of the place. However the service I received and accommodation is what I consider top notch customer service. Some other high end spas I've visited don't even want to address you by name or care if you ever return again.
