The airline employees get first dibs... so if you are traveling with your family DO NOT park here.  We have been waiting 40 minutes after a full day of travel.  My wife called early.  They arrived with shuttle and made it clear that airline employees had priority.  We weren't allowed on.\n\nNow we will be waiting another round trip for the one shuttle they have on service.  They said someone didn't   call in. \n\nWe will NEVER EVER park here again.\n\nYou shouldn't either.
