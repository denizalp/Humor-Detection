I called to set up an anniversary date for my husband and I. Pre-ordered the food so we could enjoy the evening without interruptions (and without money involved as it was my gift to him). Received 3 calls after to verify my request, yet still had the order incorrect upon arrival. I ignored the in-corrections and made a great night of it until I received my check clipped to a pen, without any kind of booklet. Putting my expenses of the evening out there, for my husband to see, ruined my evening and made it awkward for us. Expect to have everyone know what you paid for the evening, even though you are paying high prices, they still seem to think they can treat you like you are at Denny's. Low class guys. Get some damn check books. Seriously. Any bill over $100 deserves some discretion. Ugg. \n\nGreat service, great atmosphere but treated like you're at Denny's by the end of the night. Yuck.
