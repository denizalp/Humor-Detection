In my quest to find the best dinner buffet in Las Vegas, all roads keep leading back to The Buffet at Bellagio. If you want a fantastic buffet that consistently delivers the best AYCE food around, check out this buffet.\n\nThe price range for this dinner buffet varies - I paid $39.99 the last time I was there (7-31-2015, which was a Friday) and I can recall paying $49.99 a few years ago. While the higher-priced nights feature more foods, even the cheaper nights offer a very wide variety of high-quality dishes and desserts.\n\nThe prime-rib is cooked to perfection and is the best I've ever eaten anywhere. This is an accomplishment because many establishments are hit-and-miss when it comes to cooking this popular dish. The pork spareribs, sashimi (spicy tuna and salmon chunks), crab legs, and Italian dishes are also top-notch. There are spicy tuna hand rolls and the usual nigiri sushi offerings such as tuna, salmon and California rolls. \n\nThe desserts have actually gotten better during the last 2 years. The best ones that come to mind are creme brulee, cheesecake, carrot cake, and some small, rich dark chocolate cups filled with even more chocolate. The line may be long, especially on a weekend night, but it's well worth it.
