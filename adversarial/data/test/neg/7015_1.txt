Glenwillow Grille has a great atmosphere and the service is always very good.  Recently, I had the Fried Bologna sandwich.  Wow, was the meat salty!  I have never tasted bologna this salty in my life.  Rather than complain to our waitress, I just ate what I could and left.  \nDo not order this sandwich unless you love very salty food.
