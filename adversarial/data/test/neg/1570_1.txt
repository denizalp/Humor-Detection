I have never left a bad review but I felt the need to. \n\nI checked the yelp reviews as well as Facebook reviews to a new salon that opened up right next to my neighborhood they all were fabulous so I wasn't concerned. When I walked into my appointment, I was greeted by Shane Doucet. I showed her the type of haircut I wanted, long A-style (short in the back, longer in the front). She said she could do it and I was happy. \n\nSeemed easy enough, right? \n\nShe washed my hair and took me back for the cut. I sat down next to another lady getting her hair done. All four of us chatted away. It was a light and comfortable atmosphere. I was really enjoying myself with the playful conversation. \n\nWhen it seemed that my stylist was finished with the back of my head, I noticed it was too long, I asked her to cut it shorter. I wanted the back shorter (where my neck meets my shoulder, I pointed to that spot). She cut it then turned me around (so my back was facing the mirror) and worked on the front. Again, I told her that I wanted the front to be longer than the back and I pointed to a spot lower than my clavicle. \n\nShe worked way, and when she turned me around I was mortified. I am not one for confrontation and I HATE correcting people so I paid my bill ($55 plus tip total $66) and left. I was so upset. The cut looks NOTHING like the picture. I've had my hair cut like that before and I know what it looked like and how it would work with my face. \n\nI had over 12 inches cut off. I hadn't had my hair cut in over 2 years and when I finally do, this is what happens. It doesn't look like the picture AT ALL and it is uneven. I am so disappointed and will never recommend this place to anyone I know. \nIf you're going for a simple haircut, don't come here. \n\nI am in the process of making another appointment, pay more money, get MORE hair cut so that I look decent. \n\nI have this 2 stars because the ladies were so nice and the other stylist was doing such a great job on the other lady. \n\n4\/27\/18 UPDATE\nOwner and stylist read my review on Yelp, contacted me, apologized and issued a refund. They're not a bad company and the stylist isn't a bad person. I've seen what she can do, she just didn't get my cut right. Also, I've added the 'inspiration' picture (what it was supposed to look like).
