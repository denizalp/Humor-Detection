Like most Walmarts, this place is a joke. Stopped in to buy coolant for my car. Paid for the coolant and went to my car to put it in, only to find that it had already been opened. Went back in two minutes later and was told I couldn't exchange it for an unopened container because the register that does returns was closed. Now buying a second container so my car doesn't overheat and I get to make a trip back to this dump tomorrow so I can return their defective merchandise. Oh joy.
