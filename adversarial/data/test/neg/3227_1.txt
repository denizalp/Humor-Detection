Came by in a group of six before the Brad Paisley concert. We all found something to eat with our varying budgets. The food was good, the service was really prompt and friendly. We were in a bit of a hurry and the server made sure we got everything we needed and were out of there before the concert started. We also had a Restaurant.com certificate which helped with our food bill so that my friends could instead spend that money on the alcohol they wanted! Wonderful way to start off our evening!!!
