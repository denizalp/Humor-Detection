We came across to this beautiful fountain 3 times,\nThe classical music was playing and the water is dancing in the melody paste, our second time visit it was rock and roll and roll, the 3rd was Elvis... all three time were excellent! The entertainment is free of charge for all, there are directions to view this fountain the front row center always is the best view.\nIf you a tourist like me, check this out. This is definitely a must visit on the strip!
