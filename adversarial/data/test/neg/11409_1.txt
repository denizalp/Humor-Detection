My boyfriend and I took a trip here yesterday figuring we wanted a decent breakfast. I was there once before but I don't remember what I grabbed. \n\nThis time I got the cinnamon raisin french toast. I'm not sure what they do different but I wasn't a fan of the french toast. Maybe it was just that day. I REALLY couldn't drink the coffee, it's free refills on coffee so I thought I would at least enjoy a cup o' java that morning. It was so horrible we had to as for the manager, Rochelle, she took care of it. She came back with a fresh pot of coffee, we tried it the second time with International Delight Flavored Coffee Creamer.  I hope they decide to get a different blend of coffee. I won't ever get it again.
