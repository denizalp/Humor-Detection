We go here occasionally on Sunday afternoons for a good family meal. One of my favorite features about this place is the variety of seating available: traditional booths, high-top family tables, large round tables, so on and so forth. Furthermore, I have not had an average waitress\/waiter yet as they have all been super friendly and helpful---all above average in my book! I highly recommend the three-course meal deal as you receive soup\/salad, a burger, and a warm cookie all for $8.99!
