My first time here due to a recommendation. Recently have been leaning towards a \"meatless\" diet and have tried a few places; so far. The Coronado has a great selection for anyones appetite. I tried the cauliflower tacos and the friend guacamole and it was great! Indoor and outdoor patio seating is a plus. Definitely will be back sooner than later.
