My girlfriends and I all came here for Mani\/Pedi's in preparation for a wedding and we had a wonderful experience! Every nail tech in there was helpful, personable and definitely knew all there was to know about their colors, techniques and more! On top of all that, they were funny and kept us laughing! I would highly recommend coming here! I personally loved the dip powder technique, I haven't seen that done before. It was easy and somewhat quick! If your in the area, start coming here.
