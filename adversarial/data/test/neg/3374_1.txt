Friendly people, good customer service and yummy food.\nWe got some chicken plate and some Shawarma panini and even though it was a lot of food I still got some Dolmas because I couldn't resist it, the place looked clean and the owner was super nice. I will definitely stop by more often for lunch. \nNote: it's a liquor store that serves food also, but there is a separate section for food and they're rated A from the health department.
