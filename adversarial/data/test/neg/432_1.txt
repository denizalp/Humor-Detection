First of all, this review gets 4 stars for noon and afternoon dining and 5 stars in the AM! I love getting the Apple Turnovers, but you should definitely get them in the morning when they are freshly baked and still warm and gooey. Later on in the day, they are kind of stale and not as good. But other than pastries, I love their salads for lunch and nothing beats a nice morning quiche. But I definitely suggest this place for a nice breakfast or early brunch spot.
