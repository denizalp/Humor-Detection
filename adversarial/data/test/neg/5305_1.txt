Ok the dinner buffet was not so bad. Of course and judging it by being a little bit buzzed from the happy hour drinks I had earlier. The dinner is reasonably price especially for being on the strip, you can have as much crab legs you want or shrimp, and all the red meat you can desire.\n\nEven if you're at the line the line does go by real quick I ended up being here with 4 of my crew mates. And literally we're seated and less than 2 minutes. As we are picky eaters, there was a wide assortment of different types of food.
