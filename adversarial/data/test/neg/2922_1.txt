I had stayed at the mgm and used my free buffett there since I had booked my rooms on a good offer.  The time I was there it was close to 1030am and then they start changing it to brunch.  The breakfast was okay loved the yogurt, cottage , fruit bar.  I loved the dessert table so good small mini mousses and cheesecakes so good.  the brunch lunch was better than the breakfast.  Friendly staff there.
