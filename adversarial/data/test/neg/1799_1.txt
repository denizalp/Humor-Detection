WTF?  Auto Gratuity on an individual credit card tab?  I can't be the only one that thinks that a individual bar tab should not have the same auto gratuity requirements as a 6 person sit down dinner.  How can I go to a fine dining restaurant and be given the freedom to tip on my experience but grab a shot of fireball for $15 bucks and automatically have to give the guy a $3 tip for pouring it?  Prosperous! Not to mention getting me started about the methodology of tipping bar tenders under a different format that waiters at a restaurant.  The service level isn't the same and I'd at least like the option to tip up my bartender for doing an over the top job.  But the expectation that its included as standard is just stupid.  These casinos make enough money through other avenues, the auto gratuity at a personal level is not hospitable. Really sad.  Words of advice, pay cash.
