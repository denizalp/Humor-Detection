I came here with a group of friends and was pleasantly surprised with how delicious the food was! I ordered the Costilla de Puerco, which was tender pork ribs in a mole sauce. The meat fell right off the bone and the mole sauce was packed with flavor. My friends got the quesadillas and fajitas and were happy with their food and portion size too. \n\nIt's a pretty small place and we made reservations 2 days beforehand to accommodate 7 people. We pretty much took half of the seats. \n\nI will definitely come back whenever I crave for Mexican!
