Had to bump up from my original 4 1\/2 stars. On my last visits, the food has been over the top good. Flavourful, spicy, plentiful, and fantastic !\nPrices are reasonable. I highly recommend the spicy garlic chicken, chilli chicken dry, spicy vegetable rice, chilli beef.....however everything is good. Kudos also to the Bombay chicken and the Szechuan chicken. \nTheir lunch specials are a great price point.
