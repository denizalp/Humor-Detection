Yum, yum yum! BnD'z is a cute little place in a small plaza in South Park. Not the easiest place to find. I met a friend at BnD'z for lunch on a recent Saturday late afternoon and her GPS took her to Brentwood. FYI this is not the most kid friendly place either. I wasn't able to find a high chair and the tables are close together. The idea is that you order at the counter (off the menu or build your own burger), get your drink at the fountain, find a table and wait for your meal to be brought out to you. The kitchen is mostly open. You can watch your meal being prepared behind the counter where you ordered and paid. There are a couple t.v.'s but you can't really hear much over the loud music. \n\nWe both decided to order the chicken, bacon burger with cheese and a side of fries. We were given the choice of a plain, wheat or gluten free bun. Within about 5 minutes, our meal was delivered to our table. The chicken burger was exactly that. A burger or shredded, chopped chicken. Not a full chicken breast which is typical of other restaurants. I wasn't sure how I would feel about the chicken burger but it was actually very tasty. The fries were also cooked perfectly. Fresh cut, crispy, salty and soft in the middle. Overall, BnD'z is a great place to stop if you are in the area and in the mood for a great burger (beef, chicken or bison) and fries.
