Good food and awesome service. Anthony our server is very accommodating, checked on us constantly, recommended different seafood ( mussels, Manila clams, oysters, crab legs etc.).to us and definitely made us felt welcome.  Also love the Martini.   We will definitely come back to the restaurant and hopefully have Anthony as our server again.  See you all soon.
