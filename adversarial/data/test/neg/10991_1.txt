Walked in kinda knowing what I wanted and walked out with an awesome deal. Austin and Amanda were both great helping me out and took the time to answer all my random questions. Glad to have these guys close to where I live. I'd recommend this store, no question. I also know how yelp reviews work so these guys deserve 5 stars.
