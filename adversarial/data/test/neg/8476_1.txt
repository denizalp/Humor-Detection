Visited this May 24 to see if they are any better than the last gun store I bought a px4 storm. Place was slightly understaffed because of the gun show but they made sure you were greeted as you came in which was nice the last place northwest arms was not friendly if you ask to many questions the owner starts to get testy and ignores you. This place understood that most people tend to look around and visit a shop several times before making a purchase. I was looking for an AR specifically a Colt or Armalite, the 2 guys who worked with me were understanding they showed me a few clones that were priced below $700 but I insisted on a colt he said that recently colt's quality has not been the same from 10 years ago. I ended up looking at a BCM mid length then a Noveske however I found a FN 15 carbine for $1124, Nathan ended up offering me a 10% discount for being prior service and placing the carbine on hold. I ended up purchasing this rifle, a magpul magazine and ammo for $1150 out the door! \nThe buying experience was excellent which is half of the buying decision that most customer use to make big ticket purchases.\nThis will be my go to shop for future purchases and will certainly recommend them to my friends.
