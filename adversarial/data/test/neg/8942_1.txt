I was referred by a coworker and I was very surprised by the quality of food.  I've lived all over the world including southeast Asia and this is the first time I've had lamb prepared at an Asian restaurant.  The mood of the staff was less than enthusiastic but cordial.  The kitchen was open and fully visible.  The food was fresh and the portions were right.  I've been here 3 times and I will be back.
