The way Bank Of America (and the Maryland Prkwy) branch conduct business is unacceptable.  \nAs a merchant I need\/ expect quick and efficient service.\nIt's Monday, they only had ONE teller working at opening (9am), there was 10 in front of me. \nOne of the managers explains it's \"BOA\" procedure to have no more than two tellers at any given time. \nThey brought in a \"teller in training\" at 9:15 and I'm still in line with seven people in front of me. \n\nI ask you, would you go to a restaurant where there was only one waiter? \n\nUnbelievable.
