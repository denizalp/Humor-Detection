This was my second time seeing Mac King.  It has been several years, and I remembered the show fondly.  Once again, it was an entertaining way to spend some afternoon time in Vegas.\n\n  TIP:  Sign up for Total Rewards in the lobby of Harrah's, where you can get a coupon for two free tix with the purchase of \"a drink\" each.  It'll say the drink is twelve bucks or so, but by the time they add whatever fees get added, it's pretty much fifteen each.  Which is still a STEAL for this show!\n\n    Allow plenty of time before the show to turn in your coupon voucher and pay. The afternoon we went (a Tuesday) they were having computer problems, and we waited in line a long time without it moving at all. About the time we were thinking they were going to let computers make a lot of us miss the show entirely, they finally started working.  Then, with just two folks taking money...well, it took awhile.  Patience paid off, however.\n\n   After having our pic taken, we were escorted to a table.  If you want to sit in those nifty comfy-looking round booths, be prepared to upgrade.  We were perfectly happy at our table.  The theater is small enough and we had no problem seeing.\n\n  The bar is in the back...we took our drink tickets there and a friendly bartender fixed us right up. \n\n   When Mac King hits the stage it's non-stop laughs, fun, and how-the-heck-did-he-do that?\n\n   Loved the audience participation.  You've got a better shot at getting called up if you have a kid the right age, or you are a newlywed.  \n\n   This is a show for all ages, and everyone seemed to enjoy and appreciate it as much as we did!
