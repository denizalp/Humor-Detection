I'm doing a reviewing marathon today, and it wouldn't be complete without me giving my props to my second home, Boba Tea House. I plan a lot of meals that require me to visit Lee Lee just so that I have an excuse to get a boba tea here. I'm embarrassed to admit this but my friend even got me one of their T-shirts (that I always forget to wear) so that I can get 10% off. \n\nI've had boba tea at several other places in Phoenix (the Street, Lee's sandwiches, the Pho place in this same complex) and they are either too sweet, too watery or the boba is undercooked. Boba tea house is always good and they have a ton of different flavors and aside from boba they also have different kinds of jellies. \n\nGreat ones to try\n\n- Coconut snow\n- Thai tea slush\n- Taro milk tea\n- Honey green milk tea\n- Lychee milk tea\n- Jasmine milk tea\n\nThe only thing I can't recommend is the food. It is not good. Everything is fried and it all tastes the same: bland.
