Good lunch place. The Putin was good especially the sauce and my date was happy with his burger. The tartare was good but a bit too much sauce and the crackers (gluten free option) a bit boring... still good though.\nThe chocolate indulgence was nice and i was happy to share it... it kept me going for hours.\nThe service was impeccable
