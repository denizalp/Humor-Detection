Update: After writing my initial review, NYPD Pizza tried a couple times to contact me and ask for a second chance. They sent a coupon to our home address and when we went in to use it, the experience was completely different. They must have been having a bad night on our first trip in because the second time we went they were awesome and the food was delicious. It does take a while for your pizza to get to you and with kids, that can be tough. However, they also offer free dough for the kids to play with while they wait and that went over big time with our boys. We will definitely return after the effort they made to ensure that a customer never goes away unhappy!
