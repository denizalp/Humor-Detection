Tried their Apple Fritters, Cinnamon buns, Pinecones, Lemon powdered Bismarks and regular glazed donuts. All very good. The bismark and the donuts were very soft and airy when I ordered them, not to mention a little warm! For larger orders I recommend the apple fritters or pinecones over the cinnamon buns, just because the cinnamon bun gets stale quicker. If you are looking for a little excitement the pinecone also has more texture than the apple fritters.
