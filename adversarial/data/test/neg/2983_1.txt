I love this place! I went in knowing what I wanted but was greeted by Billy and quickly persuaded into something that was much better for my nails! They know their stuff here and are so nice & clean! Even know I came in with trashed nails and cuticles, Billy took his time and I'm in love with my nails! I will be back! Thank you again!
