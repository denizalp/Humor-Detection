Dr Villalobos and This dental office the the rudest of all. They only care about upcharging. They will recommend the most expensive route of dental care. My name is Jon Hill, I received a bridge from Dr Villalobos that was NOT installed correctly that led to a abscess. Instead of admitting fault and being humane, she attempted to charge me for the root canal and an entire NEW BRIDGE. When I would call to discuss options her staff would never allow me to talk with her. She made NO attempts to communicate with me..no email or phone calls. The Staff, in particular Gabby, became rude and short and even started hanging up on me. I do not recommend this office or Dr Villalobos to anyone. I went to another Dentist and they confirmed the mishandling of the crown was the result of my abscess. Don't Go To Desert Dentistry Located on Chandler Rd!!! Try Dr. Brown at C R Smiles Located in Glendale.
