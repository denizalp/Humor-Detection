I can't say enough great things about Steve Benedetto. After speaking with countless attorney's and getting disappointed by their responses Steve was able to see what most others couldn't. He is one of the most brightness, intelligent and outgoing people I have become to know. I was truly  blessed  to cross his path 2 weeks before my trial date. In 2 weeks he was able to turn my 2nd agg felony DUI case from a possible 4-6 years in prison to an endangerment plea with no points on my driving record, no fine, and when all said and done left the court with a misdemeanor. Thank you Steve me and my family are very thankful to have had you on our side!!
