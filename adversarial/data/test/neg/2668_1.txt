The pizza here is WAY overpriced and only average at best. I bought 2 large pizzas (nothing crazy) a pepperoni and veggie on a Tues during their 8.99 special and my total came to $32.89. The total is $23 for a large veggie pizza.  wow. Just wow. One other one i was here i over heard the crew complain that I did not tip for an order I picked up with my own car. There is no way in hell I will ever be returning to this dump again.
