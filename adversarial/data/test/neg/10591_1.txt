Being a first timer in Vegas. We wanted some pho type of soup for a hangover. I browsed over Yelp and found this place. We arrived around 12PM and had a 3 minute wait. We were sat at the bar. They came and took out order within 2 minutes of sitting down. We tried the fried rice and it was really good. And it was a big portion. We also tried the Spicy Ying Nan Rice Noodle. It had good flavor and was big portioned as well. They are a bit pricey but I mean it is located in the Venitian Hotel in the strip. \n\nIf I were to come back to Vegas I would definitely come back.
