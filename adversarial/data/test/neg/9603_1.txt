Hey there! So you found yourself at Ewing Bros towing. Through no fault of your own, your car was towed to this place. Well, we are in the same boat now aren't we. You now are dealing with extremely long holds when you call and a receptionist that doesn't know how to properly answer a business phone and just forcefully gives her name. You then arrive at the tow yard, you stand alone in an empty room with a unpleasant receptionist waiting for the \"guy\" to get back to escort you to your vehicle. Despite maybe being in a car accident, having injuries, and now losing your car, this place still cannot muster up an ounce of empathy and try and make your life somewhat easy during a trying time. Unfortunately, this place and many like it are in business because they hire former drug addicts, parolee's, other nefarious characters, with, I'm sure, a few good apples thrown in, and pay low wages and bid the lowest contracts. So if you find yourself here, rest assured, it's just as bad as it looks and it's not going to get any better. Fate just issued you a cold hard slap twice (towed car and bad tow yard).
