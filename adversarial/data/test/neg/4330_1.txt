I'm not a big fan of Arbys but had to stop in for that Deep fried turkey sandwich, which was delicious. Perusing over their website, it looks like Arby's is trying to grow up. If you would of asked me if I wanted to go to Arby's 5 years ago, I would of passed. Now, it looks like Arby's is trying to compete with Subway; while at the same type trying to find its niche. \n\nIf you look at the nutrition menu, you will see why 10 out of 10 doctors recommend staying away from processed meats (sodium content). It is fast-food and you have been warned; if anything, at least drink you're water.
