There used to be a Pei Wei very close to me on Lake Mead but unfortunately that location closed.  I actually preferred that location for a variety of reasons but I mourned my loss a short while since a fairly good Greek restaurant replaced it...which I will review sooner or later given that I've eaten there about twenty times.\n\nANYWAY, Pei Wei!\nGo in, order, take a number, grab a seat along with your drink, and hot food is brought to you since everything is cooked nice and hot to order.  \n\nThe younger sister to PF. Chang's.  It has more of a pan-asian variety of Thai\/Chinese then just straight Chinese cuisine compared Chang's.  The food comes in large portions, nice and hot with plenty of fortune cookies and delicious teas available.\n\nI almost ALWAYS get the pad thai with extra chicken and tofu.  Their cooked tofu is really very good, very flavorful and it actually KEEPS very well in the fridge for a day.  \n\nThey are a PINCH pricier than I'd prefer, buuuuut.... c-est las vie.\n\nI DID take AWAY a star though based on my first experience at this particular location where I stood waiting for my order to be taken while the cashier was going on and on to a server and then walked up without an apology or \"Oh, hello!  I'm sorry, I didn't see you there!\" or anything of the sort.  Or a friendly gesture or whathaveyou.  And when I mentioned this to the manager, (who is currently working there), I was given an apathetic apology from him and shooed away.  So no star for you.
