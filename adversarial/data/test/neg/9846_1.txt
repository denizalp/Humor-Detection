Called the front desk at the airport. I was misinformed by the gentleman assisting me and I knew the information was wrong so asked to speak with a manager and was told that the manager was going to tell me the same thing. I said that was okay and proceeded to hold. Was on hold for over 15 minutes then hung up on. I called back 4 times and no one answered the line. Cancelled my reservation and was assisted very politely by a woman at Enterprise and made my reservation with her instead.
