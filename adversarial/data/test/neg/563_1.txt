I just had my Jaguar F Type ceramic coated by Brian.  What a fantastic place and a great guy.  The result was amazing.  The car looks better than when I picked it up from the dealership and he detailed it head to toe.  Not a fleck of dust left.  He was honest, reliable, professional and just plain friendly.  I highly recommend him and will definitely be a long time customer.  Stands behind his work, truly rare these days.
