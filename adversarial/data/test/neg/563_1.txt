I grew up going to this Library for a long time.  Its pretty much apart of CMU and Pitt.  Large selection of books and all you need is a free card it makes buying books obsolete.  I lived and a lot of different places and no city can stand up to the amount of libraries in Pittsburgh.  The Burgh has a ton of libraries thinks to good old Andrew Carnegie.  I spent my childhood in these libraries.   I miss the great access.
