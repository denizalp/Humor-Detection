I had a quick lunch in here the other day. Burger with a side salad. The burger was cook very well and had a lot of flavor. The salad was also dressed really nicely. Think my meal was $10 with a $2 charge for the salad. In hindsight the salad may not have been worth the $2 up charge but it was a healthy choice at the time. \n\nIt seem like they had a lot of nice specials going on during lunch and I will definitely be back again.
