Stayed here once before .. It was very nice so we decided to stay again . The night before we left the rate was $79.00. I did not make a reservation cause I was sure there would  be availability. We arrived at 730 pm .the man at the desk said we have a room for$119. I said it was 79.00 online. HE said this is the best he could do but I could use the computer to go online and get the 79.00 rate. When I did, I saw the price went up to $119. Less than 24 hrs prior it was 79.00  .i was really annoyed so I booked a room for the Hampton across the street for$89.00 .\nI will NEVER use Sheraton hotels again just because they raise their rates. \nIm typing this while in my Hampton hotel bed and I have to say I made the right decision .\nI gave this a one star due to price . Was a clean hotel
