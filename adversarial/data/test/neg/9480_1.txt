I'll preface this by saying froyo is my favourite dessert of all time, so I have high froyo standards (if that is even a thing). Yogurty's is good, but they could be better. I wish they had a larger selection of froyo (it could just be this store) and also I often find their froyo sort of watery. It could definitely be a lot creamier and less icy. Their selection of toppings is good though, and the prices is good too.\n\nI find it to be a hit or miss - sometimes I go, and I leave thinking \"this froyo was so good I love Yogurty's heck yeah\" but sometimes I leave thinking \"this was okay, I wish I went to a different froyo place instead\". It's definitely never bad, just not always amazing!
