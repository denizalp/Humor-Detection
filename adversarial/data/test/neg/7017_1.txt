Art is one of a kind person and Dr.! I have known him for 8 years now, as my Friend and Chiro extraordinaire! I have been very active in my later adult years and Art has had to bring me back from the almost nonliving. Truly a master at the Chiropractic care and does extremities which is rare, but is life changing.\n\nImprove your daily life and go see Art!!
