I was referred to New Look by Audi Henderson. I had been rear ended and needed my rear bumper on my 2016 Audi A6 replaced. I worked with Mimi and she was very helpful. The Geico estimator insisted to me that the bumper could be replaced with a refurbished OEM bumper. I told him that would not work and mentioned it to Mimi. She stated that New Look would review it once they took the bumper off. She followed up with me and let me know that the bumper would be replaced with a new OEM bumper. She also worked with me on an additonal paint repair on my front hood. The follow up that was provided during the repair was timely and consistent. The car was able to completed earlier than quoted. The work done was excellent. New Look also called to follow up a couple of times after the repairs were completed to ensure that no additional work was needed. I would recommend New Look to anyone who is needing to have their car repaired.
