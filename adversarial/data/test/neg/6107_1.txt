Just stopped by this Hawaiian-style shaved ice place while on a trip to Las Vegas. For those who aren't familiar with shaved ice, it is very different from a snow cone. The shaving of the ice makes the ice very fine, much like freshly fallen snow. A number of shaved ice places have opened up recently in the Los Angeles area, and it looks like Avalanche uses the Swan-style shaved ice machine that is popular with most of them.\n\nAvalanche is unique in that it has a self-serve syrup station with 36 syrups to choose from. When you place your order, you first pick your size (small, medium, or large), whether you want ice cream (vanilla, chocolate, or strawberry, 50 cents per scoop), and whether you want an additional topping (condensed milk for 50 cents or pixy stix, 3 for 25 cents). Once you get your shaved ice, you take it over to the syrup station and put whatever combination of flavors you'd like. If you order condensed milk, it comes in a separate plastic sauce cup that you can pour on after you've added your syrup.\n\nIt is apparent that Avalanche has recently opened. There are still a few hand-written signs, and the overflow plastic chairs were stacked in a couple of areas of the dining section. Some of the toppings that other Hawaiian shaved ice places offer, like azuki beans, mochi, li hing mui powder, aren't available; maybe they will be in the future. The consistency in the amount of ice can also vary by quite a bit: both my wife & oldest daughter ordered a small, but there was a pretty significant difference between the two (one was about 50% larger than the other). But the dining area is clean and comfortable, and Avalanche offers a refreshing way to cool off from the desert heat.\n\nAvalanche is located in a strip mall just east of the UNLV campus, on Harmon Ave., one driveway east of Maryland Parkway on the north side of the street. We had lunch at a near-by In-N-Out before coming over here for dessert. I could see this turning into a favorite hang-out for Runnin' Rebels when school is in session.
