Not sure why this place doesn't have more reviews... As pretty much the only late-night food joint in the market itself - this place really delivers. I came at 1:30am the other night and my slice was fresh out of the oven! The pizza is great: thin crust, good cheese, not too much sauce, 3.25. I came again the following day for more pizza I was so impressed! I talked to the owner about my great late night experience and he told me that as long as he has customers coming in he keeps making pizzas because, as he says, \"after half an hour the pizza is no good\" wow! So glad to have a pizza joint in the hood that cares about freshness. I'll be back to try their sandwiches! \n\nThis place blows Amatos and fresca out of the water.
