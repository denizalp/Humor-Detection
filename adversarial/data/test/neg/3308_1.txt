Just had my brows tinted and shaped  with Whitney! Love them! Was scarred about the tinting process since it was my first time and they came out so natural and she gave me helpful hints. Everyone was so nice and friendly as soon as I walked in so nice and welcoming and the shop is super cute!! Can't wait to have my eyebrows grow a little thicker! Thank you pink cherry for a great experience HIGHLY recommended!!
