Lilly at the Las Vegas Store (near the Linq) provided my wife and I incredible customer service as she was willing to research the company's database in search of our \"In-Store Voucher\" that I had left at home in Hawaii. Lilly really went above and beyond in finally finding the transaction as it had originally been filed away incorrectly. Lilly's great customer service added to a great vacation.\n\nSincerest thanks to Lilly.\n\nRob and Kandi Lee, Kaneohe, Hawaii
