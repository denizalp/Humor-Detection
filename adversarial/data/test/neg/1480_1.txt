This place is SO cool!   You get a card and then you start trying wines!  Now, this can get very dangerous\/expensive fast.  But its just too much fun!  You get a choice of three wine pour sizes.  Try the 2oz size and taste something you wouldn't normally order!  Once you decide on a wine, order the large charcuterie plate!  Great variety of meat and cheese and lots of crusty bread.  Also, the manager is super sweet and helpful.
