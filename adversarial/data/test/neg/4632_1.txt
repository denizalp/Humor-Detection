The restaurant was just remodeled and is now called Flourish.  It has great formal romantic dining with an awesome view of Fountain Hills (including the fountain) and Mesa.  Everything we tried was VERY good and a little unusual!  It's tucked away on the top of the hill between Fountain Hills and Scottsdale.
