I need meat.  Unless I have meat, I'm hungry.  This is what I've always found, and this is what I've always believed.  Then I went to Fresh.  Had a bowl of lentil soup and one of their super-protein salads.  I was full, happy, and amazed.  With the house sesame dressing, and all those oh-so-good-for-ya nuts and seeds and roots and bark thingies...I was satisfied for the night.  Great flavours.  And I joke about the roots and bark.  This is a great place to go for detox and penance.\n\nDownside?  Too loud for my tender little ears.
