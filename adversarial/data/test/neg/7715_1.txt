The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\n\nOkay - over used headline, but appropriate for this review.\n\nMy wife and I are somewhat regular restaurant goers but 1st time visitors to Forte.  Were there last night for a tasting menu dinner and here is our feedback:\n\nBAD.  Let's start with the BAD (not really bad, but needs improvement).  Place was definitely understaffed and staff seemed overwhelmed.  Got a half hearted welcome and were seated to our table.  Our server (who we later surmised was either the owner or manager) came over with menus - no 'welcome to Forte', no 'my name is So'n'So and i will be your server', not even a 'would you like to start with a cocktail'.  Overall service was pretty slow and server on few occasions mentioned how busy it was earlier in the evening and how tired he was. \n\nGOOD.  The food.  The bison was just ever so slightly undercooked but had beautiful flavours;  the frites were smothered in salt.  Everything else was excellent - the vichyssoise, the scallops, and especially the french onion soup dumplings  (sans soup). All were very tasty.  Be prepared for small portion sizes but you will really enjoy the flavours.  Decor is somewhat eclectic but interesting.\n\nUgly. The website says free parking at the Hilton hotel.  When we presented our parking voucher prior to leaving we were informed that the restaurant no longer validated parking vouchers - that the parking fees had become too expensive and they could no longer afford to pay the hotel $10 per customers' vehicle.  When we reminded them that their website still indicates free parking their response was that they hadn't gotten around to having their website updated.  Incidentally, parking after 6:00 pm cost us only $6, not $10.  Oh yeah - a few annoying fruit flies hovering our table during dinner.\n\nSUMMARY.  Great food but food alone does not make for a great restaurant.  Based on the overall dining experience we can't give Forte more than 3 out of five.  With some service and attitude improvements, a 4 rating is well within reach.
