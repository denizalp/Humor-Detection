I cannot say enough great things about Jen and her team! I've lived all over the country and always leery of new vets. Spike has to go about every 6 weeks to get his glands expressed and I have his nails done so he is at the vet often. From the first time I walked in Jen and Justin made me feel right at home. Jen came out to introduce herself and tell me all about the facility along with taking me on a tour. The place is beautiful! \n\nI was getting his teeth cleaned and was concerned about the anesthesia. She walked me through the entire process and assured me she would treat Spike just as her own. On the day I brought him in she reviewed everything again and went over all the options and scenarios. Her staff kept me informed throughout the day. \n\nIf you adore you pet as much as I do then bring them to a place that will treat them as their own, right there! \n\nThank you for being amazing!
