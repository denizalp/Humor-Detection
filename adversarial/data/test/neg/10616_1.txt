You can't beat this! I've been going to Vegas for 10+ years and never used a VIP host before this weekend. Safe to say I'll never go back to planning on my own. I reached out to a few companies and this one was the most responsive, with the best prices, and totally trustworthy. We made a quick deposit through paypal and they handled the rest. They booked our table at Drai's Beachclub for us, the host met us right on time and we were escorted inside. To top it all off, we had the best daybed in the club, right next to the DJ booth where we got to watch Travis Barker rock out. It was our best Vegas trip to date. I don't recommend booking directly through the venue, save your money and stop waiting in line - this is the way to go.
