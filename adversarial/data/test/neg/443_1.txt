Did not know where to go order until a friend pointed out the individual stations.  So many different types of meat you can chose for your tacos!  I got the al pastor and tripas tacos and they were delicious.  Carne asada fries were good and not too oily.  They tasted fine the next day as well.  Salsa bar was clean and abundant, however the salsas were not labeled.  I'm used to spicy condiments (the hotter the better) and like surprises, but some of my friends cannot handle spicy salsa.  I would return for the tacos.
