I pass this place all the time on my way to Katsuya and stopped by to ask the people at the front desk how it was and my host was there and said \"do you want to try it, I'll give you a comp\" so I tried it and it was wonderful, I would definitely go back again and again... the service was great ...I sat at the bar and Steven was amazing and friendly and the food couldn't have been better !! I had the pork belly and the heirloom tomatoes with burrata and of course the brussel sprouts which they definitely take up a notch so delicious can't wait to go back !!
