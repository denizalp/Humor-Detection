Excellent restaurant. Try the Cincinnati chili. Best west of Indiana. Friends had steak and eggs, all cooked exactly as ordered. I had Cincinnati Chili skillet. Bran muffin is made fresh. The management was sampling pizza for customers and they were very tasty. I've had their lunch\/burger and it is also first-rate. They have three locations and all have the same consistently high quality and friendly professional service.
