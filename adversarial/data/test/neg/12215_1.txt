It took me four years at ASU to finally step foot in the Vine. Now I've been there twice in two days. Both times the bartenders were very friendly and helpful. It was early in the evening both times I stopped in so it was laid back and not very busy. \n\nTry the apple pie shots! I don't even know what's in them but they are cider-y and sweet and delicious and cost A BUCK. College kids, you can't beat that. \n\nI didn't realize they have a full menu, and I'd love to go back and try their sandwiches or baskets because they actually looked pretty tasty.
