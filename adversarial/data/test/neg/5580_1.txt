Never had I experienced such terrible customer service like I did today. I called this morning at 11:20 to get more information about trading in a phone and firstly, this male employee answered with a simple, unenthusiastic \"hello\" as if I were calling his personal phone. I asked him a question and he didn't reply for a few seconds until I asked another question to which he replied \"I'm sorry, I have another customer in front of me and we've been really busy today\" with an attitude. I stayed quiet and patient until he finished with the customer he mentioned then he asked \"are you done?\" I finished our conversation but he seemed bothered throughout it all. Never coming to this Verizon for customer service.
