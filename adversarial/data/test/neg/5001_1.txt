When they came to do our quote we were told they were going to bring us boxes - never happened. \nThey told us NOT to package the artwork ourselves or they couldn't insure it - so we didn't and when we got it back from them ALL of it is damaged - some of it destroyed.  When we asked one of the movers about the broken glass in one of the frames - he said oh ya i had to pull broken glass out of another one this morning when we were loading.  At this point they had been with us unloading for OVER AN HOUR and had not bothered to say a word to us.  The office manager is trying to insist we use his \"extensive network\" of contacts to fix all the art they damaged - as if we would allow them to touch what they have already damaged - rather than submit a claim to insurance.  \nI would not recommend this company to my worst enemy - some of my late mother in laws most prized possessions have been damaged beyond repair - and the only response we are getting from the company is a rather rude attitude.
