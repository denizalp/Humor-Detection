My favorite coffee shop in Phoenix! Small and intimate with a beautiful dog friendly patio. The staff is so nice and helpful. They always have the highest excellence of coffee and pastries. Love all the Staff here. Such a comfortable great place :) My favorite is their Carmel macchiato!! Oh and they have almond milk!
