It's been a year since I last dined here,  and although today was a 2 go order,  I still think this is some of the best middle eastern food around.   The lamb shacks are so tender and tasty and the aroma . . . so challenging not to munch on the way home.   Tip:  put the food on the floor behind your seat so you won't be tempted.  Also,  around 4 pm the parking is plentiful: easy-peasy in\/out.
