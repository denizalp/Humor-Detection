My mom and I found this place on yelp...and my goodness it's like the pizza gods themselves came down with their spirit hands and fed me pure bliss hahahaha...im a ninja turtle when it comes to pizza so this place did not disappoint..we had a caprese pizza with olives and pepperoni added onto it..and the it was so good..perfectly cooked..from the time we walked in we were greeted by who seemed to be the manager he asked us if it was our first time..which led to free garlic knot appetizer which was yummy as well..our server Noah was excellent..even though he was busy he made sure to check on us when he could..thank you again we will definitely come back..ill be craving this from now on ..i just bring my whole family
