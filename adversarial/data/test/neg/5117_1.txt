Our garage was giving us some issues and being the third owner we didn't know where to turn. Luckily they had placed their sticker on the garage for service. I spoke with Denise who was so helpful and understanding, she was able to have someone out the next day, even with going into a holiday weekend. Reed came out, what a nice guy. He was very honest, and pretty much told us, if we didn't replace it was going to break. What I thought was going to be a $300 job ended up as a $1500+. It was well worth it, and there wasn't much of an option. Being the cost was so high we are going to wait on our 3rd garage to install a motor (house\/garage didn't have one). Now we have garage people to work with(being new to Arizona). Thank you Reed and Denise.
