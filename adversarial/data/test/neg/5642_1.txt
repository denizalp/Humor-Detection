Was looking for a last minute quick oil change spot. I had called at 4:20 pm and spoke with Michael.  He was very polite and let me know that he did have appointments to fulfill before their 6 pm close time, however he would do the best he can to squeeze me in. I stopped by ar 4:30 pm, since they are right across from the street of where I reside.  I got checked in and was even able to use a $15 off coupon of any oil change.  Which was great because my car takes full synthetic.  \n\nThe waiting area is clean and spacious.  They have a tv and the remote is left out in the common area for customers to use at their own leisure.  I loved this perk since choosing what I was watching kept me company for the time I was there.  My oil change was done in a little over an hour.  While checking out, Michael informed me a few issues they found.  The explanation was in detail and I asked so many questions.  Michael was responsive and very helpful in answering all of my questions.  He was polite and very welcoming.  \n\nMy visit here was a very pleasant experience.  And the staff is honest and helpful.  I will definitely be back for various services I need for my vehicle.
