I'm giving this 3 stars primarily because of the drinks.  The mimosa was strong and the bloody Mary's were excellent.  I got the chicken and waffles and they looked great very overwhelming, however there was so much breading on that chicken there was hardly any meat.  What a total disappointment.  The waffle also had bacon cooked inside, it was interesting.  I don't think I would be back again.
