This is your average pizza joint.  Food pizza always busy.....but I have no idea why people are coming back.  The service is so bad. I was sitting there for fifteen minutes before any employee asked if I were dining in.  Then they forgot my order then had to retake my order..... 20 minutes later. Then as we though the place couldn't get any worse, they have us the wrong bill!  Just go to some other place!  Yes, it is pizza but even better pizza can be found at whole foods!
