IF you get table service... be ready for the most thirsty girls you have ever seen.  They are just dying to come to the table so if you roll with a bunch of guys and want girls this is the spot.  The lay out is nice and TONS of people there.  They have a inside area and middle area and pool side spot.  Def get the inside area as where that is where the DJ is and where all the crowd is partying.  Table prices are good and service is decent.  The bouncers are cool and VIP is roped off.  Tables are big and tons of space if you get the side tables on the wall.  Only problem here is that the VIP hosts are not cool at all.  Out of all the clubs I been to in Vegas this is the only club I have problems with the people working the VIP stuff.  But other than that def a club I would check out if they have talent there.  Have fun!
