TMI has been one of my favorite places to sit back and have a drink on the patio. Haven't been there lately due to the heat though. They have a great happy hour with a nice selection of beers on tap and a few bucks off cocktails. The food has always been the big draw for me. LOVE the Sheridan sandwich! Toasted and cheesy :) The Red Goat salad is delicious with pistachios, goat cheese, strawberries, and their to-die-for balsamic vinaigrette! Mac n Cheese is a hit as well! \n\nThe service has always been poor, but that has become expected. It takes a long time to be greeted, and expect your glass to be empty for awhile before they come around to offer you another. The waitress always seems to be rude and acts like you are bothering her. Other than that, I recommend it! It's in a cute Phoenix historic house and they place cool music :)
