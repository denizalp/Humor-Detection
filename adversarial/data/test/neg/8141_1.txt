My passenger window was a smash & grab while my sons and I were at Easter Mass. I was able to schedule an appoint the same day through my insurance (Geico). The technician Joseph vacuumed out the vehicle very nicely both front and back! He also cleaned all my windows, not just the one he fixed!\n\nThis is my third experience with Safelite and I wouldn't go anywhere else. They have competitive rates and they come to YOU!!
