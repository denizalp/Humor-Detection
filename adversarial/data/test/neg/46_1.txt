This is the worse Panera I have been to. The service is horrible, the employees are rude and unhelpful. The food is very inconsistent. On my most recent visit, the sandwich they served me has nothing on it but lettuce and hummus and when I asked for it to be remade, the teenager working the counter acted like I asked her for her first born child.  I try to avoid this location when possible, but since I work near by, it's a convenient stop for coffee and bagels... Which are hard to mess up, just don't order anything more complicated than that.
