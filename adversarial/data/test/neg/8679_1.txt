I come to Montreal a few time a year now for a few decades...\nThe night life on this trip seemed a bit slower, I arrived Thursday night and wandered the streets that night and Friday without actually entering a bar or club.  On Saturday night I ended up in here.  The cover was 15 Canadian, and the drink prices were 8.50 for a house Vodka and tonic and 5.50 for a shot of Vodka.  The music was decent I guess.  The atmosphere was shooting for an international scene and they did seem to have a bit of that.  At 11:15 a certain amount of people actually seemed to leave.  Not sure what has been happening in this town for their clubs, but my impression is the biggest rooms have either closed or been reformulated to just have live music and big name DJ's maybe.   It was an ok place.  Can't really judge too much.  Met up with one of the people working there, a dude named Dino and he was pretty hospitable and engaging as someone who works in this industry should be.   I got the feeling walking around for the three nights that the younger generation as opposed to mine just doesn't quite do the clubbing thing the same way as mine did.  Less actual dancing and more selfies and hanging out at private booths and such...
