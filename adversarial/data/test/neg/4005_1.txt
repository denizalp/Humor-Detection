First time trying since moving from Century III Mall. The restaurant is very nice and inviting. Although the food was lacking when in the mall, that is no longer true. \n\nThe food was served piping hot and delicious. The Chicken Fajitas were awesome. The Alambres was incredible. Being I eat low carb and gluten free this was an ideal tasty meal. \n\nThe Enchilada Dinner was also delicious. \n\nThe service was fast and friendly. \n\nWe will be back and recommend.
