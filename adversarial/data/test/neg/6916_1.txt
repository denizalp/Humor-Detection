I was so excited to finally come to Fuku Burger. My usual eating partner is gluten free so I don't make it to burger places too often. However I took advantage of an out of town guest and we came for some late night grub.\n\nI ordered the tamago burger. It was tasty. I liked the flavor profile that the sauces brought. Although there's wasabi mayo which likely added to the flavor profile but didn't seem to add spice. I did see a recent review complaining of a raw or bright pink burger. Mine was at the other end of the spectrum, definitely over done. The fries were crispy and tasty, I agree that they are not bursting in garlic flavor. I liked the crack sauce, which I think is mayo based.  \n\nMy eating partner had the chicken burger, she didn't finish it. It was also over cooked. The outside of the chicken was past golden brown to a dark brown and apparently very dry. \n\nGood burger joint, worth a stop,  but I'm still looking for the best burger in vegas.
