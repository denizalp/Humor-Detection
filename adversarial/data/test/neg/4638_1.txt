Nice new theater. Glad there is a bar. Please update food selection Harkins. Seats are great, very comfortable.  Restrooms are cleanish. Staff is ok. Not rude, but don't seem super friendly. It's close to home so that is a huge plus. Parking is crazy. Be prepared to park far, the lot is almost always full if you go during high traffic times.
