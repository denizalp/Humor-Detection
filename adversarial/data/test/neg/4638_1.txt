The empanadas here are absolutely AMAZING, and only cost $5. My favourite is the beef - a juicy, flavourful mix of beef, olives, raisins, and a hardboiled egg inside a deliciously chewy crust (baked, not fried!). \n\nI've never tried the salsa, because my empanadas are always gone before I get to it, but my friend says that it's very good XD\n\nI took a star off because the place is tiny, with a serious lack of seating. There was a patio outside but no chairs, despite the weather being gorgeous.
