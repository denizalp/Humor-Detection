Coming back from a trip, nothing in the fridge, my partner and I went for an early diner around 6pm on a Saturday. The place was half full, not specially good looking. We ordered a green sweet hot curry (Gaeng Kleow Wann), and a BBQ beef salad (Yum Neua Yang), with regular rice. The food came quickly and was so good! The curry was excellent, quite spicy even though I asked for it mild. The salad was very spicy, but fresh, with good beef. So we'll come again to try other delicious thai food!
