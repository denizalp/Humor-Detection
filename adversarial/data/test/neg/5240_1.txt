NB:  This is a review about The Bay's wedding registry service.\n\nTo sum it up:  almost amazing.\n\nThey sit you down in a nice area with tables and chairs and ask you some questions about the wedding.  Lenora, our consultant, was very helpful in explaining how the registry works, completion program and walked us through the catalog.  We started in the basement for the kitchen stuff and she even accompanied us down- this was after she took our coats and offered us bottles of water.\n\nThe Bay has a GREATER selection of items than Crate & Barrel @ Yorkdale (see review).  \n\nThe Bay's completion program includes a gift card that gives you an additional 10% off (regular or sale price) up to 1 year after your event.  They also give you a list of items and the discount you get if they are still on your registry after the event.\n\nThey give you a sleek black folder with all the registry info, catalog and small tags that you can pop into your bridal shower\/wedding invites stating that you are registered at The Bay.\n\nI was very pleased with their registry service.
