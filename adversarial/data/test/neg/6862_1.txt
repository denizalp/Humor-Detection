When I first moved into these apartments in 2013 aside from the roach carcasses all over the place on move in day things were decent. For a single person with no kids the apartment was spacious, with nice amenities like the water cooler and the gym, and the area was nice and quiet however as time went on I became increasingly more and more unhappy living here. What with unleashed dogs running about the complex, people parking in my parking spot and only getting an orange ticket on their window instead of having their car towed (I paid for the parking spot in my rent), hives of bees always congregating around the mailboxes, and the mountain of fees they tried to impose for random things its a wonder that I stayed so long.\nUpon my moveout I was told that I would have to pay approximately $350.00 to have the carpet replaced just because I had dogs. Despite me walking my dogs 4 times a day this was in the lease agreement so I didn't argue and I paid it. About a month after I moved out I recieved a $120 bill in the mail for cleaning fees. \"Preposterous!\" I thought. I made it a point (and took a video) to clean the refrigerator,counters,washer and dryer, the stove and the pantry. I even mopped the kitchen and the bathroom. I did not make it a point to clean the inside of the oven nor the bathtub, or get the carpet cleaned (since they charged me $350 to replace it). I didn't clean the bathtub because it was uncleanable without a heavy duty cleaner which I wasn't going to invest in,  and with whatever they painted the tub with before I moved in that kept chipping off and clogging the drain I didn't even bother.Â \nSurely I'm not a cleaning person, so I didn't make it a point to deep clean the apartment as it's customary for the apartment complex to have the apartment fully cleaned before the next tenant moves in. However this fee was passed on to me. It is wholey irresponsible for an apartment to rely on the previous tenant to fully and thoroughly clean their apartment at move out before the next person moves in. Basically the apartment was going to be cleaned anyways so I felt that it was unethical and a dirty business practice for them to still bill me even though they needed clean the apartment themselves anyways. To expect your tenant to make their apartment apartment ready for your new tenant is unacceptable.\nI don't recommend Villa Fiesta. At one point I would have. Before they charged me unnecessarily even after all of the months that I paid my rent on time, and was a good tenant (no loud parties, no loud music, no overflowing sink etc.) and then they went ahead and decided to treat me this way I won't ever refer these apartments to any one again.
