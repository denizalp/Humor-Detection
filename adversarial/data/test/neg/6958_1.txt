I normally don't do reviews but this place honestly deserves it. I have been to many dentists in my life, but none have been as friendly and honest as Dr. Lighthall. I went to him to get a second opinion about my cavities and he gave me an honest answer. Most dentists try to scam you and tell you that you have more problems than you actually do just so they can make more money, but this place is the exact opposite of that. He is very honest and best of all knowledgable about dentistry. Him and his staff are so friendly and treat you like you've been best friends for years, I absolutely love it here! I will never go to another dentist since finding Lighthall Family Dental.
