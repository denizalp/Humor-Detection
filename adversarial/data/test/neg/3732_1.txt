This place is small yet very cute inside. Most people there speak French but English is available. They sale pastries up front which look delicious but sales out sooo fast since they open early. We ordered their panini sandwiches. It was THE BEST panini Iv ever had in my life. The egg poach in you face was soo cheesy and full of flavor!  Must try! The Gustavo was also very tasty, the chicken was marinated well!
