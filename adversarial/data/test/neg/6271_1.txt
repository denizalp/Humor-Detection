Much needed lunch date with my good friend!\n\nOlive and Ivy is always a great idea. The food is delicious - always consistent. The patio is very comfortable and I love the lights and trees. \n\nMy go to is  the bacon cheese burger & of course the bread and pesto . Jason was our server today. You should request him, he's very easy going and pleasant. He  provided great service and everything was wonderful. \n\nI need to come here more often! \nWish they sold the bread and pesto in the market area!
