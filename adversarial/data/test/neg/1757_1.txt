My kids love Crystal's place.\n\nNothing fancy. Typical Breakfasts, Homemade Burgers and Grilled Cheese (which is never grilled, but thats hardly King's Diner's fault), decent fries and soups too.\n\nReasonable prices, kid friendly. Good coffee, quick to refill.\n\nKids love walking down for pancakes while Mommy sleeps. Dad can read the paper while they scarf down some pancakes and chocolate milk.
