The food is good, watch out for the prices!  The price on the menus is not correct!  You will see the add $.50 to a buc per item !  I asked them about a $.95 increase on one item only to be told the menus were old !! Then noted all prices were higher.  I am good with a bit extra I do like to know what I am paying for
