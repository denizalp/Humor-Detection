We had never been here before, but myself and my group love golf and drive by this place all the time! We decided to stop by and a lovely young lady named Janet (from Pittsburgh) helped us and made us feel welcome and like family. She was very knowledgeable and provided us with the best customer service we've had all week. Next, our sever August showed the best customer service. He checked on us multiple times and even provided some awesome golfing advice! More places should have employees like Janet and August. I wish we could do more than just write you an amazing yelp review. You're awesome. We will be coming back a lot because of her.
