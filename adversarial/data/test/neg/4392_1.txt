Very good brunch place. And seems like everyone else agrees too since the wait for a table was 45min on a Saturday. (They texted us after only 30 min though).\n\nI ordered the fork scramble and it was absolutely delicious. (See photo) and I was very full after. I'd love to come back and try a few more menu items.\n\nThe service is OK since the food took a long time to arrive but the waitress was good.
