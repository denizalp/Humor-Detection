On hotdogs, on kimchi, on-young!!\n\nThis quaint hot dog spot brings a creative, Korean twist to red hots.  I love the menu and the variety in the menu, but was less thrilled with the actual product.  \n\nLike most red hot places, the majority of the space inside is dedicated to the grill.  This can make for a very hot room to eat in, so be warned.  The restaurant is neat and clean, with a couple things on the wall and a TV.  The staff was friendly and welcoming, and happy to explain the menu for those who inquire.\n\nThe food:\n\nWe had the Classic Buldogi, the Smoked dog, and the Bahn Mi dog.  Of the three, the Bahn Mi dog was flavorful and satisfying.  The other two left a lot to be desired.  I would rather have a good hot dog and good bulgogi individually if they are not complementing one another, and these did not complement each other.\n\nAngry Kimchi fries - This was a hot mess.  The flavors worked well together (sweet potato fries btw) but it was just so messy.  The fries became soggy very quickly under the heavy toppings.  \n\nSeasoned Fries - The fries had an odd aftertaste about them.  I think maybe it is cumin that I was tasting, but I'm not sure.  Either way, I'm not a fan of fixing something that isn't broken, and these fries would have been better senza the seasoning.  \n\n\nOverall Buldogis is an alright place, but with all the Korean fusion eateries around town, I'm not left yearning for seconds.
