After sinus and allergy issues that plagued me from my childhood until the present day, my allergy doctor recommended I see an ENT. Dr. Rehl was at the top of her list. I was able to get a CT Scan in his office followed by an office visit a couple of weeks later. Dr. Rehl and his staff were professional and courteous. Dr. Rehl diagnosed two issues (chronically infected sinus cavities and enlarged turbinates) and suggested an outpatient surgical procedure to solved both issues. He also told me that my nasal passages WOULD NOT have to be packed with gauze post surgery (a different ENT six years prior told me that he would have to pack my nose for 5 days!!). My response was - book the surgery!  I scheduled the surgery for about 5-6 weeks from my office visit. I received a call from his surgery scheduler on a Thursday morning to let me know someone had cancelled their procedure for the following Monday, Aug 27th. Thus, I was able to move my surgery date up by 3 weeks! I just went to my first post-op appointment this week. I can already tell that my ability to breath is greatly improved and I have several weeks of healing to go. I would highly recommend Dr. Rehl. He cares about his patients and is on the cutting edge of ENT procedures.
