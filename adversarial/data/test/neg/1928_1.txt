1110 Caven St. is not much better...Things have gone downhill over the past couple of years. Elevators and garbage rooms are dirty and stink. Cockroaches are a common sight around the elevators.  The new asst. supers are lazier than the ones that recently left - hard to imagine that is possible.   And here we are with no water since noon - a pipe burst. No sign of a plumber and it's now 4:29... This is an all too frequent event.
