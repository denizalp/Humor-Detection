We just got a really cool sectional from here today and got it delivered this evening!  Prices are good and Ken who works there is really nice.  He also helped deliver the vouch and showed us how to fit and take apart each piece properly. (And they installed it together for us too).  I'd definitely recommend this place if you're looking for cool furniture (especially sofa with a chaise lounge.  They had quite a few really nice ones).
