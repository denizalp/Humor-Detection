Waited 20 minutes in the drive thru until finally someone took my order after I got off knocked on the window and pulled up to the drive through window. After finally getting my sandwich I received the worst sandwich I've ever gotten in my life the bread was cold when I asked for it toasted and not to mention my cheese was cold and not melted one bit. They also didn't even offer a drink or to make it a meal. Worst subway I've ever been to.
