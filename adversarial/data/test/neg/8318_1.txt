It's pretty tasty thai food, we ordered spicy thai fried rice, beef salad, pineapple curry, and lad na. I really want to give this place 3.5 stars because it was better than A-OK, I'm just not a fan of thai food in general.. I mean I like it but I never love it.  For those who really like a variety of flavors this is the place for you! Every bite was filled with flavor, I always think things are too salty because I have a sensitive palette but my boyfriend and roomate thought it was fine.  \n\nThai fried rice- Full of flavor, comes with bamboo shoots kind of weird if I knew I would opt out of the bamboo.  Other than that very tasty \n\nBeef salad-  I was only disappointed because the beef is cooked well done, normally in thai beef salad the beef is seared, leaving it very tender.  \n\nPineapple curry- My first few bites were good but after a while it got too salty and overwhelming. If it was a tad less salty I would have been more satisfied. \n\nLad na- I really liked this, though I am use to Lad na not swimming in brown gravy.  \n\nI will be back to try some other dishes.  I feel like I need to try more menu items.
