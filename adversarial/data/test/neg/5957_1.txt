Love Nolan's Kitchen. The have a great indoor space as well as an outdoor patio. At night they have a gas fire burning on the patio which looks amazing. The food is also amazing. They have HUGE salads that are great, a variety or small plates to share and great enters. I had the sweet potato gnocchi that was to die for. Totally recommend it.
