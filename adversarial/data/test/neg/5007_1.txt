We found this restaurant on yelp and we were blown away... end of story unbelievable.  If you're staying in Vegas is worth getting away from the strip it coming out to the red rocks and then having dinner at Juan's flaming fajitas! We may actually come back to Vegas just to eat here again.  We felt like this was an authentic experience. The flaming fajitas we had were so delicious! The service was excellent.  The environment was perfect right down to the smoke, music and wait enthusiastic staff.
