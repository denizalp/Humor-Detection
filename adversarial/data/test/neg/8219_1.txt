I've been meaning to do this review for some time now. We take clothes we don't want to ruin by washing at home to this cleaners. As long as it's his work jacket, pants, or shirts, they seem to do a decent job. Granted, he prefers to press them himself, since they can't seem to get the creases as perfect as he wants them.... Which in my opinion, shouldn't be an issue for a professional cleaners. My clothes however? They ruined one of my favorite dresses. I didn't notice it right away because it was with a bunch of other stuff and it wasn't the right season for the dress, but they completely messed up the padding in the bust area. They don't even have an onsite seamstress that could fix it for me, and instead suggested another place.... Which I would have to pay for! Why should I have to pay to get something fixed that NEVER should have been messed up in the first place??? I have some friends who can rip the seams, flatten the padding, and sew it back up so no one would even know the \"pros\" messed it up. Also, they should have \"if items dropped off before 9:00 am\" written below the part about \"same day service available.\" I waited in line several minutes before just walking back out with my items because I was told they wouldn't be ready by the time I needed them.\n\nOverall, I am thoroughly unimpressed with this \"professional\" cleaners. I'm just glad I never had anything lost by them like some of the other reviewers here.
