Dr. Ting is extremely friendly! My 3 year old loved him. Affordable dental for kids has dentists that are EXTREMELY patient with kids. It's not easy getting a toddler to open their mouths and take X rays! Kiera is very friendly as well. She took the time to get to know my daughter before starting the X rays and cleaning. I would DEFINITELY recommend them to anyone!!!!
