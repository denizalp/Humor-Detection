You walk in and you are instantly in love with the place!  The decor makes you feel like you are in a very swanky spot.  The service is amazing- we were immediately seated with no reservations and our waitress was so helpful and I felt like she could pull up a chair and be our friend!\n\nTHE CHICKEN... WOW!! AMAZING! It was perfect and melted in your mouth.  The only bad part was my stomach wasn't big enough to literally lick my plate clean!  Someone in our group had the pasta and loved too!  We had salads and the burrata and they were all delicious!  \n\nI travel all over the world for work and we all agreed this is a place we would 100% be coming back to on our next trim to Montreal.  We have to check out the speak easy!
