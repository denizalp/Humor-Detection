Stopped by for a work event and decided to have the Pepper Jack Steak Wrap. I will say I really enjoyed it. Not too spicy, tender steak with the right amount of guacamole, pico de gallo, and lettuce. Obviously, the fries were great, who doesn't love fries. Anyways, I am recommending this wrap, however your service lags. It's packed in here with two bartenders during happy hour. People would usually spend more money on alcohol in this joint then food, however with the service being slow at the bar due to staffing issues that's what you get.  This place definitely lost some money with our group of 25.
