Just returned from the 2015 Arizona Taco Festival.\n\nIf you love tacos of all kinds, this is a must attend event!!\n\nThere was a wide variety of tacos from both local and out of area vendors and every one that I tried (at least 8) were all delicious.\n\nAs great as this event was, there are some things to consider before purchasing your tickets which are:\n\n1. Online purchases of tickets will cost you an additional $3.00 per ticket, cheaper at the gate (and there was virtually no one in line to purchase)\n\n2. Upon entering, go right to the $2 Token & ID Check line, you have to pay for everything in tokens ..... and if you plan to drink (other than water), expect to purchase a minimum of $30 in tokens (have to purchase in increments of $10) since tacos are $2\/ea & drinks range between $6-$8\/ea\n\n3. Get there early, the place becomes busy in the afternoon\n\n4. Honestly, this is not really a kid friendly event if you are thinking of bringing the munchkins\n\n5. Watch the weather, there is not a lot of tents to use as shelter if it rains (especially once the place gets crowded) and the parking lot will turn to mud since it is all dirt\n\nOverall though, definitely a fun event with lots of good eats and looking forward to the 2016 event ... and will try to make time to attend the Chihuahua Pageant.
