There is amazing, beyond belief and just OMG, served exceeded all of these. We were the first two guests of the morning and had come for breakfast. What we didn't know, is that our meal would be gourmet presentations and a collection of fresh flavors that just melted in your mouth. The Apple pie pancakes could fill 3 adults, the berry French toast was amazing covered in and around with enough healthy naturally sweet berries to give a weeks worth of antioxidants. The staff were professional polite and genuinely wonderful.
