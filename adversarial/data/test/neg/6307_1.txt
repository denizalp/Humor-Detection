I've been going to this salon ever since they opened. I love the girls that work there! Vanessa and Bri are so experienced and can do anything you ask them to do! Not only are they good at what they do but they are passionate about it as well making it that much better! I would never let anyone else touch my hair ever since I started going to Bri! Definitely recommend this salon for the best care for your hair!! Nice location right before Anthem. I have also learned so much about what products are good or bad for your hair, and definitely see a difference in my hairs health and growth! 5 stars no doubt!!!
