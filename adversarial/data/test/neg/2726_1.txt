This place is fantastic! One of my girlfriends is a personal friend of Mr. Bradley Ogden and so we were of course all treated like royalty! He personally ordered us champagne, tastings of several appetizers, and dessert. So, we were left to order our entrees on our own. I choose the rib-eye cooked medium rare and it was absolutely delicious! \nMy favorite appetizer was artichoke soup, you have to try it!\nIt's nice to have friends in high places because the menu is quite pricey. But, if you have the money to spend, then it is definitely worth it!
