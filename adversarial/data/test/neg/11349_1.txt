My 6 yr. old dropped her iPod touch, wanted to get it fixed. After searching around for a place I found this place here on yelp. And I am so glad I did, fast service great prices. If we ever need any other cell phones or iPods fix I will be returning. Also they are so sweet, it's my daughters birthday so they included a screen protector!
