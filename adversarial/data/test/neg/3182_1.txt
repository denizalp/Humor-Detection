I actually come here pretty often. Don't know why. Restrooms are  such a mess they should clean it more often. Service is not bad but not good they should hire more people cause they are always busy but only have 2 or 3 people tending to customers. We didn't get drinks until second plates. You have to pay extra for drinks, don't ask for water cause its nasty. They don't refill the good stuff, like the oysters and crab. You could be there at least and they won't refill them. I think its more of trick if they don't want to refill them they should just stop serving it cause thats why we are there for. Their egg roll are huge. Mongolian station is pretty good and fast. Salmon is good but often has bones. Nice location.
