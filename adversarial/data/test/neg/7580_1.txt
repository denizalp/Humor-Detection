Janet was amazing!! She was really fast--she got my alterations which included taking my dress in, adding a bustle, adding a built in bra and a few other things and she got it done in two weeks. She was flexible with times to come see the dress and she let me try it on several times before the wedding. She also makes hand made garters which were beautiful and fun! I got my husband a Star Wars one and he loves it. She is reasonably priced as well. I had a lot to be done and she charged 300 which I thought was a good price for it all. I had a wonderful time experience with her!
