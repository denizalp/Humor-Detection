THEY WASH ONLY CLEAN CARS \n\nI have been, or should I say was a fast pass customer for the past six months. During that time my vehicle has been hit inside the wash by another vehicle not once but twice!  The second time I watched as a truck in front of me jumped the tracks. I was then bumped from behind. Clearly at less than a mile per hour no damage but...  ridiculous just the same. \n\nLast week I returned from a trip north where my vehicle got very dirty. However, it was no dirtier than many previous trips and I always washed the day I returned. This time I went to the was at 6:30PM, and was to,d I could not get washed. MY CAR WAS SIMPLY TOO DIRTY AND WASHING WOULD DIRTY UP THE BRUSHES AND GET ON OTHER VEHICLES. \n\nRIDICULOUS. After several minutes of discussion with the two clearly inept individuals I was directed to leave without the wash.\n\nI won't spend another dime at this place and rest assured, I will tell this story to everyone I know and meet in the area. \n\nThey violated the fast pass contract, offered ridiculously bad customer service and could not have cared less if I cancelled my pass. \n\nDid once any of the think to grab a hose and spray what they thought was excessive dirt?  Nope.  \n\nSHAME! SHAME! SHAME!\n\nIn response to J.R.R from super star. Thank you for your reply. It is unfortunate that while I can understand why you would not wash my vehicle, this was not part of the agreement I. Fast pass. Furthermore, I find it amazing that the staff at this location are so poorly trained they are incapable of problem solving. \n\nFinally, I sent a note via email to superstar expressing my concerns about bring hit inside the wash, two weeks prior to this recent incident and recommended you give the shammies out after the wash to prevent the individual in the vehicles of getting distracted.  To date I have no response. It is clear that if you want to ensure a good reputation you should take immediate steps to resolve the multitude of concerns I have raised along with other customers. \n\nAs for me, it was not about the bargain but the convenience. I'll take my business elsewhere. Getting a car wash shouldn't be stressful or frustrating. However, your organization creates both.
