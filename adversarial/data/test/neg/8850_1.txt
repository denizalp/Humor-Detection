Polished concrete floors. Mismatched wooden furniture. 32 chairs inside. 8 chairs on the 7th St. facing patio.  Stark white walls with local art -- the two owners are the first to show their work.  Pastries brought in from a number of local bakeries.  A glass menu board.  Free Wi-Fi with password.\n\nI ordered an espresso macchiato my two times in and got two different prices ($2.50 the first time, $1.30 the second).  I was told today when I picked up my order that the cashier (owner?) rung up the order wrong and next time the price would be correct.  No big deal.  The coffee is not Lux nor Copper Star, but I'd put it on par with Drip and Fair Trade.  Not a complex taste, but it does the trick.\n\nNot a lot of action in here either visit.  One or two people at any given time over a few hours.  The music is hit or miss, but volumed well, and unobtrusive.\n\nOne of the barristas mentioned that they'd like to serve beer\/wine some day and they have the makings of a walk-in cooler, replete with pounded copper door.  \n\nIndeed Phoenix could use more places where city dwellers drinking coffee can sidle up next to someone drinking a beer.
