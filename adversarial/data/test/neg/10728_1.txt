Come in a few times and Jake is real friendly and knowledgeable, shoots you straight about what you're buying and what he offers. I enjoy the personal attention and professional advise they give. I was given some sample packs of different flavors in the products I was interested in so that I could make a more confident buy.\n\n Use this place for all my supplemental needs, highly recommend.
