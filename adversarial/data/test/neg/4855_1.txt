A few nights ago while in Las Vegas we found out Guy Fieri's 'a - Kitchen and Bar-eat place had just opened 6 days earlier. We had dinner elsewhere But decided to have dessert - OMG the mint pie was awesome for the 2 of us but could easily feed 3 maybe 4 peeps . Our waiter was Chris Anderson and his helper Angel. Chris was very informative and friendly. Chris I could hang with you and learn about the area too- you rock man- thanks for the chat ..... Hubby and I appreciated it much- take care-
