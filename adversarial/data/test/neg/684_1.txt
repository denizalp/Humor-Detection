Stopped in for breakfast on a Sunday morning and it was amazing! The server was so sweet and helpful. She took the time to explain to us what was a popular dish and was very attentive with our coffees and waters. \n\nThe decor was really cool inside. We both ordered the Breakfast Burritos and they were so delicious. \n\nWe will return next time we are in town! Recommend this place :
