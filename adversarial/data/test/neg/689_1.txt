What I Ate\n- House soft pretzels and provolone fondue\n- Sweet potato tortelli\n- Grilled asparagus\n\nWould I Go Again?\nThe word I would use to describe this restaurant's food is \"bold.\"  The sweet potato tortelli was fantastic--very strong sweet and salty flavors.  The portion was kind of small, for which I was grateful.  The flavors were so \"bold\" that I don't think I could've eaten any more.  The grilled asparagus were great--again, very \"bold\" flavor with olive oil and vinegar.  Lastly, the soft pretzel bites and provolone fondue were outstanding!  If only my soft pretzel at ballgames tasted like these pretzel bites and the cheese dip like this provolone fondue!  The Arrogant Butcher was great, and I would like to come back next time I am in Phoenix.
