There are a few very simple reasons this cozy cafe is rated 5 stars.  The owner and his wife are amazing, so friendly and accommodating.  The food is great, and at a fair price.  The menu has all the classics and their specials are creative and delicious.  My wife and I went twice on our honeymoon, by the second visit they had us feeling like regular locals.  Breakfast here was one of our highlights of our stay in Scottsdale.  I'd go back a thousand times!
