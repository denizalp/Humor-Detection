It looks clean and friendly, but I couldn't get past the front counter because of the heavy fumes. My mom and I stopped in for manicures. I get them regularly, this was a treat for her. As soon as we opened the door the overwhelming smell of acetone hit us. We walked to the counter thinking we just needed to re-acclimate to being in from the brisk winter air, but after a few minutes we started getting headaches. There was no moving air- circulating or ventilating. We made our excuses and left. Others didn't seem to mind it. I cannot understand that. We went elsewhere for manis.
