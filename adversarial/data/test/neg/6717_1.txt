Kinder Care has had some turn over in leadership and staff in the past year. It worried me as a parent but it did not affect my son at all. He was still taken care of very well and to this day he asks to go to daycare when we are on vacation or decided to stay home. That speaks volumes to me as a parent. In addition, the district manager frequently visited the center (and still does) to reassure parents that they were working on finding the right individuals in order to avoid additional turn over. I believe the people in place now (Ms. Victoria & staff) are the right people and they are here to stay. I also appreciate those few individuals at Kinder Care that stuck it out during the changes.  Everyone there is so awesome.
