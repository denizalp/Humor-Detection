Scheduled an appointment, but the company was a no-call \/ no-show for the appointment. When I called 15 minutes after the appointment time, was told that he was running behind and would be at least an hour late for the scheduled appointment. At least a text or phone call by the time the appointment is supposed to start would be appreciated. I will not bother re-scheduling with this company.
