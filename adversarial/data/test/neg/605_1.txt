The bread is really hard and the sandwiches are really dry. The Vietnamese desserts in the fridges are not good, very generic nothing special. This place is good because it's open 24 hours but other than that it's not a good place to go to not a lot of selection for food besides sandwiches. Don't come here expecting is going to be another Lee sandwich from San Jose or LA because it's not. Save your money.
