Update: Sky is absolutely AWESOME! and the only reason I'm updating my review. She actually went above and beyond with her customer service in helping us! She called us back and she totally went to bat for us in correcting our situation!! THANK YOU SKY!!\n\n\n\nHORRIBLE HORRIBLE!! Do NOT use these guys!  Go to a better place! Their phone employees are nice but they hang up and you after over an hour on the phones and don't call you back AND ALL of their employees at their casinos are rude and never want to help you!
