I went into Exotix today to get a tragus piercing done. Alex greeted me warmly, and made me feel very welcome in the shop. There were a couple people getting tattoos at the same time, as well as another person working with the artists on placement of a new tattoo. This shop has an air of professionalism that you would expect, but none of the pretentious attitude that you might experience at other shops in the area. \n\nAlex is not only a great piercer, but he's super friendly and made me feel confident that he would do a great job on the piercing. I'm very happy with how it turned out, and if I ever decide to get another piercing I'll definitely go back to Exotix.\n\nI'd definitely recommend Exotix over other shops in the area, even if their prices are a little higher. You definitely get what you pay for, and this place is worth it!
