Excellent service and attention to detail. I stopped by after breaking off the rubber hee part on a pair of boots. He resoled both sides to ensure evenness and also rebuffed\/repainted some scuff marks on the heel and lightly brushed the suede on the rest of the boots. One-man show. Great service. Excellent value. $12.95 + tax. Would absolutely return here anytime. All done in about 30 minutes.
