Last night was one of our worst experiences at whiskey row. First off, this is a place I usually enjoy having Sunday fun-days and watching football at; that now has changed. I don't think we have stood so long at the front of a bar and not received a drink. We made countless attempts to get the attention of numerous bar tenders and were blatantly ignored. It got to the point that people were bumping into us to cut, and they received service almost immediately. Terrible experience! Never again!
