Came here for a \"pub night\" for a social event after work. The waitress was friendly and since people were arriving at different times, she made sure to greet each guest that sat down and get them a drink right away.  \n\nWe ordered nachos, fries, wings and drinks. Food came out fast and it was okay. Not the best food I've ever had in my life but it was bar food.  \n\nWe had a good time chatting and eating but you could tell there were regulars that go there all the time.
