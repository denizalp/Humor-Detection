Super gross \"panini\". I had to return for them to grill longer so that its wasn't cold. The second try didn't do much in terms of making the sandwich palatable. I ended up needing to pick off the gross tomatoes, bacon and cold chewy turkey. Ultimately, I ate overly greasy sourdough toast for $11. DON'T CHANCE THIS PLACE
