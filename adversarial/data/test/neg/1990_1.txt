Came here after searching Yelp for nearby restaurants while visiting my boyfriend's family in Chandler.  Little did we\/they know that this awesome Chinese restaurant exists just feet from their door.  It was a Sunday night and the restaurant was about 60% full on arrival and to the max when we left (so takeout may be recommended).\n\nWe devoured several good dishes shared among the table:\nPork potstickers\nMongolian beef\nSweet and sour pork\nHouse special fried noodles\nEggplant with pork and garlic sauce\n\nThe potstickers started us off on the right foot, some of the best I have had and we saw them being made later during the meal in house.  The pork and beef dishes were arguably great standards while the house noodles came with three meats and was huge and delicious and the eggplant was succulent and well flavored.  We surprisingly had no leftovers which is usually a very good sign in a Chinese restaurant.  Walked away with just over a $40 bill which is a remarkably good deal.  Loved dinner here!
