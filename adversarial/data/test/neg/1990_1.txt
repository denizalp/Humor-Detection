Love to grab a coffee at the Starbucks inside this Target and stroll the store.  It's a SuperTarget, so there is a full grocery store in addition to all the normal stuff you find at Target.  While I don't normally do full grocery runs here, it is nice to be able to pick up a few food items when I'm shopping for toys, books, clothes, baby items, etc.
