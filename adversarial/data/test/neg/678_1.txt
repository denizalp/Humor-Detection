I had buffalo chicken. Spicier than most. I ordered a sandwich, she brought a wrap. It was good. Looks like they are still ironing out some things as they just opened a week ago. Hubby's chicken sandwich was good altho they forgot to dress it. They have a huge beer assortment altho only 6 or so wheat beers, which I Love, so that was a bummer. Service wasn't perfect, just ok. Atmosphere was casual sports bar-ish. They have OMB Copper and that's pretty good.
