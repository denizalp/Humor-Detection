yes another NYer commenting about bagels! I was impressed with these bagels - chewy outside and soft inside.  Not bready bagels which I hate. Even in NY I hated those bready ones. and the everything bagel had a good amount of everything on it! I will drive the 20min to get these bagels. The people working there were very nice too. They froze and defrosted well so I can stock up so I don't have to make a 40min trek on a weekend morning! Side note - NY styles are all different just like are pizza! But a good bagel is a good bagel whether its the twisted style (my total favorite and hard to find anywhere) or traditional. And adding good service like at the bagel bin it means it a place to return to!
