Stopped in to Wendy's for a quick bite last week with the family.  We were taking a road trip, so we decided to eat lightly.  My wife and I both ordered the full size apple pecan chicken salad.  The server told me that they would have to make the salads from scratch.  I did not argue with him about that!  I guess that is the norm for these salads.\n\nThe salad was fresh and delicious.  The chicken was tasty, the greens were fresh and crispy too.  The apples and pecans were yummy and this is definitely one of the best salads I've ever had at a fast food restaurant.  I've been eating Wendy's salads since I was a teenager.  Anyone remember their taco salad?\n\nAnyway, I love having healthy, fresh options when driving.  I find that eating salads while on road trips helps me stay awake better on the road.  \n\nThe only improvement Wendy's could make is to replace their iceberg lettuce with Romaine.  The salad already had spinach in it.\n\nTotally recommend the salads!
