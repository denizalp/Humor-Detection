What a terrible response from their sales rep to online inquires. \n\nDirect quote to me politely asking why my BMW specialist can't look at the car.\n\n\"I don't know of any simpler way to tell you that we only allow PPI (inspections) by maranello or Parkview\"\n\nThat's it! That was the only response. No hello, no thanks for the inquiry. No logic, no goodbye. \n\nNo thanks.
