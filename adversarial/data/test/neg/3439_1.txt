I've never been a fan of Baja Fresh, but it's been adequate the last few times I've been there. Today the service was terrible. I went in to pick up my phone order. While I was waiting, there were a couple different people that were pissed off with the wait. MEANWHILE, they put my order on the counter without calling my name or the order out. When I finally realized it was my order, the manager (?) said, \"well why didn't you say anything?\" Excuse me? I'm so sorry that I didn't assume that the bag on the counter was mine, because THE STAFF DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. Don't blame the customers for your incompetency, or for your soft-spoken voices. Rude!\n\nPS....my quesadilla was dry and my friend's burrito was so small that we're probably gonna go get something else.
