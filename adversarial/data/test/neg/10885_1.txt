Wow, way overrated, but not really a bad place either.. I received so much HYPE about how GREAT this place was, and people went into the Diners Dives n Drive thru's, which for me was a selling point to try. Great concept though, a mix of 3 culture to quench most cravings. I got the Chinese BBQ Pork (Great) and the Jerk Chicken (fair) with the beans n rice... Rice was a tad undercooked, and the Jerk chicken lacked the JERK from other Caribbean food I have tried..
