This mall is the equivalent of metro center now-a-days.  Honestly I don't recommend leaving your vehicle unattended.\n\nThis is the type of mall that the people with money avoid unless it's a restaurant on the outer mall areas, or in n out.\n\nThe Starbucks here even sucks.\n\nProbably the best thing is the shoe department in Dillard's downstairs at the north entrance.
