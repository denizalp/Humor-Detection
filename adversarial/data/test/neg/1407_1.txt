On 4\/24\/17, I hosted a dinner party of 10, for one of my company's very best customers at Roy's in Las Vegas.  I had hosted a dinner for them at another Las Vegas restaurant previously that did not go well at all and this night was the redemption for that.  I have dined at Roy's many times, in various locations and had complete confidence tonight would be a memorable experience for my guests.  \n\nThe evening started out well at the restaurant's bar and continued into the restaurant.  The first course went off just as expected and excellent as usual.  Our waitress then notified me that the kitchen was backed up and there would be a minor delay with the second course.  I dine out multiple times a week, entertaining guests often and understood that these things do sometimes happen; no problem.  Twenty five minutes later, I asked for an update and am now embarrassed and becoming annoyed.  Our waitress apologized and when she returned, informed me it would be another ten minute wait.  Fifteen minutes later, I asked her what was going on.  She could not provide me with anything more than an apology and free drinks for the table.  I declined the drinks and asked for the manager.  The manager apologized, offered free drinks again and told me I would be the next ticket up; again with no real explanation.  One hour has now passed in between courses and we finally received our second course.  To my surprise, the food was barely warm.  I was dumbfounded.  We feared turning down the food as we just wanted the terrible night to end.  We accepted another bottle of wine, this one on the house.  The waitress was obviously not thinking and fell into her routine by asking if we wanted desert, reminding us there would be a wait for the chocolate dessert.  Predictably, we declined any last course or beverages.  I profusely apologized again to my guests but the apology was sounding ridiculous having been repeated so many times over the last hour and a half.  \n\nI have no idea what occurred to allow our table to not be served while others were; including a much larger party in the private dining room.  All I can tell you is that I have only experienced one other dinner with very similar circumstances in my thirty years in sales.
