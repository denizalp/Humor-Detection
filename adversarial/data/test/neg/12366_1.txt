A tremendous place.\n\nMy wife and I went to Les Deux Singes de Montarvie last Saturday for dinner. We were not disappointed. When we arrived, we found our name on a small chalkboard sitting on what was our table. The decor is eclectic--very, very eclectic--but somehow works well. The restaurant has the feel of a small, quirky neighborhood restaurant, even though the food it serves is anything but ordinary neighborhood fare.\n\nTo start, I ordered a cocktail. I forget exactly what it was called, but it had whiskey (I think), Amaretto, and kumquats. It was fantastic. My wife went straight for the wine, ordering (for both of us) a bottle of rather excellent trebbiano. A note about Les Deux Singes' wine list: It is small, but it appears to be very well curated. Additionally, and especially for those of us who have grown accustomed to New York wine prices, the bottle prices are eminently reasonable.\n\nBack to the food. There are only two menu options: nonvegetarian (regular?), and vegetarian. I chose the former, whilst my wife chose the latter. For the amuse bouche, we were brought a fried(?) zucchini blossom stuffed with eggplant and mozzarella. It was fantastic. (It was also substantially larger than any amuse bouche I've had before.\n\nRather than go through each individual menu choice we had, suffice it to say that everything was marvelous. Additionally, service was fantastic.\n\nHighly recommended.
