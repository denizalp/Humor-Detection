Wow.. what a nice store. I came in here today for the first time and I was very impressed by the selection of higher end fabrics. They were also having a sale on some of their items and the employees were more than willing to help you find the right piece :).  Their prices are a little on the higher side but the employees will help you pick the right fabric for what you want to do and they will make sure you get exactly what you want. A+ customer service!
