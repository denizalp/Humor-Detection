The biggest saving grace, and why i like this airline, is they fly to Bellingham WA, saving me a 2 hr drive from SeaTac. They consider themselves a budget airline, which they are, you won't find them on Orbitz,Travelocity or any other website. You must book on line to get best deal. Suggest you look frequently for the best rate. Rates do change..you sometimes can get the best deal closer into your travel date...Hey it's a vegas based airline you take a risk..If rate is lower after you've booked, don't count on getting an adjustment house keeps the difference! Booking is an adventure pay close attention to what your doing..they slip in charges, automatically like picking your seat and priority boarding. You can remove those charges. Since you have to check in at the desk, suggest you make your seat request (window, exit row,etc). then. If flight is booked your seat assignment will be pre-assigned and your stuck..again it's a crap shoot so to speak. Bring your drinks,snaks,meal on board.Nothing is free, they charge for everything (nominal 2.00 for a coke)..Seats don't recline so don't plan on being too comfortable. Remember they are providing basic transportation, it's not a pleasure flight so to speak. You generally will arrive on time. The times I've been significally delayed they have compensated me.....fasten your seat belts...
