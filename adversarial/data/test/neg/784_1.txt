Always crowded because your food is prepared quickly. Perfect spot to go to for healthy eats and even not so healthy eats because they have a few different desserts. Every meal you order comes with a chocolate strawberry. Their bisque soups are my favorite. You can taste the freshness in their meals. Their fusion drinks are awesome too.
