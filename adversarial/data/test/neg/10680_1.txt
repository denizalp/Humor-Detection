I gave it an extra star for being open and available in my drunken state. Youd think though in a drunken state the food wouldve been amazing. However, it was super dry and looked almost like left over food was used. The only thing i enjoyed was the fresh coconut...but even that, the way they give it you doesnt make it easy to drink it...meh. i mean...next time just eat some mcdonalds and your better off with some nuggets.
