The definition of underwhelming. We arrived at 545pm on a Friday to a 15-minute false wait. Frustrating, but it happens. Our server greeted us quickly and took our order. Our salads came out before our drinks, again not a deal breaker, but par for the course. Our steaks came out underdone with the medium well having red and the medium bleeding. Server didn't offer to fix or replace. Just a blah experience all around.
