One of our favorite places to stay while on the Strip. Expansive rooms. Pretty amenities. Nice pool area and a good spa. We brought my 92 year old mother and her 91 year old husband here for their newlywed get away vacation. We booked them for a day of spa treatments and were impressed by the extra care and attention lavished upon them both by the staff.\n\nYes....just like everywhere else on the Strip you pay a price for the pretty. We booked them on The Venetian's very short and pricey gondola ride but they loved every moment of it and still cherish the photos.\n\nTheir covered shopping and restaurant area is sweet and a fun place for a stroll.
