My friend found the place and asked me to meet him there for dinner.  What is interesting about this pizza place is they also offer Broaster chicken.  Now if you are from the mid-west you know what this is, if not you need to order this chicken.  The pizza is great and so are their salads.  I met the owner and she is a really good person and everything from the eating areas to the bathroom are sparkling clean.  The menu is friendly to any persons taste and accommodations.
