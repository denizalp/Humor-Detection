We were in Vegas for the day and instead of going to our usual place, we decided to try this place instead. It was definitely worth the 30min. Drive we had to do from where we were at. \n\nFirst and foremost, the staff were super friendly. They treat us so well!! \n\nWe had Al Pastor, chorizo, carne asada, chicken, barbacoa, cecina and chile relleno tacos. They were ALL amazing. Our favorites though were al pastor, barbacoa, and chile relleno. \n\nHats off to the chef!!! \n\nThe green salsa that we used was pretty good. We added it to all the tacos. \n\nIf you've never tried a Jericalla, I suggest you try it. It's kind of like flan, just not as sweet. \n\nJust overall...an amazing little place.
