Ate here last night, both my wife and I had the lobster with sides, expensive at $46 each. Both of our lobsters were over cooked, the sides of baked potatos and broccoli were cold. The broccoli was covered with a cheese product that was much too heavy for the vegetable. The baked potato was small and slightly larger than a red potato from the grocery store. Parking is inconvenient and had to park at a business next door. Very disappointing and I will never be back. I don't understand the attraction.
