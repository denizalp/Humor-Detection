I've brought my car here before for an oil change and for brake service,  both of which were good experiences, I worked with Jason both times. I went in yesterday to get some help because my check engine light had come on, Jason was not in. When I pulled up the guys there were just standing around staring at me like I was chopped liver, when someone finally came to \"help me\", it was really anything but help, I was being nickeled and dimed and told that I would need to replace all of the sensors in my car even though only one was bad, and that it would cost me around $500 dollar, I then left after that poor experience and took my car to the dealer who completed the work for half the price and twice as good of service. I thought I would be a regular customer however after that experience I definitely will not ever bring my car back.
