This is officially one of my more favourite Shoppers Drug Marts, simply because it is a new location and it is right around the corner from my bank the TD Canada Trust.  I simply park there to do my banking and walk around the corner to this SDM to buy my vitamins, toilet paper and to get my postal services done.\n\nBecause it is new, it's really clean and there is never any line ups; the convenience is amazing and of course you get all your basics here so as all Shopper Drug Mart locations are, it is a one stop shop.\n\nThe difference for me is parking and getting banking and essentials done in one outing.
