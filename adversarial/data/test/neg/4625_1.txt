Went out last night in Old Town with my boyfriend and after bad service at Whiskey Row we decided to come here. It's a great spot with a great patio as well. Music was great and the bartender Jordan was AMAZING!! She definitely made up for the previous service I had. She is definitely not your typical caddy, stuck up bartender or girl...which fyi ladies there is nothing more unattractive than that (which I notice a lot of in Old Town) She was super nice, personable, sweet and funny!! Definitely go check this place out. Great service, music and vibe. Jordan definitely made me wanna go back.
