I can't praise them enough! We had some important friends in town who were  more than 3000mi away from home. Their one request was some good Mexican food and Frank & Fina's is The Best.  The ambiance was perfect, clean, cozy but not cramped.  The service was perfect.  We had an unusually loud group and everyone was so kind and patient. We were delivered chips and salsa before we even finished sitting down. They're so great!  One thing that genuinely impressed me was the way he took time to tell us about some of their specials and their specialties the way a formal restaurant does. He has a way of making you love the food before you even know what to order. It was great!  Everyone ordered something different, and everyone LOVED the food. I'm dying to go back asap!  I'm pretty sure I will dream of their mole enchiladas until I do. The price was HALF what I was expecting it was going to be, and that included drinks. You can't beat that!  Epic food, epic service, all affordable.
