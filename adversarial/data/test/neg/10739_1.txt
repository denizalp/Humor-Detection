1 and done, will NOT be ordering again! We're new to the neighborhood so I decided to try it out. Ordered a large pizza with bacon, small steak salad, and a kids mac n cheese meal. First the pizza, crust left much to be desired and was cold upon delivery. The small steak salad was very small for $6. I've paid the same for a nicer salad at other places, the \"steak-um\" steak on the salad wasn't even cut up, looks like it may have been microwaved, not grilled. The mac n cheese wasn't even mixed and again, cold upon delivery.
