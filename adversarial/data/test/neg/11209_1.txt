I've only been in here a few times and I have liked it every time. Their prices are pretty reasonable compared to other thrift stores and the ladies who run it seem very nice. If you go on Mondays it is half-off day, lucky for you if you find something as you want. I still wear a pair of shorts I bought here three or four years ago. I once bought a book in here just because I like the author and found out when I got home it was a first edition! After I read it I was able to sell it on eBay for a pretty good price. Their craft supplies are especially well priced, maybe $2.50 for an item that would be $8 over at Bookmans. I do a lot of knitting and crocheting for charity so I appreciated finding some yarn for a dollar a skein. If you are looking for unique, antique type furniture and accent tables etc, this is a great place to find them. If it was a little bit closer I would be in here every Monday. They close at 4 so it's sometimes hard for me to get here since it's often after that when I'm in the area.
