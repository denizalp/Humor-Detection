First things first, there is always a long wait outside this place going down the corridor next to it. However, it is about the same as a regular restaurant wait. We arrived about 9am one morning, and still were very far-- but waited roughly 20 minutes to order, which wasn't so bad. \n\nThe menu options are simple: bacon egg and cheese, homemade-sausage egg and cheese, a burger, a steak option, and regular egg and cheese. They have an egg over easy dish and biscuits, but neither looked appetizing to me. \n\nOur group ordered a couple bacon egg and cheeses and sausage and cheeses, and WOW. This was really the best breakfast sandwich I've had in a very long time, and possibly ever. The turkey sausage was homemade and very well done. Super flavorful. The bacon egg and cheese had a ketchup type sauce on it that had a good bite. Totally 5 star worthy. The service is pretty fast and kind too. \n\nThe only draw back is don't arrive thirsty-- this is Vegas. A bottle of water will cost you $5, and fresh squeezed orange juice is like $5-8. Also, seating gets tight when it gets busy, so consider taking our sandwich on a still on the strip!
