The place has a chill vibe hiding by the jack n the box.  The prices are doable and the dogs are tasty along with the fries. Balanced flavors.  Plus you can have an option of a burger even rice.  The service is fast and the server is friendly.  Just dont try the one with corn the southern one. It doesnt taste soo good IMO
