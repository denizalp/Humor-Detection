Loved their Acai bowl(Full Brazilian). We ordered a large and shared it as a light lunch. Good price. Freshly made. They have 4 different bowls to choose from. So far I've tried Full Brazilian and Swole Bowl. After a hard workout swole bowl would be my #1 choice. Love that they have gluten free items on there menu. Definitely need to try the Carrot Cake!!!
