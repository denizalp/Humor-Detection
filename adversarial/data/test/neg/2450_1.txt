Never tried Bao before coming here, but after tasting it at this location, I can say I'm a fan lol. The bun is very soft and pairs well with the flavour of the pork belly and the crunchiness from the peanuts and cucumbers. Personally, I love coriander so it's always a plus in my dish. 2 are pretty filling in my opinion. Best to come during off-peak hours.
