I really enjoyed this restaurant. When you're grabbing lunch downtown, there are not a lot of top rate choices, but this is one of them. My guest and I had the Arnacini, which is basically fried mozzarella with some really tasty sauce.5\/5. I also had the chicken chop salad, which I found to be pretty good. 4\/5. The reason I am giving this restaurant five stars is because of the ambience and the service. Our server was Hannah, and she was great! The building is a refurbished art deco structure from the 1930s that has been turned into a modern hotel with a fairly hip lobby and nice bar. All in all, I would recommend this restaurant if you are downtown and want to grab a quality lunch.
