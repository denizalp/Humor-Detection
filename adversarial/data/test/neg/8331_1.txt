Unfortunately, my friends and I did not have a great experience here. We placed an order over the phone and when we arrived to pick up the order, the order was ready but not at all correct. We attempted to correct the order and waited nearly 40 minutes for our correct order...only to find out that yet again, our order was wrong. We waiting an additional 20 minutes for our correct order (finally). The women in the bar who was \"helping\" us was not very friendly nor did she apologize at all for the inconvenience. She simply stated \"we're busy\". I understand, places get busy and hectic but that is no excuse for poor customer service\/unwelcoming attitude. The food itself was not very appealing either. The cuts of the fish were old looking. Maybe a dine in experience would be better but I don't think I'll be coming back here to find out.
