I have been anxiously awaiting this opening and they did not disappoint! I don't think the decor could get any better, it is beautiful, and inviting. French music playing and French staff really make you feel like you're no longer in the financial district. Perfect timing as the outdoor terrace is also now open. \nToday it was pay what you wish as 100% of proceeds went to a local charity. The breads and pastries are made in house, hence the delectable smell when you walk in. \nI got a skim milk latte and croissant. I didn't know croissants could be so perfect. It was buttery but crispy and light! The latte is also perfect, it is balanced and rich, not weak. \nI do believe I have found my new favourite coffee and bakery spot. Cannot wait to try their rotational lunch menu. Je suis amoureuse!
