People at front office were very helpful and polite. I communicated with Ventura to choose an apartment and he was great in helping me get one according to my needs and budget. The location of the community is really good, close to ASU, close Safeway and CVS. Will be moving in soon in a 2B2B Apartment. Really looking forward to it.
