I found Simply Housekeeping when my construction company was in a bind and needed services after we completed a remodel for a very particular customer.  Rose was able to schedule me the very next day!  They arrived on time and made sure to ask all the questions pertaining to the job prior to starting so that she could charge accordingly.  The cleaning crew called me 30 minutes prior to leaving as I had requested and the house looked fantastic. I was nervous because the homeowner IS VERY meticulous and I was concerned that she would find something wrong.  I came into work the next day with an email from my homeowner praising our housekeeping team saying \"they are goddesses\"!!  I made sure to share the news with Rose so she could share that with her team.\n\nThe invoice process was also smooth and easy.\n\nWe will definitely use Simply Housekeeping in the future for all our construction clean up needs!  Thanks again Rose!
