I wish I could give more stars to this company.  Found a Diamond Back Rattler sitting outside our sliding glass patio doors at 11 pm Sunday night.  It was not a happy camper.  Hissing like crazy.  Went online to figure out what to and found Rattlesnake Solutions.  Tom was here within 30 minutes.  What an awesome guy!  He removed the snake in minutes.  Although I hope it never happens again, if it does, I will be calling them again for sure!!
