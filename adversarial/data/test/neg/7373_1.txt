Loved this small establishment! It was a bit difficult to find at first, but parking was easy to find. It was nice and cool inside, spacious and the employees were very friendly and quick to get out orders. I order the pineapple lush slushee and a mango diamond bar! Both were very flavorful and refreshing to enjoy in this AZ heat. Definitely recommend making a quick stop here!
