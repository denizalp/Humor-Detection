This Buffet Participates with Tix4Tonight (30%) and AAA (20%) discounts.\n\nThe Weekend Brunch seems to include basic Beer, Bloody Marry's, and Mimosas.\n\nThe food quality is just OK. The sushi tasted like it came from Vons (Costco sushi is better). Panda Express does better at their beef broccoli. The pizza looks like it is cooked in a fancy way, but they must have skimped on the ingredients because it does not taste anything special. They did not have seafood crackers for the crab claws. I had to go to the bar to get mimosa refills because the waiting staff was very slow at refills.\n\nI was also a little disappointed that there was no Crème brûlée at the dessert station; however, I must say I did love their chocolate bread pudding. \n\nOverall the food and service was just OK. Next time I am in Vegas, I will try a different buffet.
