Good food, fancy Cafe.\n\nSurprised of the bad reviews.  They had a good menu. Service was excellent. Portions were big.  They had ethnic foods on the menu to.  The waitress asked if we want to bill the room for the tab which was a first for me at 5am. Very attentive. Kind of fancy looking from the outside, prices are kind of steep but its the strip, and its the mirage, not imperial palace so worth it.
