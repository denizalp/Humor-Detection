My husband and I had the worst experience ever last Friday. Seats and cushions are filthy! Food, old stains, grimy! We waited for a very long time until somebody came to our table and took our order. We waited for even longer until the same person told us our food would arrive very soon. After 50 (FIFTY!) minutes, we just got up and left. This story has an even more interesting part than not trying the food at all, even though we were assured we were going to. When we were at the door, our waitress asked us if we had placed our order... What?! She knew we had and said they were very busy that day. They were busy, like normal lunch hour busy, but we're sure that's not the reason why we didn't get our food after 50 (FIFTY!) minutes.
