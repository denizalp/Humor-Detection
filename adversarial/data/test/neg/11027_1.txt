This place is absolutely AMAZING! My coworker and I stopped by on our lunch because we were craving Mediterranean food and were pleasantly surprised. The food was DELICIOUS and the staff was extremely kind and accommodating. We both will definitely be coming back...regularly! Be sure to order the grape leaves when you visit :)
