I was having lots of trouble with my washer not balancing loads. It was at the point that I couldn't wash more than a couple of shirts without the thing stopping every few minutes. The technician from Advanced \"Zach\" new exactly what to do! He had it fixed in no time and it didn't cost an arm and a leg. Highly recommended!
