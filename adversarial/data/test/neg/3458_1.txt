This place was pretty cool.  I got there pretty late (like 2ish) and unfortunately still had to pay $50 to get in, but if you're a guy in Vegas, you're probably expecting to pay about that much to get into most places anyway.  \n\nThe pool was pretty cool, and packed.  My friends had already found a spot to chill, but I'm not sure how difficult that was (it was a pain in the ass over at the MGM pool party).  There were plenty of people, and people-watching is... much more enjoyable at a pool, so even if you're just relaxing, you'll probably have a good time (though you might not enjoy the prices so much).  \nI don't remember exactly how much I paid for drinks, but I'd expect pretty standard Vegas prices (aka: expensive as fuck), so be prepared.\n\nOverall: A popular pool party with good music, but expect to spend a good amount if you wanna get drunk there.
