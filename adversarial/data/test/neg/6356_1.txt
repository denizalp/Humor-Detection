Came in to grab a fast bite to eat before I go to work. Kelly was great! She greeted me and took my order. Best part, she had a smile. Once I got my food and sat down, I notice there was no music playing. So it felt weird eating my food in a quiet area with other people around. Also hearing them eat their food. Not only that, you can hear all the employees in the back of the house talking about their personal life. So because of that, my satisfaction during my time here was not okay. Other than that, the food was great.
