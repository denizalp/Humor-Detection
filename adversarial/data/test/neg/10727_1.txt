I'm kind of split on Lulu. I'm leaning towards 4 because i see the potential but think i have to give it three.  I wish yelp had .5's.  The calamari was top notch a total 5.    My wife's bucatini was decent, but not great- it was a little bland. she has had it before, and said was much better so i feel consistancy could be a problem.  I had the salad Nicoise it was flavorful, and the tuna was cooked just right, but i was left looking at a very small portion for what i think was an inflated  priced of $17.   \n\nLoved the actual building its very homelike and the french dude with the mustache was helpful and sincire.  However, our server was new and you could tell. She was not rude just still had her training wheels.   My wife tells me ( she has been here more than me) that the others servers are fantastic, so im sure  she will either rise to that level or be gone. \n\nI think its a solid 3.5 but ill give it a four, since my wife has eaten there fairly often and says our meal was more the exeception than what she has come to see as the norm.
