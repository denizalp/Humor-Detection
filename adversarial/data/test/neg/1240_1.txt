I agree with the other poster who said their rating is probably influenced by nostalgia.  I love Ru San's.  It was my first sushi experience ever and still remains my favorite.  \n\nHowever the prices have crept up over the years to where it's not really the value it once was.  Also some of my favorite menu items have disappeared such as the Ginger Simmered Beef Maki leaving me with less choices when I go.\n\nStill it's a great choice for sushi in Charlotte.  Just be prepared to wait if you come during the weekend as it's usually busy!
