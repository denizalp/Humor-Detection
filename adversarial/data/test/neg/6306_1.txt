I would not suggest living here, to anyone! \n\nI have been living in a two bed, one bath for the last year. Since then, I have experienced rude management, and awful maintenance repairs. Whenever I have a question or concern, the front office, (mostly the manager) is always in a judgmental attitude and usually makes me feel stupid for bringing something up. If I miss something on the flyers that they post on our doors, she will point out that I messed up. I have brought complaints, concerns and questions to her, and I have never felt satisfied with an answer or result. \nExample: The lighting around the green building is out. Every light in the parking lot and stairways are not working, and havent been working for the last year. I have brought this to their attention, especially because I am a girl in my early 20s and I feel unsafe walking in the dark parking lot, and up the dark stairway to my apartment if it is late at night. They have not made an attempt to fix any of the lights for the entire time I have lived here. \n\nMaintenance is AWFUL!!!! (especially for the green and orange building.) The maintenance office is in between the two buildings and are always so loud. They have no consideration for residents as they are yelling to each other at 7 in the morning. The lead maintenance guy, Tom, is extremely rude and does an awful job at repairs. \nExample 1: My front door had spaces within the door connecting to the wall. I called a work order in because it was letting the air conditioning out, and letting hot air in. The first time they came to fix it, they did a half ass job, and had the weather stripping attached to the front surface, instead of the cracks where it was actually needed. I called again to let them know that the problem had not been fixed, so the second time they came out, they put so much in between the cracks that it is extremely difficult to open my front door. I have to pull all my body weight to unlock the door from the outside, and press my body against the inside to lock it. \nExample 2: A water pipe line burst in the complex and resulted in them shutting the water off for 6+ hours. They did not notify\/warn any of the residents of the emergency and many residents had to call in to ask why their water was shut off. \nExample 3: It is 7 in the morning right now, and they are doing work on the roof, right now. Their loud voices and stomping feet make it impossible to sleep. They have no consideration towards the time and residents sleeping in the area.\n\nThe apartment space is nice. The bathrooms are very small though, and there is only two cabinets for storage of food. Which means that there is very little storage in the kitchen and bathroom as well. The shower is made of cheap plastic and the base shell feels like it could rip off the walls. There are no lights in the living room so it is important that you buy large lamps in order to have light in the living room. There are only two outlets in the kitchen, which makes it hard to plug in appliances.The bathroom has a round mirror, which seems cute, but provides a small window for getting ready in. There is almost no counter space, only room for your tooth brush and soap. The doors stick a lot, so when opening and closing doors it makes a very loud noise which makes it hard to be quiet late at night or early in the morning. The walls are extremely thin and makes it easy to hear conversations in the parking lot and neighboring apartments. \n\nI would highly suggest looking at other complexes. It may seem cute and affordable but the service is awful and has ruined my experience here. I will not be resigning my lease. \n\nI wish you luck on your search.
