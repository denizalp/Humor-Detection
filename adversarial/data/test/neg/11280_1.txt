This place is just a typical dive bar if you are looking for a place to sit down and chill that doesn't get too crowded. There are pool tables here which is cool if your into that. I usually just get beer when I'm here. You can smoke in the bar which gets annoying for people who don't smoke. Other than that it's a decent spot if you just want to chill.
