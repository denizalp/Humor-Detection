I call myself the \"Cupcake Connoisseur,\" having already visited 10 cupcake stores during my travels this summer.  Staying with my folks in Vegas - researched new cupcake bakeries in the valley.  \n\nI purchased five cupcakes:  Cake Batter, Root Beer Float, S'Mores, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough (for me), and some type of Snickers cupcake.\n\nMy CCCD cupcake was DELICIOUS!!!!  However, the cupcakes (altogether) are a tad dry, and everyone's frosting kept falling off with each bite (made for a messy snack).\n\nThe store is cute enough, and the lady who helped me was very nice.\n\nHowever, my only suggestion (besides moistening the cupcakes), is that the owner should consider typing-up her cupcake labels.  They were hand-written (and looked like a school bake sale).  This is a bona-fide, professional establishment, and the labeling should resemble that.
