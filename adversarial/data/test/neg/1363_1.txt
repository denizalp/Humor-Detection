Although it's nice to have a place to go do ceramics, the cost per piece is greatly inflated and they don't give you time to do a nice job in a reasonable timeframe. Also the lighting is TERRIBLE and it was difficult to see the piece to do a good job with shadows in all directions obscuring the piece.   Then you're told to go home but you can come back another time ???? Hummmm!
