I felt bad as we were those customers that came in 15 minutes before the kitchen closed. And I wish we could have stayed for hours! I loved the modern decor and the service was excellent! They didn't begrudge our late arrival and even kept my boyfriend's plate under a hot light when he went to the restroom. The gnocchi was so creamy and and the duck absolutely succulent. A perfect combination and just the right amount of food. I also appreciated the sommelier's effort in pointing us to dinner wine options.
