I took my 19-month-old twins to Jambo today for the first time and we had a fantastic time!  We are vacationing in Phoenix for a few days and picked up the Groupon which is how we found out about this place.  We will definitely come back to Jambo during our annual Phoenix trips.\n\nI'm glad we went on a Monday morning--it was just us and a couple other kids there.  No lines which was good for my very young boys.  They weren't big enough to ride most of the rides, but we had a great time on the Safari Train and the robotic animals.  They spent a little time in the soft play area, but they had more fun throwing golf balls around the mini golf holes than anything.\n\nMy husband and father-in-law played mini golf and really enjoyed the course.  We didn't have food there so I can't speak to that.  But I will say that all of the staff members were super nice and helpful.  We stayed for nearly two hours--usually about an hour or so is the limit of my boys so I was particularly pleased to have them entertained that long.\n\nI highly recommend Jambo for the under-8 crew especially, even the little tiny guys!
