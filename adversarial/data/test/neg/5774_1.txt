We had breakfast at Hazels because the other restaurants in the are were not open.  In the future, I will wait to eat rather than go to Hazel's again.  The eggs Benedict were definitely below par with a very globy dose of hollandaise sauce.  The potatoes were average and the Americano was poor.  I would not return.
