I had my first appointment with Janette last night at Wicked Pixie! I called and left a message, and Janette called me back quickly to schedule my appointment. She is very flexible and scheduled me for the next afternoon. As a breastfeeding mother to a newborn, it's pretty difficult to find a salon and stylist that will accommodate me. She made me feel very comfortable and welcomed!  \nI've been a highlighted blonde for a long time, and she got the color spot on! She spent over 3 hours perfecting my color and cut. I felt like she really took her time, unlike some of the other stylist I've visited in the valley. My experiences here in the valley have never led me to set up my next appointment, but with Janette I've already scheduled my next appointment. Her prices are extremely affordable. The color, cut, and service was better than the expensive salons in the valley.\nYou will not be disappointed when you schedule with Janette!
