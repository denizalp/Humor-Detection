I drank the Dill Caesar and ate the Cowboy Eggs Benedict.\n\nDill Caesar (5\/5): a good Caesar should punch you in the face with flavour and, like a good punch, leave a lasting impression.  This Dill Caesar is one of the best Caesars I've tried. If you have ever mixed dill pickle and ketchup chips, or if you have ever had dill pickle ketchup, you can already guess how well Clamato and dill go together: the answer is very. A perfect amount of spice, topped with a fantastic deep-fried pickle (thin, crisp batter covering a juicy pickle). Flavourful and not too salty. Well done!\n\nCowboy Benny (4\/5): the eggs were cooked just right over a healthy portion of beef brisket. The brisket was tender, if not melt-in-your-mouth tender. The sweetness of the buttermilk biscuits (instead of English muffin) was a nice compliment to the brisket.  Came with two potato latkes on the side - these were excellent, crispy at the edges and soft in the middle with a nice balance of onion and potato flavour - a welcome twist on traditional breakfast potatoes: nothing fancy, just good latkes.\n\nAmbiance (3\/5): small, clean room with friendly staff who were knowledgeable about the food. The ambiance met expectations. The washrooms were not dirty though not clean like a good hotel washroom either.\n\nBottom line: I would come here and again and recommend to friends living within a 20 minute walk radius. Try the Dill Caesar!
