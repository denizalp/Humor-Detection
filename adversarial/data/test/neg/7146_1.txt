My family and I just got home a couple of hours ago and I gotta say - we had a BLAST at Stu Millers Pumpkin Patch. Maybe its because we werent expecting all that much but still I have to give them props for having all the pumpkins laid out the way they did. It just made it feel so cool walking around and there was just the right amount of attractions to keep the kids entertained.\n\nId have to disagree with others' comments about bad service, almost any ride\/attraction I brought my kids to had an attendant on hand ready to accept tickets. That was really all they did and my kids zipped through the slides and the little jungle gym course on their own! The rotating swings wasnt of much interest to them lol. They preferred the  huge slides.\n\nTo top it all off, my 2 oldest kids thoroughly enjoyed their trampoline bungie jump (for the record it was way more than 90 seconds, more like 5 minutes or so!). It was a little pricey at 9 tickets = $8 but it was worth it seeing their smiles and a little bit of nervousness, even though it was only 1 time each haha. In total we spent about $45 in tickets (and socks, dont forget socks or else kids cant ride the slides)  and $15 for a large pumpkin (guy who helped me pick out the pumpkin was real courteous by the way, took the pumpkin all the way to the car for me! Thanks bro!!). It came out to about $60 total tonight to be at Stu Millers Pumpkin Patch... but it was a priceless experience with the family. :-D
