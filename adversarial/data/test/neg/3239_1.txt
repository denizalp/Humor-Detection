I've been to Scarborough Town Centre several times.  I'm usually there for the Moxie's restaurant.\n\nIt is a good mall with lots of stores, restaurants and a theatre.\n\nIt's close to the highway and there is also public transit nearby.\n\nIt's laid out well, and there is a lot of parking.  Plan to go early, the parking lot is usually very full in certain areas.  Plan on walking a good distance and time to drive around and look for parking spots.\n\nToronto is a big city with lots of people. If you like being around people, a lot of people, than this is a good place to go.\n\nI'm not a big fan of being around a lot of people, or taking a lot of time to find a parking spot, or walking long distances to get where I need to go.  So, for me, I go sparingly, but I do like the variety of restaurants there, so I'm there from time to time.  ;)
