The place is swank, with its cool lights and awesome conversion of the outside pool area. But the DJ was pretty bad and the drinks were pretty pricey  ($22 for a redbull vodka) so I can't say that I was really feeling it that night. But it wasn't super crowded and there was plenty of room to talk outside so I guess it was good for just chillin. Oh and the outside blackjack and craps tables were a definite plus. If I had to do it over again though, I'd go back to XS or check out Hakkasan.
