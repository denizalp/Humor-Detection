This place is amazing. The staff is amazing and the food. We have been to another Capriottis around town and had some rude service once but this one is great. \nWe usually get the Bobbi. It's turkey, with stuffing, mayo and cranberry sauce. Pretty much just perfect. \nSo if you haven't tried it please do!
