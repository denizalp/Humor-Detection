Ate here last Friday night. As everyone knows, I am a pizza junkie. This place was great. We had excellent pizza. The dine in area is small but we had a short wait for a table.  Wait staff super friendly and helpful with menu. Wine was good and pizza was hot and crust baked perfectly. Love this place. Just sorry we were visiting family and live states away. If able, this would definitely be my \"go to \" pizza place.
