What a disappointment!  I made reservations to take my mom and my daughter to Stella to celebrate Mother's Day. The restaurant called to confirm my reservation yesterday and we were all looking forward to a nice brunch...then we arrived at the restaurant. \nWhen we checked in, the hostess gave me a strange look and told me it would be a few minutes while she checked to see what she had available. This seemed strange since we had a reservation, but ok. She came back and said we could either sit on the patio (it's a hot Phoenix day) that provides absolute zero shade, or we could \"squeeze\" into a small table in the back (was actually a table for 2 and we had 3 adults) or we could sit at a large communal looking high top in the bar area.  They had music playing in the bar that was needlessly loud. My mother could not hear a word we said. When I asked the hostess why they didn't have a table for our reservation she said the reservation system wasn't setup correctly and had double booked the restaurant. I mentioned that the restaurant had called me yesterday to confirm and this was not mentioned. We could have modified our reservation yesterday if they had said something. She then told me that they had had several walk-in's and she had tried to \"save\" tables for reservations but took the walk-ins instead. Not sure what kind of customer service this provides. We ultimately decided to leave and go somewhere else to celebrate because we didn't want to sweat outside, squeeze into a table for 2 and actually wanted to be able to talk during brunch. The hostess didn't apologize or even offer a happy Mother's Day as we left. Didn't seem to upset to see us go!  It's too bad the restaurant is run so poorly!\nOh on a side note, as we left the restaurant I went onto Open Table to see where we could get last minute reservations since our reservations at Stella weren't honored. Imagine my surprise to see they were still accepting reservations for right now!  Reservation system can't be closed even when they won't honor the reservation?  What a scam!
