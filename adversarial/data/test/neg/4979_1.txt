This is a great way to receive affordable treatment - Ash is amazing. I love the community aspect. I bring my own earplugs to avoid any extra disturbances. I find immediate relief from the usual anxiety or common cold symptoms that I bring with me. Each acupuncturist is very skilled at what they do, each with their own style and highly professional as well.
