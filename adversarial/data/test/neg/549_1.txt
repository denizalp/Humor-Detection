My husband and I stayed year just over a year ago and are planning to stay here again next month. We stayed in the V Suite and it was absolutely beautiful and spacious.\n\nThe biggest issue we had (and we hope to not have again) is the check in. It started out with us being sent back and forth between the Mandalay Bay and THEhotel. We went to check in and our room was \"being cleaned\" and we would receive a call when it was ready. Three hours went by and no call. We went back to the front desk and he said its been ready for quite some time. We were upset because we drove hours and were exhausted. I felt we should have gotten something complimentary or an upgrade...something. We never even got an apology. This is why I gave it 4 stars. If we would have been taken care of or even a got a sorry....totally would've gave 5 stars.\n\nAs far as that, the doorman was amazing and so was housekeeping. I really enjoyed the stores, pool, and our favorite Fat Tuesdays :) The beauty of the hotel and the comfort is what is bringing us back. Customer service is huge in my decision making when booking hotels. So because I love the hotel itself, I'm giving it another chance. I will be staying 5 days this time around and I'm looking forward to it! I will definitely update this review.
