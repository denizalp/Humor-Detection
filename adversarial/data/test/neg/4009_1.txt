Service was super slow and they got half of my order wrong.  When tacos came out 40 minutes later they were really good, but they had my sides wrong. They made it right by bringing out the correct side to me 5 minutes later.  The place and the logo is really cool but once you're inside it is kinda lame.  The waitresses are all hot and in skimpy outfits, but it just doesn't have a fun vibe.  Food overall was good though.
