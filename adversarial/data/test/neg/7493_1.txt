I was recently in Vegas for a week for business, and found myself needing to do lunch on the first day there. I have a thing about hotel food (don't), so I yelped to see what was around.  And lo and behold....RIGHT across the street from the Aria shows a Fatburger!  Hadn't eaten at one of these since I moved from LA, so off I went.\n\nTypical setup - stand in line to order, get a #, go sit and wait.  But....the ordering....ahh.....first, a REAL burger, cooked to your specs.  Choice of size.  Choice of REAL cheese.  Choice of bacon.  Choice after choice after choice.  You know...like a REAL burger place (kinda knocks In-N-Out out of the category). \n\nOrdered the basic burger w\/swiss and bacon (I know, I know...that's so unlike me...(cough)), along with a small fries and a diet coke.\n\nReceived my meal about ten minutes later...and it was JUST like I remembered them...divine.  Definitely recommended!!
