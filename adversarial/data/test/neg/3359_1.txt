Got a recommendation form a friend of a friend of a friend.  You know how those work out, well this one worked out great.  \n\nPrompt, friendly, professional service.  Called because I had a problem at my primary residence and have since had both of my rental properties served as well.  Office staff is very friendly too.  Felt as if I was dealing with neighbors.  Thanks to all at Dukes of Air.
