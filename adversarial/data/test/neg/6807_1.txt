I scream for Graeter's Ice Cream! We stopped at Graeter's on Thursday night after enjoying dinner at Firebirds. We walked right upto the counter without any wait :) \n\nAriel waited on our party. She was so helpful with great recommendations. I tried a bunch of flavors and picked out the Seasonal Peach in a waffle cone. It had large slices of peach throughout. Yum!\n\nBrooke rang out us out at the cashier. I also took home Black Cherry Chocolate Chip. She grabbed me extra cones because I didn't want an 8-pack. Awesome Customer Service! \n\nI cannot wait to come back soon to try Watermelon Sorbet!
