My 8 yr old daughter needed an Ortho eval and I was nervous about her having braces too soon.  That seems to be the trend right now with 7-9 yr olds getting braces.  Although I'm sure it is sometimes necessary, due to alignment and bite issues, I also don't want to be a part of an unnecessary \"fad\".  Dr. Santucci was VERY thorough.  I was extremely impressed with him explaining everything he was observing, why, what it means, etc.  I really appreciated his \"conservative\" opinion and suggesting that we wait 2-3 years for her mouth to grow more, when braces will be more beneficial long term.  He also suggested that she has another eval in 1 year to see how her mouth is looking.  He does not charge for the evaluation and does not make you feel rushed or that you are wasting his time.  The staff was also very friendly and helpful.  I would HIGHLY recommend Dr. Santucci!!!!
