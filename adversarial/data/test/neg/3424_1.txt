Love!  Although I've only made it here for breakfast or brunch this is a place with awesome food, a cool environment and a real sense of community.  Love the idea of putting a small sign on your table if you are willing to share the space with another diner.  In a world where we are all disconnected, texting and barely making eye contact this is a wild and crazy idea that works.  They create great food with fresh ingredients, locally sourced when they are able (yay!).  I always love what I order yet I'm also looking longingly at what others are served and resolved to order that on my next visit. A gem in our community!
