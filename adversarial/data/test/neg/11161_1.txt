Love their coffee.\nThey need to add help in the morning.\nWith all the moms and high school kids ordering double latte whatever's there is a line to the door from 7:45 to 9:00.\nI'm not going to wait for ten minutes for a cup of plain coffee.\nUsually buy beans there and make at home. But now when I want to stop in to grab a cup to go, I go elsewherel\nThey should have someone who only takes straight coffe orders. They would get more business.
