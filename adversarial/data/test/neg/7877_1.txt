Bland, bland, bland. I had thought that there was no place more gringo than Matas. I was wrong.\n\nContinuation: As I was paying my bill, the woman at the register asked how I liked my lunch. I was honest and told her it wasn't my favorite. The food had been very bland. (I ate less than half of the small tostada I had ordered.) She said that she was sorry that I hadn't liked my meal. I told her not to worry too much about it, I just wanted to pay and be on my way. She returned my money and said that she wouldn't charge me for a meal I hadn't enjoyed. I appreciate her doing that. I left a tip for my server and was gone.\nIt's sad because this used to be one of our go to places. My husband and I were there for this location's grand opening some 30 years ago. (The cook quit on opening night and it took forever for the food to come to the table.) Sadly, I was reminded today of why we stopped eating there.
