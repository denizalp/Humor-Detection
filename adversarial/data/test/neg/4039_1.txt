This is a new place. For an Izakaya, the menu is extremely limited. No dish with raw fish for example. \n\nThere is a nice couch section area on the middle that makes it quiet convenient for large groups. \n\nThe chef is not japanese, which is a tad disappointing.\n\nYet all in all, the food is actually not bad at all.\n\nI would give it a 3 and 1\/2 stars, but since the establishment is new, i will bump it to 4 for now. Definitely has potential
