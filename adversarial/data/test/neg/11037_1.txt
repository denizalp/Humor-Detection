My suburban was acting strangely after a trip to San Diego so I took it in to Sun Devil Auto. The mechanics there told me that the engine head was cracked and needed to be fixed right away or I would be in for a world of problems; cost: $2500. I called my boyfriend and he said drive it home and he'd call his mobile mechanic, Marshall, to look at it. Marshall came out the next day and told us there were a few things to be fixed; cost: $500. No crack in the engine head, no immediate problems. Wow! \n\nThen he joined Auto Techs where I met James and Kelly. These 3 guys are so honest and trustworthy that I drive 30 minutes for them to work exclusively on my vehicles. Recently, my airconditioner went out, and they tried all kinds of things, ordered in different parts - nothing worked. So Marshall told me to give him a day or two to do more research and he'd figure it out. Well, he figured it out! It was a minor fix in the electrical wiring which was affected by an oil leak that I'd had the week before. Cost for all his time and energy and work: minimal.\n\nThese guys are like my brothers now....I know they will always take care of me!
