It will never be a good review when a place gives you food poisoning. \n\nWent for late brunch on the Sunday of a holiday weekend. Champagne was offered, but as I looked around people were taking a sip, putting it down, and not asking for re-fills so it must have been less than fabulous.\n\nFood wasn't great, but the after-effects were even worse. Service wasn't bad at all, but the complete lack of any line, after we walked away from Paris due to a wait of over an hour, should have been a clue. \n\nI will never darken their doorway again!
