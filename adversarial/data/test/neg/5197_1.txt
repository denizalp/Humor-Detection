This place is perfect to bring a date, the atmosphere is very cozy and the service is top notch, now talking about the food it is really good, great portions, but in my opinion they could do better if they wanted to, this is probably one of the restaurants i came to many time since i been living in toronto. I think its worth a try if you love italian cuisine.
