I've tried a bunch of different locations and they each have their own vibe. I prefer the sports bar vibe in N Versailles over the family restaurant vibe that some of the other locations possess. Primantis' is great for watching the game, drinking cold beer and eating their famous sandwiches. If you order an entree then you're missing the whole reason why Primanti Bros is famous! Order the piled high Roast Beef with tomato, fries and slaw and enjoy one of the best sandwiches you'll ever have!
