Border Grill is a must when visiting Las Vegas. Reservations are recommended especially during holidays and conventions. The restaurant is clean and services excellent. \n\nAt the top of our list of must have's are the Grilled Skirt Steak and their Shrimp entree (don't remember the name). The steak is cooked to perfection and the shrimp are always tender, never over cooked or over spiced. If you are like me too much salt is a bad thing. The Chef will not add salt to your dish if you ask. No problems there.\n\nThe three sample salsa & chip dish they give you is the best. The guacamole is also a must have. Always fresh and tasty.
