This place was fantastic! Our waitress Kayla was so personable and gave us the ins and outs of the menu, what's the best deal, and her personal favorites! We actually ordered way too much food but it was amazing! Keep in mind the portions are pretty decently sized. We ordered the Greek skillet with a side of bacon banana crepes, and the Barbacoa omelet with a side of pumpkin cheesecake pancakes! The sides are full portions yall haha we also got a mimosas and booze iced coffee... their bar tender is a little new so if you're trying to get wrecked on a Wednesday shes got you covered haha
