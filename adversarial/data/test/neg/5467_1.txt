The sushi was great! I totally recommend the bluefin toro! I had the omakase, sever suggestion, and mentioned that I like toro and got a lot of it! My favorite are the seared pieces! My only advice is, to make sure you really like sushi! The fish pieces are quite big and if you are the person that is ok but doesn't love it, you will be in trouble!
