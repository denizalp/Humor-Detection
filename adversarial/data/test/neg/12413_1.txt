Having taken several trips to Vegas in the last few years, the Venetian by far is my favorite overall hotel experience.  The rooms are all suites; the building connects with what I believe is the best  group of shops you'll find on the strip; the building also connects all the way over to the Palazzo. You could (and we did) spend three (3) hours simply walking, taking in the sights, and not see all that the hotel and shops have to offer in the Venetian.  \n\nThe room: \nAgain, the rooms are all suites.  I booked a King Suite, and was pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to a room with a premium view.  Seeing as we stayed almost a week, this would have run us an additional $50 a day (approximately).  The room was beautiful, and definitely worth the money.  The only downside to our trip was the room upon arrival.  Someone had left half eaten food and small piles of trash\/refuse around the room, and the bed was slightly disheveled.  It almost looked as if some of the staff had used the suit as a break room and forgotten to clean it up.  However, seeing as it was nearly 9pm, it was hard to understand how it was still dirty.  We contacted the desk and room service; both of whom seemed puzzled by our report, and wanted us to solve the problem.  Both asked, \"what would you like us to do\"?  You'd think the response would be something along the lines of an apology, and an immediate remedy, but such was not the case.  It was up to us to figure it out, and neither the desk or housekeeping was going to make any decision.  If you've ever stayed in a large Vegas hotel, you know it can take 7-10 minutes just to get to your room.  So even if we wanted another room, did we really want to come down from the 25th floor, walk all the way back down to the escalator, then back down to the main floor, and across the casino.. having already tipped our doorman who brought up all of our luggage?  Or simply have them come clean the room immediately?  We opted for immediate cleaning, although immediate was 45 minutes later.  To be fair, after my second call to the desk after a 1\/2 hour wait, the desk told me they should have warned me it would take approximately 40 minutes for a response to my room.  Overall, that was my only gripe, and to be honest it was highly unacceptable for such a fine establishment.  But we refused to let it ruin our vacation, especially from the start.  \n\nAgain, overall we had a very pleasant stay.  But it was not the best start.  However, unless that sort of thing is regular (which I highly doubt) I would recommend the Venetian as one of the top picks on the strip; at least for those looking for a more luxurious and adult set up.  Don't get me wrong, there's is plenty for a family, but I mean \"adult\" as in you aren't staying in some pirates or medieval themed room or casino.  This one is tastefully designed with an Italian inspiration and flavor.  \n\nP.S.\n\nShould you so desire, the YardBird, located very close to the rooms, was a fantastic gourmet take on Southern Food and completely unexpected.
