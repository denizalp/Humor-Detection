I've visited here before, but we recently had a group of about 12 people for dinner and they accommodated us nicely. Our sever was very friendly and funny, he took great care of us during our dining experience. The food has always been fresh and everyone said they enjoyed their meal. It wasn't too busy, but our food came out within a reasonable amount of time. I normally order their fajita steak tacos and they were very good, like usual. The chips and salsa never ran out and we ordered queso to go with our chips. The portions and pricing are good and many of us had leftovers.
