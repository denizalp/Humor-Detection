We began our meal with the famous chopped salad, which easily met our high expectations. My date didn't care for her cocktail -- too heavy on the bitters for her -- but my Moscow Mule was excellent. She loved her scallops, and my meatloaf was pretty good.\n\nThe service was excellent. Our waiter was friendly, attentive, and knowledgable. Couldn't ask for more. We went early in the week, and the restaurant was active but not overly busy. The ambiance was perfect for a dinner date.
