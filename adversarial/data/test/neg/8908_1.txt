So i'm writing this partly because it was a nice ass hotel, but mostly to relive my weekend that i experience here 2 weeks ago. \n\nour group of 14 booked 3 rooms in the Venezia tower Bella Suite, (try to get your room right by the elevator so you don't have to walk a mile to get to your room. extremely helpful when your drunk at 6am trying to find your way back to your room cus its like a maze in there).\n\nso anyways 2 queens and a pull out couch, very spacious, high ceilings, duel sinks, ran us about 180 a night, booked a package so it might have been a little cheaper? \n\nif you plan on going to TAO, go there earlier and talk to a promoter whos usually outside, but if your ratio isn't that great then i'm not too sure because we had 8 girls and 6 guys. but we got in for free and only had to wait maybe 5-10 minutes in one of the 13 lines they had. \n\nSo again, great location, right next to Wynn, i'll probably be staying at the Venetian from now on, i mean you're in Vegas, do it right or don't do it at all. see you guys there.
