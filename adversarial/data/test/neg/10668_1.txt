Great service, very helpful and friendly staff. However if I had to sum up the burrito I got in one word: bland. It was full, don't get me wrong (steak, shredded chicken, lettuce tomatoes beans cheese) but it tasted like different temperature \"stuff\". No spiced or flavor at all. I got the mild and medium sauces and they made it much much better.
