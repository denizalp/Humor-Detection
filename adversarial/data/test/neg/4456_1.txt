First time and pretty impressed!the best ceaser salad ever great texture and the cold fork is an important detail! I ordered the Chilean seabass which was cooked to perfection, and husband ordered the I forgot what steak, but it was amazing with the Cabernet butter! Cream brûlée was exceptional not to sweet not too custards but just right to share with a cappuccino and cinnamon stick
