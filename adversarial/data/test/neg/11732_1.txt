Patsy's Place is you would call a \"staple\" in my \"need to visit\" places when I return to Pittsburgh. The food is always fantastic, the atmosphere is delightful, and the best part is how \"home-y\" it feels inside (I think this has a lot to do with the people they have working there)! It's a great place to grab breakfast (my favorite is the Hungry Man), lunch, or dinner (the pizza is the BOMB, and their constantly rotating dinner specials will satisfy even the pickiest of eaters). If you're looking for a delicious, made-to-order meal without the crazy cost of eating out that we're so accustomed to nowadays, this is the place to go! Can't recommend it enough, would give them 10 stars if I could!\n\nThank you Patsy's Place for satisfying my cravings for the food I grew up eating, in the place that is notorious for its good eats! \n\nWhy are you still reading this when you could be ordering take-out?! \n\nCheers!
