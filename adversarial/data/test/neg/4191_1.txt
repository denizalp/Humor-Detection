Awww man, we were looking forward to the grand opening of this place because we would go to it often back home but unfortunately we're left disappointed with the food and service.\n\nOur order was wrong and the incorrect  food was brought to our table twice before they finally got the order right. The food was tasteless, small, very small portions and cold. My husband did not receive his order until the rest of my family had already eaten.
