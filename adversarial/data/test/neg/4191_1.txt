I really enjoy the Cheesecake Factory and for more than just their cheesecake. They food is pretty consistent flavor is usually there and great. My only dislike about this place is the lighting. It can tend to be really dark inside during dinner service. I don't know if it is to set a mood, but having to use your phone to see the menu is never a good look.
