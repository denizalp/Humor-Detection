Outstanding fresh baked goods!!\n\nWe had a nice friendly lady who helped us out at this bakery around 4pm.  My mom and I stopped in to check it out.\n\nAll the cookies were light and crisp, not greasy at all.  The snowball was like 2 cake donuts squished together with frosting and then covered in coconut!!!!!! (Insert heart eyes emoji here.)
