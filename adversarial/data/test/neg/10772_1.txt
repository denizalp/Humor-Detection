Had the friendliest server and the quickest service of anywhere I've dined on the strip. Got a wrap and fries, both very yummy. Drinks are served in mason jars, which I found adorable.  Live country band playing during dinner\/late night which made it hard to chat, but you obviously know you're getting into that when you enter. With as pricey as most places here are for subpar food, Toby Keith's far surpassed my expectations.
