I went here because it's about a half mile from my house and next to my fiancée work so I walked there in 100 degree weather and told the cashier and other employees I'm picking up dinner for myself and my fiancée and she wanted a Milk shake and they instantly gave me the milkshake while I waited almost 45 minutes for the the food and it was melted as they were bagged together although they ran my credit card was ran twice because I wanted them separate she hands the burgers back to the cook and they opened them back up to and dissected and ended up all over the bag because they were thrown in like my bag it was a garbage can or something appearntly because the wrapper was sitting in there like a wet napkin and they still couldn't get the burgers correct and mind you I'd totally understand but the Houston burger has jalapeño so that would be a dead give away but as this complaint is going on going and on and I never make resturaunt complaints but the icing on the cake is my burger was missing a patty and had tomatoes on it which is lovely because I spent 40 dollars and I'm alergic to tomatoes so instead of walking another mile to fix it I went with out dinner so thanks soo much for their horrible service and lack of communication from their staff staff never again..
