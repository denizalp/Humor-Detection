Wow!  I have always dreamt of sitting down at an honest ramen counter and I finally got to do it!  They make their own noodles, which are perfection.  You can watch them time the eggs, which are cooked to precision.  The service was superb.  The menu is simple and straightforward, with add ons available for any of the bowls.  I got the shio with chicken instead of pork.  It was so fresh and so nourishing.  Just as a warning, there is no hot tea.  The tea they have is cold and in a can; I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it.  The price is insanely inexpensive.  Really, one of the best meals I have had in a while.
