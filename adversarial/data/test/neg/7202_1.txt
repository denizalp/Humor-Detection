Tired and hungry, this was our last stop. Last night in Vegas and we ordered just before the kitchen did last call. \n\nIt was amazing. We loved every bite. \n\nWarm biscuits - heaven. Chicken n Waffles n Watermellon - amazing. Chicken n Biscuit - more heaven. Brussel sprouts - magically delicious!!! I slathered butter on my biscuit and it tasted so so good. I dream about this food. \n\nI wanted to eat everything on the menu but was full, no time, the kitchen closed. \n\nI will come here again and continue to eat and eat.\n\nIt is nice inside too - cozy and dim lighting. Good service. Friendly. I wish I could eat there right at this very moment. But I am not in town and am on a diet.
