Yummy yummy in my tummy. Saw high praise for this place on yelp and happy to have finally tried it. The Indian food I had was outstanding and as a man of Indian descent, I consider myself an expert in the matter. \n\nGoing against my carnivorous instincts, I ordered the palak paneer off the vegetarian entree list. I had a hankering for some cubes of cheese and this dish exceeded my expectations. The palak or spinach curry was deliciously rich and creamy. Definitely not for those on a diet or counting calories - you could see the cream just from the light green color of the curry - but damn it was fantastic.\n\nTrump's Taste of Kerala and Tandul in terms of taste. Will be back here again.
