I ate at the Crocker Park location again last night.  This is becoming a weekly habit.  I got my usual \"build your own burger\"...Bacon, Grilled Onions, and White American Cheese.  I also ordered s side of fries and enjoyed some crackilins.  Perfecto!  Some of us have a favorite burger spot and this is mine.  The staff are friendly and knowledgeable and there doesn't seem to be much turnover at the bar which is where I sit.  There is a solid beer selection and Seasonal draft rotation.  Happy hour draft beer is $3.00 and fries are $1.00.   The fries have a little rosemary on them which I didn't like at first but now they're my favorite fries.  I highly recommended trying it.  It's worth the trip and if you're already at Crocker Park and hungry The B Spot  is a no-brainer.
