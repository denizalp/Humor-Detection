I have been bringing my son and daughter to Just For Kids since 2007. Dr. Abrams is wonderful with both of my kids, she is such a sweetheart! In fact, I wish Dr. Abrams could be my dentist! \nBut, I think their secret weapon is Sam! He always remembers my kids and he is always so personable with them! On my kids first ever visit  to JFK, Sam gave each of my kids silly little nicknames; \"M&M\" and \"Big E\", and he knows them each and every time they walk through the door to this day! But it's not just my kids, it's all the kids that go there! Sam makes them feel at ease and they instantly relax, which has been a huge help for me, because my kids have had a lot of treatment done and they haven't always been the best patients. Yet as soon as they walk in and they see Sam, they always know it's going to be okay!\n\nJFK recently updated the office and they have iPads for the kids to play on while they are waiting which is nice. As for waiting a long time, it depends on what we are there for.... I haven't really ever waited too long for x-rays or checkups, for those we are usually in and out. As for treatments, those do take longer, but that is because we have to wait an hour for the meds to kick in. However after that hour is up and we are called back, it goes super fast! They are very quick once the kids are in the chair! \n\nAll in all I think JFK is a great place for kids. They have a very friendly staff too. The hygienist is super nice and the assistants are all great too! I have never had a problem with any of them. They also always call me to see how my kids are doing in the evening after my kids have had treatment done. They really seem to care about their patients here.
