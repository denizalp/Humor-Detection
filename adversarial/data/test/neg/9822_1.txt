Worst Pharmacy EVER!!   My doctor sent a prescription for an antiobiotic to this pharmacy on Thursday.  When I went to pick it up, they said they hadn't received the order.  SO....I called my doctor's office on Friday morning and they re-sent the prescription plus called the pharmacy to verify that it was received.  When I again went to pick it up on Friday, they said they didn't have it.  The pharmacist was very unconcerned and told the clerk in passing that he hadn't received any calls or voicemails; he just moved on to someone else.  \n\nMonday, I asked my doctor to send the prescription to a locally owned pharmacy.  When that pharmacy tried to fill the prescription, guess what????  They couldn't because CVS HAD ALREADY FILLED IT ON FRIDAY.  I'm only thankful that the prescription was not life or death!  \n\nThe new pharmacy told CVS to unfill the prescription and they filled it for me promptly.
