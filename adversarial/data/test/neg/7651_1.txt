I've come here about 3 times had had different experiences depending on the night. (all good, just know what your looking for. \n\nThe team is modern, edgy and everything is oversized. They have a lot of the usual games you would play at a backyard bbq, or dive bar: darts, corn-hole, shuffle-board, beer pong. but everything is giant sized. for instance instead of red cups on a table, they use trashcans painted red+ a volleyball instead of a ping-pong ball. It's really fun and all free. \n\nI ordered food, because I was drunk and hungry, but wasn't that impressed so I would stick with the beer and games. \n\non tuesday nights, you have people lounging on the giant beanbags studying with the free wifi. mellow music plays you can do whatever game you want.\n\nFridays, and saturdays its crammed full of people. They play club music inside, and have live bands out back in front of a silverbullet camper.\n\nDefinitely recommend this place if you don't want to spend a lot of money, but still want to have a good night
