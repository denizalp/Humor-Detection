Awesome place to get some nice food before going on somewhere else. Everything on the menu is the kind of food you can eat and then go on to do more drinking. The pizzas are awesome - great crust, fresh flavors, and a good size. The salads are good too, except the chopped vegetable salad which had flavors (primarily the overwhelming pickled something gross) that did not work for me at all. The menu description made it sounds like a cheese\/cream salad, and instead it was very dry with a strange combination of vegetables - asparagus, pickled onions, pickled something green that was so salty it hurt. I don't recall tasting feta or creamy garlic at all. The other salads at my table (green, chinese chicken) looked amazing though. Can't go wrong with the pizza margerita. The cocktails are very good here too, with fresh fruit ingredients and a strong pour. I really liked the banana cheesecake.
