Good food, nothing fancy! \n\n\nOverall the Chicken Souvlaki was good, not the best, but nothing exceptional. \n\nThey have a hot table with many choices and daily specials. \n\nOne of those places that are a little run down but quality of food is still good. \n\nGood size for a group of friends and in the mood for some Greek food or Falafels Etc...\n\nHard to see in the plaza, just a small place, close to the Walmart entrance. \n\nIf your looking for a good fast place to grab something this place fits the bill.
