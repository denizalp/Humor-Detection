I received a gift card for a 1 hour massage so I decided to book an appointment. Afterwards, I signed up for a membership and within 4 months decided to cancel. Each visit brought on multiple issues with their staff acting unprofessionally. \n\nThe actual massages are fine, but the front desk staff take away any relaxation you might have felt due to their car salesman tactics to get you to sign up for their membership. When you want to cancel they will persistently try to convince you that you shouldn't. They claim to promote relaxation, but in reality it's more of a hassle than its worth.
