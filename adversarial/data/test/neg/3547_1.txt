Got there soon after they opened. Plenty of parking. Was quickly greeted by the reception. Had to take off our shoes and place them in the cubbies. Everything was clean and well kept. The whole play area is under one area. They had a toddler area and a concession area that i used with and for my kids. The restrooms are towards the back and have seats for the little ones. The whole place is very well thought out to cater to everything you could possibly need before you need it. One thing i did find my self asking is if they had a nursing area. Towards the late morning and afternoon it starts to get super crowded, which is why i think Kangamoo came out to do  a character greeting. I will definitely be back, my kids loved every bit of this place.
