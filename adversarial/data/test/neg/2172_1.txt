I love Aritzia and frequently shop there both online and in-store. However, I will no longer be visiting the Chinook location. The last time I was there, I was with my friend and our kids, both two years of age. We were in the change room trying on clothes while our children were quietly picking up rocks that were in a plant display directly beside us. At one point my friend's child lightly threw a rock across the floor, like most kids his age would do, and went to pick it up. The manager of the store (I assume) quickly picked it up before he could grab it and stuck it in her pocket, and was very short with him. I understand that this can be disruptive on a very busy day...but it was ten in the morning...on a Tuesday...and we were practically the only ones in the store. It made us feel very unwelcome and I have actually gotten that vibe from the same girl previous times when I have brought my daughter in with me. I am a full time working professional who has money to spend but I will not be helping any of the sales girls at Chinook meet their $500\/hr quota any longer. I've had much better experiences at the Southcentre location so I will go there from now on.
