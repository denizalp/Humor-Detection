I been attending this church since moving to Arizona 2010 Things were great with the old pastor John, the new pastor Greg is good speaker however your left feeling left out invisible if not joined into there life groups, seems this church only try helping those who play huge roles in the church. I myself reached out twice to receive financial assistance for rent\/utilities But the 1st  receptionist was an woman and she kinda chuckled a laugh saying we don't help with bills if we did the church would be broke, then she ask if I'm a member of the church I said yes I been attending since 2010 and even got my whole family baptized here, then she say oh well do you pay your tithing I'm like yes most certainly then she ask oh I see well what about an reach gift offering I'm like huh well some times when I can she say I see well the only thing I can offer is you bringing your bills in set an appointment for the pastor to pray over your bills and we can educate you on how to pay your bills......TALK ABOUT FEELING INSULTED wow educate me, really... So I politely got off the phone and made an report the next following day, to attending an Sunday service about 4 Sundays ago to hearing the junior pastor at the ending of service speak about how this church would like for the community to reach out when needing help\/assistance on there bills that this church do help. Everyone musta looked around at one another in shock because alot of us was being rejected. Well just now today I'm in a financial need of help and so I decided to put my pride to the side and call the church since pastor Greg and jr pastor been preaching lately this church helps, and so today this morning I did call and spoke with the male receptionist  name Elliot at radiant church, he stated this church does NOT help out with rental needs but do with utilities, ask me the same run down questions as  the 1st receptionist then replied funds are low right now, jr pastor spoke in service stating that this church help pay bills but contradiction is happening, plus the receptionist belittled me saying what church you THINK your calling cause you might be confused, I take that disrespectful. This church needs to call assembly of God to figure out this church by law's of helping the community because I feel more of the community supporting this church financial habits and trip taking instead of this church reaching back helping us when in need, I'm now going to be  in search of a more honest and faithful to the community kind of church even if it risk the long drives to Phoenix, I want to feel acknowledge and loved as the scriptures of God's biggest commandment LOVE PEOPLE AS YOU LOVE GOD, and seems to me and alot others this church has it's handful of individuals they choose to love and help out to. I'm super disappointed and do not recommend unless you want a quick 30 minute wording and be unnoticed then attend here.
