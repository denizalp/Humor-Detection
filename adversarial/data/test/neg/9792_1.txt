Based on my experience with the Nellis location company, the following happened to me: It's my understanding of the contract I entered into that I was supposed to receive care from this Urgent Care facility as a regular client while establishing a Primary Care Physician. However, I don't believe that I did receive that. Even with insurance, I was still billed hundreds of dollars by this facility, and even double-billed in one case!! No one told me my in-network doctor would not be seeing me on my follow-up visit, and they aren't even required to tell you that. Instead, I have to pay $270 for a Physician's Assistant to review my lab tests with me. I could have read that myself! Based on what happened to me, you might want to double-check before you go ahead and engage this company and business with you. Be aware of what can happen. This is what happened to me.
