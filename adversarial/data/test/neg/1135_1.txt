Placed a takeout order when I was out and about; short on time. When I arrived to pickup my order I had to wait 15 minutes before receiving my order which appeared to have been sitting for 15 minutes. Wrote this location twice about the cold food and no response. I used to be a monthly regular and won't be back.
