I have been here a lot but today is by far the worst. Management has changed they now charge 25 cents for an extra small sauce it is maybe the size of a tablespoon. Ridiculous! Also the meat and rice were extremely over cooked. No one that works there ever seems to know what is going on. So I am very unimpressed.
