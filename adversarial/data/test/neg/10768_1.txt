The ice cream flavors were really unique, like Gansito, and of course the concept is unique as well. They're in the middle of moving locations so there were no cones and many of the ice creams being served for the day were low or gone. I ordered a single of the blueberry muffin ice cream but because there wasn't enough, it was topped with fruity pebble! Ended up being a win for me! I'd definitely go back once everything is reestablished.
