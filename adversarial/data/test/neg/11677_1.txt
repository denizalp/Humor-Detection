We had a pizza made to order. It was not on the menu but we just specified what we wanted on it and it came out perfectly. We also ordered some deep fried mozzarella and they were really good along with the sauce.  I have decided that they don't just make pizza here they handcraft each one. I have had Italian food and pizza in most places in Ahwatukee now and this place is my new favorite. I can't wait to try all the other dinners on the menu.
