Being on a low carb diet is tough.. And it was more difficult with a sweet tooth like mine. I tried a low carb cup cake from Bakeshop and it was AMAZING! I couldn't even tell the difference. For all you non-Lo carbers out there the Tres Leches and Apple Pie cupcakes will make you jump off your chair in a cake induced bliss! These bakers know their cake.
