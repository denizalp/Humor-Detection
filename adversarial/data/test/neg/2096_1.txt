We picked up take out tonight and we told the guy a bunch of times----no onions, no onions, no onions.  Guess what was all over my Sub in a Tub??? Onions :\/\n\nThey made my sandwich toasted at first and then fixed it and made it untoasted (The #13)\n\nDisappointing that they did not have a gluten free sub roll as their website states they carry.  \n\nMaybe because it's so new it will work the kinks out?  I hope!
