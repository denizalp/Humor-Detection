This is our, & our family's, favorite Chinese Restaurant. Because of my health, we usually order & pick up our food. Ling, 1 of the owners, is ALWAYS, extremely gracious to us & the food is never a disappointment. We have been patrons of the restaurant for over 20 yrs & wouldn't dream of going anyplace else!
