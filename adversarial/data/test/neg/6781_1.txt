After two days of getting my nails done, my white gel color was faded and changing in color. If I could give less that a star I would. Their customer service when it came to fixing the problem was less than professional, ending in a yelling match in the salon. \n\nThis was my second and last time coming to this salon; when the first time I came with a scheduled apt, I didn't get my services till an hour later.
