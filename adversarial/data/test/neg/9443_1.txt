The quality of the sushi are wayyyy better than Tokyo Sushi in downtown. The tempura shrimp is so well fried. Everything taste super fresh. \n\nOrdering with the ipad is a plus, you can see what u ordered so that you wont over order.\n\nThe plating is realy nice too, especially for the beef salad.\n\nOne con is that some orders did not arrive at all. Since we were able to track our orders, its easy to see what did not come. \n\nDefinitely the best place to go for all you can eat sushi!
