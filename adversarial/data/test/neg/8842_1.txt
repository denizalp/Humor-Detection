I saw the episode of \"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\" years ago, but hadn't come to La Piazza al Forno until today.\n\nI decided to treat my mom to lunch and we had the Italian Stallion pizza and a pizza Bianca with mushrooms and speck.  I like the thin crust with the slight char on the edges, the perfect amount of crunch and chewiness.  Great pizza overall.  We shared a slice of cheesecake which was very delicious.\n\nService was pretty decent, but I wish they would have included the tax on the written receipt (not that I'm necessarily hurting for the missing $4.64 in taxes, but I like to know what I'm paying for).  We happened to notice that our server seemed to be slightly exasperated, but when we looked around at her, she managed to perk up on the way to our table to serve us.  There was an older woman wearing an apron who came out from the kitchen area to greet the tables - except for ours.  It seems like she made it a point to act as if we weren't in the restaurant.
