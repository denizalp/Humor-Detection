Too bad I can't rate it more than five stars... da place deserves 10 stars, brah - it's that onolicious! After months of eating crappy food on Kwajalein it's like reaching an oasis of flavors! (I'm on vacation on the mainland from 'the rock' for a couple of weeks.)\n\nA note to foodie snobs... this place may look more like a hole in the wall rather than a gourmet restaurant, but don't dis the place because of its appearance - you're missing out on some awesome food!\n\nTook my brother along for lunch after we ran a couple of errands. After an appetizer of fried mandoo and the usual banchan I had the combo plate (meat jun, kalbi and BBQ chicken) and he went with the roast beef and gravy plate lunch. Neither one of us left anything on the plate when we finished. Yes, its that good!\n\nRussell, the owner is a very friendly person choke full of the 'aloha spirit' and it rubs off on the wait staff as well. We didn't have to wait very long for our meals - I'd say it was already piping hot and on our table in less than ten minutes.\n\nDefinitely a must eat place in Sin City - and you got a customer for life! (Whenever I get some time off on parole from 'the rock'.)
