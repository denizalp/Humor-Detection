This is one of the better Cirque shows. Like all permanent Cirque shows, the theater is amazing and you can see from everywhere. You do not need to pay top price for tickets. In off season, they usually have discount tickets or you get free seat upgrades. I enjoyed the music even though I'm not a die had Beetles fan. The show keeps you on the edge of your seat with a great mix of acrobatics, visual effects and music. The costumes are amazing. \n\nI highly recommend this show even if your not a major Beetles fan, it's the third best Cirque show in my opinion. The best being La Nouba in Orlando and Mystere at Treasure Island a close second.
