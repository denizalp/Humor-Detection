Everything about my float at True REST was fantastic, from the way I was greeted, to the orientation and instructions, to the quality of the facilities both during and after the float.  I felt well cared for and valued the entire time, and felt amazing for days afterwards.  The float itself was everything they said it would be-- I was well prepared to get the most out of the experience, and felt the benefits immediately. I'll definitely be back.
