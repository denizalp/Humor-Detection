Just Bad- the waitress\/hostess didn't really greet us, never smiled- said follow me. She asked what we wanted to drink before we ever even sat down. The place was dirty and furnishing looked worn. The buffet was very limited and below average. The only smile we saw from the staff was when we were paying the bill and they asked us to come again- Think not, I will be going to Sangrams in Cornelius
