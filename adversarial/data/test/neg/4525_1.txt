This is my first review. \n\nI stayed in the Venezia Tower for four nights 8\/5-8\/9. The hotel is beautiful inside. The room was a nice size and the bed was just ok, it was firm for me. The ease of access to the room was not easy and if you have been drinking it's that much more difficult. During my stay a fire alarm was set off at the crack of dawn. Nothing was done to acknowledge the inconvenience. Talked with a couple of other guest and they thought a comped buffet should have been given out. Hell, I would have taken n apology. Mentioned it to the front desk got nothing (blank stare). During my stay I was fortunate to win so I'm not bitter about that just bitter about the level of customer service. \n\nAlso should have a fridge with more space. Asked to have it emptied it was going to cost me 200$ WTF. How about charge a decent price for the things you put in there and I won't have to get my own. (it's me being cheap but that's why I got money) I'd rather gamble then spend 6 dollars for a bag of ... \n\nThe resort fee that is charged is the most ridiculous thing I have seen any Vegas hotel charge. Hotel should just put that in the rate. 209 rate is 266 with tax, hotel not that appealing at that rate.     \n\nI would like to mention housekeeping I talked to was awesome.
