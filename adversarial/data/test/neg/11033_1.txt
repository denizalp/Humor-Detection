I come here every year on a Friday using the free tickets I earned from spending $40 in one transaction which is not hard when grocery shopping. Plus from noon-6 there is a lot of $2 food deals to enjoy. If you can find street parking then that's free too. My niece loves the petting zoo, and looking at the sheep and chickens in the agricultural center and kerr's farm tour. Attractions are expensive and so is the food out side the 2 buck deal.
