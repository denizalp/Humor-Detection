Walked by the area and got into Cafe Bora during their soft opening. I had the Purple Sweet Potato Iceflakes. Very cute and toppings came in a multi tier container. Very nice soft flaky ice. You can adjust more or less sweetness with the sweet milk. I think it's a great sharing treat. Will come back again to try the other treats
