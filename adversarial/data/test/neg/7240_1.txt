Used a $25 for $50 groupon and was pleasantly surprised.  I normally only eat Indian food during buffets because i want to be able to try as many things as possible and i got use to eating a variety of foods at the same time.  The groupon allowed me to try the 6 things on the menu and i was able to take them home afterward.  What was so surprising to me was the service it was the best service I've had in a very long time.  The quality of the food was excellent.
