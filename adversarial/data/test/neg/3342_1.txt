I came here for breakfast and I was not impressed, and neither was our neighboring table. \n\nThe 'applewood-smoked' bacon has zero flavor. I almost wanted to spit it out. \n\nI drink peets coffee everyday and their 'peets' coffee doesn't taste like peets. It's very watered down. I asked for a fresh pot and it was still weak. Maybe the coffee is old or something because it had a hint of dirt flavor.\n\nOur neighbor also complained that their breakfast had no flavor. They ordered a Bailey's coffee and when complaining that it doesn't taste like Bailey's the bartender came to the table to explain that they've been out of Bailey's for a week and they used something else instead.  \n\nBottom line, their ingredients are cheap and they obviously don't care.
