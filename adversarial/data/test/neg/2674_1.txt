Only have been a couple of times in the past 5 years and the service was good but the food is just okay. My husband and I shared a dinner together since we are on a budget.  Had an onion blossom (small taste of burnt oil), dinner salad (which they lost the ticket for the order and brought it out after we got our dinner). Food getting cold while we ate our salad and the portion size of the meal wasn't that great, a small piece of chicken, little bowl of mashed potatoes and veggies.
