Cool restaurant with an in-house butcher shop. Food is great as I was able to sample some interesting dishes - venison steak and an kangaroo burger. Both were fantastic and full of flavor. The spices complimented the kangaroo extremely well. The service was excellent and our server was always around to ensure the meal was going well. Definitely a spot I'll be going back to!
