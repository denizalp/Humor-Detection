Myself and two roommates moved to Palazzo on January 1, 2016 and since that time, there have been three management turnovers. With each one, the maintenance and service has deteriorated more and more. Pool has been down for service three times. Pool deck is never power washed, trash area is unsightly and appears to be undersized and now repairs are virtually non-existent. Washer\/dryer unit has been broken for three weeks resulting in my having to go to a commercial laundry in 110 degree heat and is very inefficient. Even small repairs are not effective i.e. Microwave handle. Management loves to give assurances but never follows through. Please do not move here as there are a few other options that must be better if you wish to be close to airport.
