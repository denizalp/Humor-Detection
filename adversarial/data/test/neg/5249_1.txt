This place is alright..\n\nBecause it is so small inside, it is packed with little to no seating. It seemed like everyone was shoulder to shoulder trying to fill up their cups. It's more of a place for children than for adults because of their little \"games\" area. There is a lot of seating outside with misty sprinklers which I appreciated since it was 100Â° outside. \n\nThey had a small variety of flavors, few of which were fruity which was a bit disappointing. Other than that, it was ok
