As a Jamaican I've tried multiple,  probably all patty's available in Toronto. Frozen, bakery fresh, you name it. I thought randy's patty was the best then allan's. But I was wrong and I'm glad I'm wrong cuz I stumbled upon this joint on Lawrence in between brimley and mccowan. In all fairness without being bias in any way, PATTY TIME had the best patty in Toronto in my opinion. I'm from Jamaica so I've had the real deal of patty's but patty time brings me back to Jamaica. Crust is light and flaky with perfect texture and taste, the filling is absolutely flavorful and they aint cheap with the filling, you get a lot of flavorful filling and it's real meat, not that dark paste bullshit garbage that patty king, tastee and the rest offer. So my new top 3 patty in Toronto is 1. Patty Time, 2. Randy's patty and 3. Allan's patty. \nNote: I live 10 mins from the allan's bakery on Kennedy in Scarborough and I drive all the way to Patty Time at brimley and Lawrence for my patty fix. It's that damn good. Dozen frozen $13.95 no tax, dozen not frozen $14.95 no tax. A bit more pricey than the competition because they are better than the competition, nuff said.
