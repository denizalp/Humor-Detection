This was my second time here. Undeniably the food is good. Sadly the service could be better. Today I wanted at least 10 minutes to be acknowledge and then guests who arrived after me were helped and served first. I guess if your going to have guests seat themselves, there should be a better system. I don't feel valued here as a customer, which is sad as I truly love supporting local business- especially one that supports other local businesses. Oh well, I guess I'll continue the search
