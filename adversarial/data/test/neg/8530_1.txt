Food is tasty. Needs a renovation. Great tasty food for the price. One of the cheapest ayce but don't let the price fool you, good quality food. Only negative is the beef is always so bloody even if you ask for it well done...smh. this place is good but service can be lame at times. The Only male server in the evening is the best of them all, make sure you tip him!!
