Dontino's is an amazing restaurant!  In an environment of \"I need to keep my kids occupied with their tablets\" and \"get a reservation so we can jam food down our throats and get the hell out of here\" reasoning this restaurant holds its own.  Are diners aware of how many family-owned Italian restaurants have fallen by the wayside???  Would your Granparents have eaten at Olive Garden?  Mine didn't and I'm young!  \n\nDontino's is a FAMILY!  The family's Italian salad dressing is served on your salad.  The family's recipes are on the menu.  The waitress taking care of your family may have served here for over 20 years!  Why does a waitress serve at a restaurant for over 20 years????\n\nI had the pizza bianca with hot peppers, anchovies, sausage and pepperoni for lunch today - so delicious!  I'm dipping my pizza crust in the homemade Italian salad dressing.  I'm listening to Perry Como.  My parents come here every Saturday night. \n\nWhat else can I say?
