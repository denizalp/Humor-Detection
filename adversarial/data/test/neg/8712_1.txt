The old staff was incredible. Now that they are under new management it is awful. It took over 10 minutes to get our food, simply due to extremely slow hands and socializing. I ordered the grilled veggie wrap, which was cold and falling apart. The manager was flirting with female customers. We asked the cashier what happened to all of the old employees and he replied \"guess they are SOL\". Which, lets be honest is just plain rude. The tables were dirty, there is a piece of roast beef next to me as I type this. I don't like to write bad reviews but I am very disappointed with the experience I had today.
