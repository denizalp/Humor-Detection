As part of our trip to Vegas my friend and I stayed at the Venetian. I had some Expedia points so we checked into the Rialto suite at a great price. I was nervous at arrival because we were early, however they accommodated us with an early check in, and we even got a dining credit as part of our deal. The room was large and perfect. The entry way to the room was beautiful. The whole setting of the Venetian was amazing. From the Italian vibes, the gondola and the art in the building this hotel did not disappoint. While we were there it happened to be restaurant week, we had an amazing Italian dinner at a very reasonable price. If you have a chance you have to check our the macaroon place located in their shopping area! The pool was not overcrowded and the waitresses were attentive. In my opinion, the Venetian has one of the best drink menus at the pools in Vegas. Overall, it was a very enjoyable experience and I hope to return soon!
