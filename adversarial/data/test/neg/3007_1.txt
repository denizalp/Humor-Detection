If you see a chocolate-topped cronut in their bakery display, buy it. It was delicious. I'm sure the other cronut flavors are great too, but the chocolate was amazing. My friends and I shared one, and I think we all would have happily eaten the whole thing. There were some other fun items on display like massive donuts, so this is the place to go if you're craving carbs. \n\nThe coffee was OK, I ended up having to add a whole lot more sugar and cream than I normally do to get the flavor balanced right, so probably not the best brewed coffee. But it had caffeine and that's all that really mattes.
