(I was at first a little taken aback for the prices of donuts these days!)\n\nThey only are getting two stars though because of the customer service. I went on a Friday morning and the lady who helped me rushed through every answer as if she had something else she thought was more important. I asked first for maple bars to be included in my dozen donuts and she said they were 40 cents extra. I said that was fine and she took the rest of my order. When she repeated my order back she repeated 2 sprinkles rather than 6. That's quite a difference in sounds for the numbers. Then rather than giving me my total she said pull up to the window.\n\nI had a short wait before I was helped at the window. The lady gave me my box and told me the total, which was the exact price for 12 donuts, not including added maple bars. So I open my box to check and see round donuts. I ask the lady why I didn't get maple bars like I ordered and she replied \"We're out\". And then she took my payment and that was it.\n\nI was none too pleased with the service I received here. I don't think I'll go back when I'm home in Vegas visiting. I will drive farther for other Dunkin' Donuts or for a Krispy Kreme. \n\nThe donuts themselves were OK in taste. They weren't amazing, but didn't seem super fresh.
