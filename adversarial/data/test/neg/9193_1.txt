I have been a loyal customer for a over a year and if you haven't been, you must go and get naked at NAKED BBQ! Everything on the menu is delish! The smoked brisket and pulled pork are legit! It was so tasty that I couldn't resist ordering to-go to share with the family! If you have room and want to satisfy your sweet tooth be sure to order the maple bacon doughnut. Amazing! Looking forward to my next visit...
