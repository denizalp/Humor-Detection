I fell In love with Dr. Damore from the very first visit. She was so kind and sweet. I could tell she loved doing what she does. She really took care of me during my pregnancy, always answer all my question I had very clearly. She would be the one I would return too If I had my second. She Is a amazing outstanding doctor. She just delivered my baby girl.
