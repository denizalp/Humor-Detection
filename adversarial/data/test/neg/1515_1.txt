I am new to vaping so I have been going from one vape shop to another just to find a right shop, right liquid, right tank, and mod etc. So today I ended up at BDV and found everything I was looking for under one roof. I walked away feeling \"WOW\"... !!! \n\nSidney was amazingly helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly. She helped me find a right tank and coil. I was also able to try out a few flavors and find the one that I liked. I bought 120ml of Spearmint, she helped me fill up the new tank and advised me of the correct watt range for it. At all other shops I was made to feel like I was asking too many questions and inconveniencing them or wasting their time... Not here! They appreciated my business and in return they just earned a loyal customer for a long time to come. Thank you!!!\n\nOh and It is $25 for 120ml (80\/20 - VG\/PG) which is fairly reasonable so stop looking around and go visit them today. Forget red, yellow, pink, whatever else you have been visiting, BLUE is the best. ;)
