Local, casual, good food. Hubby and I stopped for a bite at the bar and were greeted by the owner. I had the salmon, which frankly is never that amazing when eating out. But I must say this salmon was very good. Cooked just how I asked it to be. I had veggies on the side which were a little too heavy on the garlic but still a nice mix of colors. My hubby had chicken parm and said it was delicious. It certainly looked it. I like the atmosphere and the fact that it's right down the road. Great wine and bar selection as well!
