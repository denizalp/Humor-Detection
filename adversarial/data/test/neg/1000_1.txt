Great store, they are very helpful and explain what you may and may not need. Every time we come to this store we don't feel like we are getting screwed. We have gone to Leslie's and are told we need so much product to get our pool back to normal and then we come here and they say we only need one thing and the pool looks great. They have. A great selection of the products you need and are willing to help you.
