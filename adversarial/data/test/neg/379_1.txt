I was here for a business trip not long ago, and I was particularly impressed with the staff.  The front desk night manager, Bash, was absolutely on top of it. There was a mistake made with my room - we are all human and mistakes happen. I went down to speak with him about it, and he was VERY proactive, accommodating and thoughtful about the matter.  \n\nAt breakfast the first morning, I was in a hurry and not all that hungry. I just grabbed a boiled egg and a piece of fruit.  The server, clearly also very conscientious about her work, charged me the \"employee breakfast\" rate.  Normally,  wouldn't advocate for people making those kinds of decisions on the fly, but clearly, the company still made more than adequate money for what I ate.  \n\nThis place is convenient, and has a great staff.  It exemplifies the Hilton brand.
