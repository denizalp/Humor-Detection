Friends recommended it, and I was delighted to visit Tempe Yarn and Fiber for the first time. What a rainbow variety of yarns and roving. Spinners and knitters and other needle workers can find an array of choice that turned a ten minute planned visit for me into over an hour, and still looking. \nI was delighted to hear a history of some of the yarn that went \"from the back of the sheep to the back of the wearer,\" and I was surprised to learn about sheep farms in the urban area. ARizona product all the way! Yes I completely recommend this shop. Staff helpful and knowledgable. I will go back, and I might even take a class.
