Keep an eye out for Popsicle Carts around town. I have seen them in Front of JJ red hots, Good Bottle, and the Food Truck Friday.  \n\nI really enjoy the Raspberry Lime pop, and the Ginger Pop.  They have all types of fun exotic flavor combinations.   For the adventurous try the Lemon Basil Pop very intense!
