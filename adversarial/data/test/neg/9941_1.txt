I absolutely love Nancy! I have looked through numerous galleries and decided to go with Nu Brows and Lash simply because her work is beautiful and most importantly, consistent. \n\nThis is my first time getting semi-permanent makeup so I was nervous about my decision - it's permanent! On top of that, I am also super picky and slightly OCD. Even though her work is consistent, I thought to myself, \"What if I was the ONE person she messed up on?!\" However, after meeting Nancy, she put all my worries at ease because she is a perfectionist. She thoroughly went over the procedure and aftercare. She measured and outlined my brows to my desired shape and didn't start until I was satisfied with my brows. \n\nI have friends who got micro-bladed brows from other tattoo artists and it's so obvious that it's a tattoo. The hair strokes are thick and far apart making them look fake. My brows turned out perfect! They are so natural looking that many people don't even know I had them micro-bladed unless I choose to tell them. I love my brows so much that I am going back to get eyeliner tattoo. Nancy is truly an artist.  \n\nThere are other places that offer deals and lower rates but you can't put a price on perfection. So unless you want to spend extra money to have Nancy fix your botched brows, save yourself the money and go to Nu Brows and Lash.
