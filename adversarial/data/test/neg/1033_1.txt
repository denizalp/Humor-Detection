Pizza here is most definitely a step up from some other places around, price wise it's a step up too. They have a big selection of \"unique\" pizzas, think Thai food on a pizza, most of which I've found to be a one off thing, but still interesting. I'd rather give this place a 3 1\/2 but perhaps I'm just spoiled, haven't ordered from a different pizza place in probably almost a year.
