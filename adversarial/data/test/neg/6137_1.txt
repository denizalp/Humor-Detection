Came here for a friends birthday dinner. We were 16 people and there was space for all of us. They separated us into three groups with an iPad each for ordering but failed to tell us that the orders weren't linked to each other. Our reservation was for 8PM and we had to wait for the previous diners to finish up their meal before seating us. Goes to show that convenience and popularity gets this place visits. \n\nFood was alright - ample selection of hot, cold foods, appetizer and sushi ~ the cuts could be a higher grade and service could have been better. You order on the iPad and it's verified by one of the staff members. They served everything on one side of the table out of convenience and the orders took long to come out \n\nCome here if you enjoy variety. Go someplace else if you want a higher grade of sushi. Won't come back unfortunately.. price point and mediocre sushi detract me
