VERY hit or miss.  They use a superior system (lammscloth) to get your car clean.  However, it never seems to get certain types of debris (bird droppings, leaf stains) fully removed.  My wheels never come out looking great, lots of brake dust and build up always remain.  I've found myself using a brush at home to get clean.  The workers that dry off the often use \"shortcuts\", make sure to have them dry off the inside door seals.  They are supposed to do this and other smaller detailing things, but causually \"forget\".  Overall, the employees are not very thorough, less so than Autobell. \n\nThey ran a \"groupon\" special, which expired on 2\/4.  Coincidently, they were closed 2\/4 AND 2\/5.  So now I'm out 2 free washes.
