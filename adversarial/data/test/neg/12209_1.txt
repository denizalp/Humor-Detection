Sorentos is one of the places on my list of repeats. Especially for work lunches and I have to say everything on the menu is delicious and simple but the quality of the food is definitely worth every penny. Another family run business. The service is great, the servers are attentive, quick and very accommodating. They also have the patio which is nice for the summer with a nice cold drink. They let us pre-order our food because we have an hour for lunch, and our reservation is usually for 8 to 9 people. This place is clean and well lit, you get a Mediterranean feel with the painting on the walls and price is reasonably standard. My favourite quick go-to item here is the Hoggie with fries. I keep forgetting to take a picture as I devour this sandwhich the moment it is placed in front of me. (Its and Italian version of a Philly Cheese steak). This is a must try place if you are in the neighborhood or just passing by..stop in and grab some lunch!
