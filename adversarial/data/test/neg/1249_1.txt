After waiting an hour and being second on the list now I was told the person that had an appointment got to be ahead of us also and their appointment was over an hour away. Their customer service is horrible they really  need to find out how to be faster and more efficient with their customers so people can get in and out. All I needed was a SIM card and I'm still here waiting. I would hate to be the 7th guy on the list they are going to spend their entire Saturday here. Will be finding a new AT&T store to go to
