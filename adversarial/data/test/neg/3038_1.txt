Laser maze is a blast for the kids, check Groupon for deals so you don't break the bank.\n\nLove the sitting area outside, great for waiting parents when the weather is cool and breezy.\n\nBummer that you can't even bring water for a birthday party, it's $0.99 per additional 8oz bottle, but it beats the $1.25 pouch of Carpi Sun.  My kids love ice cream but we couldn't bring an ice cream cake either.  Loosen up, allow us to bring water (this is AZ) and our own cakes for the parties.
