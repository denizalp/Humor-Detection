I recently went in for a bike and was pretty overwhelmed with the selection. The staff member who helped me was as nice as they come. He broke down all the differences between the two I was debating, asked thoughtful questions to find out how I planned to use the bike, offered to let me take test rides, and ultimately gave a recommendation that I believe was completely sincere and not just for the benefit of a sale, because the option he recommended (and I ultimately bought) was the less expensive of the two by a little over $200. \n\nThe bike I chose was the last of its kind in the store and the staff member tuned it up for me and helped with adjusting the seat to fit my height. This is probably a really common thing but I really liked that one person was helping me the entire time (so many places will bounce you between employees) and that he made sure my bike was perfect for me right until I walked out the door with it. \nIt made me feel like they actually cared and weren't just in it for the sales.\n\nI am ecstatic with the bike I bought and I'm really thankful the staff helped me make this choice. I wasn't aware of the Trek warranties beforehand so I was really impressed to learn about the free tune-ups. Those are going to come in handy because this is a bike I'm going to have for years.\n\nAnd for people complaining about them not having women's cruisers on display (which, funny, because I bought a women's cruiser and saw several others on display plus, you know, I was debating between one cruiser and another so...) if you ask staff they'll tell you, like they told me, that they don't keep many cruisers in stock because they're low sellers in Canada. The bulk of their cruiser stock is in California. Cruisers in general are popular, however for this specific brand they're not popular enough to carry a huge selection. Buuuuuuut, if you don't like having the same bike as everyone else on the road this can be a good thing, because I got the last of my style in the city. Stylin' past you on my sweet ride! Ding ding outta my way!
