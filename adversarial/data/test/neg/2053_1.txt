We ordered dinner here tonight and learned that it has new owners when we arrived and the order through Eat24 didn't go through. The new owner was very nice and helped us find new items to order (the menu has changed)and the food was made quickly and super fresh  .... Everything was delicious! I'd recommend stopping in or calling for their new menu.
