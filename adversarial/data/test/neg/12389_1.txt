Good lunch place that is always busy. If you have been to Philly, Corleone's is not bad in comparison. I like their Italian Hoagie, but the cheesesteak is pretty good too. The bread is what makes a great sandwich in Philadelphia and they have those amorosa rolls here too. For those Philly transplants, they have tastycakes for dessert.
