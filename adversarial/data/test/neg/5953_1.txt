Pretty typical Hampton Inn.  Lots of amenities if you have the time to entertain yourself in the Inn, but with so much to do in Charlotte, do you really want to stay in the Inn?  My one negative is the parking.  We paid for valet, and by the time we were ready to park the car, which wasn't much longer after check-in, the lot was full, and we had to pay for another lot behind the building.  Breakfast was good, but it gets crammed very quickly, as there isn't much seating and the area to get your food is a little alcove which tends to jam up pretty fast with guests trying to eat from various stations.
