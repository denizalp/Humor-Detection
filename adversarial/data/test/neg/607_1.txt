I've been to fatheads a lot. Enough so that I owe then another review for all of the fun nights out and meals I've had here. For starters, ask my boyfriend what his favorite restaurant of all time is and without even skipping a beat he will tell you Fathead's.  This is mostly because headhunter is his favorite beer and the great bar food\/large portion sizes.\n\nThey have a beer for every taste here. I always go back to my old faithful, bumble berry. If you're into strong hops and IPA, then reach for a headhunter. If you are into more wheat based beers like myself, try out the bumble berry or the heffeweizen... always a safe choice. Mug club, we're coming for ya!\n\nService has increasingly gotten better since I wrote my first review a few years back. It's always crowded here so don't expect top notch service but the servers are always friendly and knowledgeable. \n\nLet's breakdown the highlights of this massive menu so you don't get overwhelmed when trying to decide what to order. Pro tip: Everything you order is going to come in a larger portion than you think! \n\nAppetizers- The best apps here are the breaded mushrooms with horseradish dipping sauce and the nachos. The nachos use thick cut potato chips and are more than enough to split with 6 people. Sometimes we order these with 6 wings as a meal!  Don't overlook the cheesy bacon fries if you're into eating a delicious pile or greasy cheese smothered fires, but I would pick the nachos or mushrooms first!\n\nWings- The smokehouse wings here are probably one of my favorite foods. They are seriously so good and filling. You are getting the WHOLE three piece wing here, so a half order is more than enough. Beasty BBQ is my favorite sauce along with the honey mustard and buffalo.\n\nHeadwiches- Headwiches are the star here.  They're really only large because the bread they use is massive but don't get my fooled they are still great. The twisted brisket and chicken little are not to be missed. The come with chips, no substitutions.\n\nBurgers- If headwiches are the star, then burgers here are Cinderella. I just recently tried a burger here and will most likely better ordering on every time now! The different combos are creative and they were cooked perfectly. The best part here is that they are the only thing on the menu that comes with their amazing fries. Don't be swayed by the large headwiches, check out a burger.\n \nLastly, they opened up the game area as a place to wait for a table is horrendous (At least on hour on weekend nights). The best part about this is they have servers taking you're drink and app orders while you wait. It is such a great system! To say I like Fat Head's is an understatement, but when we haven't been there in awhile it's also good to know that most major retailers carry their beers when I'm searching for a bumble berry fix! \n\nCheck out their production facility in Middleburg Heights, fun beer tours and limited food menu (they have wings!)!
