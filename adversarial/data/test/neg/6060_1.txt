One of my best girlfriends got married here this weekend and all I have to say is AMAZING!!!!! The location is spectacular and a hidden gem in the middle of the desert. I am from the Midwest and it really felt like I was back home. \n\nI have had brunch at the cafe here and walked around the property when my friend decided it was the location for her Wedding. The BBQ dinner that was prepared for the Wedding reception was so yummy!!! And the staff was amazing and stealthlike...things were always taken care of but you hardly noticed that the staff was there and when you did they were so accomodating and friendly.\n\nMy only caution is to any bride who thinks this is a beautiful setting but does not consider that you are at a FARM! The bride's dress was filthy after dragging it across the ground and everyone's shoes were dusty but no one at this Wedding cared. If this might bother you or guests, this may not be the place for you. I urged female friends to wear wedges or flats because heels will dig right into the grass at the Farm.\n\nRegardless of the event, go check out the Farm at South Mountain. You can grab lunch and sit at one of the picnic tables and just enjoy the beauty of the property.\n\nThank you to The Farm for making my friend's Wedding day the best it could possibly be!
