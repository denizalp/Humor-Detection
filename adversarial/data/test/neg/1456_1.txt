I tell ya since this place opened up a few months ago, it's quickly moving up my list of Favorite \"watering holes\". Although, it does get very crowded on a Friday\/Saturday nights, I like my weekend breakfasts or lunches. The staff is super friendly and very cool. Nothing beats a cold beer or a shot or two at this place. Cheers!!! :-)
