I went on a Tuesday night after work. Arrived roughly around 5:30pm, made no appointments and waited for just 10-15mins.  Really busy and quick environment.  Hair cut was quick, cut was right to the point.   And the price was very good for what you get.  $30 for just a cut and no wash.  They do take appointments ahead of time if you do not want to wait at all.  They will also give you a cute juice box on top of that, which i thought was a cute touch.  \n\nI will definitely go back again just because it was quick,  right to the point, and cheap. As apposed to a 80+ hair cut.
