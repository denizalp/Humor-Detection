**** WARNING - MUST READ BEFORE RENTING ****\n\nI rented from they guys for Memorial day 2014, first of all they take CASH ONLY (which should be a sign). I showed up and get the trailer with my cash, backed up to the trailer, got it all loaded on then he asked me if I wanted Propane (which is REQUIRED to run the heater and fridge), and of course I said yes, so right away I was hit for another $60 or so.. one would think THIS would come with the trailer right.. along with a good battery, which I will get to in a minute.  \n\nSo I paid the monies and headed down the road. I get home and smells like Propane in the trailer really bad, I call them back the VERY next day and he said roll the windows down to air it out... I said \"OK\" (not knowing how THIS is helping the obvious gas leak ).  So after a while it doesn't smell as bad (of course 'cause windows were open).  There was nothing he was going to do, so I just headed up camping after charging the battery for about 3 hours since it was dead. (when picking up ther trailer he said the batter would require charging 30 min in morning and 30 min in afternoon while up camping).. Try 7 hours and it still WOULD NOT hold a charge.. Great times.\n\nSo I get up to Big Lake and it is rather cold (29 degrees at night) and the gas smell was soo bad, my kids could NOT sleep in the trailer and the fridge went out so ALL of our food went bad.\n\nSo I get back to explain the situation to Carson and he said 1st of all I should have SHUT OFF the Propane so it didn't smell in the trailer .. did I mention it was 29 degrees and with no Propane equals.... yep thats right NO HEAT.. I ask what he would do and he said they don't do \"refunds\".. so spent over $600 for a trailer that my family COULD NOT sleep in.. ALL my food went bad AND the battery was dead.\n\nand get this.. he DID CONFIRM there was a gas leak in a fitting inside the trailer and STILL WOULDN'T refund a DIME, but he did want to give me a \"discount\" on my next rental... I OBVIOUSLY told him that $200 of my next rental was NOT WORTH my family Freezing due to his  faulty equipment!!\n\nRENTERS BE-WARE ! ! !
