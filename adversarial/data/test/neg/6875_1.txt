I see mixed reviews about this business but for me personally I have to give them 5 stars they made my birthday something to remember, my limo driver was amazing he came a little early but that's fine, the limo was extremely clean, we couldn't get the music to work due to someone breaking the aux cord so he played music of his own and we had a party in the limo lol, his driving was good we got to our destination and back safely and on time I would use this limo service again and I would love to have the same driver each time Sheldon you made me and my friends night keep up the good work!
