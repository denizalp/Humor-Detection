I have been using Sky Harbor Airport Parking for years and never have had a complaint except for this last time traveling.  I always make a reservation for covered parking and we arrived at 5 a.m.  Scanned our bar code and the person at the entrance told us to put our printout in the window to show we had covered parking.  Normally they give us a ticket to indicate covered parking but not this time!  Unfortunately, the printout has our name, address, phone number and e-mail address in plain view for anyone to walk by and obtain this information or break in the car and scan the bar code to exit the parking lot.  Also, we waited from 10-15 minutes for a bus to pick us up at our car.  Maybe it was because we were so early that service was not as good as normal, but that shouldn't be the case.  I will continue to use Sky Harbor Parking, but suggest they change their policy regarding placing the printout in the window with all the personal information!!!!
