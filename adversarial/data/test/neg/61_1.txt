Trendy Spot for Teas and Treats\n\nPop 'N Tea presents a beautiful space with sweet treats when you want to splurge. The look and menu are meticulously designed to appeal to the Instagram crowd. We ordered the diamond bars and Jasmine Milk Tea. The milk tea had a pleasant floral, creamy taste. You can't go wrong with chocolate covered gelato, and the presentation is artful. The woman at the counter was very helpful and friendly. My friends visiting Phoenix loved the detour here!
