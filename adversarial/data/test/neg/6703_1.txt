I've taken my car to several mechanics in regards to an ABS sensor failing. It's been over 2 years. All of them said I could live without my ABS and quotes astronomical prices to replace it. This past winter my car's brakes didn't hold when I got stuck on ice. Then, my car's ebrake activated on the highway. I couldn't turn it off. Nearly got in an accident. I took it to Midas, and they did a thorough search on the car. It turns out the system was failing because it couldn't talk to the ABS and my brake fluid was murky. They replaced the sensor and I couldn't be happier.
