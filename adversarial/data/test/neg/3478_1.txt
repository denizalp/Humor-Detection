I live in North Scottsdale, but it's well worth the drive to Chandler to see my dentist.  It is always such a pleasure to go for my 6-month cleaning. Really! Dr. Gombert and his team take such great care to ensure that I maintain healthy teeth and gums. I've been under Dr. Gombert's care for over 5 years now, and I've never had a bad experience. His office is so clean and beautiful, and he and his staff are excellent at what they do.
