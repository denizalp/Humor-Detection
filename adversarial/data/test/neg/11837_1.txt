We were walking down Yonge St and saw this restaurant. This restaurant looks very small until you walk upstairs and see an additional 50 tables or so.  This place was packed, but we got seated quick.  We ordered the all you can eat for $18 or so.  At first the service was good and food came fast, but as the meal went on service suffered greatly and at times we had to refills our own water glasses and RICE, Yes I said RICE was hard to come by.  The value was good, the food tasted good, but overall the service was very poor.  This place would have been 5 stars if the service was just 50% percent better.
