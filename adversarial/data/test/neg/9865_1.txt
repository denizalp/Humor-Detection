We waited 10 min to have our order taken. Another 10 min to get our table set. Even after, we were still missing a fork and a knife, but it was a hassle just trying to get their attention so we just shared it! \n\nWhile the above complaint is very common in a somewhat busy restaurant (i think they were more short staffed than busy), the rest of our experience was not!\n\nWhile waiting for our food (which came in 15 min) we saw what I wish we could all UNSEE! A woman who worked there, was standing behind the counter (which is not really enclosed), coughed on her hand and spat something phlegmy (we saw the trail of something gross coming out of her mouth!) on some soggy looking napkin, which I HOPED she tossed in the trash, because all of a sudden we see her HAND DOWN THE FRONT OF HER PANTS! Like front and centre inside of her pants!! I don't know what just happened and what we just witnessed, but we were so shocked that we just kept an eye her to make sure she wasn't serving any of our food! She wasn't! Phew! But still she touched things after, so that's gross!\n\nOnce we got most of our meal, my mom didn't get her porridge, so we ate and waited for another 10 min and when it finally came there were BUGS like fruit flies all over the porridge. She had it returned and ordered something easier to make, a bagel and cream cheese... but that took another 10 min!\n\nAnd to end it all, my mom told me after the meal that when she went to the bathroom she saw POOP smear on the walls. \n\nThat was when I stood up and just RAN outside because I started feeling sick and just wanted to go home.
