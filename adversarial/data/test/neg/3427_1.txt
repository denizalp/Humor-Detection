This is a nice, family-friendly diner that looks like it has a lot of returning customers. We came here for brunch on Labor Day and were seated in a cute and mini booth (perfect for me!). I was thinking about the Italian frittata, but ordered a waffle and sausage links instead (nothing special, but satisfied my breakfast food craving). Boyfriend ordered steak and eggs, which he enjoyed (even though the steak wasn't made the way he wanted). We also ordered a side of home fries that were kind of bland; wish they added some seasoning and made them crispier. Luckily some salt & pepper on the table helped. Prices were pretty standard for a diner. The people at the table next to us had bagel and lox that looked good, so we might try that if we come back. \n\nTaste | 3 \nAtmosphere | 3.5\nPresentation | 3\nService | 3\nOVERALL | 3
