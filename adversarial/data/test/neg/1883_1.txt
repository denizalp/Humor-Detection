SURF the Musical is enjoyable, fun, entertaining and wow just cannot say enough! The Beach Boy songs are arranged and sung and arrange in a different way, but that does not detract from the songs. The costumes are fun and the supporting cast is stellar!\n\nThere are several dance scenes (imagine West Side Story) that are really good and exciting. The dad Actor Robert Torti had the best voice of the group and he can really carry a tune! \n\nAll in all and energetic, entertaining, fun show!! Plus as several other Yelpers mentioned...the Ferris wheel scene is awesome!!
