I'm not really a sandwich snob, maybe I'm a little bit of a bread snob. And I don't eat meat, so clearly there is a certain scope to my review that will not cover a wide array of their menu.  However, my review is not focused so much on their menu as it is on their ingredients. Reality check: I know it's a chain. I don't expect Simply Bread or McClendon carrots. But the disappointment is still high.\n\nThe sign is so pretty, their logo is pleasing. But I don't like the flashing of a \"healthy eating\" concept when your bread is made with high fructose corn syrup among other unpronounceable items and I am not so partial to soggy sandwiches that fall apart even though there isn't any sauce or cheese present (why exactly is every sandwich I've ordered so wet? do they dry the lettuce after washing it? do they wash the bread?) I haven't really encountered any nice people working here to make up for the lacking food at high prices. Not to mention I thought this location in particular was not well kept.\n\nSo why 2 stars? I don't know. My only 1 star review was REALLY bad. This wasn't quite as appalling so I've left it at 2. I wish we had Panera here. It's not perfect, but it's a step up.
