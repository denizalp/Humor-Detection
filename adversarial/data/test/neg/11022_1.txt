There were some things I experienced here as a 10 and some as a two... Not really a two but its dramatc right! Lol. Anyway the Calamari was out of this world and oh so tender. My first attempt at an entre was a miss for me. I ordered the short ribs, fully expecting the savory childhood flavors i grew up eating but... This day and age they add \"special\" ingredients and theres the risk of throwing off your tastebuds. Thats what happened to me.  Horseradish? Who would have thunk? I dont.. Its a fail for me but you might like it. They replaced it for me, with Shrimp n Grits. First bite was an epic win, subsequent bites i found  the shrimp over cooked and the sauce fell a little flat. It was tasty enough but not perfect. My partner had the Quinoa Salad, epic HIT! She was thoroughly satisfied. We finished with the banana pudding which i call not cho mommas banana puddin.. Cuz it aint lol. It was light and airy and not too sweet. Its Grey-ish hue threw me off. It wasnt pretty and could have used more cookie.  Oh and Public School; in my humble opinion you can lose the dark chocolate shavings throughout the pudding, its overpowering. Please and thank you. Lastly the cookie, cuz we are gluttons.... was not so amazing. The ice cream was not rich nor decadent. The cookie was good, my partner liked the nutella but said the carmelized bacon was an epic miss. Her advice PBS 702... Toasted coconut... Jus sayin.  Thanks for a cool date night! But there is room to grow!
