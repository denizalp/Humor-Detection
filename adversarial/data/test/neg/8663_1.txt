There were some very high points and very low points to this 12 person weekday dinner.  I had made the reservation earlier in the day and had to put down a credit card to hold the reservation.  My 3 aunts and 1 uncle went early, during happy hour, and absolutely loved it.  The other 8 in the party arrived for dinner and we were promptly seated.  Both my uncle and I ordered the miso butterfish which we both thought was amazing (tasty and moist) but my husband thought it bland.  Three people got the filet mignon and all said it was tough.  My mom got fish with no salt and sauce on the side but it arrived in the standard preparation so she sent it back.  One persons fish was raw in the middle, another person's was overcooked but still tasty, they said.  They messed up the dessert order (forgot to bring out one of the two souffles which take 20 minutes to make).  In the end they comped us nicely (add 1 star) but I don't know how they messed up so much.  I am attributing it to the large party size but we only had one person with special requests.
