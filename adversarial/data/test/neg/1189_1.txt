Located inside the New York New York hotel, with bar area, inside and patio seating. Basically, a bar food menu. I found the food and service to be very average at best. The table areas were not nearly as clean, as I had hoped. They have numerous TVs, to watch sports, but don't ask them to change a specific TV to a specific sporting event. They won't oblige. It is Vegas, so expect a higher cost for average food. There are numerous other choices, along the strip. Unless you can't walk any further or are absolutely starving, then go ahead try it out. I'd personally go elsewhere.
