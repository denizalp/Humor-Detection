Well, this was my second time here.  I had the grilled cheese last time.  It was ok.  This time tried the BBQ and it even came with a $5 off today.  Well, very disappointing.  For ribs and brisket combo.  First of all, don't boil ribs.  The bones Blanche put and the meat is degraded.  The brisket was dry.   The sauces they serve and just plain - well YUCK!   The baked beans need work on the flavor.   The Mac and cheese.  Not so much.  The chicken was dry and lethargic looking.  The whole BBQ menu reeked of boiled meats and finished off in the oven, not a smoker or open flame grill of any sorts.  That makes sense since I cannot see a place to do that in their location.  \n\nCorn bread muffins. Yeah -not.  Kernels of corn in it but could not taste the cornmeal at all. Don't go for BBQ!!  I won't recommend the place either.  Eat here at your own risk of no flavor.  \n\nI left the place and was wished a good day by staff so they are friendly, but for me...  I am paying for the food, not the ambiance.\n\nWell, I received a followup msg from owner or manager but when I provided my contact info I never received a reply. Management does not apparently care enough to take any criticism. Also others that reply to my comments are fakers as the they 2 reviews if that and look at a single checkin from all the places I go.  I like variety in my food and quality comes in many forms.  Just not from here.
