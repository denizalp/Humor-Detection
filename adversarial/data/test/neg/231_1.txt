Things have been nothing short of chaotic lately... Partly due to my grandparents having a handful of health incidents\/issues occurring almost simultaneously... Because of this they have not been able to drive their vehicle, so I've been doing basic maintenance for them to keep it in good shape... which called me to discount tire to patch up the nail one of the tires had picked up...\n\nDiscount isn't always the quickest so I had to find somewhere to kill some time. I noticed across the parking lot a coffee shop with wraps & sandwiches. Just the thing I was looking for while I wait!!\n\nWhen I walk in, a couple of regulars are chatting it up with the folks behind the counter; positive conversation and smiles, good music and good vibes are my first impression. \n\nI informed them this was my first time and I was given the run-down on some of their blended espresso drinks and then the gentleman broke down the ingredients in a few different sandwiches for me... All in a very pleasant and patient manner.\n\nI was unaware that I had arrived just before they were closing and even amidst my ignorance on the matter I did not ONCE feel rushed or like I was imposing as some restaurants make you feel near closing time (sometimes, rightfully so... But this was not the case here)\n\nIt is safe to say that I RECOMMEND this spot especially if you need to kill some time waiting on some tire service. I witnessed several regulars in the short period of time I was there each one commenting \"See you guys tomorrow!\" On their way out.\n\nAll in all. Great blended coffee, delicious bagel sandwich, and comfortable calm environment. I don't live particularly close to this area but I will be getting all of my tires done here so that I can wait over at this coffee spot! Cheers!!
