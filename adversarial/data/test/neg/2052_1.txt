I never write reviews but this is my favorite place. I have probably tried half of the menu by now and have never been disappointed. My husband and I come here often and I bring new friends here every chance I get... everyone always loves it! There is something on the menu for everyone, from vegans to those with gluten intolerances. Amazing food at a good price point and good drinks, too. I recommend the house margarita!
