For years I have been waiting for a place in my neighbourhood that delivers Japanese food! I called and found out that I live just out of their delivery area but for a completely reasonable fee, they would deliver. Not only was the phone and delivery service friendly and accommodating,  my items were all correct, at the right temperature (no sushi rice sitting in the fridge from the morning and reheated) and very tasty! I will absolutely be ordering from Lan Sushi again. Thank you!
