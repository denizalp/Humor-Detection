First time at Topgolf in Gilbert. Came in on a Friday night with no reservations and they looked very busy. As we were walking in there was 3 large buses unloading people. But still it didn't take much time to get all signed up for a lifetime membership. 2 hours seem to fly by. Lots of fun! Even though I'm not very good at it.  The staff were very friendly and helpful. We had the nachos and drinks. Our waitress was very busy and kept us served. I should have gotten her name. It was a great time with good friends. \nThank you Topgolf we will be back soon!
