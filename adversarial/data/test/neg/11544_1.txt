Such a cute place! The kpop playing is awesome! My bestie and I decided to try this place  a few weeks ago and are SO glad we did! Cute little toys on the tray add that little kitschy touch. I had the iced Nuttella latte (AH-AMAZING!!!) and my friend had an iced tea (I believe it was a green tea).\nWe will definitely be back!
