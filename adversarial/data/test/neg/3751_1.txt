I love this place! I'm so glad I found it.\nTwo Words: DUTCH. CRUNCH.\n\nI've eaten there four times so far, and already earned free chips and a drink through their rewards program!\n\nTheir \"bomb sauce\" is great and I add it to every sandwich. It is a little pricey, but if you come during their happy hour, it's a great deal!\n\nThe staff has always been friendly and fast.
