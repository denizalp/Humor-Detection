She is a good doctor and has helped me a lot with my Hashimoto's and is willing to prescribe natural meds. The only negative is the wait time and lack of friendliness with her staff. I literally have waited 50 minutes plus each visit. It just sucks to finally find a good doctor but then spend half your day waiting in the office before even getting into a room to just wait longer.  \n\nUPDATE: I ended up waiting 1 1\/1 hours total that day just for follow up blood work results.
