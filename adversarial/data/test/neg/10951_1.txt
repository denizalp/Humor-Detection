We had a great dinner for two tonight.  We had the filet mignon and the rack of lamb, which was on special.  Both dishes were delicious.\n\nWe enjoyed every aspect of our dinner from appetizers to desert!  The service was very friendly and attentive.  We will definitely return and recommend this restaurant to others.  \n\nWhat a great addition to Brooklin.
