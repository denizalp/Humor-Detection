Hob Nobs is in a cozy bungalow with a fireplace, very relaxed atmosphere. Lovely outdoor patio, sometime has live jazz, which is quite nice. Friendly staff. A vast menu.... Soups, salads, sandwiches, pizza, appetizers, smoothies, baked goods, teas, bottled sodas, beer and wine. It's well kept up, clean and food is always fresh. Each time I've gone, no complaints\/ food is always delicious. To me, if you blended your home with a caf√©, a bakery, diner and pub, you'd have Hob Nobs.\nThe only minus I can think of is their parking situation. It's very limited but there are places to park across the street.
