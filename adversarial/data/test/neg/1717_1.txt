Just saw these guys at the House of Blues on L.A.'s iconic Sunset Strip. I was expecting to be underwhelmed and I braced myself to smugly spend an evening with a gaggle of inebriated women overflowing with estrogen. I got that--and more! The humor was clever, the dancing was lively and the men were--bar none--easy on the eyes. Note to anyone expecting the dancers to go \"full Monty\": It doesn't happen. But the way they tease and titillate is terrifically  playful. A few men who professed to be gay (the venue is in West Hollywood, after all) were in the audience, too. They looked as if they were enjoying themselves as well. I'd seen New Kids on the Block a few days earlier with one of my companions from tonight. She said some of their synchronized dance moves were evocative of NKOTB. And the NKOTB guys did some pseudo-strip moves (waist up only) during their show too. But watching this group of Aussies was way more entertaining--and the only singing they did was lip-syncing to the soundtrack! Catch them on tour if you can't make it to Vegas.
