There is no milkshake in this world that can compare to the chocolate tofutti milkshake...and it's vegan?! Just awesome! The food is also out of this world...I've yet to find a vegetarian Reuben in Chicago that is even half as good as the delaney. The spinach pies are massive, so make sure you're hungry if you want to tackle one!
