One of the worst manicures i ever got, only reason you'd rating isn't lower is because my pedicure was great. Every single one of finger nails have so many bubbles it looks like i got glitter polish but not in a good way\n I was also bleeding on two fingers when i left.  Even the shape is not what i asked for but not enough mail left to fix easily.  \n\nWould never recommend this place
