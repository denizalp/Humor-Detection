Really tasty burgers with unique toppings!  This was our first visit and we really enjoyed it a lot.   Service was also pretty quick and nicely personable.  \nOn this visit, I had the French Fry Burger (features fries and beer cheese), and it was simply fantastic!  My wife had the Good Egg Burger (self explanatory) and it was great as well.  The burgers were both juicy, but not so much that it runs all over your arms, etc.\nFor the sides, we had a \nDown-side:  The Quinoa Salad...decent, but a little sweet for our tastes.  No worries, now we know\nUp-Side:  The Crafty Beans...amazing!!  I could be wrong, but these taste like real beans, rehydrated and cooked to perfection (not from a can), and they feature a nice BBQ flavor, smokiness, slightly sweet, a bit of tangy and absolutely wonderful.  We wanna take a bucket to our next cookout!!\n\nBottom line, great burgers, fantastic toppings, excellent balance of flavors and it won't break the bank!  They also have a great local brew selection.\nCannot wait to return for more!!\n\nLink below is for their November menu:\nhttps:\/\/static1.squarespace.com\/static\/5609477de4b0aafe751b4c81\/t\/58292046e6f2e13993bfcbed\/1479090265113\/CraftyBurgrMenuNovember.pdf
