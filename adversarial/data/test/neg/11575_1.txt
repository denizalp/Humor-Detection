Only my favourite gastropub!\nGreat selection of beers on tap (mostly European - but some from NA too). I love their grillhaxe (German style roasted pork knuckle), their steak is pretty good though they recently raised so it's not as good of a deal. Most other menu items are quite good as well (with the exception of their burger which tends to be overcooked\/dry).
