This five star rating is going specifically to the Mexican Speciality dishes at the Corner Cafe. In a small, \"corner of the menu\" there are four simple Mexican plates that are delicious, you have to try them. We have a hidden gem in Belleville for true, authentic Mexican food fans. No cheese sauce or bland salsas here, only fresh pico de gallo and savory, complex red salsa with lots of depth and not an overwhelming amount of heat. The beans and rice that come on the side are really authentic and yummy. Make sure you order a side of red or green sauce with the chimichanga or burrito (they don't come smothered). The fajitas are served with fresh corn tortillas, the meat and veggies are perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the guacamole is so good. The chips are made fresh, too. Thick and crunchy and seasoned perfectly to go with the great salsa. We always do take-out because the atmosphere is not too exciting; however, the staff is very nice. If you're stopping through town, this is a great option for Mexican food with few options in town these days OR if you're from here, check out something new on the menu you may have been missing out on!
