Great location.\nConveniently located on Yonge St next to Ryerson.\nNice ambiance.\nAttentive service.\nCute decor.\n\nAs for the food itself I am a bit ambivalent. They offer a fairly big selection of ingredient choices to build your bowl. I picked a few choices that are usually to my liking. Turned out I really enjoyed some of the ingredients but not quite some others. I think you have to come here a few more times to figure out the best combination, which I don't really appreciate since the price is really not low.
