I found the people here nice and super friendly but the menu needs some work.  Found the brisket was a little too fatty and the mashed potatoes were a little bland and lacked any real flavour. Pulled pork was solid though. Had a few of my wife's fries and they were also pretty good. They are starting out and I am happy there is something like this in my hood so I will give it another try.
