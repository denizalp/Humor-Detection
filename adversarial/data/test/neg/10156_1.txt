I really wanted to try this Mexican restaurant last Sunday, (Super Bowl Sunday). I went through the drive thru and ordered. When I got up to the window, I put the car in park. Through the window behind the guy taking the money was a girl. She picked her nose, blew her nose on a  used tissue, stuffed it back in her pocket and then sneezed into her hand. No way was I eating there after seeing that. I politely told the man I wanted to cancel my order. He was very polite to me and said, ok no problem. Yuck!!!!
