I have been going to this location every day for the past 3 years and I am not surprised by the turnover in employees!  This location is a hot mess and I normally do not call to report bad quality of product or service, but getting moldy food and a coffee that I could not drink was the last straw. Convenient as it is on my route to work, but not convenient throwing away my money more often than not. And don't expect a call back from store owner, he\/she probably already knows (and is tired) of hearing about it! Maybe that's why I never got a call back???
