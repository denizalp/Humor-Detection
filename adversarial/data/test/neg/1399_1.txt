I has the 1\/2  lb  burgers\/ let. , tom shredded lettuce, grilled onions , pepper jack cheese , mayo and teriyaki sauce. I like the fact that you can build your burger. I wish the burger was char broiled it would receive another star. The teri sauce was good not to sweet ,thick or runny. Very good service everyone had a smile and constantly checked up on us
