I had heard good things about this place, but I was disappointed post-meal. The decor is nifty, and that's the only good thing. Prices are a little high, especially for the quality. Nothing tasted fresh. Even the California rolls tasted like store bought sushi. No flavour, just texture. I don't plan on going back, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
