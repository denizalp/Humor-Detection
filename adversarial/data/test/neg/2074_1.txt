I really like this place. I like the options - the choices. The quick service. The good feeling I get after lunch thinking I ate something that felt healthy. Often times, this is my cheat meal.\n\nI typically opt for the tofu, shrimp and chicken bowls. I have been satisfied every time - good portions, that keep you full throughout the day. This spot is the reason I end up going for lunch more often that I intend to. I might also be bias since it''s so close to my workplace. Funny enough I prefer to walk here than bother checking out the Eaton centre food court which is connected to my office.
