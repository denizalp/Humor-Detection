I've been here twice, and both times I've had a great, juicy burger and awesome fries.  There's a good selection of toppings, and beers that you can't find everywhere else, so that's a nice touch as well.  The service is always fast and pleasant, and I leave feeling soooooooo full.  My American boyfriend who claims he couldn't get a good burger in Toronto actually loves the burgers here, that's how good it is!
