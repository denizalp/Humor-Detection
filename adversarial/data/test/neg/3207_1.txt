Review update: There's more to add.\nDay 2: The food was even more delicious day 2. We sat on the opposite side of the restaurant which was huge and had the same server as the day before which made the experience more exciting. She provided great recommendations both days. We will definitely be returning.\n\nDay 1: This was a nice experience. There was no waiting and food came out pretty quick. Located near the pool of the Rio hotel and they open at 6am. Had the French toast with pecans and bananas which was delicious and filling along with the sausage, biscuits and gravy.
