Came here this past Tuesday night, we sat at the bar which was nice because you can see the pizzas being made right in front of you. They had a wine special half off bottle wine, which was super! Me and my husband really liked the pizzas they were fresh and light. You can tell they use good quality ingredients. We also tried their dessert brownie that was soooo good! We are happy to find his place and will be back for sure!
