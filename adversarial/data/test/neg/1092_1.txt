I was told it would be 15-30 minutes \n\nI'm just getting a spot an hour and 20 minutes later\n\nSet proper expectation I was told I could start on the first floor immediately I choose to take the 2nd floor because it was a small wait well if I didn't get bamboozled I would have just gone downstairs immediately \n\nThanks for ruining my evening
