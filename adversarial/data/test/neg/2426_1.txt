What? How have I not reviewed this place yet? I thought I did. \nWell anyways, Chou kitchen. Hands down the most authentic Chinese place in Arizona, you will not find another like it. \nThey have so many awards that you can not count, that shows how good they are.\n\nI eat here every week for lunch. \nI highly suggest the steamed dumplings and meat pies! It's so amazing, your taste buds will explode with flavor. \nHighly recommend
