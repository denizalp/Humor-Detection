Appointments: They won't answer the phone.  You need to leave a message and hope that someone calls you back to schedule the appointment.  I have had returned calls within a couple hours and other times it has taken them about 5 days to get back to me to schedule.\n\nBlood work: Two of our kids have severe nut allergies, and need annual blood work done PRIOR to their annual exam.  So after finally getting a call back to schedule the appointment, I asked if they could complete the lab forms so I can pick them up and get the blood work done prior to their appointments.  They said ok and it took about 3 weeks for them to call to let me know it was ready for pick-up.  Picking up the lab forms was very exhausting... 1st attempt... I was in there for about 30 minutes, they could only find 1 file, couldn't find my other child's file.  They said they would call me when they found it... about 2 weeks later I get the call.  2nd attempt... I was in there for another 30 minutes while the lady at the front desk was trying to find the form.  She didn't know what I was talking about and had to talk to a nurse.  Finally got the 2nd lab form!  \n\nI'm glad I have been proactive in scheduling, lab work and forms for school, if not, they wouldn't have what they need when they go back to school.
