3 stars for this place but that's because it's in Vegas and there are so many opulent restaurants with amazing food in Vegas, I must hold Vegas restaurants to a slightly higher standard.\n\nAs far as steakhouses go, this wasn't bad but it wasn't anything special.  I would definitely eat at the Cut or CRAFT (actually numerous places) steak before eating here again and I haven't tried steve wynns steakhouse, but could only imagine it being better as well.\n\nI ordered the 24oz Ribeye which was good.  Turns out it was bone-in which wasn't mentioned on the menu or by the waiter.  The steak was cooked just as I ordered it and was charred nicely.  I believe the steak lacked a little salt but it was still very good.\n\nOrdered the garlic green bean side.  It was good, cant really mess up green beans.  \n\nWe had a nice bottle of Tor malbec which I highly recommend.\n\nOverall, if you aren't staying at palms then don't go out of your way to eat here.  Even if you are staying at palms, go to Venetian and eat at the Cut or Delmonicos or head to the Wynn and eat at steve Wynn steakhouse.
