As if I needed another reason to live craft beer and chocolate!!  WooHoo, this place is great!  Did a beer\/chocolate tasting.  Great pairings, unique but delicious combinations... LOVED the Oink.. White chocolate, Himalayan pink salt, balsamic glaze and bacon.  Sounds odd but soooo good.  Loved the dark chocolate lavender infused one with candied violets as well, plus they look like little peices of artwork.  Fun atmosphere ( how could it not be with that combo?). Definitely a place to visit!
