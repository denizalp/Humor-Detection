Went here for my grandmother's 85th birthday dinner - party of 6 ladies. It was a bit loud of an environment for my grandmother but since she can't really hear even in a quiet spot, it didn't really affect the awesome meal we had. Everything we ate was spectacular - beginning with oysters and burrata. I picked off of everyone's entrees but got the pakora appetizer as my main. Since I tried everything, I decided I was going to rate everyone's dishes and decide who's was best... well - that ended up being quite the difficult task considering everything tasted so great. If I had to pick, it was the pasta dish with lobster that my aunt and cousin shared. We had dessert and wine which were both really good. Everyone left very satisfied - including my grandmother. It was a bit pricey ($600 bill) but we decided it was totally worth it. Our server was also very sweet and helpful - although she did forget to split the bill and bring it to my sister who requested it at the beginning of the meal.
