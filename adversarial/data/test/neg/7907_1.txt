By far, way better service than the ones in the Bay Area!  Our waiter, Rachel, was very warm and friendly, and anticipated all of our needs...from drink refills to when our entrees will be ready (\"just a few more minutes\"), she was never late with anything.  And if you're on a health kick \/ lifestyle change like me, order the Linguini Marinara.  Even the version with whole wheat noodles was deliciosoo!!
