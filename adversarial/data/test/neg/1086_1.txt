Friendly staff. Prices were reasonable. Amazing food! Had the carne empanadas to start. Really tasty along with their home made hot sauce (not so much of a sauce, more like a salsa). Followed with the seco de carne as my entree. Love it! I always come back for it. Reminds me of home. However it is a very small space. The very tasty food make up for it.
