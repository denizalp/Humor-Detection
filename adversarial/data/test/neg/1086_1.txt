-- PLEASE READ MY REVIEW BEFORE CONSIDERING THEM FOR STATE INSPECTION --\nI have a 1999 Nissan Sentra and I went to these guys a week before my inspection expiry date, after reading these google reviews. I drive this car almost regularly, so I know that the front axle is making a bit of creaking sound due to rust issues. I gave them my car at the end of the day (around 4 pm) for inspection and until 15 mins before they close (which is 7 pm), they never bothered me to call. \n\nI called them up to inquire what's the status. They said \"Sir - we were going to all you and wanted to inform you that you have to do some work on the car in order to pass the inspection.\" When I asked them what all things need to be done and how much that amounted to, they said \"..... and it's coming to $1300 .. oh no, just a moment, its $1203.65 incl of taxes.\" I almost jumped out of my window, as none of my previous mechanics told me any issues with the car.\n\nI was so worried that I made an appointment with one of trusted mechanics, but wanted to sell of my car because of this huge cost (my mistake). Somehow, I waited for my mechanic to give me an appointment and when I took it to them, they passed the inspection like nothing ever happened to my car (as usual).\n\nThey gave me estimates as below:-\n1. Inner tie rod end (left inner) - $89.99 (Actual price on rock auto is $7.65)\n2. Inner tie rod end (right inner) - $89.99 (Actual price on rock auto is $7.65)\n3. Left CV Complete Assembly - $159.99 (Actual price on rock auto is $50.99)\n4. Right CV Complete Assembly - $159.99 (Actual price on rock auto is $50.99)\n\nBottomline - Please think twice before going to these guys, because they are no less than car showroom dealers. They will charge you less for inspection in Pittsburgh, but come up with this huge list of repairs. I believe they are totally fraud to take that $40 out of your pocket for no reason and won't even do the inspection properly.
