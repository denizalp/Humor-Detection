I am such a fan of this place. The hotel is clean, modern and everything you'd expect from a Marriott brand. But for me the staff is outstanding. They are so friendly and helpful. They go out of their way to make you feel welcome and appreciated. I had a slight snag with the shuttle but mention it to a staff person in passing and it was immediately addressed. I couldn't be happier with the results. I wish there was a bit more in walking distance but the shuttle offered by the hotel fixes that problem.
