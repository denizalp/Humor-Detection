You can be sure that I will never ever stay at the Venetian or affiliated resorts again. Worst experience ever in any of the hotels I've stayed at in Las Vegas or anywhere in the world.\n\n- Coming back to the suite after dinner (around midnight already), there was no water coming out of the faucets to wash up. I had to wake up at 3am to catch an early flight so I already only had 3 hours to sleep. I had to spend the next hour dealing with the no water issue before finally getting settled into a new suite to wash up and sleep. \n\nThe first outrageously long 30 minutes was spent on the phone being transferred and being placed on hold REPEATEDLY with the front desk before they ever offered to switch suites for me. They kept repeating that I should've gotten a note in my room to which I had to repeatedly respond that there is no note! And why does the note even matter because did they just expect me to not use the toilet, not wash my hands, or wash up before I sleep?! Next, I had to pack everything up, go all the way down to the front desk, and wait in line to get keys to the new suite. I barely had 2 hours to sleep because of the crazy chaos.\n\n- For such an expensive hotel, they provide you with NO basic necessities. $5 charge on their Venetian bottled water. Not the FIJI water. Their own Venetian bottled water. EACH. I have never experienced a hotel where they charge you for hotel bottled water. There usually always are 2 free water bottles and you can call down to housekeeping for more. With all the hassle I went through with switching the suites. They can't even comp the ridiculously priced WATER. With their highly priced rooms and resort fees, they don't even offer you WATER!\n\n- The phone system in the hotel has a lot of automated systems. Even dialing to the front desk puts you through automated messages and holds! I've never had so many issues trying to speak to an actual human being at a hotel! \n\n- The sheets were like sand paper. If you need a full body exfoliation, then sleep at the Venetian. My Airbnbs have had better sheets. I've stayed at lesser numbered star hotels on the strip with better sheets. I'm not even a picky person. I travel a lot and stay at cheap hotels and Airbnbs and have never had scratchier sheets. \n\n- Express check out e-mail is supposed to be sent to the guests on the day of check out. Of course it was not sent. I had to call the front desk again and go through automated systems and messages and holds again before I was able to talk to an actual person and check out.\n\nIs this a FIVE star hotel or not?! Unbelievable.
