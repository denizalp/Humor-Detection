The ordering process is a bit confusing and when we told them it was our very first visit and we needed help knowing the order process they still didn't make it very clear what all the options were.  Oh well, we eventually sorted it out.  And the other reviewer said that the menu board is poorly placed was SPOT ON.  As it is you have to stand back several feet to read it and then walk up to the counter to order.  It's awkward because right after you walk in the employees are asking you if they can help you, but if you are a 'first timer' then you are probably still standing 10 feet away looking straight upwards trying to decipher the menu and options.  It makes everything seem rushed and confusing.\n\nI ordered the tortilla soup and it was lukewarm as soon as took one spoonful of it.  I had to go straight back and ask the cashier to please have someone put it in the oven and heat it up, and afterwards it was delivered back to our table by a sullen employee who seemed offended that I asked them to heat up my room temperature soup.  No apologies, nothing.  (Seriously, I don't think the flame was even on under the soup pan on their stove, it was that chilled.)  \n\nMy husband's food looked better and was piping hot because they actually put it into their wood brick oven before he got it.  He liked his food a lot, I did NOT like mine at all.  To be completely honest, even if my soup had been served at a normal temperature it was bland, with very little definition or texture (aside from mush) and almost no zip.  \n\nWe both LOVED their chips and salsa though.  Delicious!\n\nWell probably be back to try them one more time as I really want these guys to succeed because I live right down the street and I love their concept, but if I get another room temperature bowl of soup it'll definitely be a MAJOR issue.
