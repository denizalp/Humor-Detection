This show was not worth the discounted priced tickets. I laughed maybe twice, but it was more of a chuckle. He asks for volunteers and then picks the people who are willing to make a fool out of themselves. He is not hypnotizing. He is just giving people a chance to act stupid and have an excuse to tell their friends that they were hypnotized. Huge waste of time standing in line. I will never go see a show about hypnosis again. Thanks Marc Savard!!!
