A Body in Balance is like my \"mother\" Pilates studio: I visit other studios but I always come back here.  I began my Pilates journey here and I have learned a lot. I feel much stronger now and more in control of my body, although I still have a ways to go. They have some great instructors - Maia, Darrelyn, Galina, Kiera - just to mention a few. I like that socks are required and the studio and equipment are kept very clean.
