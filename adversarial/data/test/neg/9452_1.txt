Decided to go last minute for dinner. Got sat immediately and with a friendly greeting by Michael. My daughter ordered her favorite:  mini corn dogs and fresh fruit - always great! I ordered the Enlightened Mediterranean Chicken Tacos. These were delicious! Michael was a great server and we look forward to coming back again. Highly recommend BJ's - always delicious food and great service! AND it was FREE pizookie night!!
