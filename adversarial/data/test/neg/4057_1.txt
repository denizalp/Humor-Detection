This is our favorite Mexican food ever.  We had two house margaritas.  Nice big glass...but had a lot of ice.  :(. The chips and house-made salsas were amazing!  Husband had 3 tacos, rice and beans.  I had the fajita taco salad.  Everything was outstanding.  The ingredients tasted so fresh!  Dinner with two house Margaritas was $45 without tip.
