The place was good and the lady who had served was helpful . The beer served was frothy and chips were nice and crispy . The scotia movie theatre was a stones throwaway. It's a good place on a Friday night to catch a beer after the movie . P.s if you are game lover , u would definitely enjoy this place ...
