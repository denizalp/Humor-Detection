Sad News, my fellow NIBers. The buffet has been discontinued indefinitely.:-(  I was surprised and disappointed to discover this today when my sister and I went there for lunch. A couple different boring combo plates are now available, with some variations possible. Of course, there is still their delicious chaat menu and their regular menu. Lunch business was nearly non-existent, not surprisingly  At least one group, that we recognized as regulars, left when they discovered the buffet was not available. No doubt, others did as well.
