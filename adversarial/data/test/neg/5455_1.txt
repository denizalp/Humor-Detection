A typical Taiwanese bubble tea spot with a good variety of snacks. The ambience and interior decoration is descent however it felt a bit overcrowded and busy with all the people waiting outside.\n\nMy friend and I went and we ordered a Mango Shaved Ice ($7.99) and a Sesame Brick Toast ($4.99). We added 60 cents extra for Mochi for the Shaved Ice and it was well worth it! The brick toast wasn't anything special and they just put a spread of sesame on toast so I would not recommend that. However, the shaved ice was really good. The Mango Shaved ice included a scoop of Vanilla ice cream, lychee jelly, mango fruit balls, and condensed milk!\n\nOverall I would come again for a quick snack however not for anything more, as the WiFi was down and the environment felt a bit hectic (maybe it would be different if I went at a different.)
