This is one of the nicest hotels I've stayed at in Vegas. It's close to the airport and about 15 minutes away from the strip depending on traffic. The hotel itself is clean and our room was spotless when we checked in. Their complimentary breakfast spread is pretty good, it's from 6 am to 10 am which is a good time frame. I like how they set out warm cookies for guests at night and there's also a shuttle to Mandalay bay. Probably my only annoyance would be the water pressure in the shower was really low but we only stayed for one night so it wasn't too bad. Overall I had a good stay and if I'm looking for a hotel that's close to the airport I'd definitely choose this hotel.
