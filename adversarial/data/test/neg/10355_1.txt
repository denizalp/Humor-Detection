The School of Rock is a magical place where budding musicians grow wings! The feeling of rock and roll pervades the space yet the attitude of staff and students is respectful, kind, energetic. When music is in your soul, it shouldn't be a painful extraction process to let it out...and School of Rock understands this. They get students directly to the fun part right away and give them confidence to explore their passion while still instilling work ethic, practice and technique. My 10 year old loves it and so do I. So happy we found it!
