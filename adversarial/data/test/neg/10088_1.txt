I agree that the novelty factor is a 5 star experience but the food isn't the greatest.  It's not bad but for 32 to 39 per person just for food (no drink), I expected much better\nI had the octopus and filet mignon.  The octopus was okay, but a tad salty and slightly chewy.  The filet mignon tasted good but it was the equivalent to the Keg, which is much cheaper.  I think if there was a special occasion, or someone out of town visiting, I might take them there, but its not a \"recurring\" everyday place.  Overall, not bad, but not wowed by any means.
