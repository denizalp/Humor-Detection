It's a $42 dollar oil. They claim to clean your windows and vacuum your carpet. They literally didn't vacuum a single part of my car. I showed the manager and he offered to do it himself, I said forget it. The rest of the staff was just sitting and texting on their phones. It was an awkward waste of money, at best. I'll never do business there again.
