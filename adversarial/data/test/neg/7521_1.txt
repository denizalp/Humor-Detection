This was my first time finally getting to go to the cheesecake factory since they've opened and it seemed that a lot of people were hyping about it so i wanted to experience it myself and see what the hype was all about. \n\nMy experience i had there was good. I got the chicken crusted parmesan dish which tasted pretty good, but it was too salty which i would assume to be because of the amount of cheese on the chicken and the green beans that came with it could've been boiled more in my opinion. The portion size of the food is pretty big and very filling so i felt i got my money worth when it comes to that. Also, the waiter we got was very nice and he made a lot of jokes with his guests which made the experience even better.\n\nHowever, the waiting time isn't getting any better and i wouldn't expect to any time soon just because with it being the only location in Toronto its pretty busy especially in the evenings. We waited 70 mins to be seated, but we did walk around the mall which made the time pass by more quickly. \n\nI will for sure be returning again, but would try something different on the menu. Oh and yes the cheesecake slice is small for it to be $10.
