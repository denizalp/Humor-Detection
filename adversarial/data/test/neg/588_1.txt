Great lunch spot if you get there before the line is outside. I've had about 5 or 6 hotdogs and a few of their subs and a wrap. All of them are delicious and plenty more than filling. Great quality. Definitely recommend a Bahama mamma in place of you hotdog whenever they have them in stock. It cost a little more(bit much) and is amazing. I try to stop in once a week. Very friendly people with the eight price for the eats.
