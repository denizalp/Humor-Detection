I have been SO SICK AND TIRED of this library. It's never quiet enough and it's super outdated. Has anyone tried to find a computer here during finals? or the last two weeks prior to the end  of the semester? NO way. \n\nSince the opening of the Taylor Family Digital Library I have found a new place to call home. \n\nSorry MacKimmie -- you've been good to me over the years, but I gotta trade you in for the newer sleeker high tech Digital Library.. totally worth crossing the 15+ for! \n\n(One of my key frustrations with this place are the bathrooms! argh!)
