We used to love to go to this place for a special brunch in our neighbourhood. This time we saw the price hike and walked right back out. Brunch would have to be made of saffron and pearls to justify $18 $19 for most plates. I'd rather spend that on a reliably delicious dinner. This place was good, but the prices are a shameless gouge. Not going back.
