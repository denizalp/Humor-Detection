Worst place to live. Filled with roaches.  Management sucks and all they want is your money to do nothing.  Water leaks in multiple apartments.  Be careful if you have a dog because this is the most dog unfriendly complex on the strip.\nYour dog will not be allowed in the elevator or in the lobby but somehow has to get back and forth from your apartment to the dog park.  \n\nWe spent a year here and could not wait until our lease ended.\n\nWatch out for the manager Mindy Dent - she will take your money and give you false promises of a beautiful apartment.  They will find ways to keep your ridiculously high (3 months rent) deposit and not give it back to you. \n\nMindy also fired a loyal staff member after they found out she was pregnant. WOW!!\n\nBottom line: they are con-artists.  New management is needed badly!!!
