I used to LOVE Mi Taco (pause for laughter).\n\nTheir shrimp tacos were heavenly and much like every other fast food burrito \/ taco place in Toronto, you could choose your toppings - custom bowls for everyone! But sadly, things have changed.\n\nYou can now only order off of a menu of pre-arranged items - if you don't want something you have to go through the add this \/ take away this \/ are there any other options for this? process. It was so much easier when my choices were beautifully & freshly laid out in front of me. Gone are your rice options, and the bright green lettuce is now replaced with brown shrively pieces of what I am assuming was once leaves. It's a pain to look through my order to ensure that substitutions are there and items aren't missing - this may seem picky, but having the ability to make a custom bowl or taco was what I loved about this - and all burrito - places.\n\nNext time I'll skip my once beloved Mi Taco, and instead take the extra 20 steps to Mucho Burrito where my options are a-plenty.
