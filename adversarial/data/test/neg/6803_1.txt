We really liked this place.  I had the shrimp risotto and the rest of my party ordered the margherita flat bread, lasagna and the bacon wrapped pork.  Everyone must've liked their dishes because we all finished our food; except for my husband who loaded up on the yummy bread and pesto dipping sauce beforehand.   My dish was perfectly cooked and the portion sizes are just right.  All around good food with great ambiance.  It's also a fun place to people watch!
