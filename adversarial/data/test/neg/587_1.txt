Sarah is absolutely great, one of the best stylists I've ever had! When I first arrived in Pittsburgh (originally from California) I had an extremely hard time finding a hair stylist, I am very particular about my color and wanted to find someone that specializes in creating the perfect colors and tones. My friend recommended Destefino and told me about her stylist Sarah. Well, Sarah has been a godsend, every time I leave the salon I receive countless compliments, even from strangers! She typically books out pretty far in advance, a truly great sign of a talented and passionate stylist. Not only is she talented, but she is an absolute sweetheart, she makes you feel comfortable and talks to you about life (if you want!). One other thing I would like to mention, Sarah's assistant Bekah gives mini head massages during the shampooing process, simply amazing!  \n\nNow for DeStefino itself, it is a top quality salon, always extremely clean and I love the interior design of the place. Always the perfect temperature, great hair products (cheaper than online I've found), and they even have great makeup and skin care products. Every single person that works here is incredibly warm and welcoming and makes you feel at home. One of the first questions they ask is if you would like any coffee or tea, so hospitable! Although their prices can be a little bit higher, you honestly get what you pay for.
