First time eating Indian in Chandler. I'm visiting from the PNW and my relatives asked if Indian was okay. I'm a huge fan of Indian food so of course I agreed. The food was great. Small portions but good. I felt like I was full enough but could probably still eat more if available. We ordered two main dishes and some garlic naan for the four of us. I feel like these portions were just smaller than other Indian places. One of the curry chickens came attached to the bone so I didn't eat a much of that chicken than the other chicken that came pre-cubed. I say great food, although I guess I have high expectations of Indian food from where I live in Portland, OR and Tacoma, WA. I'm sad they didn't offer anything like chicken or more importantly lamb kabobs. Good for takeout !! Oh and definitely ask if you have the right number\/restaurant when you call. We got confused when the lady who answered the phone only said, \"hello\" and then the ID number came up on the tv as a \"spa\" so I guess they offer more than just Indian dishes !! :-\/
