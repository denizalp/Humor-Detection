While the food at Beer Bistro is good, particularly the fries and mussels, the attitude is the worst.\nThe bar has 2 areas, a large diner's section and Ã  over crowded drinks only Section and mary the two shall meet.\nDespite working locally and visiting  numerous times, the staff never acknowledged our frequent attendance and wouldn't allow our group to sit in Diner's section even at 4:30 pm when the area was dead empty. \nA place that does not make customer service a priority does not deserve customers.\nGo if you like attitude as a side with your overpriced craft beer.
