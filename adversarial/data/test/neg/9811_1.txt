4 stars because i wanted to love this place but I drove 30 minutes just to get home & discover my order was wrong. I even showed them a picture of what I wanted, yet they still got it wrong. But they gave me a refund so I guess that makes up for getting the order wrong. The food was ok, not worth the hype, the burger was under cooked & the prices are too steep for the qualities food they put out. The wait time was insane as well. Interior was nice they had anime playing on the tv. I am willing to give them another chance & will definitely make sure I check my food before I leave.
