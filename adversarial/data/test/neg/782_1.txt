I'll head over there this week and play, and update this.  I must say however, that when last entertaining clients in May and in June, both of the boards had been removed. Only the giant paintings of dartboards remained. The bartenders both took a message for management asking about it, and I never heard back. An employee out in the yard said you got rid of them so you could have giant darts,(to match the giant games theme). That sounded unlikely and dangerous.\nI'm glad to hear that the regulation dart boards are back and so will my clients!  The Oasis is a great place to stay and the Spike has been a great place to play. Thank you for the good news!!\n\nUpdate 9\/17\/17: either the manager is a liar, or he has no idea what a dartboard is. Here is what he calls 'real dartboards. What a joke.  They used to have regulation boards up. I complained, the manager responded as if they'd been there all along and I must've missed them.  No. You took em down, told me in your response that they were up.  No surprise that we've found other places to entertain and take clients to. Bad management decision. Again. \nUpdate: 2\/26\/18\nProper darts are back at The Gold Spike!  \nVery happy they've changed their minds. Great little restaurant there now.  Great staff
