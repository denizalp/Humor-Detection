Let me start by saying I never have written a review on yelp but after eating at Posidon I just felt I had too. This place is absolutely wonderful the food is excellent and the service is better than most 5 star restaurants. We had the humus, spanakopita, the gyro plate, and the souvlaki, as well as the free pita chips with tzatziki they start you out with. Everything was beyond our expectations. We even ordered a bag of the pita bread to take home with us. Prices are really great most plates are under $10 most appetizers are below $5 and the portions are huge. If you haven't ate at Posidon you are missing out. My new favorite restaurant.
