Coming out of the MGM pool we decided to drop by and grab a dog.  This place was horrible.  It took almost 20 minutes to get three hot dogs and a fries (no that's not all for me...).  The buzzer thingies didn't even match the recipes!  While we were standing there, there was a couple that said they had been waiting for almost 30 minutes and one of the workers gave their food to someone else.  If I knew it took that long to get fast food, I woulda called ahead for reservations.
