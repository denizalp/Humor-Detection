Just like last year this is Maybe this is the Very best of PHX area Festivals with a vast assortment of local businesses  of many kinds and the awesome food vendors that were very generous with free samples and money off coupons to visit them. (Spinato's Pizza samples were really big and good and the St. Francis gave out big cups of delicious Pumpkin Soup) This festival was so organized in every way it was a pleasure. They had free parking in the garage ,many stations set up for hand washing, provided bottled water and they had places all over where you could sit . I enjoyed purchasing local produce from a vendor . They had activities for kids and vendors selling beautiful things from sunglasses-kitchen serving ware.The Festival was really a labor of love for the community.
