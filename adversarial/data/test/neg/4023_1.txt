I will start by saying I am born and raised in Texas so I have very high expectations of BBQ. These expectations have not been met anywhere in Arizona until I tried Tom's Thumb. This is a great little spot inside of the car wash. \n\nI did have one bad experience where the plastic wrap that they keep the meat in was actually INSIDE of my pulled pork sandwich. This was very disturbing to me and left a bad taste in my mouth. I was even more surprised that they did not do anything for me in this situation. This could have been a serious choking hazard and made someone sick if not kill them. \n\nNever the less, the food is usually always great and they just had one mess up. I won't hold that against them forever because mistakes happen. \n\nIf you want some good BBQ this is the place to go!
