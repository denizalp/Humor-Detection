Gotta say this place is disappointing. Such a great name, it has to be a fun late night place, right? Nope!!!  They have a good beer selection, but no one who knows anything about beer.  The food is OK, but the atmosphere is just sad. They really want to close by 10:00, so don't plan on sticking around.
