I like Ru Sans. It's good if you're craving sushi and you want something quick and easy. The vibe in there is very casual. The food is good, but it's far from fancy. They have a good selection of rolls and the prices are reasonable. The waitstaff is also quite good.\n\nThe lunch buffet is craaaazy. It's a great value, but it's unlike any sushi buffet I've ever been too. It's pure chaos. But they have a lot of sushi and non-sushi options. If you're willing to put up with the chaos, it's a great deal. \n\nI tried the ramen there and although it tasted good, it wasn't authentic ramen. If you're used to ramen in NY, SF or DC, don't order it here. But it's not a bad soup. \n\nI like it here if I want something quick and easy. I'm not blown away, but it's pretty good. Ideally I'd give it 3.5 stars, but I tend to round up. 4 it is.
