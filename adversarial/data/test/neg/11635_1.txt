My experience with this rental location is quite different comparing to the two previous reviews.  I rented a car for two weeks during the Christmas break.  I had 3 different staff persons serviced me during the pick up, rental processing and drop off, all of which were courteous, knowledgeable, and customer friendly.  I know because I saw how they treated other customers in person and over the phone.  Kyle the office manager was especially accommodating to the ice storm affected customers.  I rent frequently at airports in a lot of US cities, and this by far THE best experience I have had in a long time.  It was very refreshing to see a rare true customer service.
