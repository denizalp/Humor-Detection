Best all you can eat Brunch (tapas style).  Also $10 bottomless mimosas (you can choose from over a dozen juices) so there's many variations.\n\nFantastic service with an amazing outdoor scene by palm trees and the lazy river.\n\nAfter 10 plates and 10 mimosas (I'm a large and tall guy) I'm one happy camper .  Had I found this place before my last day in Vegas I would have eaten here daily.
