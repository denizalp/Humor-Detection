Greenland might just be my new favorite Asian market in Vegas!!! My man and I decided to hit this place up (over one of our other favs, the newer SF market) to see if we could find uni... and lo, and behold, we hit the jackpot and then some!! We found our scrumptious uni inside the seafood area where a conspicuous \"A\" (a la NV Dept. of Health) was proudly displayed behind the counter. But we were in for treat after treat.... shisito peppers, frozen BBQ Unagi, sushi-quality tuna, tako and hamachi (SLURP), and red bean mochi that is delish!! It doesn't get much better than this, I tell you!! I also discovered a new fav at one of the food stalls in the front of the store-- a tuna kimchi rice roll. YUM!! I'm salivating just thinking about it..... \n\nActually, the cutest part: we were looking for Unagi sauce and a passerby, who took pity on us, tried to help us hunt it down. As our searches met with failure, he asked his Japanese born wife to start looking for it too. Pretty soon, the whole store was involved!!! \n\nGo to Greenland -- you will find some great Asian food (cooked or uncooked) at decent prices, and you'll meet some nice folks!!
