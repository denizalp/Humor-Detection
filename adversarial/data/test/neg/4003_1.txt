Albinas is one great Italian bakery.... Your best to arrive early to get your hands on the fresh pastries available at Albinas.  It's not a large store and is unfortunately tucked inside a fairly large shopping center making it less accessible unless you know exactly where it is.\n\nThe store isn't very descriptive with its items but the staff is more than happy to answer any questions you may have.
