Great food and great service! Cute atmosphere! We had the club sandwich and LA wrap with a cup of beef vegetable soup! My husband said it was the best club sandwich he's had!! The bacon was cooked just right and the turkey was very tasty. My daughter and I shared the wrap and it was awesome! Perfectly combined ingredients without having too much ranch dressing!! \n\nWould definitely eat here again! I love when the menu has so many things that look good, it's hard to choose!
