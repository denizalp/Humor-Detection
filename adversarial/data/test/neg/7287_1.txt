Stopped by Butcher & the Brewer for the 1st time last night & loved it! We were able to grab a spot at the bar no problem & were greeted shortly thereafter by an extremely cute bartender, 'Tinnie' (sp?). \n\nI ordered a German draft, The Repeater, & the smoked lamb ribs. The ribs were good (just a little fatty for me), the beer was excellent & the service was even better!\n\nUnfortunately, we didn't have time to stay very long; however, I will definitely make it a point to stop by this place again!
