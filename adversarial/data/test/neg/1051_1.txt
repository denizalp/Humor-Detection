My wife found this randomly and we hiked across the city to grab a bite. It's in a gorgeous neighborhood, tucked into the street's facade. \n\nUnfortunately we got there a bit too early and could only have drinks. Kind of a bummer but we should have paid better attention. \n\nReally nice inside. Friendly staff and good selection of beer.
