Had a great lunch here! We randomly stopped out of convenience on our way to a dessert tour. The food was great and staff very personable and friendly! Sandwiches and salads were great and very fresh. A pleasant surprise for somewhere we didn't know. The raspberry vinaigrette is homemade and SO good!!
