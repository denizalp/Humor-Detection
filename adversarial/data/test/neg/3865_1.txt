We came here with another couple who are regulars at this location. We had great service from the beginning to the end. I was surprised at how slow they were for a friday night.\n\n Chips and salsa were good. We ordered the guacamole and it was a little bland for my taste. \nI got the combo-taco, burrito and rice and beans and really enjoyed it My husband got the chicken fajitas and he liked it a lot. \n\nOverall, the experience was good. It is kind of a hike from our location but we would definitely consider coming back!
