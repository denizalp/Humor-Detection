Absolutely love Dr.Tabassi from the first day I met her! She makes you feel so comfortable and talks to you like she's known you for a while now! She answered every question I had for during my pregnancy and during labor she did an amazing job!  I hope I still live in Las Vegas for my second child. Highly recommend her !
