Great patio (in the back)...sit at a table or lounge on the couches. Servers were extremely knowledgeable, good wine recs. Brie appetizer was delicious, the accompanying hummus was a bit bland. Salmon and lamb entrees flavorful, fresh and good portion size. Service was timely. Absolutely a chill environment, you can get in and out OR you can hang out!!
