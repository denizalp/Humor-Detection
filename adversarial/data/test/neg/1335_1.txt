I have been with Lucas Lawn Care since I bought my house 3 years ago. I have been very pleased with them!! Anytime I have some kind of issue with my yard they handle it or refer me to someone who can take care of it. These guys will have my business as long as I own my home. I highly recommend you use them for any of your landscaping needs. It is really nice not to have to worry about my yard...especially in a neighborhood with an HOA. Thanks Ryan!!!
