I got the shishito peppers and the crispy pork shank.  Both were excellent.  The pork shank is definitely very crispy.  It comes with kimchi, naan, and buttermilk dressing.  It's almost like another take on Peking duck.  Delicious.\n\nJamie was my server and she was totally on the ball and also very warm and friendly.  She welcomed me as an out of towner and made good beer and food suggestions.  Service was perfect.\n\nThe bathroom is a community bathroom with stalls.  But the stalls are still marked M and W, which honestly kinda pissed me off.  Come on people, a stall is a stall.  There is no difference.  Please welcome all genders.  Also, the water taps tended to spray, though they did make for a nice effect.  And then there was the Dyson hand dryer hiding in the corner seeming very out of place.  Ok I think that's enough on the bathroom.\n\nThe place is quite large and very loud, like very loud.  At least it's very loud on a Friday night at 10pm.  It's possible that earlier would've been a little quieter and more manageable for a date.\n\nOverall great food, beer, and service.  Bathroom need a little work, and it's potentially too loud for a date.  Definitely worth a visit!
