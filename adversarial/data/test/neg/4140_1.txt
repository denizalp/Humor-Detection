I was excited to go here but the service was so bad.  Waited for a hostess forever \n\nWaited so long for a server.  Then drinks took forever.  Food took even so long manger said sorry for wait.  Didn't offer us a thing.  Food and drinks were good but so many choices in Scottsdale don't be hungry if your going here. You might not get your food.
