I'm being generous with two stars that's just because they are opened late. When we got here it was packed! I ordered the XXl Burger and I asked the lady what's the best fries because they have different choices she told me the chili cheese fries. I asked her let me get those without chili and just make them cheese fries.. When I saw those fries after I ordered them I was very disappointed it was like they took American cheese and put it on top and let it melt. I was very confused on how you mess up cheese fries it's very easy. Anyways the burger was big but tasted like nothing if that makes any sense. The bun was like dry and not soft it was gross I needed a lot of coke to wash it down with. After I eat it my stomach wasn't happy for a while. This place is over priced and gross. I'd rather find another burger place that actually cares about your food.
