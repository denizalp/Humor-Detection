Not the place to go if you're in a hurry. We dined in this past week, with reservations, and it took just shy of two hours to serve our lunch food (sandwiches and flatbreads, nothing crazy). Sever was inattentive. Most restaurants around here are excellent at accommodating working (one hour) lunches.. not Walnut Grill.\nFood was good - but I would never come back for lunch.
