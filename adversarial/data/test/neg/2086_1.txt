I have a really bad experience here in 2008. But I'm truly surprise how things have change! My best friend is getting marry. She have no idea what type of styles or anything about the dresses that she wants. So I mentioned to look at David's Bridal. It's have a vary of sizes, styles and budget.  BUT MAKE SURE YOU SET AN APPOINTMENT. They will be rude to you if you don't even tho they will still serves you! \nOur appt was Sunday, May 15 at 1pm. We arrived at 12:40pm. Greeted by a gentleman by the door. He wasn't very friendly, short answer and look at us like we are inconveniencing him. He checked us in, but said nothing else. We were left standing there like we're lost. Wondering around, not quite sure what to do with ourselves. Find a really nice gentleman greeted us exactly at 1pm. \nHe mentioned to Robin that it will take him another 5 mins to pull at the dresses she was interested in from the website. The ones she marked as favorites. After that, everything went smoothly. He was a doll. Added the right accessories. Help her in and out of her dresses. I took the pics, etc. pointed out different details to the dress that we didn't notice before. Overall, she's in love. And we love the guy that help us with the dresses. But definitely NOT that gentleman at the front. When we getting ready to leave. He still have that same face. Whoever puts him there, they need to switch him out with a friendlier version!
