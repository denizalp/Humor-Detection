I've been here a couple of times and have thoroughly enjoyed the massages. It's a small and cozy spa, with great employees who are eager to fix you up and make you feel brand new. The ambiance is very relaxing, and that says a lot coming from me since half the time I can't relax until the massage is over. \n\nI got a manicure once and it was.... average. However, the massages have been great and modestly priced. For 90 minutes, you can get a full body massage for 100$. It's so worth it. If you're going with your significant other, or a friend, you can share a room as well.
