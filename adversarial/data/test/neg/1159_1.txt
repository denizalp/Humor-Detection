This business receives 5 stars because of Ashley. She is amazing. Meticulous is the first word I would use to describe her nail technique. \n\nHer regular manicure lasts days longer than any I have had in the past from other nail technicians. When she does a gel she takes the polish to the cuticle rather than leaving a gap. \n\nShe is the only person I now go to.
