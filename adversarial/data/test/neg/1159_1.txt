I was excited to try this place as it had good reviews and was fairly close to where I live. The food and atmosphere were decent. My overall opinion was that I'm not sure why this place got such high ratings\/reviews. It was decent but not any different from any of the other mediocre sushi places all over Toronto. Perhaps because sushi places are scarce in that area of the city? Prices were good but I felt like you're getting what you pay for. The boat we got had enough sushi for the price we were paying. You won't get anything other than the basics either. But considering the price, you can't expect more. \n\nHave nothing negative really to say about this place but definitely NOT as special as the reviews make it seem.
