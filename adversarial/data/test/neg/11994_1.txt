I'm a fan of southern food and as southern food outside of the actual south goes, this place is extremely good. A friend and I accidentally found it when looking for a nice place to eat during a recent visit to the Palazzo\/Venetian and were extremely impressed. The service was excellent, the drinks were solid and the fried chicken was phenomenal. A great place for a reasonably priced meal in Vegas before losing all your money at the tables.
