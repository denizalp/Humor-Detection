This is literally one of the best locations to stay in while you're hanging out in \nToronto.\nThe hotel is more than nice. It has many of the luxuries one would have at home. \nIts right in the middle of downtown Toronto within walking distance of many of the sights tourists like to see and visit. \nThere are several clubs directly across the street if you're there for that. \nIf not, be careful because you can hear club music while you're attempting to sleep but I personally didnt find it overwhelming. \nIts also within walking distance to the local university a large mall and a large underground transportation system that connects you with shopping, downtown, eateries, and the local university. \nQueen and King street are very popular downtown in Toronto and HGI is \nsmack dab in the middle of both streets. The staff was wonderful and made us \nfeel more than welcome. \nThe next time i travel to toronto I will more than likely stay at the HGI
