I move to Vegas 2 years ago from Los Angeles.  Every stylist I went to ruined my hair.  I was about to give up until I purchased a Groupon for the Boulevard Salon. I checked on yelp and saw the reviews for Jessica so I made my appt with her.  All I have to say is WOW!!!!!  Jessica nailed the haircut.  Best haircut I have ever had.  I get so many compliments.  I have been back twice with the same results and am so happy to find a stylist who knows what they are doing.
