Did the buffet which was like 40 bucks including party gratuity and fee for wasted food I guess; came beee for a friends birthday party with a group of 11 and felt pressured to leave ASAP even whilst eating.\nChicken felt disgusting to eat tbh cause it was slimy and it was just bad quality food in small portions.\nNever going there again.
