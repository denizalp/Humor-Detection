Great Hot Dogs!!! We had the Angry Dog, West Coast Dog, and a order of large fries. Both were very tasty. The spicy mayo on the Angry Dog was really delicious. Also the seasoning on the fries was so good. Definitely will be going back. One thing we did notice FYI, the menu's are a little outdated but check out the \"WALL\" because there are some sweet combinations that are not on the paper Menu!!!
