Gave this place 1 more try... Previous i was bundled into a takeout work order with coworkers and the food seemed mehhhh chinese places should make sure their rice is perfect... \n\nI tried the Chili Relleno and Jade Chicken W, Chicken Fried Rice. - dont like any kind of beans so got those wrapped to go,\n\nWife had Machaca n ???? pork fried rice and salad\n\nFood was average, nothing off the hook, but the mix of the cultures made for a good eat.. \n\nSeriously dont know how Guy Fieri came across this place,, definitely not a place to go out of your way to try.\nWe will maybe stop by every 3 months or so..
