Jered of Advance Home Solutions was able to solve our problem with our AC. A few months ago I had the same issue and non of the recommended companies chosen by my Home warranty insurance ( Ice Cube co. is a disaster! ) fixed the issue. We suffered heat exhaustion for several days to the point that it was so unbearable which prompted me to make a decision to get help from a different company non affiliated with the Home warranty. They fixed the problem but with a price.. This time OMG! its like a miracle Jered rectified the problem in a heartbeat!! I almost cancelled my subscription , until AHS sent  Jered of Advanced Home Solutions
