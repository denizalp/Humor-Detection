Great family jewelers! The people who work here are mostly family and everyone was patient, kind and informative. I had them resize my diamond ring that is over two carats and I had been unsure of a trustworthy place to bring it to get sized until I found this family owned company. I totally felt safe and secure leaving my diamond ring with them to be sized and I would highly recommend them.
