I love this market. Although it is a Korean market they still have other non-Korean food items from Japan and China. \n\nWhat I love though is how clean, organized and well stocked this store is! Ingredients are labeled well and usually in English somewhere. This is helpful to those of us that love these foods buy can't always decipher the original label.\n\nThe have a nice seafood section although probably not as big as some of the other asian markets. They will clean them to order, however. They have a nice selection of sashimi cuts such as salmon, ahi, hamachi, and white tuna. This varies as I have also seen uni and octopus. just look for the freshest ones!\n\nThe food court just outside of the grocery is worth a look too. The food is pretty cheap and also tasty!
