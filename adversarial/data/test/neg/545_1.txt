Not the best place I've been, but not the worst. They are a little pushy - I told them I didn't want callus removal, and the pedicure tech was convinced that she was going to make it happen. Got a pedicure, and it looks good, I'm curious to see how long it lasts. Would maybe go here again in a pinch.
