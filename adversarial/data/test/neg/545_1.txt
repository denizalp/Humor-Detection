This is my local Starbucks and it is awesome. It is usually not as busy as other Starbucks so I've rarely had an issue finding a place to sit or an outlet. The baristas are fast and extremely friendly and the drive through is also pretty fast. I've come here for years and it has always been consistent and I've noticed that they don't have a really high employee turnover rate which is great because the baristas actually know what they're doing. They are also really good at getting to know their regulars and also extremely professional
