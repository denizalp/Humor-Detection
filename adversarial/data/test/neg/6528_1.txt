This place definitely deserves all 5 stars. We came here on a recent trip to Scottsdale and this was recommended to us. We sat down and were promptly met by our waitress. She explained the menu to us and how the menu is set up. They have a great beer selection for Asian fusion and they were more than willing to let us sample a few that we haven't heard of before. Also, if you check in on Yelp, you get free Edamame. The portions are very big and the service was great. Below you will see what we ate.\n\nFood:\nEdamame: done just right with a good amount of salt\nPotstickers: You can tell they are homemade. I wasn't a huge fan but I like the store bought ones. The other 2 people I was with really enjoyed them.\nLings Seafood Hot Pot: Fantastic- the curry and coconut milk go together perfectly. It had a lot of mussels in it and it was really good. Just spicy enough but the coconut helped calm it.\nBudda's Feast with steak- steak was done perfectly and the portion was huge. I got mine with the brown rice and it complimented it well. The veggies were cooked to perfection and the sauce was awesome. I am so sad I left my leftovers at the place we were staying.\nSurf and Turf- Again, another excellent dish. The portion was great, steak was cooked just right, lots of veggies and the shrimp was not overcooked at all. We got the fried rice with this one and wow- best fried rice I have ever had. It was fresh and you could certainly tell.\n\nI very much recommend going there. I wish there were one closer that I could go to again. The only tip I would give to people going there is: don't order too many apps because the portions are big and you will get full quickly.
