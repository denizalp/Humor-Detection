Had stopped coming to BLD for dinner 2-3 years ago after the staff changes and thought I would try it again and check out the BBQ menu...damn glad I did. While BBQ purists will argue it's not true \"Q\" since the brisket has no smoke ring, it is excellent and fall apart moist. You simply cannot find a better deal for $16 than the two meat platter with sides and cornbread muffins. My wife and I split it and still had leftovers. Kudos to the fun bartender who recommended the amazing sausages as the second meat item. I hate it when you ask for a recommendation and they tell you it's all good. Only reason not giving five stars is the amount of time it took after we ordered.
