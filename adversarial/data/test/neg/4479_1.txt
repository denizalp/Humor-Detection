Not sure what people see is great in this restaurant.  Below average food, difficult to categorize as french, wait staff was undeservedly arrogant ( maybe this contributes to some people thinking its better than it really is), service was painfully slow, steak special was way overdone, but took so long that we didn't want to send back.  Ambiance is stuffy, distractingly quiet, and definitely not french.  Very boring, Nothing interesting.  I cant find anything that stands out from a positive aspect.  5 of us had dinner, only one entr√©e was good, the rest; very disappointing.  Unfortunately a waste of time for all of us, couldn't wait to leave.
