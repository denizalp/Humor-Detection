I really liked my stay here. The room was comfortable, the bed exceptionally so, the fitness center was spacious and had a fair bit to offer, and parking was free and easy. Location-wise, everything is quite accessible by car or monorail, and I really enjoyed being a couple of blocks (and we're talking Vegas-sized blocks) away from the madness of the strip.
