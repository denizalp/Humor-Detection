Mr Chow LV blew me away. First and foremost, the restaurant is beautiful, sparkling white! The staff are experts at what they do, I recommend letting them choose for you. Our server did an amazing job selecting items for our party. Everything from start to finish here was outstanding, I cannot wait to return! This place is an absolute must if you're looking for a great spot for dinner in Vegas !
