I tried Avenue B for the first time a couple nights ago. I went with my parents, who had been once before over the summer, and had a good experience then. Our waitress was pleasant and service was quick but not so speedy you felt like your dinner was over before it started. I had the vegetarian spaghetti squash chilli relleno. The waitress warned me it would be very spicey, and indeed it was! If you're looking for a spicey dish, I would recommend this. My mom thought her dish (the scallops and mung fish) was too salty, but she is particularly sensitive to salt. We were a little disappointed by the dessert portion, particularly of the ginger bread cake with egg nog ice cream. There were two small pieces of cake and one TINY scoop of ice cream. Of course, most American restaurants have ridiculously huge portions of food, and I appreciate when a restaurant gives you a reasonable amount to eat, but if you are excited about one of the desserts, don't plan on sharing!
