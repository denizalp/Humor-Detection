Came over for a birthday dinner since it is so close to our new home and the reviews are pretty good. What a disappointment!!! Sunday evening they only have 2 sections open. So we waited for our table. We told one of the waitress that we will be outside after she took our name. While we were outside saw that more people started coming at least 5 more families. One of the waitress ask for our name again so we said we already had our name down. But some some reason, the other waitress( one of the three) crossed our name off without asking or communicated with her co workers! And she go ahead and continue seated other families before us! And we told  her that she skipped us and she said \"ok, I know\". So pretty much at that point my boyfriend and i don't want anything to do with her at all!!!! \nGet to the point the food is ok. Nothing special than just low price sushi. \nThe service is shitty!! If you are the first time customer here and they don't know you, you are pretty much do not exist to them!!!!3 waitresses working the front, don't have to serve food just drinks and still can't make it ok. We have to go up to them and asked for our ticket and tell you what we had??? Not just us but the couple next to us had to do the same thing!! \nMaybe I will return just because I don't feel like spending my money and just want something cheap that better than fast food or if fry's is run out of sushi there
