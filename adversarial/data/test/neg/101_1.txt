I have tried most of the buffets in Vegas and this one is a MUST ( I haven't tried the one at the Wynn yet but heard that one is good too).  The trick I use at this buffet is that I go right at the end of lunch so I pay the cheaper price and then they turn over the food for dinner once you are already in there ;).  I really like the pizza, shrimp, mashed sweet potatoes, prime rib, sushi. Ok I pretty much like everything there ESPECIALLY the desserts. The chocolate covered strawberries, creme brulee and fruit tarts are sooo good. I can easily spend 3 hours in there.  I have had the Sunday brunch once and the food was good as well but I still like going right before lunch ends so it turns to dinner.  The only thing I haven't liked was the elk but at least I can say I have tried it. There is truly something for everyone here, enjoy!
