Great location in Eau Claire.\n5\/5 for where they are situated in the Market.\nSelection of candy 4\/5.\nService 2.5\/5.\nI cannot possibly list all the types of candy I indulged in, all into one bag they went and onto the scale. The price was on par with other Calgary candy shops. I loved the separate area for all the jelly bellies too.\nI was pleasantly surprised finding this candy store right after lunch - twas dessert! I may be stocked up now for a whole two days! :)
