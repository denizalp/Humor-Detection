Hands down the best Thai food I've ever experienced in my life . Everything was spicy and just flat out a amazing (period)! The service may have been a bit slow , but only because the owner was working alone . None the less , the wait is worth for the authenticity you get. Thai food may be a bit pricy , but I always say efff it because if the food is good , it's good, so I must say that the price was also worth emptying my purse . Definitely will be back in a heart beat !
