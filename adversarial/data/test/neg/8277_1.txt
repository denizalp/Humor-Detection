Only been here once, but the veggie fried rice totally hit the spot! It was ready for pick up in 5 minutes, reasonably priced, and extremely delicious. The customer service was great too. Will be back for sure to try more food.  One thing that I really liked was that compared to a lot of the restaurants I've tried in the area, they use all fresh veggies in their rice and not just frozen peas and carrots. That makes a huge difference.\n\n\nUPDATE\nJust went back for a 2nd trip, food is still pretty good but they only give you 1 soy sauce packet for to go orders and one chili paste otherwise they have to charge you extra..... I have NEVER been to an Asian restaurant that charges for soy sauce packets.... I mean if you're asking for an excessive amount sure, but ONE PACKET? That's insane, they must be really hurting for money.... sad just sad
