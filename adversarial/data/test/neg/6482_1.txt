I spent 2 nights here about 2 months ago. The Quad is located in the middle of the strip. It is the lowest casino hotel in the Caesar's chain. It's definitely still outdated since it was formerly known as the Imperial Palace. To be fair, they are still in the middle of renovations. I'd give the place itself 2 stars at the moment. The only reason I give 3 stars is because I received very good service from everyone that works there.\nThey have a 24hr Hash House & Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen, which are a plus. It's a good place if you're looking for $5 games on the strip(as opposed to $10-15 minimum at most strip casinos).\nThis review could be updated once the renovations are complete.
