Wow! What a wonderful car shopping experience!  I went in this past weekend to purchase a CLA 250. Was greeted right away and introduced to Lou Gordon! This was the best car shopping experience I have ever had. He was funny, professional, and most importantly honest and humble. He made me feel right at ease and knew that my time was valuable so he took care of everything as quick and efficiently as possible. This was my first Benz purchase and I hope Lou stays around for my next car purchase. I consider him family and he is definitely a major asset to Schumacher Mercedes. The service he provides is what makes people keep coming back.
