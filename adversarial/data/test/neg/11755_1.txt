Happy to have a nail salon so close to home! Love that they have disposable liners for the pedicure spas, as I'm a bit of a germaphobe. I went two weeks ago and my gel pedi still looks flawless! My nail tech was kind, gentle, but a little too soft-spoken which made communication more difficult, but she did a great job. Prices were reasonable. I'll be back!
