I love this place! Pho is one of my favorite dishes and I tried many other Vietnamese resturants before finding this gem. Now, I don't go anywhere else because Noodles Ranch is the best. Excellent food, fresh quality ingredients, great service. I feel great after eating here, not at all sluggish. The spring rolls are amazing, we usually get a few orders. The jasmine iced tea is fantastic. The owners are sweet and passionate about their business, they even have a cookbook out and available for purchase there.
