Sounds expensive, but they offer a different flat fee depending on the hotel you're staying at, so not sure if it's consistent price across the board, but Car #4, highly recommend because I sure will in a few months on my next trip out to TO.  \n\nFlat rate of $58 to\/from airport, for this luxury -- not a limo -- but another sedan but lots of space. Clean, leather.\n\nAt first, I thought it was another Aerofleet lol.\n\nNice that driver allowed me to use his USB charger too.\n\nAmex all good, you can even get an emailed receipt too (he asks).  \n\nGave me his cell # number so knowing who you can trust to call, is huge.
