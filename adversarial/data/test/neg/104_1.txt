I recently moved here from Chicago so I'm still adjusting but I didn't like the food at all. My boyfriend and I went for brunch and wanted to sit on the rooftop. My breakfast sausage was not editable.. it tasted like old meat. After eating that as an appetizer I was turned off so I just stuck with my beverage. The staff was really nice and the rooftop was great as well.
