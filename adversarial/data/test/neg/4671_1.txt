We stayed here while traveling north with our dogs. The staff was just lovely to them, bringing them bowls and dog beds and always greeting them when coming and going. There is a great park across the street for walking. The (human) beds were very comfortable and the shower was spectacular. Thanks for a great stay and we may see you on our way back.
