Took a cab from the strip to chinatown hoping to get some authentic Chinese food after many days of buffet. Very disappointed. I could cook much better fish porridge and steamed chicken than the chef. Besides distasteful food, the poor service is also disturbing. They even automatically add tips to the bill.
