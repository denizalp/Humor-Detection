I ordered a specialty pizza with a side of garlic breadsticks (so tasty). I don't order pizza much but when I do papa johns is my go to pizza place. They always have freshly made products and as long as you stay away from desserts you can't really order anything bad. (Lets face it, pizza places suck at making a good dessert) I got my pizza approximately the time they said it would be delivered and had a great night of relaxation and movies! Definitely a great way to end the night!!
