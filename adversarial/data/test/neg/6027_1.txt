Conveniently located in the Venetian Hotel where we were staying. Christmas Day and the place was open. Decided to have brunch here and was so glad we stopped here.\n\nFood: pretty amazing...got the Chicken & waffles with watermelon  , slow and low chicken salad which had fried cornbread and avocados in it, & the special of the day: biscuits and gravy with eggs & bacon. All were delicious! The chicken was delightfully crispy but very tender and juicy (even the breast), and the watermelon cubes were not only refreshing but very tasty! Served with bourbon maple syrup and hot sauce on the side. The low and slow chicken salad was very good too, with shredded chicken was also very tender with a mild smokey flavor which was well complemented by the fried cornbread, avocados, and buttermilk ranch. The biscuits and gravy-can't say it was the best biscuits and gravy I've had...it's more like a Benedict but with a brown colored thick gravy on 4 halves of biscuits underneath, bacon, and a pouched egg-very brunch like and very good. \nThe dinner was finished off with a  complimentary dessert....an amazing cinnamon latte ice cream atop a layer of pumpkin bread served in a cute little mason jar in celebration of Christmas!\n\nVenue: great ambiance with a wide display of wine on the wall. Great service!\n\nPrice: $36 for the chicken and waffles dish, $ 14 ish for the salad, and $18 for the biscuits and gravy with eggs and bacon dish.
