After about six visits to scramble both locations, I've decided the best thing about scramble is the free wifi.\n\nThe food is basic at best, border line on step above ihop..no seriously. \nYes its a local place who uses fresh ingredients.. But so what. The culinary makeup in this town is at its peak and i feel like scramble is coasting by with a pass.\n\nPancakes are always undercooked and plain. Hashbrowns Always undercooked and flavorless. The eggs for every meal weather it be omelette, scramble, plain..is simply lack luster. The amounts used in each omelette is very scarce. There is just nothing creative or unique about any of it.\n\nEvery time lately i wait in line for over 15 mins and there is barely anyone seated. I kept trying the restaurant simply because i live a block away..but.. Im over it.
