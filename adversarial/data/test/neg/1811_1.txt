This rating is for CATERING only. I like going there to dine in, that experience far exceeds the quality and service you get through the catering. \nThe people who run the catering side are really lousy at customer service and the food is subpar. They need to learn how to better run their kitchen and their administration. I do not recommend using their catering service. Go elsewhere!
