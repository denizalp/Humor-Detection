I love my waxer Jessica. She so awesome and makes me feel so comfortable. She remembers everything that I talked to her about from my previous visit and she is just so personable. She's just amazing. The one thing I don't like is that the front desk presses you about the packages EVERYTIME you go in. Other than that I would recommend Jessica for your waxing.
