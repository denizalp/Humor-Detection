Excellent diner food. Especially breakfast. You can tell that they cook the food with love. Patty melts are my favorite there and I highly suggest ordering their fries! They're battered so they're crispy and crunchy on the outside and soft and hot in the middle. My husband recommends the meat lovers skillet as well as the Friday fish fry. So good! The atmosphere is quaint and comfortable but they could use a remodel because it's a little run down. Basic diner though. Great service too! Friendly staff and the food comes fast and hot.
