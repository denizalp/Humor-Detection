The providers are fine, the staff is horrible.  Simply they do not care.  I called 3 times basically begging to have my little girl seen and they would not help.  We have been patients for about 6 years, and they have never been helpful, but I liked Maggie the Nurse Practitioner.  Stupid me, I should have moved years ago.
