Second visit on a 2-day trip.  I've been here over the past 10 years at least 100 times.  The food is consistently good - great baked bread, pastries, sandwiches, and breakfast.  My understanding is that the owner went to France to find a great chef to create the bread...you need great bread for a great sandwich.  The premise seems to have worked, as the restaurant has now exploded into a chain within AZ. \nI personally recommend the Bear Claws and Chocolate Croissants amongst the baked goods.  I usually have the Ham and Egg sandwich on whole grain, instead of the Ciabatta, but both breads are delicious.  I also recommend the banana pancakes.  My only reason for going 4-stars is this particular visit I pointed out the pancakes didn't have much banana (if at all) in the batter.  The staff courteously offered to remake, but they were good nonetheless.  \nThe atmosphere is brighter than other restaurants in this space, e.g., Panera and Paradise Bakery.  They have newspapers for one to browse through, bread samples upon entrance, and great coffee.  Lastly, there are multiple booths, and all have outlets located beneath, which caters to those needing a break from the home office, or the worker on the go.  Cheers!
