I've eaten in this place several times. They have a great selection on their menu and the food is always fresh. The way they played the food makes you want to just gobble it up because it looks so beautiful. The service is outstanding and it is one of my favorite places to stop in. If somebody wants some fresh food and take out this is one of my favorite places to recommend.
