I've been patronising George C. since it's opening at Hazelton in 2007 and have nothing but great things to say about the store and service. George the owner has an eye for picking up the smaller brands for the Toronto market and his staff (I shop in the men's section) has always been most friendly. I recently purchase d a blazer at 50% off sale and  JP offered the alterations and made sure it was done right the 2nd time, all for free when most stores charge alterations on discount items.
