Possibly one of the best pizza places to eat at in Las Vegas, not only for the food, but service as well! Typically there place is clean, the mens room could be checked on more, however myself and my family typically are happy and full upon leaving. We take a lot of out of town guest here, and they can accommodate large parties!
