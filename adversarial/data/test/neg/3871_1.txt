This place is amazing!! They made an appointment that was at a convenient time and I didn't have to wait long to be seen. It's clean and comfortable. Sanita did a great job cleaning my teeth and she was very friendly and professional. Dr. Smith was a pleasure and gave me great advice. He was very personable. The checkout process was quick and easy. I have bounced around a bit with dentists but I've definitely found my forever dental office!
