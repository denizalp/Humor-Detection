Fat kee has been one of those hole-in-a-wall places in the NE. I have been coming here for years and I'm sure they have gone through many different owners cuz or at least lots of different servers throughout the years but the food has not changed.\n\nPrices are great as its in the NE and the food quality is great as well. I really like all their brisket dishes like the soup with egg noodle or just on rice with book choy. Yum! \n\nService is not that great but the food is consistent. Cheap, quick eats!
