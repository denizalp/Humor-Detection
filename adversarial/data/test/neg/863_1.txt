We were not impressed with our recent stay.  I only travel to Marriott hotels and this was recommended via wedding party block.  Our room had bright purple marker (it appeared) drawn all over the carpet.  Had we not been only in Charlotte for 12 hours and away from the hotel for most of that, I would have requested a room change.  \nWe headed down to the bar before the wedding and for a glass of wine and one liquor drink was over $35.  Very expensive for what we ordered. Would not return to this Marriott again.
