I have never been to a dental office with such professionalism and courtesy until True Dentistry. I get slight anxiety dealing with any dentist office but right from the start, I felt good about this place. I was seen in less than 5 minutes of walking in the door and the assistant, Sharice, was phenomenal. She put me at ease right away. She was very sweet and knowledgeable in her profession. When it was time to be seen by Dr. Joe, he was very professional but made you feel like you were talking to a friend at the same time. I would definitely recommend this office to any and everyone with anxiety or any discomfort about Dental Offices. True Dentistry is the best and I am looking forward to working with Dr. Joe and Sharice the assistant again.
