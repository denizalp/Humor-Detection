I must say i love this place, it's nothing fancy but they have excellent food. I went today to get a pulled pork sandwich and chicken pasta salad and it was delicious. I've been here several times now and i have never been disappointed and always left with a full tummy. I love their ribs very meaty and juicy. Don't pass this place up if you see it. I give it 5 stars.
