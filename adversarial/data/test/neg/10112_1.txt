My GF and I went to dine here prior to attending Hamilton at Gammage.  I completely spaced that it was a Friday night, because I had intended us to dine at a certain Oyster House in Tempe, and so forgot to make a reservation.  I had not been to the Salt Cellar in over 30 years, back in high school, for a prom or such.  My friend at work reminded me of it, and I am glad he did.\n\nWe put our name on the list, but also got lucky and found 2 seats at the end of the bar.  Extremely lucky, because it only continued to fill up, which we learned is only a testament to the continued popularity of this underground valley landmark.\n\nUnlike another recent reviewer, we ate at the bar.  However, we did order off the Happy Hour menu, so maybe that might be why?  Not sure, but we are returning there in a couple weeks, so I will inquire and follow up.\n\nWe ordered the Oysters on the half shell, Bucket of steamed Mussels, and fresh bread from the HH menu, and also the signature dish, Sauteed Shrimp San Remo from the \"Seasonal Bar Appetizers\" menu.  Strange menu name for a place you supposedly can't eat at the bar at?  Again, maybe you can't order from the standard menu.\n\nThe Oysters and Mussels were surprisingly larger than we expected!!  My GF remarked on this, as she is a much more experienced seafood aficionado than I.  The bucket of mussels was very generously sized, so I felt a lot better about the $13 price.  The $2 each oyster price, easily justified by their size. The bread was OK.  The Shrimp San Remo, I thought at the time was great, especially for dunking the remaining mussels and bread in, but my GF told me later she wasn't that impressed with it.  Worth giving a try to decide for yourself.  Definitely rich though, lots of butter and oil.\n\nDrinks were good, service was good, staff attitudes very welcoming, and the ambiance was very nice.  Bartender (1 of 3) was busy, but very professional and responsive.\n\nAs I stated, we plan on returning.  I am looking forward to trying some new dishes including the Oyster Rockefeller.  We both remarked that it seemed like there were a LOT of regulars in attendance too, so make of that what you will.  How did we know?  Try becoming a regular somewhere and you will learn how to spot them too.\n\nWord of advice - if you want to impress your date and definitely have access to the full menu . . . make a reservation!!  Fortunately, I have the world's most awesome GF, so she only teased me for a short time about my failure to do so.  However, I suspect that the fact that we left there happily stuffed probably contributed to that leniency too . . . Nah!!!! She's just awesome!!  ;-)
