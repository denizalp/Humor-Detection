Second time ever buying a car off of a dealer lot, and I must say, my favorite so far.  \n\nI did have a Certified Pre-Owned car in mind before I went into the dealership.  I was pleasantly greeted by Trent Jenkins and immediately taken to the 2 cars I wanted to test drive.  After driving the 335d I had my eyes on, we sat down, Trent was very informative about what my options were, how I could pay, etc.  \n\nOf course all of the above was great customer service by Mr. Jenkins, but even the people behind the scenes did an amazing job.\n\nSimply put, this was the easiest and most enjoyable purchase of my life so far.\n\nThank you BMW of Las Vegas.
