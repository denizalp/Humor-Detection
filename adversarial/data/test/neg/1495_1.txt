Diego pops is quaint and trendy at the same time. The building itself has a lot of fun decorations and reminds me of a bar in Mexico with a fun mixture of pop art and neon signs. The food was great. I loved the green chili chicken taco- Crispy  I also had the charred skirt steak which was also good. I rated this place 3 stars however for the service. We asked to be moved outside as soon as a spot opened and she ignored us for a long time on a slow day. I asked for the guava coconut drink and our waitress said they were out of coconuts as I proceeded to watch a girl at the next table receive a drink out of a coconut. I had to ask for my water to be refilled. They were also out of a lot of drink items. I would have rated this place 5 stars if the service wasn't so bad.
