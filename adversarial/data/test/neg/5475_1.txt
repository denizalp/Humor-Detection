Came here for a quick dessert on a Thursday evening. It's definitely no sit down, but more like a grab and go kind of place. Ordered a scoop of their Hong Kong Milk Tea ice cream and was blown away by the flavour and the colour of it. It tastes just like the milk tea you'd be having at a Hong Kong cafe. I'm glad the ice cream tasted like milk tea and not just milk. I find other places that try to make this flavour focus more on the texture of the ice cream than the actual flavour, which is why I was impressed by the colour of it. Other places usually try to make the texture creamy which masks the true flavours. Will definitely be back to try some of their other flavours and their donuts which were introduced not too long ago after their recent renovation.
