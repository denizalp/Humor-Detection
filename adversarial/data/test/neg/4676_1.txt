Tried this location three time, convinced the only reason they're in business is because it's on campus.  This location shows non of the Starbucks pleasantries.  During a rush I over 15 minutes for aapologized and asked for assistance due to a lack of sugar I was told they could not help.  Granted a rush is a rush but Starbucks is known for its efficiency and welcoming environment none of which are evident at this location...not even a name on my cup all three times.  Very badly disappointed.
