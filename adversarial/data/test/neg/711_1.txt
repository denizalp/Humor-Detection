I think it's a cool place. The only problem is they need more organization. Why isn't there a sign up sheet for most of the games? It's a really cool concept, but there cheapest pitcher of beer is an $18 pitcher of PBR. REALLLLLLY??? The type of place they have should have $2 PBR's. I'm sure this would draw the hipster cliente they are striving to have. Overall, cool place.
