I work right by this place and go as often as possible - it is amazing!!!  I'm a veggie hater, but their Wisconsin Cauliflower soup has made me love cauliflower!!!  I also love the Honey Bacon Club sandwich and have tried their deserts - this place rules!  Only con is that they are closed on Sundays, which is ridiculous, this isn't the bible belt for pete's sake!
