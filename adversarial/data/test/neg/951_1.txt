This is the best Mexican place in downtown madison for sure. Way better service and atmosphere than Los Gemelos. Amazing salsa--plenty of cilantro and fresh onion. The tostadas and tacos are my favorite. Close are the enchiladas verdes. Only skip is the quesadilla for me. Accommodating to groups and small parties-- we come here a couple times a month.
