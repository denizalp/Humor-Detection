My 2 stars is mainly because of their extremely SLOW service. I was in LV for a conference and decided to give this place a try for lunch. The young lady working the entrance was very nice and professional, and seated us very fast, however, once seated it was a while before we were greeted or asked what we wanted to drink. Once we ordered our drinks, someone came brought 2 out of 3 of the drinks that was order...I never received my drink. Once we ordered our food, we waited an extremely long time to get our food, considering others that were seated after us had their orders and halfway done with their meals. Long story short...be prepared to wait. \n\nAlso, the weird man lurking around the restaurant jumping from table to table, who I can only assume was the owner treated his staff pretty rudely bossing them around in front of the customers...not good.
