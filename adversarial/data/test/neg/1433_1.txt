Have been to many Roy's restaurant across the country including the original one in Hawaii Kai, Oahu when Roy Yamaguchi first opened up the restaurant.\n\nWe celebrated 3 birthdays with 18 people and our servers were exceptional.\n\nWe had the gyozas and peking duck as appetizers, the gyozas were very good, the Peking duck was bland.\n\nMy wife ordered the Butterfish which was very soft and tender where it practically melts in your mouth and a wonderful taste. Highly recommend this entree.\n\nI selected the entree Roy's Quad which consisted of 4 different samples of fish, Salmon, Butterfish, Roasted Macadamia Mahi Mahi and Ahi Tuna. Very nice sampler, the Butterfish definitely stood out.\n\nCame back a few weeks later and Roy's offered a prefixed meal for $39, an appetizer, entree and a dessert. I chose the Canoe Appetizer ($12) which included Szechuan Ribs, Spicy Tuna Roll, Lobster Potstickers, Coconut Shrimp and Chicken Satay. Then for the entree had the Filet Mignon with Butter Roasted Lobster Tail ($59) Finally selected the Pineapple Upside Down Cake ($12) and Chocolate Souffle ($13) which all were exceptional.
