The service was terrible. There was almost no customers and I waited FOREVER for my food. The staff all seemed unenthusiastic as well as pretty hungover. When we got our food and smoothies, it all tasted like rubbish. We asked to talk to a manager and he was very rude with us and acted like we were being unreasonable. This store definitely needs some help!
