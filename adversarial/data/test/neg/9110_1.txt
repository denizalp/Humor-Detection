Sushi Island is located not far from Sushi D (my personal favourite AYCE Japanese sushi place) and a place we often passed by with a big line up outside.  A couple of years ago, I went when a friend suggested I try it so a group of us went.  My expectations were a bit high since we thought the big line ups must mean it's a good place to eat.  We figure the turnover would mean the food is fresh and reasonably good.\n\nWe were disappointed with the service (they even told us that they had a strictly enforced 1.5 hour time limit but perhaps it was the big bodybuilder with us that scared them off but they didn't know it's the small guys that are the big eaters lol).  The worst part was the wait... they told us it would take an hour to seat our party of 4 and it took closer to 2 hours.  Didn't matter, we figure by the time they served us food, the paper napkin would probably taste good.  So, we sat down to eat and the quality was ok but nothing special considering we were starving.  The service was a bit slow but we assumed it was because it was so busy. We decided it was ok but it wasn't worth the long wait and the rolls had a bit more rice than we liked.\n\nSeveral months later, we went back again because another friend wanted to try it but this time it was a shorter wait period as it was late after the main dinner hour.  We met the owner (Chinese) and she was pleasant.  My friend liked the selection because it had some unique menu items (eg. beef sashimi) not offered at the place we usually go such.  He enjoyed it and also liked the red tuna so he decided to go back again the following week.  I didn't go with him on the following occasion but he was upset when they told him he could only order red tuna once (3 pieces) because it was an expensive item so despite being an AYCE they limited his order! He complained to no avail so we have never been back since.  Not sure if the ownership or policy has changed since then but my own experience was ok so a 3 star rating.
