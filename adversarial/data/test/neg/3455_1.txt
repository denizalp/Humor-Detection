I love everything about brunch here. It had everything:\n\nAmazing food - all you want to eat, just order off the menu! Everything was so, so tasty! The green corn tamales might have been my favorite, as well as the churro tots. Also can't go wrong with Huevos Rancheros ever! The best part is if you're here with a few people you can try practically everything since it's all small plates. \n\nDelicious, free-flowing drinks - bottomless mimosas available for $10, made with delicious fresh fruit syrups and purees. We had blood orange, pomegranate, passion fruit and mango, I think. You best believe we got our drink on! \n\nExcellent, friendly and above-and-beyond service: Gatsby served us and she was just awesome. She basically quarterbacked ordering for us and put orders in for things she thought we'd enjoy, and she knocked it out of the park! Basically just kept drinks and food coming until we couldn't eat another bite. Plus she was fun to talk to, great rapport. There are good servers out there, but she was definitely beyond! \n\nAll in all, I can say this is my favorite brunch in Las Vegas, if not anywhere!
