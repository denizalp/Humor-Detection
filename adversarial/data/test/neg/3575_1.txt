came here for our last breakfast before I got sick on vacation (isn't that great) anyway it was delicious and I was happy to have fresh chocolate milk compared to the out of the bottle at other places. my husband loved his food (can't remember what he got) I wasn't a fan of the home fries but I didn't realize what they were cooked in. should have got the hash browns. no wait when we went and it's definitely a local kind of place which is exactly what I wanted.
