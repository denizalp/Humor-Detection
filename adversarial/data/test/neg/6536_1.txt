Yes, \n\nI go by the name of Delton-Son.....I am an independent soul artist and graduate student. I single handedly recorded an album about my experience growing up in the AAU basketball capital of the world (SEATTLE), and some of the obstacles that I have overcome. Everything was done but something was missing........I needed a photographer. I reached out to the owner of Nappsack Photos for the following reasons: (1) He has an extensive background in architecture and graphic design (2) he is very professional (3) He travels........I can only use one word to describe the photo shoot...........Spiritual! \nI have also referred several customers to Nappsack for professional photography and they have all responded with rave reviews! \nI am also painter. As a visual artist, I am very picky about who I let capture my work. Nappsack works with love and intelligence. \nI consider myself a client and it is an honor! He is modest, but his clientele' list consists of some pretty big names.......... \nThe prices are reasonable.......... \n5 Stars hands down! \nDelton-Son
