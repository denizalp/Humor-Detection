Received a Groupon from a friend, so decided to check this place out before it expired. We stood at the hostess stand for 5+ minutes, before finally grabbing one of the very busy waitresses who ended up seating us. She was very nice, but you could tell she was in over her head and they were under staffed. She did the best she could, but it shouldn't take over 30 minutes for your food to arrive, especially during lunch. The food was mediocre, nothing to write home about. \n\nWith all of the conventions and nearby hotels, they have the potential to do great things, but from my experience, I don't know that I would ever return.
