Stumbled across this place when I was looking for new places to eat off Rainbow.  Took our order of 10 wings and 5 drumsticks to go and it was still delicious when we got home!  We had a split order half spicy half soy garlic.  Perfect mix of sweet and spicy!\n\nThe best part?  The chicken was still good the next morning for breakfast!  A few minutes in the toaster oven and it was still crisp and juicy!
