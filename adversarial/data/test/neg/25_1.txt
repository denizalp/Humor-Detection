I have now been to JFPH twice, on their third day of service and today.  I am trying to keep an open mind about this place, I really am.\nFirst, some background.  This restaurant location was previously a really fine place, Lis Doon Varna, and finally closed due to financial issues: It was a great place, fun, with a great beer selection, impeccable food, and great wait staff.  There is a sister pub in Tempe, Rula Bula, with the same menu but apparently, under a different corporation from the ill-fated LDV.\nOnce closed, Robbie Fox (whose other restaurant is in Tempe), purchased this building. I hear he was in on the design and building of this location originally, although I am not sure how a restaurateur fits with being a general contractor, but I digress.  There was, apparently, bad blood between these two entities and there's a bit of a \"gotcha\" atmosphere going on.\nOK...the restaurant.\nThe interior is mainly unchanged BUT the changes that have been made are a little too...neat? manufactured? shiny?  The photos of the Kennedys--fine, but way too many.  The framed art in the main dining room--looks like crap from a mall art shop.  The banners in the \"church\" area are gone, which was really unique stuff.  One of the things I really liked about the other incarnation was that there were no TV's.  No crappy NFL Sundays, no guys yelling at the TV's with vulgarities, no distracted dinner guests.  Now they have them.  Big negative.  If I want to watch sports, I'll go to RTO'Sullivan's or Padre Murphy's.\nThe beer--we had a proper pour of a Stout today, which I appreciate.  And I like that a local beer, Kiltlifter, is on tap.  The waitstaff needs more education, though.  My husband asked about a beer and the girl clearly didn't know.  She should have offered a taste but didn't.  Pilsner Urquell would be a nice addition to the tap beer.\nThe food--I agree with the other reviewers that the prices seem high.  I finally asked the waiter today if the fries\/chips were fresh potatoes or not because both times, they have been, well, bad.  He assured me they were.  Well, if you are going to convince me, then leave a little peel on the potatoes, and fry them to crisp, not warm.  How can you not do fries right?  My chicken and leek pie was good, although really small for the price.  It looked dwarfed in its ramekin on the platter. My husband's chicken barbeque sandwich was good.  I ordered a tart for dessert and it took 20 minutes, I was told because there was only one pastry chef.  ????  It was a refrigerated piece of pie with blueberry sauce on it!  It was good but really?  20 minutes?\nAnd I was told they didn't have the order in for the bread pudding (which makes me suspicious it'll won't be made on site)--what's bread pudding take? Bread, eggs, cream, cinnamon and raisins.  They don't have that in the kitchen?  \nThis time the waitstaff seemed a little more with it, less deer-in-the-headlights.  The owner, Robbie, was seem both days bussing tables,  and taking care of unhappy patrons.  \nWith that all said, I really want this place to succeed.  It is a lovely place, the menu is adequate, with a lot of seafood, expected Irish dishes, and good beer.  We will continue to go there and hope they get their legs under them and make it a place to go and relax before a movie, after work, and when I'm tired shopping.  With the prices, though, it will likely go from a drop-in place to more of a special occasion place.  Stay tuned....
