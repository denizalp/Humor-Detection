Your typical DQ. They're staffed by mainly high school\/college kids. They're always very clean and very nice here! However the downside is the location is VERY small. Unfortunately there can be log lines at times. There are only like 10-15 parking spots and it's on a main road so getting in and out can be difficult. There is only 1 bench for seating so people mainly sit in their car. I believe they are also only open seasonally.\n\nBlizzards are always flipped upside down and pass the test! Orange Julius's are delicious. Funnel cakes are a no-go... they taste like they're microwaved or something. They only serve the DQ icecream menu- no hot foods at this location. They do serve boxed icecream bars and DQ cakes.\n\nOverall it's a great quick stop on a hot summer day or night. No serious complaints! I would recommend.
