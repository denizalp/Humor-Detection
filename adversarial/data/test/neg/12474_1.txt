Second visit; this time I actually found a seat (good luck getting a table) and got to sample beers.  I got the sampler of five different beers, all the tables were taken so I pulled up a chair in the front window and set the beers on a small counter.  \nI really enjoyed the hefeweizen, surprisingly, I don't typically like them; this hefeweizen had plenty of flavor.  The IPA was also pleasant, but considering I have a couple of friends that loved this beer (and can't stand IPAs) I would say it's an \"every mans\" IPA.  The stout was a bit too smoky for my tastes, and the other two beers are just forgettable.\nI'm not a fan of the floor plan of this bar:  it feels a bit clunky, there is way too much space behind the bar that could have put to better customer space, when crowded traffic jams happen in odd sections of the bar, it is difficult to order beers\/food, it also is extremely loud when busy.\nI didn't order any food, but I will add:  truffle oil is a cardinal food sin, and should be abolished immediately.\nSo this place is brand spanking new, there are plenty of kinks to work out, and I'm sure they will over time.\nInterested to see the direction this place will go.
