We had real good service till I went up to pay and didn't hear our waitress tell us she would take it up for us.... Opps, sorry didn't hear you!!! Would of tipped her 20 percent but because of her getting a attitude with me for not hearing her I tipped her 15 percent... Not everyone hears well!!! I couldn't believe how she changed her attitude.. Maybe, she thought I wasn't going to tip her.  I always tip.. I tip on my service I get...
