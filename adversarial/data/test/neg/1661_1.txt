This is a great restaurant that's close to Air Canada Centre and Rogers Centre. It's a convenient spot to go before a game. \n\nThe service is friendly and efficient. The decor is very nice. \n\nThe food is very good. The pizza is delicious and so is the seafood linguine. The prices are reasonable. \n\nI definitely recommend this restaurant.
