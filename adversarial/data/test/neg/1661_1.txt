Made a quick stop here while shopping. Definitely an upscale, urban vibe. Cozy seating while still very chic. Cocktails are pricey, most at $18 or more. Had to try the spicy flamingo, which I loved. The watermelon and spice went perfectly together. The easy street was excellent as well, the elderflower really shines and it's aromatic and easy to drink. Our bartender was knowledgeable and friendly. This was a great quick stop for a good drink.
