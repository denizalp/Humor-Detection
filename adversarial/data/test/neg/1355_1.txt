I cannot recommend the food because the Denny's-style menu does not look appetizing to me, so I've never actually sat down in the restaurant.  \n\nBut I enjoy the Fireside Lounge.  The neon-lit interior gives it a swanky atmosphere.  It's a casual place to hang out with friends or bring a date after dinner.  All kinds of interesting people come here.  \n\nThe service is all right and the drinks are reasonably priced.
