My mom and I were bored and saw that a midday magic show was happening so we snagged last minute tickets -- and wow we had way too much fun for what we paid (roughly $25 pp). If you like old school magic tricks and hokey fun this show is for you. \n\nEven for the \"magic skeptical\", Mac King is a well versed magician -- you will definitely be left wondering how he managed to do his version of the disappearing rabbit act (and the lesser known reappearing goldfish act )
