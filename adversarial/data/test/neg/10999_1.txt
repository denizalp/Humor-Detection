EDC 2011 - the bf and I met up with our friends who were staying here, and I have been itching to stay here since. \nMay 2012 - Yelp Spring Break gave us the perfect opportunity to finally stay at the Platinum. It was extremely difficult to turn down a $170 weekend deal (taxes included, no resort fees).\n\nWe stayed in a Solitaire Suite (910 sq. ft. - the size of a one-bedroom apartment), and was already impressed by the basic package! Each suite is built with an intuitive and efficient energy system: plug your card into the light switch by the door to adjust your HVAC unit, take it out and the air + some lights turn off.. plus it's a great key holder (i had no trouble finding my key card each time we left the room!), a balcony, a living room the size of a Venetian\/Palazzo Suite, a bedroom, a beautiful bathroom, and a full kitchen. \n\nThe kitchen is spacious, had a classy granite countertop feel, and came equipped with: a full-size fridge\/freezer (we went looking for the ice room on our floor, but couldn't find one, because every room comes with an ice maker.. duh!), microwave, coffee maker, 4 stove tops, an oven (I could have baked a cake here!), a set of knives (not the best idea for drunk college kids), and silverware and 3 types of glassware (wine, tall, short). \n\nOn top of all the amenities, the service here was stellar! Shortly after we checked into our room and retrieved our luggage, Guest Services called to see how our check-in process went, and offered to further assist with any other services. After the call, we were so amazed! \n\nThe next day, we requested for pots and an iron, and we got it within 5 minutes. About 5 minutes after that, we got another phone call from Guest Services following up on our requests. SO AMAZED!\n\nValet only, and unfortunately no taxi line waiting outside the porte cochere. It was hardly a problem though, since The Platinum is a block away from the Strip, right behind Bally's... about a 15 minute stroll. We DID need to hail a taxi once, and a cab arrived within 10 minutes, although it can take up to a half an hour wait sometimes.\n\nEven without the Yelp deal, the usual room rates here are unbeatable for its quality and quantity. Having been inside one of the suites before this visit, I expected a large room, but I never imagined the service to be world class as well! \n\nThe Platinum has become my new standard for luxury living on the Strip, and I doubt many places will beat it for its value!
