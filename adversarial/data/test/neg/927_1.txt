We moved recently and were looking for a place that was close by. I could crawl home from here if I needed to so we decided to give it a go. The place was very busy for a Wednesday afternoon (about 4 pm), which I took to be a good sign. Our server arrived quickly and was very friendly. They had a nice selection of beers on tap and I opted for a local craft brew that I hadn't had before. We just wanted a snack so we stuck with the happy hour menu which wasn't that big. We ordered the Pirogues, not something you see very often... very tasty. I wish their happy hour menu was bigger and that is the reason for 3-stars instead of 4. Their regular menu seemed to be pretty big but that's not what we were there for.
