Very happy with staying here, the lazy river is an added bonus though between running around the strip and seeing free shows, we didn't really have much time enjoy it thoroughly... \n\nthe LVB location is set further out from the strip to give you more of a resort type of experience. There are plenty of entertainment onsite, pool, jacuzi, lazy river, pool table, air hockey $1, DVD rentals ($3), foosball and several arcade games for kids...
