Got my hair colored and cut by Joni last week. I haven't colored my hair in 10 years and so glad I decided to with Joni. I showed her a couple of pictures and styles I found online and on Instagram that I liked - and she knew what to do. After she was done, I loved it. Be sure to check for the Yelp special and buy it! It's a nice helpful discount.
