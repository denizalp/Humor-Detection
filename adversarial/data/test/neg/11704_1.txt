This place should be demoted to a motel ASAP. \nMy mother and I needed a quick overnight stay at a hotel as we prepared to move the following day and called around for something reasonably priced. We found this place and picked it because it was pet-friendly. \n\nWhen we got there we were less than thrilled when they told me they only accepted dogs? Why on earth would you say pet-friendly if you're only dog-friendly who knows? I told them I would have to cancel since I needed a room that would allow my cat in too. After a call to the manager they said they would make a one-night exception for me, little did I know I would regret it. \n\nFirst off the price was not as they stated over the phone, they added a resort fee since they had a pool and a bar which apparently qualifies something as a resort....? \n\nThen finally I get to the room and it immediately off-putting. The curtains were stained with specks of what looked like blood, but the lady reassured me that it was just stained from the paint since the room had been repainted recently, I guess replacing the dirty curtains was too much to ask? I only made it 30 minutes before I had to call the front desk again because the TV wouldn't turn on. They sent up maintenance which was actually just the maid who spoke no English and brought towels instead of fixing the TV. After calling a few more times it became clear the TV was not going to get fixed so I requested a room change and they complied. \n\n(Curtains were stained again in the second room) Next, the outlets were all really loose, like so loose I had to switch spots twice because my computer charger just kept falling out of outlets and thus not charging at all. By the end of the day I was exhausted from packing up my apartment and I just wanted to sleep. After a rough night of trying to ignore the weird \"paint\" stains all over I got up early to get my day going only to find there was no water! I couldn't shower, brush my teeth, anything! I called the front desk and they explained that there was a pipe issue and it should be fixed in an hour or so and that I would be comped for the night. I was booked to stay another night, but I had had enough I just wanted to go home. \n\nI get to the front desk to checkout and she hands me a bill, I thought my night was comped I ask and she explains they comped the stay but I still owed the resort fee!! What jerks!
