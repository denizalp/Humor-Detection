This was definitely by far one of the best corn dogs I've had, and I've been to a lot of food trucks and restaurant and fast food places. THIS DOESNT COMPARE! Soooo yummy and who would've thought honey on the corn dog! In love! Highly recommend!! And Fizz drinks which this truck was outside of, was super good as well! We Will see this guy and his truck again!
