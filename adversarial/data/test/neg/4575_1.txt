I visit this place here and there with co-workers and have never been disappointed. I am not very adventurous so I usually get a turkey sandwich on kaiser and fries, really good fries actually. Sandwich and a drink get close to $11, not cheap for sandwich. Lots of seating and interesting historical pictures of Downtown Phoenix on the walls, worth a visit.
