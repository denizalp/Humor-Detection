I went to pick up food from an order that I placed online. When we got there, this lady that appeared to maybe have been the manager pointed to the food sitting on the counter. When I went to go grab it she just put the bags on the counter and walked away so I had to call her back to get the cups which when she gave them to me she was rude about it. I gave it two stars cause the food was good though.
