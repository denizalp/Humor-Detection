terrible customer service and terrible products. my $200 order arrived in complete destruction. Everything was dirty, essential oils had particles of loofah floating around in them (and they were not sealed\/did not seem new) and containers were cracked. I had to call three times to get someone to send me a return shipping label and authorize a refund and am still having to pay additional UPS pickup fees out of pocket. Lots of stories like mine (and worse). I never give one star reviews but these people need to be reported not just poorly reviewed.
