My husband and I had honest air install our new AC unit. After talking to multiple companies we choose them because they were...well...honest. He was honest with his AC units and what we could do to help fix our hot living room.  Most AC companies would have suggested all these crazy costly methods. He said to wait and see what a properly installed AC unit (ours was backwards with a kink in the vent) that isn't 25 years old does. They found one of our vents crushed and fixed it for no additional cost.  \n\nWe used them before and will continue to use them. :)
