Two separate experiences: Food Quality good (for price) but service was slow. Next time the service was attentive but the food quality poor: leathery and VERY THIN filet mignonette steak (not like pictures!) and shrimp was salty and poor quality. Potato cake was a hit!\n\n Managers make things right. Needs Proper staffing, better quality steaks and seafood. Our kiddo loved the chicken strips. Ok, I may be spoiled from all of the other mid-level steakhouses. I'm really pulling for you, Outback! Thanks for making the effort.\n\nUPDATE: last experience was perfect (service,quality,prompt).
