I heard this spot was pretty new so I decided to check it out. I tried the #5 which was shrimp tempura and salmon. it was sooo good. I probably could've had another burrito haha and to top everything off the customer service was amazing. I didn't get his name but he was helpful when I needed a high chair for my baby. 5 stars!
