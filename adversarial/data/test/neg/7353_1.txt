This place would do well without my four stars so I'll give it a 3.5. I'd been a couple of times when it was a smaller joint under smokes poutinerie, where smokes burrito is now. The wait times were long then, but now that it's a bigger place I think it's gotten a lot better during the day. HOWEVER on weekends when everyone's craving drunk food it's still packed af in there because it's one of the few places downtown that's open until 4am (because pfft, Toronto). \n\nMenu-wise the chicken quesadillas and the naked burritos are the best. Even the empty corners of the tortilla are good because they go hard on the cheese; I live for them cheezez. Also I always ask for more cilantro as I'm an exotic asian girl and they PACK it with extra cilantro leaving me extra satisfied. \n\nThe last time I went, I pre-ordered by phone after being put on hold for about seven minutes, waited the 20 minutes that the employee told me it was going to take for the food, and waited an extra 20 minutes at the place because drunk orders were too piled up. Despite this, the reason I keep going back is that I live really close by and that I try to avoid Smokes (people working there are really nice; unfortunately food is horrible), but if I were visiting dt from afar I would find somewhere else more special or rather go to Chipotle. \n\nConclusion: If it weren't for the dirty tables, the waiting time, and the missing cutlery in my takeout I'd give it a 4.6.
