I had my hair colored and cut by Jessica today. I was very nervous about letting a student take scissors to my hair, but I rolled the dice. I got a basic color to cover my gray. It was a little darker than I'd hoped but she did a great job. Even and not one bit of gray showing through. As for the cut, she took her time and did awesome. To be honest, it's a little shorter than I'd hoped. But that's probably just because I haven't gotten it cut in almost a year!! It looked so much healthier when she was done. I recommend Jessica. Such a pleasant surprise.
