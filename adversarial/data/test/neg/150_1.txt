Great beer - I like that they make it themselves. We liked the \"Ralph's Nuts\".\n\nThe food was decent. However - small portions for the price! $15 mac and cheese in a mini-ramekin just doesn't cut it for me, even if it has a sliver or two of brisket inside. \n\nAnd it was packed with only 2 waitresses working, which makes for a slow service. \n\nIf I'm back, I'm back for beer, and maybe I'll try their $5 popcorn. I wonder if that comes in a mini ramekin, too.
