Service is great. Very friendly and attentive staff. It's limited seating as is everything else on Yonge st. but we didn't wait long for our table and we didn't wait long for our food either. We ordered a waffle and a crepe. Delicious! Great for the price. Waffle wasn't dense. It was nice and hot and fluffy. Lots of fruits and fillings and good portion of ice cream. No complaints!!
