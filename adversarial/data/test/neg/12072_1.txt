This is my first experience with a fast Thai place. I'm used to more sit-down style atmosphere. This is like Thai food chipotle-style. You pick a dish, then pick a protein, then pick a side. Simple enough concept. The food however is slightly on the blander side. I had the green curry with chicken and that was decent, but my spring rolls and dumplings lacked flavor. I can appreciate the freshness of the products. I can taste the Thai earthiness. Overall, I do like that we now have a Thai option for the fast casual diner.
