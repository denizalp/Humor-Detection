Alright, so this was my first visit here and to be completely honest, idk why the reviews are as high as they are. I usually get smoothies like this around the corner from China Magic Noodle House, but I decided I would go for a change and get something different, so I finally tried this place after reading all the reviews. I was originally going to get a milk tea when I got there, but I decided to get the watermelon slush so I can compare it to CMNH. When I tasted it, I was disappointed. It was very obviously that fake watermelon syrup flavoring and did not have any trace of real watermelon. It was seriously just sugar in a cup with a splash of watermelon flavoring. To make things worse, I also ordered calamari, for charged for it, and then had (I'm assuming) the manager come by and tell the cashier that they're not offering it right now. Instead of asking if I'd like something else or anything like that, they just grab some cash and give me my money back. Idk if he cashier was new or what his deal was but he was just being very fidgety, non attentive, and rude. I might give this place another shot in the future so I can finally try milk tea (like I should've done in ten first place) but this isn't a place I would ever come to on a regular basis.
