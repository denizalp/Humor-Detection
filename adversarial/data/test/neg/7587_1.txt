Nelson Ford has been in business since the mid-1980s and I've used him for as long. He is a graduate of the Colorado School of Trades and knows the Browning P-35, the Colt 1911 system, and the S&W revolvers completely. \n\nOver the decades, he has come to know what works and what doesn't in firearms and in their repair. He is not a general gunsmith and openly says so. While he might occasionally take in a Remington hunting rifle and mount a scope on it, his work is dedicated to quality defensive handguns. If you want work done to certain brands or models, he won't touch them. The Ruger LCR, the Taurus 92 clones, Filipino 1911s, etc. will be refused because they are problematic in quality straight from the factory. Arguing that the Ruger LCR is popular and thus, must be a good firearm is using the same faulty logic that Ford Motor Company used to defend the Pinto automobile, once a very popular compact car until it was learned that they had a propensity to explode when rear-ended in a collision. Popularity in the marketplace  quality in design or manufacture.\n\nHe is a highly opinionated person and can be mercurial. Some craftsmen are. If you expect a smile and a polite greeting when entering, you may not get it. Many gunsmiths and people in the firearms industry have reputations for being brusque or acerbic; Ed Brown, Jeff Cooper, etc. Nelson Ford is the same way. He will tell you what works and what is not worth the money. He does not pad his invoices with parts and work you do not need. \n\nHis work is first rate and he will stand behind it [as long as no one else has worked on or modified it]. He has the same guarantee that Bill Wilson of Wilson Combat does and will not charge extra labor to fix it a second time. \n\nUnlike many, he is not merely a parts replacer. He diagnoses what is wrong and can design and build\/modify parts to meet specific applications. \n\nIn short, he may be a pain, but he knows what he is doing and does only quality work.
