This was our first trip since Boteco opened so I made it a priority on our dining agenda because I love small plate dining.  We do not have large appetites so we only ordered three, but each offered a decidedly different flavor profile.  We started off with the blue cheese cream that came with house made kettle chips.  This was followed by moqueca de camarao, a.k.a. shrimp in Brazilian Dende sauce.  I have had this dish elsewhere and would only rate this version as good. The highlight of the meal was the truffled mac and cheese.  I do not enjoy mac and cheese and will only take a small bite when my wife orders it, but this version was amazing.  Even if dining alone, I would order this mac and cheese, that is how delicious it was.  Service throughout was above average and I am looking forward to trying more menu items in the future.
