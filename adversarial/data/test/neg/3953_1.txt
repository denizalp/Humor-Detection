I really enjoyed my pityaya bowl.  The granola was very good and I added cacao nibs for extra crunch.  I loved the almond butter on top.  It made the bowl more filling and was so good!  The only downfall was the base was melted so more of a smoothie consistency.  I needed a straw instead of a spoon to eat some of it.  Nonetheless, it was delicious.  \n\nThey have some great menu options and flavor combinations.  Some of their pre-fixed muffins, oats and protein balls looked good as well.  I will definitely be back.
