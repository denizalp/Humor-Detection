Wonderful fully vegan restaurant located in a pretty neighborhood locale of Cleveland. We didn't know when we might be back again, so we plowed through the menu each ordering a 1-2-3 Cleveland Vegan recommended experience and shared \"family style\". It was a tremendous amount of food and we ate like royalty. Everything was to our taste and we left sated and hopeful that we would find our way back again. Don't forget the dessert!
