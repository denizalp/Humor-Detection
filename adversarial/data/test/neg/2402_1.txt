This place is great, so much better than some of the reviews led me to believe. It's a very casual place, not great looking on the inside, but the food and service definitely made up for it.\n\nThe favorites of the table were the \"Chop\" of 3 kinds of meat, the Beef Brisket, and the BBQ Beans. The Fried Pickles and Sauced Smoked Wings were also winners. The BBQ sauce was excellent and they give you a bottle on the table to add your own.\n\nWe were all very picky BBQ fans and everyone left happy and full.
