I LOVE LOVE LOVE Bikram Yoga Pgh. I started out using the unlimited pass for two weeks and it didn't take long for me to start seeing the benefits. I use bikram as an addition to my other cardio and muscle building activities, and it truly gives me a sense of personal fulfillment. \n\nAbout the facility: it's fantastic. They offer classes at various times throughout the day. Between the classes, the front door is locked so that your items in the locker room are safe. The actual building is clean, has an urban feel, and has everything from a retail section, main desk, lounge area, mat rentals, and beverage area. The locker rooms are clean and have nice showers and cubes for your items. Many people utilize the shower facilities and there is enough room for all of the customers between classes. The actual yoga room has beautiful floors , surrounded by mirrors. The staff is so helpful in and out of class, and I have asked them for postures tips and technique help after class many times.
