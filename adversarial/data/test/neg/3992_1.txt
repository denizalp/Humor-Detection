The wait was pretty long for a Sunday morning. It was 40-45 minutes for just the two of us around 9:30-10am. Husband had the country fried steak and it was a good size. He said it was just average in taste. Not terrible-- but nothing memorable. I had the crab cake benedict which I enjoyed. The crab was very tasty in it. Even with the restaurant being very busy, our server got to us quickly and our food came out faster than I expected. So overall, a good place for a breakfast, but maybe the wait isn't for everyone.
