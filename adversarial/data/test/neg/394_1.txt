We initially had a good experience with Adams Refrigeration when they installed our A\/C two years ago.  They have been out twice a year since then to do check-ups.  This last check-up we got a last minute cancelation from them.  The appointment ended up being rescheduled a couple of times because of other emergency situations.\n\nTwo weeks after the tech performed the check-up we woke up to our thermostat not working at all.  We assumed this would be a warranty issue as it is a new unit and they are the only ones that have touched it.  It was a simple fix of a loose wire, but they still charged us even though it was their work.  I will not be using a company that does not warranty their work.
