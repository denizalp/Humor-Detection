Best Personal Trainer!!!  I've been with TPT for 2 years. This place is amazing!  At 54 with a number of old sports injuries. Worst being two herniated discs that are being managed by my Chiropractor. I have tried it all. Boot camps, Krav Maga, Crossfit, Yoga, Pilates, Spin, etc. \n\nTPT was my perfect fit! Seth, Stephen and Aaron have taken amazing care of me, and have tailored my workouts to accommodate all my old injuries, while at the same time making me the strongest I've ever been. Full body strong!  I feel amazing!  And my chiropractor is thrilled with my progress!  I take the the group classes 4-5 days a week and the variety keeps me from getting bored! I like that I don't have to think about anything... just show up and get it done in an hour. \n\nGo here!!!
