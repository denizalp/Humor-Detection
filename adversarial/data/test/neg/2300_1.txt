When I was looking to have a few shirts printed with some custom artwork, I sent emails to many businesses. A few did not even bother to respond to my inquiry. A couple others wouldn't even consider my order because it was too small. Two companies did respond but the prices were higher than I was prepared to pay, and one could not complete the order by the date I needed the shirts... \n\nThen there was Jeff at Genre Sportswear. Genre Sportswear specializes in smaller orders and performance apparel. Not only was Jeff one of the first to respond, but his pricing was a good 30-40% lower than the other quotes I received. \n\nJeff and I exchanged numerous emails before I actually placed my order. He was always quick to respond and always answered all of my questions. He helped create the right artwork for the shirts, adding and tweaking text until it was precisely what I wanted. \n\nGenre Sportswear uses a sublimation printer, which results in a long lasting look that will never crack or peel off. Rather than selling me boring, basic cotton shirts he provided me with 'dry fit' shirts and tanks, made of material similar to what athletic jerseys are made out of. The shirts were completed days before I actually needed them, and they came out exactly as I wanted. \n\nI plan on ordering more shirts from Jeff in the future and recommend anyone looking to have custom apparel made contact Genre Sportswear for a quote.
