For an expensive upscale restaurant, i expected more from milos. \nI was there with 3 other people this past weekend and we were all fairly disappointed. \n\nOur server was not helpful at all with deciphering different selections of fish I had never heard of. His answer to everything seemed to be \"get up and have a look at the fish market\"\n\nI want to know about flavor profiles of the fish....not see them dead in a bed of ice. What can a person ascertain from this besides a loss of appetite??\n\nUgh.....we let him choose 2 fish for our table and they were both nice fish, but definitely not anything id want again. The 2 filets of fish i did receive had numerous bones in it which i found to be pretty unacceptable. The 2 women at the table got pretty nice cuts of fish, but the other gentleman and I had to spend half our time picking out small bones.\n\nThe crab cake appetizer was the standout dish for us.....it was sweet, flavorful, and had little filler and a LOT of crab meat, It was large too, about the size of a baseball. \n\nWe also had the fried veggies (milos special) with the cheese i cant pronounce.....the cheese was great but there just wasn't enough of it!\n\nDrinks here were fairly priced, and the house greek white wine was good...recommended by the sommelier (who was personable, helpful, and nice)\n\nIt would take me winning the lottery to come back, and id probably stick to a steak or some veggies and crab cakes.
