Wonderful food.  We have been eating lunch there for the last couple visits to Madison.  All items we have tried have never failed to please us.  We love sitting outdoors and taking in all the action from State St.  I have walked inside to look around and it looks nice, it's clean and plenty of seating.  You will enjoy the food.  Oh, did I mention garlic bread... WOW!  If you're in town and want some Italian, you have to try them.
