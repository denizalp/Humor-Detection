This place was hard to visit. The staff was unapproachable and unwelcoming. The outside conditions for the pets were devastating. I feel like knowing this pet store exists and those poor animals are forced to be outside in this heat is going to haunt me forever. I read the negative reviews here and I fully support them. This place shouldn't be open.
