I am not a big fan of Mexican Food but Blue Agave is my favorite now. I love a real margarita...since I was the winning Margarita Challenge in Cave Creek \"I really mean it \"REAL\" and I got it!!! I love Agave Spicy Margarita...kicked my Taste buds' butt!\nThe restaurant looks so nice and clean. Staff friendly and helpful.\n\nHighly recommended.
