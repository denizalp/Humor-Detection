Considering we like to choose Port for fine dining on special events, I am consistently more disapointed each time we go, I am not looking forward to going again if we do. On my birthday dinner a few weeks ago I ordered the steak, bacon wrapped, and the bacon was delicious, but the steak was (1) overcooked, (2) chewy, (3) farthest thing from fresh. I've worked in the Food and Beverage Industry for years, and I understand Monday's are slow, but this was just awful service and quality for a $45 meal.
