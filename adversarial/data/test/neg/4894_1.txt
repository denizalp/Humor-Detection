Just finished my second trip and this restaurant  and all I can say is it's amazing. Probably one of the top 5 in the area.  Very extensive wine menu at reasonable prices for a high end restaurant. I highly recommend the lobster and steak tartare. I also had the scallops which had an amazing fruit garnish as well. No matter the occasion this restaurant will not let you down.
