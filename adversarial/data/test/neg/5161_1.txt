I love and appreciate EVERYONE at Crystal Beauty Studio! I've been coming here since they opened! I had an emergency short notice interview and I needed a full set of gel nails, my eyelashes dyed and extensions put on. They made it happen in less than 2 hours! Hanna Hanna how do I love thee?  I only let Hanna do my eyelashes as I wear contacts and have really sensitive eyes! Somehow every other place I tried my eyes would burn and be blood shot and feel very heavy for a couple days. This has never happened with Hanna! I actually took the photo of my eye in my car right after I got them done. I love my nails! Who would have thought a French manicure could be so fashion forward and coordinate so perfectly with my interview suit I picked up from the tailors! I was told I looked classic, polished, and perfect! People loved my nails! One lady asked to take a photo of my nails and I told several woman about Crystal beauty studio! \nTHANK YOU SO MUCH!! MUAH
