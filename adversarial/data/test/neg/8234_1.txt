Must have their fries and sandwiches. The BLT is loaded with thick slices of green tomatoes deep fried in crispy batter with sliced pork belly on top. This massive sandwich is about 3 inches thick packed with rich flavor and texture. The fries are also very delicious and hearty. My advice is stick with the sandwich and fries and skip the soup. The Roasted tomato garlic soup, although still rich in flavor, was more of a sauce than a soup. The taste and texture closely resembled marinara sauce. I almost wished that I had pasta to go with it after each bite.
