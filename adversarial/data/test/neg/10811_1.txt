This is a very nice indian food place! The fact that it looks luxury is a really nice thing and makes it more comfortable. They have many options for everyone's taste and meal type. The food is seasoned very well. My only critic is with the samosa, to me it could have been wayy better cause it really didn't taste like anything. I got a beer also and 4.99 price tag is kinda high. But if your in the mood for indian food, you should totally check out this place!
