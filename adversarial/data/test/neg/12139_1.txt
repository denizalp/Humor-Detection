My husband and I have stayed in this Hotel before and the Candlewood has always been one of our favorites! On Monday, March 21st 2016, my 9 year old son and I were on our way home and we had a blowout on our back tire. We were scared and it was my first blowout while driving, we pulled off to the side of the I17 right next to the Candlewood. We walked over and the lady at the front desk was soooooo nice and helpful!!! She let me use the phone to call for help, she even checked the Camara on the side of the building to make sure my car was okay, and she gave me and my son a bottle of water and a pack of eminems. I didn't get to get her name, but I am so grateful for her hospitality and for making us feel safe. She was kind of short, had long black or dark brown hair, and the time was about 7:30 pm. The Candlewood not only has some amazing suites but some AMAZING customer service as well. Thank you to the Candlewood and thank you to the sweet lady that helped us!!!
