Espace Libre is known as the experimental theatre in Montreal. I saw my first show there, a mime \"short\" followed by a sort of documentary theatre piece (Le corps qui parle), this evening. Both pieces were excellent and I really enjoyed myself.\n\nThe theatre is conveniently located near métro Frontenac. You will need to circle around to the rear of the building to find the door.\n\nSeating is first-come, first-served. We were warned to arrive early for the best seat selection, but unfortunately the doors were not opened until a few minutes before the start of the play, so our early arrival was no advantage. The theatre isn't huge, though, so I don't imagine that there would be any particularly bad seats.\n\nThe theatre is designed for the possibility of many configurations, so the seating is of a temporary nature -- padded benches on risers. I didn't find it particularly comfortable, but perhaps that was more a function of the show not having an intermission so there was no chance to stretch. \n\nTip:  Don't be surprised, the washrooms are co-ed. (But the stalls have doors that close, never fear). \n\nWe had no problems reserving tickets by phone (with a credit card). Tip: we were offered a great deal of $5 (for a $32 ticket) if anyone in our group was 35 or under, so if you are a young-ish person, be sure to ask if there are any deals available.\n\nOh, et en passant, the pieces were in French. I believe that the resident company (Théâtre du mouvement) makes an effort to have at least one show in English during their season.
