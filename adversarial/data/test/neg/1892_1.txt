Pretty nice place for bubble tea or cakes. Cozier than bubble republic and chatime. There's free wifi here if you want to do work. \n\nDine in drinks and food come with complementary popcorn. Appetizers are good but nothing unique, the typical Taiwanese appetizers. I usually order their cuttlefish balls and popcorn chicken. Whereas for the rice dishes, the pork on rice is ok. But I prefer the rice dishes from bubble republic better. \n\nThe cakes here are not made in house. They are bought from another store. They taste meh. They don't seem fresh and kinda taste old and stale. Avoid. \n\nAs for drinks, they have a decent variety. I think the selection is still smaller than bubble republic. But this is my favourite place to get the wintermelon tea and the wintermelon mousse. These drinks are usually really sweet. Most of the time I order half sweet or 70% sweet. They make this drink perfectly whereas for some places it tastes really watered down. \n\nHokkaido milk is delicious here. It's creamy with the right amount of sugar. \n\nWhite peach bubble tea was horrible. Did not like it. \n\nThe hot fruit tea here is good too. Warm yet refreshing.\n\nService wise, this place is horrible. It's really slow.
