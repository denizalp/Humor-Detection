I have been a repeat customer at Honda West since 2006, and I really think everyone that works there as Great Friends and People Who Care! I always get good service when taking my Honda in and they care enough to really get to know their customers. I think they are just the Best Place to buy a vehicle and also drink a cup of coffee with, will always take my car and my business to them.
