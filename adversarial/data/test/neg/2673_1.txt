This is a horrible Starbucks, for the following reasons:\n\n1) The drinks are very inconsistent, but usually made incorrectly.  Somehow they're able to make the drinks taste differently compared to ever other Starbucks in the city. There are certain employees there who make horrible drinks every time - if we walk in and see them making the drinks, we leave.  Given that there are several amazing independent coffee shops in the neighbourhood, along with a much better Starbucks at Gerrard, I avoid this location if I can.\n\n2) The line ups are usually very long.  Sometimes there is nobody serving that long line up.  I think this location is simply understaffed.  It takes a very long time to get a drink here.\n\n3) There is a limited amount of seating, laid out in an awkward way.  Compared to other Starbucks locations in the city, there's a big difference.
