Been here a few times to have a beverage and chat with a friend -- it's a bit noisy and it could be cleaner. As others have noted, it shares the tarmac with a busy gas station, so getting in and out of the parking lot can be tricky. Be sure to watch out for vehicles darting in and out of the laneways. It's not hip or cool or anything like that, but what did you expect, fair trade organic artisan roast?
