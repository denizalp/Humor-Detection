Finally made it here Saturday around 5pm. To be honest this brewery always looks closed so I'm hesitant to stop. The weather was so nice out Saturday that we actually saw people outside so it was much more welcoming. Inside there were several tables and couches to sit at. They had board games and a bingo board. I inquired about bingo and the bartender said its free on Wednesdays from 7:30-9:30. \nI had never tried their beer before so I asked the bartender what her preference was between the Zitten and Shag. Both are lighter beers. She gave me a taste of both. Both were smooth and tasty. I would have no problem finishing a glass of either but I ended up getting the Shag. \nWe sat outside and ordered from the Food Truck. It was super enjoyable (and kid and dog friendly). \nI will be back for sure!
