Audrey is very meticulous and made sure that I, as the customer, was completely satisfied. This was my first time having something like this done. She was very thorough in explaining the process and what to expect on the initial treatment. If you've been on the fence about having this procedure done, I'd highly recommend it, she's fantastic!
