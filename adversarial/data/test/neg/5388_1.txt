Just recently checked out the newest addition to the Metroparks golf lineup.  \n The center prides itself on recognition from the Audubon Society for \"high quality of environmental stewardship\" and offers educational sessions; so it has that going for it, which is nice..\n The layout is a par 3\/executive course, with only two short par 4's resulting in a par 29.  The place is well-maintained with ample bunkers and some water hazards.\n The driving range really shines though.  The mats in the covered range are more like newer professional field turf than the common patio enclosure green astroturf you find at most places.  There are multiple bunkers and flags to shoot at on the range.  They could benefit from some signs advising the distance to the various flags, however.  They also have decent putting and chipping greens.\n The center also has a small pro shop in case you forgot or need something for your bag.\n It's a great place to work on your swing or short game and the closest golf facility to the city center.
