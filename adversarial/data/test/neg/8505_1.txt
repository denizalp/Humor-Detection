If you're going to give your money to the casinos, give it to this one. Helpful blackjack dealers, look for the Wheel of Fortune slot machine with the BIG WHEEL to spin, makes it more fun. Wish there were more seats for regular betters at the sports book though. Overall, you can't go wrong with a gondola ride and a walk through nice shops. Best location on the strip too!
