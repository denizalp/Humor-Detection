Delish burger  In-n-Out Burger totally lived up to the hype I've heard--the hype of friends and relatives I've been hearing for years! Everything was fresh: burger, flaky bun, fixings. The store was immaculate and the staff helpful and welcoming. I wish this chain would set up shop on the east coast.
