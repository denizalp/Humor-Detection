I LOVE this store!! I really love the concept of Sam's Club, considering that my mom has been a member since the stone age. She always made sure to get good deals and save money on what should be purchased in bulk. Over the years, I have learned to coupon so I realize the value in many items I purchase. If I can get it cheaper via couponing, I will hold off and just make sure to prioritize that with my next coupon run! I usually divide the amount of items by the amount I pay to see if what I purchase is worth it, but if you ever take a good look at the tags of all the items, you will see a 'per unit' 'per oz\/lb\/etc' price to make things more transparent to you as far as savings go! \n\nI remember coming here as a kid and eating the hot dog on my way out. It's so funny to see my kids asking once in a while for a hot-dog because it reminds me of my younger self. This is m\n\nI always check out the little 'clearance' or markdown area in the back, because I have always scored some really great deals on some last-minute items. Another favorite is the gas, it's usually some of the cheapest in the valley. This Sam's can get a bit busy, so expect some lines! This isn't my normal, local Sam's Club but I do like changing it up a bit!
