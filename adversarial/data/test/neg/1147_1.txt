I don't know whether I should be happy or not that finally a quality bakery opened at Yonge\/Sheppard as I love pastries but I'm on a low-carb diet. Regardless, it just opened so I dropped by today to check it out. Each pastry had samples so customers could try, and all samples I tried were so good! Judging by what was available today, the prices were very reasonable - ranges from $1 to $5 (I guess they may add more stuff later though). I picked up taro pastry (I forget the exact name) and chocolate baguettes, and they were so amazinggg. They're generous with the taro filling and I THINK it also has cream cheese in it. The staff were very friendly and packed my pastries individually which I liked. \nNeat place - I recommend you visit as well when you crave some carby yumminessss!
