Ventures for an evening out with out of town friends and ended up here.  We got an assortment of dishes which were all ok, nothing spectacular but the prices were outrageous.  Way overpriced.  Not a big fan of the white cap and language as well.   I wouldn't repeat and I don't think it's kid friendly.
