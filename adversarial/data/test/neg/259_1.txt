This was a business trip and I didn't want to be on the Strip but instead close to the airport for an early departure home. My Garmin GPS was about a block off for the hotel's location, but I had seen where the hotel was earlier when riding the shuttle bus to the rental car facility upon arriving in Vegas so not a problem.\n\nGuest parking is free and appeared to be ample during my early evening arrival. I was promptly greeted upon entering the lobby and my reservation was in order. The desk staff was gracious in pointing out that they had a free Nachos Bar in progress for their guests. I didn't partake, but a nice perk nonetheless.\n\nMy room was in a quiet location away from the elevator and any vending as requested. I was traveling with a colleague on this trip and my Company requires that same gender employees share rooms, so I opted for the sofa bed since I had an earlier flight out than my roommate. I had to call the Front Desk twice for a houseman to come and make up the sofa bed for me, but he did a great job.\n\nBoth the bedroom and living room had their own climate control and TVs, which was great. The kitchen was clean and stocked with the basics. A calendar of hotel events was on the refrigerator.\n\nDespite having to sleep on a sofa bed, my stay was as expected from a quality Hilton property. Definitely a keeper if in the area again.
