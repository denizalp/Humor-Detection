Fantastic experience for my daughter! Everyone is so kind and really understands kids. They really make it fun and uses positivity to motivate kids to brush and floss. She really loves watching TV on the ceiling while getting her teeth cleaned and looks forward to getting a small fun prize at the end. My daughter actually looks forward to seeing the dentist! Kids are so lucky nowadays.
