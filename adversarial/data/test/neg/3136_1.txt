Found Pink Cherry here on Yelp!  As the many positive reviews will tell you, this is a hidden gem in the SW. I had my lashes done by Stephanie and I am thrilled with the way they turned out!  The salon is clean and very cute. There are various products for sale, lotions, lash serums, soaps, etc.  From the moment I was greeted, I felt very comfortable and welcome. Stephanie gave me an very thorough consultation on my lash wishes, and she gave me EXACTLY what I was looking for!  I will definitely be back to Pink Cherry and would highly recommend it.
