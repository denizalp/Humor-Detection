I am also surprised by the negative reviews. I have had nothing but great experiences each and every time I visit. Suit alterations, to pants needing hemmed, to extra starch on my shirts when getting them dry cleaned and pressed. \nAmazing service and great attitudes even when I show up 15 minutes before they close as I work late some nights. \nQuick turn around time and excellent prices will keep me coming back! \nKeep it up!
