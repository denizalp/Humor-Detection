Visited Guy's restaurant in the Quad on Sunday night.  We were seated right away on the patio.   Our waitress was rehearsed and unnatural.  No recommendations made.  We had the lettuce wraps which were very good.  I ordered the turkey burger which was a huge disappointment.  The burger was dry and bigger than the bun....normally that's not a bad thing but in this case, the burger was dry, flat and burnt.  I almost sent it back.  My friend got the fish tacos which she said were just ok.   For the price and the name, I expected much more.  If it weren't for the lettuce rolls, this place would've gotten 2 stars.
