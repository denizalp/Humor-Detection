Today I needed a haircut on the fly before a big recruitment night at school. Jay lined me up with a come over and it came out great. \nHe's also a friendly dude and that's great for someone who you have to sit with for a while. Definitely recommend and will definitely be back. \nThey'll also pick you up from the airport and get your stuff right before you vacation.
