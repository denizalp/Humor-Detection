First of all I have to say that our server George was extremely friendly and welcoming. We order the peking duck was very good.  The smoke fish I have to say was just amazing. Havent had any smoke fish like this for a long time. The fried bamboo shoot tip just perfect. But the taro hot toffee was just speechless. Overall, service was great food was amazing highly recommend this.
