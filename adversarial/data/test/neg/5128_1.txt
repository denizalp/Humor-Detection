Party City in Goodyear is a joke!! I bought my daughter a Sweet 16 sash to wear for her birthday at this location earlier in the day. My daughter later on in the evening went back into the store after we had gone to dinner and was accused of stealing it. They went as far as telling her they were going to call the police. She asked them to look at their camera footage to see that she had it on when she walked in and they continued to tell her that they were going to call the police. I called and spoke to the manager Danielle and she continued to make accusations against my daughter.  I asked her to stay open and I will show them my receipt and once I do they will apologize to my daughter for accusing her for stealing...guess what she said \" no we are closing and it's not necessary\". Ok well if it's not necessary then don't accuse my daughter of stealing. I won't be shopping there again!!
