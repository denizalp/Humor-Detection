After reading a review about the staff being rude, I was prepared to be on my own when shopping for fire glass. However, I was pleasantly surprised when my husband and I showed up, and we met with Mike. He was so nice and helpful! He showed us samples, told us what was in stock, and how to save some money by adding a layer of rock underneath the fire glass. We had a great experience and I would shop here again! .*important note- they are only open until 4:00 during the summer instead of5:00 like it says on Yelp.
