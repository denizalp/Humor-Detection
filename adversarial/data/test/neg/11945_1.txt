I finally found a reliable place to get waxed! My friend recommended this place to me. I will not be going anywhere else for my waxing needs. It does cost more than one of those \"nails and waxing\" places but the higher cost is soooooo worth it! Juliana is now my go to lady. She is so talented and meticulous about creating the perfect eyebrow shape for your face. I'm very happy I found Aroma. The atmosphere is so zen-like  and calming. It's clean and professional. They have a no-double dipping rule which means that the wax will always be clean.
