Even after all this time I don't know if I'm sold on Bojangles.  It isn't so much that their chicken is bad or anything - it's just that it isn't all that.  And I guess I grew up eating Chick-Fil-A (actually I didn't have CFA, but once I tried 'em, I was sold), so I prefer the softer taste of the CFA chicken to that of Bojangles.\n\nThat said, the chicken isn't bad - it's just that it is this tiny crispy little hunk of fried chicken that isn't really anything special and you don't get much of it for the price you pay.  Especially if you get it in a sandwich with extras (such as cheese), the cost really does add up quickly.  Now if you get a sausage biscuit or something it's not bad - but who would go to a chicken place for a sausage biscuit?
