There are liars and thieves in this Walmart car service center. Anytime I go here it's a bad experience. They will steal my metal tire caps, lie about service that's been done etc. I hope it's not a Walmart thing but specific to this location. The photo below shows how they lied about the tire pressure - the receipt says 35 psi while the dash show 29 - it wouldn't be so bad except I asked them to fill the tires. They said the car was wrong. I had to fill the tires myself at a service station later. Did they actually work on my car? You've been warned.
