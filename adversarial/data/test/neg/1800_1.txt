This was the first vision center we went to when we first moved out here 5 years ago. I won't go anywhere else.  It's about a 40 min drive from where we live but the Dr is well worth it.  I have been to chains in the past, and private, and they all seem to care about the bottom line, not your vision.  He is quite different. His staff is kind, welcoming, and quite professional.
