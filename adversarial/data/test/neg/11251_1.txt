This is the most beautiful place to visit on a Sunday. The leisurely stroll up to the switchbacks leads you in many directions. You can experience all this mountain has to offer, the beauty the nature animal life and scenery is unlike anything you will find it other overpopulated mountains across the valley. This place is amazingly gorgeous and well-kept. The restroom facilities are clean and tended to. You will love this hike!
