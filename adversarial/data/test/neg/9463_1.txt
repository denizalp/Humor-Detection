This buffet was about what I expected from reading reviews prior. The food isn't bad, but it isn't amazing either. I considered it to be pretty average quality. There's 11 different stations with a fair quantity at each. However, me not being able to eat seafood of any kind significantly decreased my options. There's not much at the Latin or dessert stations either in my opinion. I've been to a buffet at a smaller casino in Oklahoma that I considered better than this and it's about $10 cheaper. \n\nIf you're only wanting to spend about $30 for a buffet and you're okay with average quality food with a fair variety then this is the place for you. If not, I would definitely say to splurge on a nicer and higher quality buffet.
