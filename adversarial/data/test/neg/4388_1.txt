Came here as a +1 for a Yelp elite movie screen event watching \"McDonalds\". Was super excited! The theatre is on the second floor and an interesting location as it is across from GoodLife and steps away from a bakery, go for tea, chat time and an izakaya restaurant. Good date night spot of lots to do in one place. \n\nThe theatre is not that big and the staff here are pretty friendly and efficient it seems. From what I can tell the place is pretty well kept and clean. The crowd here is mostly yuppies (young working professionals). I'll have to come back to try the VIP movie experience.
