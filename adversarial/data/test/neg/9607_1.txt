So disappointed with my visit here and I didn't even get to try their food. I can understand waiting for a table on a Sunday afternoon but poor service, I can not rationalize. Upon being seated and waiting for about 10-15 minutes, I had to check with the host if we ordered at the counter or if we had a server. 1st time here and no one approached us so seemed legit that maybe we ordered at the counter.  He found our disgruntled server and we placed our order. More time past and a busser brings us water and my coffee. Have yet to see\/hear from our server since ordering. I walked up to the counter to get a coffee refill. 45 minutes have gone by and we decided to leave. I came here for my boyfriends birthday brunch based on the recommendation of a foodie I follow on Instagram. I generally don't speak out like this so it's gotta be pretty bad for me to do so.
