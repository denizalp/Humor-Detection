Their food is great and so much tastier than other Asian markets in the area. The service is also amazing, they are always ready to help with a smile. They have a great selection of products from the Philippines and they are reasonably priced. We come out to this store even though it's further from our house than other markets because of the great service they provide and the delicious food! Try the pinakbet, menudo, kare kare, and pork adobo! Yummy!
