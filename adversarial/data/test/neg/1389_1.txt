I had been meaning to check out this place since reading about in the City Paper and finally made it over there on a Wednesday evening. At 7:30pm, I was surprised to find the restaurant empty. No other guests came in the entire time we were there. The decor is simple and rustic. We ordered the Siberian dumplings filled with lamb and beef to start. They were delicious! I had the seafood special: seared scallops on creamy polenta with arugula salad and roasted red pepper sauce. My companion had the lamb bolognese. While some have complained of small portions, the bolognese was very generous. And three large scallops is pretty typical. The food was great! And don't skip dessert! The Russian honey cake was something pretty special, and I couldn't imagine anything better until I tried my companion's cannoli. Delicious!
