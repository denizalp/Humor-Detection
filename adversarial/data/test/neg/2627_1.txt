The food was good, but the service was less than expected.  I asked a question to the waitress, and I guess she didn't know English.  Then my food came out 7 minutes before my boyfriends. No one said anything, like \"oh it'll be a minute\" or \"sorry it's taking so long.\"  And then as soon as he got his food they put the check on the table and kept trying to take my food.  I said \"no\" twice, and they kept trying to take it.\n\nLike I said, the food was good, but there seems to be communication issues service wise.
