You know, this used to be my favorite cirque show in Las Vegas, but it's definitely not as good since the update.  They added some music (all crappier earlier Beatles stuff) and removed much of the parkour and acrobatics in exchange for crappy dance numbers.  I can only assume this was to save money as people waving their arms to the music has to be cheaper than guys doing flips and aerial twists.  To be fair, the audience seemed happy and maybe it's my fault for seeing this show too many times.
