Honestly, I cannot understand for the life of me why this place only has 24 reviews! First off this is the best nail salon in the valley for nail designs. They will hand paint, do any design, color or 3D art you want. It CAN get expensive depending on what you get. Last time i got a gel build up which is a healthier version to acrylics and then a gel color and it was 50.00. Wayyyy too much for my budget but otherwise their prices are reasonable they give massages with your pedicure. You need to be specific with what you want otherwise a lot can get lodt in translation...however they seem like very honest genuine employees and i look forward to coming back here in 2 weeks :) also make sure if you pay with your card to let them know to add the tip because you cant write it in after
