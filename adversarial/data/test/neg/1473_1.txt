Their soy chicken wings was good but was too salty for our taste. Their spicy chicken wings was too spicy to try and we had to settle to eat only the  soy chicken wings. The server was very attentive and that was the only bright spot of this restaurant. Lastly, It took a while for our food to come out from the kitchen.
