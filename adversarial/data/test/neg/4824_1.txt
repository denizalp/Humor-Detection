Yes it is a fast food version of Japanese food. But that doesn't stop people from eating at mandarin does it? I've tried about 80 percent of the menu and my advice is to just so straight to the chicken Katsu. It's delicious and never disappoints. The beef ribs are good but way to fatty. I'm not paying to discard all that fat.
