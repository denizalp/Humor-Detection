Good food for a decent price. I usually get the carne asada torta because in my opinion, it's one of the best Mexican sandwiches in town. The guacamole spread they put onto the sandwich brings a little heat, and makes the sandwich taste better.  This Roberto's location is nice and modern. Furthermore, this Roberto's location has a friendly staff and the restaurant is clean.
