We have been HH fans from way back and were extremely excited to see there was a location in our hotel when we stayed over for a night in Vegas. We planned to eat breakfast there the next morning with our crew and I eagerly looked up the menu online and planned out which delectable dish I would get. \n\nWell, that didn't work out. While the website shows an updated and exciting menu, this location still had the old one. That was disappointing in itself. \n\nWe also had pretty slow service. Granted, we had a sort of large party with 4 adults and 4 kids but it wasn't so huge as to merit the slowness we experienced. \n\nFood came out and while it was still big portions, things have definitely changed. The biscuits were different, and not a good different. They were kind of dry and blah. Nobody really liked their food. It was not nearly as good as we had remembered. We left wishing we had just gone to the buffet.
