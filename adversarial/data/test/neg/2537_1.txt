I ordered some living room furniture through Amazon.  The product, which had \"3-5 days delivery\" according to the seller's ad has still not arrived.  I ordered on 3\/8.  After ordering, the delivery date came up at 3\/17-20, which is now 6 days ago.  I emailed the seller on 3\/20 for info, and they got back to me on 3\/23 saying that they are sorry and will find out what happened.  Still nothing.  I have contacted them 3 more times and still nothing.  \nActually, the only communication I have received since 3\/23 was what I assumed was an automated email that asked me not to go onto Amazon and give negative feedback.  Maybe that should be the hint that I am not the only one that is unhappy.\n\nAdded after comment back from the business:\nWhat is the excuse for the lack of any communication for the past 3 days after I asked several times for some information?  I have provided the order number in 3 or more emails already.  Why don't you manage that email address instead of managing your image on yelp?
