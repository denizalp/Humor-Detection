I really enjoyed my meal! My boyfriend and I were test driving a new car and happened to pass by this little gem. I had heard about it and I've been wanting to check it out for a few years, it's just not in my neck of the woods (East Mesa).  \nAfter taking care of business at the dealership we stoped and grabbed a meal to share to go since we had to make it back to our side of town in a timely manner. I ordered a 2 item combo. The second item can either come in a burrito or a quesadilla.  We chose the jade red chicken, which was delicious. It's like orange chicken style but better and with a little kick. My second item was the jerk chicken in a quesadilla... delicious as well. For our sides we got the white rice which I always get when I get Chinese, and the second side was refried beans which were really good too! The guy that took our order was awesome...  we told him it was our first time so he told us what the favorites were and gave us a coupe of sample bites before we made our decision. All in all the place was great. Will definitely go back there if I'm in the area!
