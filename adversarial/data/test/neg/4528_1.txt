We have started lessons right after Christmas and the kids really enjoy coming here. We Will continue to come here and like to have a break from Vegas life here. \n\nI know that there is a space issue but I wish there was an easier way to get skates on the kids etc. all of the skates seem to be missing aglets or The shoelaces are so long that they are impossible to get on the kids. With three kids having lessons I have to budget over 20 minutes to get skates on everyone
