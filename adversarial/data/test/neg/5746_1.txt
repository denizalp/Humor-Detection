Found this place on yelp for lunch with a co-worker. We were looking over the menu and was shock at how pricy some of the menu item was. We almost walked out, but we stayed.\n\nAmbiance was a very comfortable family oriented restaurant. \n\nCustomer service was excellent. They checked on us enough to make sure we had what we needed and it was not to a point where we thought it was too much.\n\nFood was delicious. My first time eating this type of Korean food. I ordered a Bi Bim Bop on a plate verses my coworker ordered hers off of a stone bowl. Beef was flavorful on rice and a lot of veges, pickled cucumber, bean sprout, carrots.. top with seaweed and a fried egg. I was told by the women and man that I'm eating it wrong. I need to add their chili sauce and mix everything up then eat it. It was delicious. \n\nI will definitely come back even though it's a bit pricy for me. Overall, it's all worth it.\n\nThanks for the delicious meal!
