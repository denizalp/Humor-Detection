I'm not going to be too critical here because when it comes to Indian food, I am a one trick pony.  I get Chicken Tikka Masala every single time.  Every time.  LOL  I like it so spicy it makes me sweat.  I'm still trying to figure out how to convey that to a restaurant when I order.  I got take out here, and it was really good.  Ordered a couple different types of naan and both were delicious.  The rice was not exceptional, but again... good.  So, my review is for chicken tikka masala eaters.  Nothing wrong with this dish here, but any suggestions on where I can get my favorite indian dish prepared so spicy it hurts twice are welcomed.
