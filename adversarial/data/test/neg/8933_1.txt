Allegiant was the only airline I could find that flew directly to Bozeman Montana. I'd never flown with them but I have a friend who absolutely hates them because they are never on time and change flight times.\n\nI had no issues on my flight to Bozeman as booked, but they did have to move my return flight back 4 hours from 4pm to 8pm. Fortunately this worked out perfect as my niece flew out at 730pm to Denver.\n\nIf I had anything to complain about, it was their gate location...as far as possible away in Terminal 1. No one available in Bozeman to check in until late, fortunately I just needed to use the app for boarding passes. My other complaint is the seat, virtually no padding and no pouch for storing drinks, etc. Even a short 1.5 hour flight was uncomfortable. I guess that's what you get for $145 round trip. Price was great!
