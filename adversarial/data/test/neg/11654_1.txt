Had a haircut with Katt yesterday my first time in while working in PHX for the summer. Without giving her too much direction, she totally nailed it. She was friendly without asking awkward or banal questions, listened exactly to what I had to say, and took the time to make sure her detail was on. I'm sad I won't be around to return.
