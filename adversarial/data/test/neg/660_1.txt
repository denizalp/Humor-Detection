My boyfriend and I ate here this past weekend and loved our experience. The menu had several options that sounded delicious and it was difficult to choose. The staff was kind enough to suggest a delicious small plate and made it a double to create an entree for my boyfriend and he loved it! The vibe of the restaurant was relaxing and the music choices were on point. This is a spot I would definitely recommend if you are looking to try something in the NorthSide.
