Pros  \nFood was good compared to other options in the area\nWas in and out in less than 10 minutes but I was the only one there\nService was ok, didn't seem very welcoming but I was taking it to go\n\nCons\nI read so many reviews about portion size and I guess I came on a bad day,it barley fed me and my 2 year old! I was still hungry and that never happens! Didn't care for the onions in the fried rice. There was more vegetables as well than meat. I guess if I'm hungry for Chinese I'll come here or try some place else.
