Feels like I found a hidden gem with this place. It's nice and clean inside. The woman greeted me and was very polite as soon as I walked in. I gave her a vague description of what I wanted and she nailed it. She took her time and was patient. I never felt like she was rushing. She took her time to compare eyebrows and did not stop till it was perfect. I didn't ask for the price before we started and couldn't believe how cheap the total was when she rang me up. I hope not too many people find out about this place but good service is so hard to come by nowadays I just had to share my positive experience. Will definitely be returning there from now on.
