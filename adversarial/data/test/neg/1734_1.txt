Ok I officially love this place. Went back to try the WellBowl...a build your own grilled chicken salad...10 stars! SO fresh and delish, and their homemade dressings are fabulous. The staff there is super helpful and friendly and the place is spotless. They are located a bit off the beaten path but well worth the trip. Hope they expand all over the city.
