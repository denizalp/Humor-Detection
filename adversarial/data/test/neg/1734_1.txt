We went for a Saturday lunch to meet friend in town. Food was eh, nothing made my mouth water and we could have easily ate the same meal for half price off of the strip. The wait staff was terrible and couldn't find us a high chair throughout the entire 2.5 hours we were there. We will not be returning.
