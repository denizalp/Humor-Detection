Delicious! The visual impact of the special cones is huge and wonderful. I tried the Cookie Monster, which was blue cookies and cream ice cream with mini Chips Ahoy and an Oreo cone. The ice cream was fun though standard flavour-wise - we all have had cookies & cream, right? But the cone provided a lovely surprise in that it had marshmallow fluff on it in addition to the Oreo cookies! So fun and delicious!\n\nWhat was a standout flavour-wise though was their jasmine milk tea ice cream. I love all things tea-flavoured. It was flavourful but not bitter, not too sweet...it was fantastic! The waffle cone was also great quality. I can't wait to taste more of their unique ice cream flavours!
