Phoenix is seriously lacking when it comes to options for pie. Thank goodness Mamma Toledo has stepped in to fill that, ahem, piehole.\n\nI got to experience of of her pielicious concoctions at the Wednesday night food truck gathering downtown. I'll admit I was kinda hoping for a fruit pie but it's all creme pies. I however am not going to turn down pie so I can make a creme pie work! \n\nThe boyfriend and I shared a chocolate creme. Yum. Yum. Yum. For $5 you get a mini pie that was certainly big enough to share (at least after stuffing our faces at other food trucks). The filling was rich and chocolatly, the whipped topping held up in the heat and the crust was really good too. The crust can make or break a pie and I thought her's was flavorful, flaky and just the right thickness.\n\nThe only bad thing was that she gave us two really wimpy spoons. It was hard to cut through the crust because the spoons would bend under the pressure. Mamma Toledo - get some heartier spoons, or forks even, and it'll be perfect!
