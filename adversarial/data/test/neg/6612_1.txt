Easy to review now. This place can get so crazy, but now we sit at the bar counter. First time we got Tori who is awesome, but the last two times Kat has been the waitress and she's great, too. We've made it a Sunday Morning every week kinda gig and Kat even remembered us last week after just one visit. The food is great. No real complaints anymore now that we've found the good waitresses.
