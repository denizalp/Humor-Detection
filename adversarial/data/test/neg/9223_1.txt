Somehow, during a recent trip to Toronto, I went to very few beer-heavy bars or restaurants. Maybe it was because there was usually good, local beer on the menu at every restaurant I visited. Nonetheless, I wanted to have at least one night knocking back a few pints, and fortunately, Bar Hop was a short walk away from my hotel.\n\nFirst, Bar Hop has multiple locations, particularly downtown around King and Queen. I was surprised that there were two locations almost equal distance to the Hyatt Regency, but I opted for the one on Peter because of the rooftop patio.\n\nGenerally, I also was interested in Bar Hop because their menu looked impressive. There were several IPA and pale options that I wanted to try, though unfortunately, by the time we got there, a few had already been cleared out.\n\nStill, I got to try three IPAs and each was good in its own way. They were all from Ontario and now I am jealous of all those who can partake of these on a regular basis. \n\nI also really enjoyed relaxing on the rooftop patio. Maybe it was due to being a Sunday night, but it was really easy to find a spot to sit. The patio has a sort of second level, which wraps to the back and was completely empty. My partner and I took in the beautiful summer's night air, which of course only enhanced the beers themselves.\n\nI should also note that she did not get beer, but rather some of their signature cocktails. One was more tiki-style (I believe it was called paper punch), the other, tequila-based with activated charcoal. She found these drinks equally delightful.\n\nCheers!
