My friend picked this place out for a girls' dinner out. I don't know anything about Malaysian food, but we ordered the $35 chef's choice and they brought out tons of delicious food.  An amazing deal and the service was great too. There was a slaw that was reminiscent of Susur's Singapore Slaw (and a lot cheaper with this deal). Will definitely come by again.
