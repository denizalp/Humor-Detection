Awesome place for lunch! I had the munch breakfast, husband had the Buffalo chicken wrap, they were both awesome. It was a 40 minute wait but in Vegas at lunch time I figured that was a good sign. The service was awesome, Sarah was our server and she was very attentive despite being so busy!! Food came out super fast as well.
