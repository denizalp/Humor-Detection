Overall great experience.  Staff was very friendly.   Had been flying all night and luckily a room was avail at 9am so they allowed us to check in early.   Also let us check out late.  \n\nRoom was a little small, but it was nice and it was very clean.  Fine for two people, however.   \n\nDownside is you could hear people talking In the hall.  But since they were only walking by and the sound didn't last long, it was ok.   Cleaning \nladies were having a convo in the am and you could hear everything, but again not a huge deal.  \n\nPerfect location for downtown.  Close to everything.  Price was right.  \n\nWill be back, thanks Hotel Victoria!
