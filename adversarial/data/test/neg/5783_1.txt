I've been wanting to try Monty's Blue Plate Diner ever since I moved to Madison. But every time I've tried to go, there's been a line out the door, so I've gone elsewhere. However, on Mother's Day at two in the afternoon, although there were people sitting outside, we were able to get in without a wait.\n\nInside is a definite retro diner feel. There's also a display case w\/amazing looking pies.\n\nOur waitress escorted us to a table, brought us waters, and took our drink orders. The menu is heavy on the breakfast items. However, my brother and I were both in the mood for lunch. I ordered the Meatloaf Stack and my brother got a burger with a side of fries. He made a comment to the waitress that he wanted the fries really crispy. Crunchy he said.\n\nWhile waiting for our meal we continued to peruse the menu. Their desserts and dessert drinks look and sound amazing. When I go back, I will be sure and save room for those.\n\nIt took awhile for the food to come out and when it did, it was sans fries. But the waitress explained that she had sent the fries back because they were definitely NOT crispy enough. When she did bring them out a few minutes later, they were PERFECT! Crispy, crunchy, really fried. Kudos to the cooks and kudos to our awesome waitress for taking care of us like that. The rest of the food was also quite good. My meatloaf was perfect. I could have used more gravy for the mound of mashed potatoes, the onion rings were thin and crispy. My brother said his burger was excellent.\n\nWe left stuffed and pleased. I definitely want to go back. I just need to find a time when the line is not out the door.
