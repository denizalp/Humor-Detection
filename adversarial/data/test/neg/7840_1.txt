Not impressed. Service was below average for a steakhouse who's menu and pricing would be considered comparable to a Flemings, Durants etc. We started with a weakly poured vodka tonic and some calamari (small portion) which was just \"ok\". A lettuce wedge followed and  the lettuce was brown and wilted opposed to being fresh and crisp. For the main course we both had the 14 oz ribeye and it was very good. Properly cooked, decent cut of meat and nicely seasoned. Steamed veggies and a loaded baked potato were chosen for our sides and they were ok, however, the baked potato does not exactly arrive at the table \"loaded\". They were kind enough to let you do it yourself. (And if you do, I would skip adding the \"Bacos\".)  We realized that our waiter had not brought our bread to the table and politely asked for a basket. He came back with a couple of small pieces and said \"Sorry, we're almost out of bread.\"  We didn't stick around for desert. Overall, I would consider this to be an average AT BEST experience and would most likely not return.
