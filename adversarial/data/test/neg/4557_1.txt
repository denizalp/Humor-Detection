Here is a tip: DONT EVER EVER EVER ORDER DURING BUSY HOURS. It will take hours to get your food, the food will be cold, and you won't get all of your food. Its dang near a guarantee. It has happened to me 4 times! but the food is good when its fresh. \n\nI have ordered about 5 times and I work about 1\/4 mile away. The first 4 orders took several hours to get my food, it was cold, they NEVER bring the ranch, and I have never received everything I ordered. It's either the fries, soda, and once a complete sandwich!  UGGG because their bada bing chicken sandwich is fantastic. \n\nHowever: Today (Wednesday) at 4 pm I ordered the chicken sandwich with fries, a drink, a side of ranch and a turkey hoagie with chips and a drink to take to my husband later. I received everything but the ranch (no surprise there) and it was all here in about 15 minutes!!! I was really happy with my service today. The food was good and it got here quickly.\n\nMoral of the Story: order when its slow and its definitely worth is. Order when its busy and you will be disappointed and angry.\n\nA tip for management - when you consistently mess up the deliveries to everyone, it makes you look really, really bad and you end up with terrible reviews like the ones on Grub Hub.
