I've been here several times and I always get a bowl of soup.  The soup has never disappointed, but I would like to try a salad or sandwich too, however at Kneaders you can only get a combo like that if you get a soda with it. I don't like soda.  Anyway if you want a good bowl of soup, this is your place.
