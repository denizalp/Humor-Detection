The hotel was average.  The rooms were fine, although our sliding door to the balcony was stuck shut and we had to call maintenance to have it opened.  Also, there was a burnt out light in our room that never did wind up getting fixed.\n\nAdditionally, we arrived and learned that the pool would be closing early (6pm) on Sunday for an event......they kicked us out of the pool area at 4pm instead.\n\nFurther, if you want to eat at the hotel restaurant, don't.  It took over an hour after we ordered our food to even see an appetizer....and according to the only other two tables seated....they had the same experience.
