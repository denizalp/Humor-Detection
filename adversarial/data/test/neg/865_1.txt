First time here this evening and overall very pleased with my experience!\n\nNegatives:\n- icy initial reception by hostess. She was not friendly.\n- no happy hour food items\n- I wasn't a fan of their white blend\n\nPositives:\n- great service. He was friendly, quick, and attentive. \n- loved the atmosphere. Warm, cozy, visually appealing - the whole place is beautiful!\n- FOOD IS AMAZING! We had the bruschetta sampler, smoked tomato bisque with grilled cheese croutons (genius), mixed fries, and pear salad. Everything was beautifully presented and delicious! Fantastic!\n\nWe only had time for one glass of wine. I will definitely be back to try more! Great place!
