This is a nice little place in a nondescript strip mall near ASU. The food is primarily North Indian, and it's tasty. My lentils were nicely spiced, and my boyfriend couldn't stop talking about his lamb korma for the next half hour after we left. If you like Indian food and are in northern Tempe, I recommend trying this one.
