This place is so weird and kitschy - I LOVED IT. A friend tipped me off to this place. I'm not sure I ever would have found it otherwise, which would have been a real tragedy. I'd honestly walked past it dozens (hundreds?) of times without even noticing it. So after dinner at Miss Thing's just West on Queen, we stopped in for a few cocktails. I cannot sing praises of this bar loudly enough. The front area, looks like a little storefront. I believe it is a mezcal bar. Prior to our visit, we did not know what mezcal was. Thank you to our fabulous bartender\/ server\/ ~mixologist~ named Joel for explaining this #complex beverage to us in terms we could comprehend even though we didn't love the taste. Perhaps too #complex for a couple of basic white girls? The bar was wonderful - dimly lit, sprinkled with taxidermy and the pièce de résistance, a wu-tang themed lavatory? This bar *gets* me. But more on Joel! He took his time to go over the cocktail menus in detail with us and give us detailed flavour profiles of each beverage. He even made very astute recommendations to us based on what kind of flavours we were looking for. He made us feel welcome - like old friends. Thank you, Joel. We will be back to see you and Pretty Ugly pretty soon.
