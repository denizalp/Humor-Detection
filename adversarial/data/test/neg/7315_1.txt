My first time staying here and I loved it!!!! Wow!!! Last time I was in Vegas The Palazzo was under construction so it was nice to see it completed. There is lots to see and experience, so come prepared to take it all in. All the rooms are suites and very spacious. Aside from Tao restaurant there is also Tao Beach, so if you are here during peak season, don't forget to check it out.
