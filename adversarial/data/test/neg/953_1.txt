I finally tried Craft Burger after reading about it a lot so my hopes were very high. I wasn't disappointed. The burger was cooked just right and the fries were very good, nice and freshly cut. That being said, it is still just a burger joint so don't go in expecting to taste anything incredibly different than you'd get anywhere else. What Craft Burger does, they do well. But beef is beef and it all comes down to how its cooked and the kinds of toppings you get. I just had a simple cheeseburger this time around but I am looking forward to going back and trying some of the more elaborately topped ones. If you like burgers, you can't go wrong here.
