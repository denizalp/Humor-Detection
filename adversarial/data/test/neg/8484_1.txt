This store has such cute designer items for cheap! They have such designers as Diane Von Furstenberg, Free People, Hudson Jeans, True Religion, French Connection, and BCBG. In addition to clothes and shoes, they have accessories such as purses, wallets, and jewelry, including a few items from Tiffany & Co. I eyed a cute Chanel tote and a black Balenciaga city bag behind the counter for a very reasonable price considering how much they are originally. Sample prices that I saw: Hudsons for less than $40, and a Free People dress for $30.\n\nThe saleslady was very friendly and nice. If you consign with them, you can get 50% cash or 60% credit- not a bad rate! They also offer a 30 day layaway program for purchases over $100.
