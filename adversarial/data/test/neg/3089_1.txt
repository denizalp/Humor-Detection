Surprisingly good for a hotel.  I stay in a lot of hotels and eat in may. You can't always find as good a selection, both at the bar and from the restaurant, as this place has. While wine spectator would sniff at the small selection, there are many good wines here and they are not overly priced. Taylor the bartender knows her stuff and can discuss both the wine list and the spirits on hand. I had a nice martini. Later I had the BR Cohn cab with dinner and it was very good. For dinner I splurged and had the filet. It was one of the better steaks I've had at a restaurant. I would definitely recommend this place.
