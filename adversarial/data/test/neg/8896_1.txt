The food here is fantastic!  My friend ordered the shrimp tempura  po'boy and I got the corned beef Benedict which comes on an amazing rye bread pudding. Everything is excellent!  It was more than I'd normally spend on breakfast but i ended up taking half home so It sort of worked out.  I'd prefer an option for a smaller portion at a smaller price. I'm not a light eater but the bread pudding was just too dense! The only thing keeping this place from being a five star review is the price point and the out of the way location. I will definitely be back if I'm in the area again!
