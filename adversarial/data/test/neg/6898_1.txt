I got an online deal to try some mink lashes.  I was super excited, as I had a wedding coming up.\n\nI get the lashes.  They looked AMAZING.  I followed her post-care instructions (no showering or washing the face for 48 hours, and no make-up application), and was disappointed that after 4 days they started falling out.  After 7 days, the lashes were COMPLETELY gone.  Totally not worth the expense.\n\nI wrote her an email to tell her, and her response was defensive, she blamed me (!?), and was ultimately mean spirited and didn't offer any solutions.\n\nI so badly had wanted the lashes to work out.  \n\nI will try again with another provider.
