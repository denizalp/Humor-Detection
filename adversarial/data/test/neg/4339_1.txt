Just took my 3 kids, ages 11, 6, and 4 for xrays and their cleanings\/dental exam ...had an extremely pleasant visit. No cavities!!!! All three got to ring the bell and celebrate. They even quickly slid my son in for a quick sealant treatment. Thank you, thank you...that alone made my day. We all left with smiles on our faces and kids with stickers, tattoos and small treasure box prizes. Dr. Laurie, Sammy, and all of the staff made this Spring Break  appointment enjoyable and painless.
