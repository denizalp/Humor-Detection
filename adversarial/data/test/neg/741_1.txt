That's some good Island Flavor. Love the Shoyu Ahi Poke and the soup here. Better than the one at CA Hotel.\n\nOur 3rd time back we took our family of 13 here and everyone ate everything from Kalbi ribs, Loco Moco, Stew, Poke, Chicken Terriyaki, Spam Masubi, Guava Cake, Chicken Katsu. It was all good.
