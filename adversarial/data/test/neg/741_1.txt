Never been to this chain, so I figured I'd give it a try. For me, the best part was the drive through. I was in the area for a meeting and heading home. Didn't want the usual fast food and didn't have time to walk in or sit down at a restaurant. This was a great compromise. \nI got the roast beef and added mushrooms. I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor and quality. Reminded me a bit of roast beef sandwiches the day after you had roast for dinner. I happen to like that, kind of like when you have a turkey sandwich the day after Thanksgiving. \nMy service was prompt, friendly,  and correct. Can't ask for much more from a drive through.\nI'll stop in again next time I'm in the area.
