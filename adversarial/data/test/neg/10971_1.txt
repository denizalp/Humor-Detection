Review for just the chicken caesar salad. The menu promised croutons and parmesan cheese, but when I brought my bowl back to my room all I saw was chicken, lettuce, and the dressing pack. Supremely disappointing to say the least! Lettuce was at least crisp and dressing was good. Chicken had that weird slimy spongy texture you find in most fast food chicken, but that was to be expected.\n\nI could have went back and asked they remedy my sad salad but I didn't think I'd be missing that much. So learn from my mistake and check your salad before you leave the food court!
