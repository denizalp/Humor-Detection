I said yes to the dress!  While visiting Vegas with a girlfriend, we came here on a whim to kill some time. My wedding is not until 2017 so I had no intention of buying a dress so early, or while on vacation. We called ahead and they were happy to take us last minute.  Laurie took care of us and we had such a great time.  I picked out a variety of dresses to try, to get a feel for my style. Laurie was very receptive to my tastes and knew exactly what to show me. She came in with this one-of-kind Mori Lee dress that was half off, and I was in love! She and my friend were convinced it was \"the one\", and Laurie gave me plenty of space while I mulled it over.  She gave great insight without being pushy.  The store has a great variety of beautiful, quality dresses and all the ladies there seemed very genuine.  I definitely recommend it!
