Pinkberry is my 2nd favorite fro-yo establishment in town.\n\nPROS: cutest modern decor ever, rich yogurt flavor, fresh, quality ingredients, clean establishment\n\nCONS: expensive (not weigh by the ounce), employee makes your cup for you instead of self serve, parking at this location is annoying on the weekends
