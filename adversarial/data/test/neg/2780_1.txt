Oh the sweet glorious splendor that is the MGM Grand buffet! Yes, it is pricey. But so is the rest of Las Vegas in general. Gone are the days of cheap food and free-flowing booze, but I digress. What you do get for the price is a variety of  quality food and comfortable surroundings. The desserts are superb and they have a wide array of beverage options. After filling up at the buffet I like to head to the sports book, which is just off the main entrance. It's a good place to relax and bet on the ponies. I will have to say that the MGM grand as a whole has fallen off over the years. It used to be my go to place, but now they nickel and dime you pretty hard. $10 for parking is pretty outrageous, especially after spending well over $100 just at the buffet (no validation offered, I checked). But, this review is just for the buffet alone, hence the five stars.
