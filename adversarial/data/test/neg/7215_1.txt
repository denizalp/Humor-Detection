Leo came out and did the stucco on my main house in 2012. See his pictures #14 and #15. This was a major remodel. I've done many remodels and flips and this house takes the cake. His work speaks for itself. This summer we finished building the guesthouse and Leo came out to match the stucco with it's intricate crown moldings and pop outs. Stella work! Communication is essential when working with Leo. Make sure you both know what your expectations will be and there will be no problems.
