Irwin Goh DDS has a superior dental practice. Professional, friendly staff, who will spend time to patiently answer all my questions. They also remember my family 's interests and adventures. I have had general exams and cleanings, crown replacements, and recently a professional whitening that produced great results! The office keeps track of my insurance benefits and sends me additional messages beyond the simple reminder of next day's appointment.
