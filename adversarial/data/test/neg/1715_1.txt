Located in Terminal A, the only restaurant among fast food options (near A12). It was packed and it is self seating. Once seat found I was immediately greeted and drink order taken. I ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. In 5 mins I had my order. It had a smokey flavor (not too much) which was amazing. Although I put BBQ sauce on it, without it was tastey, it enhanced the taste. I would definitely come and order the same thing again if ever in this terminal.
