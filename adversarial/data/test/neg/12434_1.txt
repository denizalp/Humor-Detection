This is my first time going to any of the Baton Rouge franchises. I had gone with my coworkers for a holiday lunch, party of 15-20 people. \n\nI ordered the Goat Cheese Top Sirloin 8 oz. Steak - Crumbled goat cheese, Herbes de Provence, chopped walnut - medium rare.\n\nWhen we all ordered, the waiters seldomly came to checked up on us even with refilling with water. Although the servers were nice, the frequency of flagging someone down was harder as they were not around our area for the most part.\n\nThe steak was done well but I wouldn't say it was the best steak I've ever had, and I am no expert on steak. The veggies that came with the dishes were overcooked and really bland for taste.\n\nOverall, the experience was pleasant and average, but not somewhere I would go out of my way to going again.
