Update, having tried the roti, I am bumping the review up to five stars.  The roti is awesome, and I would recommend getting either it or a doubles with everything.  The roti is like a big burrito, but filled with spiced potatoes, chickpeas, and chicken if you want.  Great seasonings, but the real winner is the wrap, it is kind of like the crust from a pasty, but tastes almost a little like potatoes, super tender and flavorful, and obviously homemade.  So good!\n\nSecond update:  There are two updates I feel I need to note.  First, they have added a new pork option for both the double and roti, so now there is veggie, chicken, and pork.  The pork is insanely good, it is slow cooked, super tender, with tons of flavor, and there is a lot of it, I can't recommend it enough.\n\nThe second thing I want to point out is that Yelp still says the cart is down by the square, but it has moved, and is now full time on Dayton street, by Union South, on the corner of Dayton and Charter.  It is there most of the time, but does seem to take a day, sometimes two off each week.  I would recommend checking the Facebook page, he normally posts daily if he will be out or not.
