Shared a two & one haddock fish & chips, so many chips (even though it was supposed to be a small portion)! Chips are some of the best we have had in a while, and the fish was SILKY SMOOTH!!!! Fried to perfection, and huge as well! \nGreat staff, very friendly and warm! Some of the other diners were elderly, some with kids, a great mix of folks! \nSmall, cute restaurant, with some bigger tables in the middle if you had a bigger party.
