I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet! This is my Vegas tradition ever since my first trip to Vegas as an adult, every trip, usually on the last day, I get a savory crepe for breakfast\/brunch. This is not the best creperie ever, but for a grab-n-go place, it's very good. I like that the crepes are not smothered in sauce, but with a decent amount of filling.
