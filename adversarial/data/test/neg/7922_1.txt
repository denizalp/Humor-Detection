All Hot Food Was Fairly Cold at Table - Otherwise Wide Variety\nI was actually shocked and I hope I did not catch them just on a \"bad night.\" But the nice looking prime rib, mashed potatoes and gravy were just cold and lame by the time I sat down. I will say they had a FAST LANE for the MLife holders and that was AWESOME!!\n\nBut NO WAY would I wait in line ever at Bellagio for their Buffet or go there even if its FREE!!! The Aria is the best buffet second only to the Wynn, and Mirage I felt was third best and totally the most gracious staff ever at the Mirage Buffet, Every service person thanked us for our business and went out of their way to smile and do so. This was not the case at the Bellagio and if they could just make their food HOT HOT it would be quite awesome.\n\nIt was the only real problem I saw they have and perhaps just a bad night so I apologize if this was the case. ALL the staff depend on tourism and good reviews. So I am careful with what I say and give that real thought.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.tripadvisor.com\/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d422633-r530406791-The_Buffet_at_Bellagio-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html#
