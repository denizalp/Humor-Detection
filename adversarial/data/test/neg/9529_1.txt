This review is based on the day time dim sum experience.\n\nWu Tai is an excellent place to have a meal with my vegetarian friends. Just love that we can all eat everything and anything off the menu.\n\nWe tried quite a few dishes:\n\nSticky Rice Siu Mai ($3.20) - Meh\n\nMushroom Veggie Dumpling ($3.20) - A-OK\n\nRice Wrap in Lotus Leaf ($4.20) -A-OK\n\nSteam Eggplant & Mushroom ($4.20) - Hate it! Just taste grassy and blend\n\nFungus Dumpling Hai Gaw ($4.20) - A-OK\n\nSteamed Luffa Rice Roll ($3.20) - Excellent\n\nDeep Fried Lotus Cake with Sticky Rice ($6.50) - Batter is way too heavy... Meh\n\nBaked Almond Pudding ($3.20) - Freshly grounded almond and served right from the oven! I love that!\n\nLayers Cake with Nuts ($4.20) - A-OK\n\nI notice that most of the dishes are not oily at all. The taste is really delicate and clean. I also enjoy the fact that they not trying to make their dim sum to be the look alike of their non veggie version.\n\nThe deco is classy and the space is spacious! The restaurant was not busy at all when I visited and the vibe is really calm and zen. Servers are all really friendly and nice.\n\nI will definitely be back if I am dining with my vegetarian friends. The price is on the pricier side, but Wu Tai definitely provides a great and refine vegetarian dining experience!
