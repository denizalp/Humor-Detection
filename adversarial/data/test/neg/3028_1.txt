DO NOT purchase their groupon. what a fckin joke!!!! i call the guy to schedule. the deal is 2 hrs of cleaning. he says since there will be 2 ladies coming, it will be for one hr. he texts me the morning of at 2am that his car was stolen. he said he'll call me to reschedule. i call him. \"oh we will be there tomorrow at 8am.\" get a txt 4 hours later. \"our groupon acct has been canceled. pls call for refund\". r u fckin kidding me?!!!!!! had to find another cleaning company.
