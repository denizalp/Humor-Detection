I tried this place on Saturday for the first time!  The service was great.  Fast drinks and food orders.  The food itself was really good.  I had the mayor of flavortown burget which was really fantastic.  The desserts are a bit on the insane side in terms of size \/ quantity.  When I was there for lunch the place was packed, buzzing and had a good Vegas feel !  If you're on the strip - I suggest you drop in and try it out !
