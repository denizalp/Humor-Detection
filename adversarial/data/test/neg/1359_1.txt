Basic Tex-Mex type menu. Wasn't really blown away by anything.  The nachos were pretty lacking. So much for the \"never a dry chip\", we had a bunch of them.  If you've been to one American Tex-Mex eatery, you've pretty much have been to them all.  At least the manager was honest about their mediocre tamales.  I give him credit for being truthful about it and not trying to sell me on them.
