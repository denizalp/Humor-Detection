FANTASTIC food and beer. I recommend the beer sampler, and the French onion soup. The sandwiches and wings are delicious. Just beware: they have a very strange potato policy about not allowing substitutions. That's ok, though, because their house made chips are AMAZING. Also, my favorite waitress is a woman named Shelby. I highly recommend you request her for the absolute best service you can ask for. A+
