Pleasantly surprised! We live across the parking lot and a menu was found in our door yesterday. A Chicago inspired menu at that! Being from Illinois we are curious as to if their food could measure up. We got 12 wings, a HUGE order of Chicago Style Fries, and 3 drinks a piece for less than $40! And It was delicious! Roger, the bartender, was hospitable and friendly. The restaurant owner, Pizza Mike, came out and had a great conversation with us and a few other patrons. Overall, exceeded our expectations. We will be returning again!
