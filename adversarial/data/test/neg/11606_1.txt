I have been a patient of Dr. Yasmin Ismail-Juma for over 20 years.  She is caring and goes the extra mile for her patients dental health.  She would rather give a patient extra time rather than cut corners.\nDuring the cleanings, she checks the state of dental health carefully so that she can keep an eye on areas of possible cavities and recommend treatment if the patient is grinding their jaws at night time.\nShe tries to ascertain that treatment is affordable and will work with the patient to see which portions of necessary treatment are covered by their insurance plans.
