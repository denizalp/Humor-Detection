Omg! I finally got to kill my craving for the Waffle works with Portuguese sausage. Weird combination but I absolutely love it! I love coming here. The banana nut muffin is ahhmazing, so moist light and fluffy!  From the waffle to the scrabbled eggs and portuguese sausage it was definitely cooked to perfection. I couldn't help but do a little dance in my seat while eating lol. The service here is always outstanding! The menu is hugh. Everything looks so good on it. I always have trouble choosing what I want for breakfast. One day I'll try everything on the menu... Will come back again... Hehe
