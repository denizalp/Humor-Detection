We come in and everything's fine. The lane was still in the previous game and won't reset. We got 1 hour gme and the lane stopped working meanwhile counting our time. We called the manager and while we explain that it's counting the time and we are in a bit lack of it, she laughs at our faces and said she'll fix it when possible. A manager should understand how frustrated we are or offer something as an apology. We didn't even get a sorry. For $60 game of one hour plus shoes. Definitely not worth it. Don't come.
