Sorry Georgetown - I have to disagree. This diner is in a run down strip mall - and the decor was horrible. Needs a TOTAL make over. The staff was friendly and improved our initial impression of this venue. Then we went to the washroom to wash our hands (smh) mmmmGross! My five year old did not want to go in. He said this was an ugly bathroom and didn't want to touch anything (good thing). \n\nI suppose the food could pass (with a push), but it was just mediocre. I don't give out bad reviews so I gave this place three stars because of the friendly staff. I wanted to love this place based on the reviews but it was an epic #FAiL. \n\n**I really want the management to know that its ok to change the 1970s puke-colored vinyl bench seats and baby poo coloured green paint. Please hire a restaurant reno company. xoxo. I think you can do so much better.
