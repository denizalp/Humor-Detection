BOTTOM LINE: Eat here! Their guac (along with everything else) is superb!\n\nThe owners of this place takes the award for being super friendly and cheerful. Camera-shy people beware though, they like to photograph their patrons (with your permission of course) so they can put in on their TV slide show!\n\nTheir menu is fairly straightforward with tacos, quesadillas, empanadas and burritos and even adobo chicken (which I didn't get to try because it was sold out!), but their combination of fresh ingredients and spices make this place top-notch. In particular, whatever they put in the guac, it's amazing - some of the best guac I've ever had! The portions are substantial and you will be full. This has definitely become one of my go-to spots for a quick and casual meal.
