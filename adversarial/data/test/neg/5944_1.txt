My family and I went to RM seafood during happy hour, so we did not get the full menu. We ordered the shrimp tempura, Wok fried Edamame and the fresh Maine lobster roll (which is a small sandwich by the way!). The shrimp tempura was very good and it came with a spicy sriracha aioli, so if you like spicy seafood this is the dish for you. The lobster roll was simple and fresh. It is very small(you could probably finish it in 3 bites) and it comes with handmade potato chips. The edamame was liked by everyone in our family!
