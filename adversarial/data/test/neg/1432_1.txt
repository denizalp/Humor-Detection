This unit should be sold to comfort inn, maybe even red roof inn!  Not up to Hilton standards at all.  If you're a college kid, or need a cheap place to stay with small rooms, go for it.  \nThe fitness room and pool are dirty, small and a tad gross too.  Badly in need of an update, this whole unit is simply not worthy of the Hilton name, or price.  It was maybe state of the art in 1989, but times have changed.  I live in hotels, with my job, this one needs help!
