I love Chinese food delivery. I hated this places food, I ordered at 9:00 ($17) worth of food I got teriyaki chicken fried rice, egg drop wonton soup and crab cream cheese wontons. The guy showed up at 10:20 and was like sorry we had a busy night. After waiting that long you would hope the food would be delicious, it was the worst Chinese food I've ever had the chicken looked like it wasn't enable and I tasted it and it was nasty, the rice looked like potatoes and had no flavor I couldn't eat any of my main entree, the egg drop wonton soup was nasty and made me feel sick the only good thing I got were the wontons... Great ya never ordering here again
