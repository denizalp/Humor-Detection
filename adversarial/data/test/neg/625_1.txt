My husband and I are were born and raised in Hawaii. We are always looking for great crab and lobster restaurants to indulge in. We stopped at the Crab Corner on Eastern and Flamingo. We were very happy with the lobster,  Alaskan king crab, bottle neck clams and the crab salad appetizer. The prices were very reasonable for the amount we ordered. The great part was we are Primo fans, they serve Primo beer. Delicious!!
