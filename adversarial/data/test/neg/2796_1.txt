When purchasing (well, leasing) my vehicle I visited both Subaru dealers in Calgary and found Centaur to be much more helpful through the whole purchase process, and everything has been good since. Simple buy out of the lease with absolutely no hidden or surprise costs. No pressure approach to the extended warranty, which I decided against, and service has been good and easy, if a bit expensive, but I somewhat expected that with the brand and dealer service.\n\nOnly thing they haven't been able to do is get the USB port in my vehicle to work.
