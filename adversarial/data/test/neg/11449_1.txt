Prices are great!  Food is hit or miss depending on how busy they are.  I usually go for the two egg breakfast but decided to explore their new menu.  I had chicken Marsala with macaroni salad.  I expected to get a pasta dish but it was just chicken with Marsala gravy which by the way was delicious.  The Mac salad was good but I like a creamier version with more mayo.  The house salad was delish with the basic ingredients: tomatoes, cucumber croutons on romaine the balsamic vinaigrette makes it quite yummy.
