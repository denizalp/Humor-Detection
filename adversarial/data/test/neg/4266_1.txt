Tim Horton's is the epitome of what happens when things get too big, too fast. With the increase in quick food at low prices comes declining service at all the Tim Horton's locations I visit these days.  The 49th Ave NE location is no exception.\n\nAt the drive-through speaker is a large and bold sign advertising peanut butter filled cookes so I ask them for one.  To my surprise, they are not available at this time.  I asked, \"did you run out?\" to which they reply, \"no we just don't offer them.\"...... Umm... being a stickler for setting things in order and offering up suggestions for improvement (the DNA of most Yelpers) I was quick to point out, very politely I may add, that there was a very large sign above the speakers advertising these yummy looking cookies.  The answer I got was an irritated, \"corporate told us to keep the signs up.\".... My response should have been, \"Stupid is as stupid does.\" but I know that bit of comedy would have been lost to this person.  So I accepted the idiotic policy and moved on.\n\nLater, when I go to pick up my order, face to face I explain to him in very polite manner that I was just trying to prove a point that people *WILL* get confused.  He insisted that everyone knew the cookies weren't available.  Then I reminded him that I had not known and that if he would like to avoid any further unpleasantness from customers that perhaps they should temporarily remove the sign.  He didn't like that and got more irritated.  It was a hopeless cause, one that I had no further desire to address.  Alas, I got my sugar and legal stimulant fix and moved on.  From now on I am going somewhere that hires people who can converse with me; I would gladly pay a few extra dollars for that.
