Short version: Cool\/fun decor, great service, and a couple of amazing burgers. Highly recommended.\n\nLong version: We had the Nom Nom burger (wife said it was one of the best burgers she has ever had) and the Gold Standard (right up there for me as well, at least on par with my favorites at a similar price point like The Counter).  We didn't try the shakes but they looked amazing as well. Excellent service from both wait and bus staff. We have definitely found our go to burger spot on the strip.
