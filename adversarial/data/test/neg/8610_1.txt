Grazie! We are really happy to have Alida's in Pittsburgh, let alone in our neighborhood. I can't wait to go back after having dinner from just appetizers of bocce balls and calamari, which were both wonderful along with the fresh toasted bread and home made dipping sauce.\nThis is really good Italian food.
