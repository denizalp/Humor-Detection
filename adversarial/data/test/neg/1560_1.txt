Delicious burgers and chicken burgers. Masala fries are amazing. The pricing is okay, even good if you get the daily special. It is cash only which limits how often I end up here(thankfully). Yes the fries portion is \"small\" compared to some other places, but the fries are high quality and fill me up perfectly - not too much. Overall, this place has good fresh food, and the owner is always friendly.
