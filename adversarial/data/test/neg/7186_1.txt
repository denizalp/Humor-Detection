One of my favourite Japanese restaurants!\n\nGreat place to go in small groups and even in big groups. Although the wait for a table can be long sometimes (I'm talking about 10-20 minutes), it is pretty reasonable considering how packed it gets on Friday nights and on weekends. Nevertheless, the wait is always worth it! Sushi is fresh with a large selection of other Japanese\/Korean dishes, and the service is even better with their very courteous staff. Most tables have a little button on the side that is very useful instead of having to wave down a server. From what I hear, this restaurant is locally owned by Koreans and it is the perfect place to hit up when you are in the Markham area!\n\nPrice is amazing especially for the quality and quantity of their bento boxes which I always get.
