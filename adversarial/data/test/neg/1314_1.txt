Ah, The Jaggerbush. This spot is one I've been to a handful of times and it's always been a good experience. So many South Side bars, so little time to Yelp them all. I like that DJ Samurai does his thing there on Friday nights. He's truly one of the best and that to me that says a lot about Jaggerbush. Reasonable drink prices with good specials and good bar crew.
