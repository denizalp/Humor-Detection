Son and I have come here twice over the last year and have been happy both times.  I'm am not a hot dog guy but there is so much going on in their dogs that there's something for everyone.  I got the spicy kimchi dog and it was really a meal.  There was a great deal going on but it all came together nicely.  Drink lots of water as there stuff can be salty.  Staff was patient and friendly. We will be back when there is another hockey tournament in Las Vegas.
