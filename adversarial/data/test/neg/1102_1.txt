Uh, how could anyone hate In-N-Out? Really. Like, how could anyone possibly have anything bad to say about this place?\n\nAhem. Anyway. This particular location lives up to the hype. They're always fast (or as fast as possible if there's a line out the door), friendly, and they've never messed up my order (which is double meat, protein style, extra spread - in case you were wondering).\n\n\nGo to In-N-Out. Like really, just go.
