Well, appearances do not always tell the story. Nondescript from the outside, the completely transformed Tom Thumb's market is AWESOME. For two weekends in a row, we have walked (yes, walked) there for breakfast. My hubby had been raving about the caprese sandwich (at a gas station?), the cubano and the bbq. We had 'pigs and grits' for breakfast (we split it- huge serving) and it was divine. Beautiful pulled pork smothered in Low Country bbq sauce over creamy grits! Delicious. The following week we split a smoked turkey egg white omelet. It was equally good. Priced well and quite a surprise. The people are very friendly and we will be back. We were so glad this gas station and carwash re-opened. The car wash is professional. When I took my car in for a hand wash, I asked for how long it would take. They told me and hit the time on the dot with no hardsell for other things. Great experience.
