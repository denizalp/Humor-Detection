Went here several times, usually around the time of the second performance at 8:30pm. I noticed that they added a min purchase of $10 for 90 mins during my last visit, which is expected since I bet there was people that were camping the place for hours without ordering anything.\n\nThe desserts are great, and I've taken a liking to the White Orchard. I always order at least one every time I'm there.\n\nThey also serve specials like the omurice. I haven't tried it but I should. However I noticed that they didn't put the rice into the egg omelette which is the standard way of making the dish.\n\nFor the performance, they are known as ACT102 (pronounced ACT ten two). There are three teams. \n\nTeam A (A stands for Artistic) is my second favourite due to one of the maids (Berry) that is helping all the other maids trying to get better at English. Their schedule seems to be Tuesday and Thursday. One of the songs that is unique to them is a Morning Musume '15 song so if you are a fan of that and are good at wotagei, please do come. Keina is also in this team and I'm taken a liking for her as well. Their image colour is Blue. However, if you are cheering for Berry, support her with some purple!\n\nTeam C (C stands for Cute). I first saw them on stage during the grand opening on May 15th and I've quickly put them on the top of the list because of their performance of READY!! from The iDOLM@STER in their medley part. RIN-CHAN SAIKYOU! Also some cheers to Minnie who designed all the maid costumes for the entire cafe! Their image colour is Pink just like iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls Cute girls. Not sure what their schedule is like though.\n\nTeam T (T stands for Trouble). Their only performance so far was during the grand opening. Since I do not know much about them yet, I'm not going to talk much about them. All I know is that they performed AKB48's Heart Gata Virus. Their image colour is Yellow\n\nThey also have two planned performances at Anime North on Friday and Saturday, so if you are going there and you have time, you should give them a visit.\n\nThe atmosphere is alright, but I am hoping that there are more people around that know the chants for the songs. So far, I've been the only one there that has been doing it. Also, when they do Koi Suru Fortune Cookie from AKB48, if you don't feel shy, you should go up on stage and dance with them! The in-store music playlist that plays when no performance is going on plays some pretty popular Japanese songs as well. During my last visit, it appears they added Shine!! from iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls to this list and I was ecstatic when it came on.\n\nI recommend this cafe for any idol fan be it 2D or 3D. The maids are also improving and I'm hoping they get more performances in. Team C is planning to do the opening theme for Hanayamata in the future.
