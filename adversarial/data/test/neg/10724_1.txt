I recently visited this salon to get a gel manicure, and did not walk away a happy customer.  I have been getting gel manicures for the past 4 months and can definitly say this was my least favourite salon. I am not saying this for all other services they offer, the place seemed very clean and had friendly staff, however as far as my manicure  went I was not a satisfied customer.  I felt as though they rushed through the procedure.  There was no soaking of my fingers and after filling and buffing my nails I was not asked to wash my hands, which left tracings of nail filings under the polish once it was applied.  Most of my gel manicures have lasted a minimum of two weeks, sometimes longer - this gel manicure only lasted 6 days.  After one week I had chipping on 6 of my nails!! This manicure was NOT worth $50 and I would not go back to pay for this service again.
