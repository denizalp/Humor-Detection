This place was very fun to stay at for four evenings, the employees were all very nice and  you can find just about anything within a couple minutes walk.  The suite was beautiful\/spacious and you really can't complain about anything unless you're super nit-picky about accomodations and I'm not. \n\nThe poker room is second only to the Bellagio , it would be much better if they would have placed it next to the poker room instead of the slot machines, or asian noodle place they have their now.
