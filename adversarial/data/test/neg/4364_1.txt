Avondale Toyota is DISHONEST.  \n\nWe purchased two Toyotas from Avondale Toyota.  The first, a RAV4 in 2009 after researching prices and services including the Costco discount.  Everything was great at first.  We bought a second Toyota - a Venza in 2010 the Costco discount was less than the \"one price\" at Avondale Toyota.  As an added incentive (besides being closer to our house) said we would get the Toyota extended warranty - Toyota Care - that provided extra services like oil changes and tire rotation for 2 years.\n\nIn summer 2011 I was in Salt Lake City Utah when an oil change was required.  I went to the Toyota dealer who said that we were not covered by Toyota Care, the one year oil change policy had expired.   Not a big deal - I paid for the oil change and said I would resolve the issue when I got back to Phoenix.   When I returned, Avondale Toyota said that salesman was gone and that I did not have Toyota Care, but they would do one more oil change to make up for that promise, but would not rotate the tires. \n\nWhen I went back this past spring (2012), I had to argue to get that next oil change - even though it was originally promised through Toyota Care, then as a remedial measure - and they would absolutely not reimburse me for the SLC oil change.  \n\nNow that's not the end.  All along, from the first month, I said the car was pulling to the left.  I went in for warranty service 3 times including one recall.  Each time I said it was pulling but they said they tested it and it was OK, but that they would document the issues.  My bad.  I never looked at the service slips.  It was documented once and they did a \"road\" test, not an alignment test.  It is out of alignment and no, I did not hit any curbs or rocks or potholes, while driving or parking... ever.  \n\nOne more thing that is really dishonest.  I looked at the service slips.  Guess what, the SLC oil change they said I took 5 quarts of oil (they listed Valvoline as the type).  The 2 oil changes that I had from Avondale Toyota said 6 quarts and the one they wanted me to pay for (the last one) said 7 quarts.  The price of the filter and \"shop\" parts were higher than the SLC Toyota dealership.  The owners manual says with filter, the capacity is 4.7 quarts.  So when they thought I as paying, they were going to bill me for 2 additional quarts plus extra changes.  When they did it under warranty, they over-documented 1 extra quart and probably either wrote that off as an expense or charged Toyota.\n\nBottom line... do not do business with Avondale Toyota unless everything is written, signed, and double checked.  Even then, out of principle, I would never go back.  Not a lot of money - but certainly, just the thought of their dishonesty would keep me away.
