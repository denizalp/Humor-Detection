I had a senior stylist cut my hair and for highlights (total $165+). The haircut was okay, but the colors did not come out. When I called the next day to inform, the receptionist gave me attitude when making another appointment to redo the highlights as if it's my fault. I had to pay another $35 for styling, plus tips, not to mention double damage on my hair.
