I had a hard time deciding where I wanted to have my birthday dinner and I wanted to try a new place. I'm happy I did! The food was delicious and the staff was amazing! \n\nThe meats were cooked perfectly and the salad bar was good as well. The mashed potatoes were soo yummy! \n\nThey have karaoke which my whole family enjoyed! They enjoyed it more than I thought.\n\nThe restaurant is family owned so the owners actually care and take their time to get to know you. \n\nThe price was great! It's better than paying $50 per person. Especially if your family is pretty big.\n\nThank you guys for making my birthday unforgettable! My family and I will definitely be back!
