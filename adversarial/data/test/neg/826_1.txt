Comparing to other shows in vegas, this one is really worth your time, especially if you have kids. I have heard about other very special and professional shows, i think Mac King is way more friendly and hilarious. He might not have a stunning and huge, gorgeous showroom, but he definitely made me and my friend laugh so hard.\nI got a special price from vegas website so my seats were upgraded to VIPs, cost around $36. And i said, again, it is enjoyable and worth it!
