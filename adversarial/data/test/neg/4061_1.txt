Arrived at 10pm on a Saturday night with a party of 9. Was told it would be an hour wait. The timing was totally off b\/c they sat us in 15mins. We should've known then that it was too good to be true. My husband ordered a beverage, but never received it throughout the course of our meal. We ordered our dinner around 10:30pm and it took about 45mins to receive our food. We were told by the waiter that it takes a long time to cook a steak well. Really? First of all, you don't tell your customers an excuse like that. It doesn't take that long to cook a steak well either. Then when the food came out, my entree was cold. So that tells me that most of our food was already done but not brought out. Once we receive our food, we saw the waiter one time, then never again. We waited at least 15mins after we finished eating just to get the check. At this point my party is very irritated and just want to leave. We finally asked 2 other servers for a manager. One server stated that the managers were very busy. I told him that they shouldn't be too busy if a customer is requesting to see them. The manager comes out and asked if everything was ok? We all said no, not at all. As he walks over to me, i hear him mumble under his breath, \"everything hasn't been ok for me tonight either.\" Or something to that effect. When I asked him what did he say for clarification, he changed his words and said \"what's wrong?\" Like he really cared. Well after explaining to him about all of our problems and he could see that our table was full of dishes, meaning no one had been by to clear the table, offer dessert or coffee. He apologizes for everything, comps my meal but didn't offer anything else for the rest of my family that traveled out of town and are here for the first time. This was a very bad experience at cheesecake all together, including how the manager handled the situation. Highly disappointed in the Cheesecake Factory.
