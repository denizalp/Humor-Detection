As a former tourist and now current resident of Las Vegas, NV when my brother and sister-in-law stated they wanted us to treat them at this buffet we were excited to go. We felt the $43 a pop price was pretty high, but we were treating family. We got there and it was pretty full, and looked pretty trendy, and overrated. Now for the food. The presentation was okay, but the taste was horrible to okay on a lot of the entree items. The ice crab was salty, and the hot crab did not taste that fresh. There lobster was not lobster at all, and to add insult to injury my husband and I both got sick shortly after our trip here.  If I wanted montezumas revenge I would have drank the tap water in Mexico. Thanks for the biggest ripoff in las Vegas.
