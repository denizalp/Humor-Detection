After reading all of these great 5 star reviews, I wanted to love Crostini. I really did, but i'm so sad to say my experience there was not very good. \n\nSo for those you of that have never tried it, here is an overview with my yesterday experiences:\nParking was complicated. There is not really a designated parking area that I could find. There are signs that say for the apartment complex \"corner parking only\" which I was a little confused by. I did ask the Crostini employees, and they said they thought it was ok to park in those spots. So yeah....not sure if they have parking or don't?\nMad construction right now all around Crostini, but I give them mad props for staying open during it! Good work on that. \n\nNo Bathrooms! None.\nSo if you have to use a bathroom, go before you come here, or as my wife said to me, \"if you can deal with the grossness of the bathroom around the corner at the coffee shop, which will remain nameless\", you can use that one if you buy something there. \n\nAtmosphere: Pretty chill jazz music in the back ground, very clean! A good place to sit and read a book outside. Good for 1 or 2 people (not larger groups). \n\nOk, so usually I can deal with confusing parking, construction, and no bathroom but here is the kicker...\nFrom the time we ordered our food, sat and waited......food to go. It took a solid 25 minutes--- With no line....\nThere was a group of 3 people, that looked like they had been there awhile waiting for their food as well. They finally recieved their food and I heard the counter girl say, \"sorry for the wait, I put a bunch of $1 off coupons in your bag for next time\". \n\nAfter these people left, My wife and I were the only customer there, and I still sat for at least 10 minutes more waiting for my food. 2 panini's only!!!! Seriously. A Meatball panini and a gyro panini. That was all I ordered.\n\nToward the end of waiting after the only other poeple in the place left another guy came in and a employee working there must have known him and decided to have a conversation with the guy about the night before and where they partied (he was also ordering food). Rather than continue making my order, I seriously was a second away from asking for my $ back and just leaving. \n\nThe food:\nMy Gyro Panini was pretty tiny considering it was over $6. It tasted good, I'll give them that. It did not come with any side (a very small pickle and green olive only) But there is no way I'm headed back there to pay that much $ for a small grilled cheese, looked like standard cheap (very cheap) white bread and a couple of small pieces of beef\/lamb slapped together and crushed with 1 slice of chedder. Nope. \nMy wife got a Meatball Panini. I ate 1\/4 it because I was starving after my small panini which felt like I had ate an appetizer. Her's was about double the size of mine but lacked flavor. It was meatballs, cheese and bread. Pretty much a meatball sub (but they called it a panini???)\nSo the food was nothing even close to resembeling 5 stars. What a let down. I'd say 2 to 3 stars if they are lucky. \n\nThe place is tiny. Don't expect to find enough room to have a nice sit down meal if you have multiple people in your group, and just a heads up it's an \"order at the counter and wait for your food\" kind of place, which is ok. There is nothing wrong with that, but I guess for the person reading this Yelp review, they might want to know that before thinking they are headed there for a nice sit down with a server type of meal---It's not like that. \n\nI did get  my free chocolate cookie, as I read on other Yelp reviews about. Yup, it was a cookie. \nUnlike the people that sat and waited who knows how long before me I was not offered a \"sorry for the wait\" or any $1 off coupons. \nJust a--- Here is your food, and a bag pushed my way from behind the counter. \n\nSo Yeah, not what I was expecting based off all the great reviews.\nI'm really bummed about this one. I just feel like I missed out on something that every one keeps saying is so awesome. Man, maybe it was just bad timing...I don't know. I'm just really bummed that this place was not as awesome as everyone said it was. \nI should have taken a picture of my tiny panini to show you all (but i didn't) sorry, I was just so hungry from waiting for so long that I never thought of it.  I don't want to shame Crostini and more than I have.....because obviously there are 5 star reviewers out there who love this place, and I wish I had been one of them.
