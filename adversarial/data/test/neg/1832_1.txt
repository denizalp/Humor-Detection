Haven't been on yelp in SEVEN YEARS but Leah was so good I thoroughly felt the need to post a review. She's been doing makeup for over 20 years and let me tell you... it shows !\n\nHer ability to do makeup that makes your natural beauty shine is impeccable ! So great at matching skin tone and keeping consistent throughout a look ! Not to mention how stinkin cute the Black Hearts Beauty Lounge is !!! \n\nLastly I really need to mention her spray tans !  wow ! I've always been skeptical of looking like an Oompa Loompa because of the stigma around them and seeing it first hand around town, but I was absolutely glowing and felt so confident ! BHBL is 11\/10
