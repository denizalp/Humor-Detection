I was referred by a friend. Went there today for the first time to have my brakes done. They did a great job at making my wife and I feel comfortable. Total opposite of going to a car dealership service dept. I didn't feel like they were trying to suck me dry. Terry  was awesome and we even met the owner Loren before we left. If your looking for a family type atmosphere look no further. I'll be coming back to have some work on my truck done.
