This place is amazing!! They have the best subs in town. I would definitely recommend the meatball sub or the pastrami Ruben. They also have refreshing salads that are great in this HOT Arizona summers and they delish daily soups. It gets super packed during lunchtime so I would recommend calling in an order and picking it up if you don't want to wait.
