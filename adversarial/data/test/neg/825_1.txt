Best ice cream shop ever! Adorable building with a awesome paint job might I add. Great staff who knows how to take jokes and are genuinely very cool, down to earth people. Awesome creative flavors... And I love all the cereal ones, really brings you back to your childhood. They put it in a Chinese carry out box and to top it all off, literally, they put a fortune cookie on top .You can't just get that anywhere else! If I lived closer I would be there every day! ....tip: dip your fortune cookie in the ice cream... You will literally melt ;) lol
