Not the best service. I went in expecting to drop off my car for repairs and instead was told they needed to order parts and I would have to come back. I lost 2 hours of my day only to have to go back. When I did I wasted more time because even though I had a reservation for a rental car, there were no cars on site!  If your business is repairs, you should have parts and rentals readily available. If for some reason I find myself I need of another repair I'm going to see if the insurance company will allow me to go elsewhere.
