Had lunch on 7\/8\/16. I qualified for the senior menu and ordered a turkey club. The waitress asked if I wanted regular fries or seasoned fries I ask what seasoned fries were and she said they were like curly fries without the curls. I said I'll try the seasoned fries. Lunch was good. Food was good and fries were good. Got the bill and found that there was an extra charge for the fries. I asked the waitress if fries were not included with my meal. She said they were but the seasoned fries were extra. I asked her why she did not tell me it was more. She said her manager told her she was not allowed to tell the customers the seasoned fries were extra. She said that the added fee was the one thing she could not say. She showed me on another page of the menu that the fries are extra in price. I said I see it now but it is not anywhere near the senior menu. Just saying. My opinion when steering customers off their order you should tell them there is an added fee if there is one. Poor business practice.
