I will not be back.  I took my neices here ages 16, 18 & 20 thinking they would get a kick out fo the place.  It was OK, the food was not very good. The ribs were very tough, and even though the wait staff is suppose to be rude, I still expect to have my drinks refilled at least once.   Also, the whole draw is that your waiter is suppose to make funny hats with silly catch phrases on it.  Our waiter didn't make us one, and took one from the table next to us after they left and put it on one of our heads.  Ewww! \n\nI would not recommend this place to anyone, and I was sorry I suggested it for my neicesas they didn't enjoy it.
