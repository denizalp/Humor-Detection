I have been a member for close to two years. I first joined it was clean and motivating For the past month there has been no towels to use 80 % of the time. I am lucky if the dispenser with wet wipes are full. I would say it's full 50 % of the time that is the best of my awful review. Almost every bench and a good portion of the machines have cracks in the leather and I mean huge long cracks, full of bacteria. I inquired about this 2 weeks ago, it is obvious that they refuse to fix them. It is definitely  a health hazard. They have not had free WiFi for at least a month which cost me money!!! The place is downright filthy!!!! The turnover in staff is constant and I have noticed there are 10 guys working out and one female which has to tell you something. The ratio of men and woman are terrible. A year ago they had double the staff at all times working the floor, very friendly, there were 5 people getting trained by pro trainers at any given time, now maybe 1 while I am there. This place needs to figure this thing out. I am looking for a new gym and at this point I will probably go back to snap due to convenience. I will pay more money with old equitment and one standing tanning bed to get out of this place before I get really sick. I am giving it 2 more weeks if some changes are not made I will leave. I have a ton of insight in this business. I will say so does the owner because it was a great place to go for a long time there are some very quick and easy and inexpensive tweaks that would get your memberships back to where they were. I hope somebody takes some action so we can enjoy this neighborhood gym once again! BTW I do not complain, but I spend a lot of time there much more before undergoing open heart surgery 5 months ago. Take care and let me know if there is anything  I can do!! Thanks for listening!!\n Best regards
