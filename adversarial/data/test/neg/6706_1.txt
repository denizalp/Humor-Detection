I held off on trying this place for a long time, but the kids I take care of finally convinced me to go. I've been to similar places in the past like Orange Leaf in Columbus, and I'm just usually not that impressed. It's good but not \"great.\" \n\nWell, I'm so glad I finally tried Menchie's! I think the flavor variety is good and unique. Most places have the typical ones like chocolate peanut butter, cake batter, etc., but Menchie's had flavors like original tart, lime mint sorbet, and toasty marshmallow (my personal fav.) I was really impressed with the taste, but also the fact that they have nutritional info on the wall. They tell you calories per 4 oz, and which ones are low or no sugar, dairy free, low fat, etc. They also have a great selection of fruit, so if you're watching your cals you can definitely make it work here.  I however was not trying to be healthy on my visit, so I put cookie dough, caramel sauce, marshmallow sauce, and Butterfinger on mine, and it was seriously delicious. I'm pretty picky about cookie dough in ice cream, and I was pleasantly surprised w\/ the quality. (If you're a cookie dough person you know what I mean.) I also liked that they had things like whipped cream and chocolate covered strawberries.\n\nNow, on to the location. I used to take the kiddos to the Fairview Park location, (which just randomly closed shop out of nowhere.) The Avon store feels significantly bigger, but it also seems a bit more empty. They also don't have as many fresh fruit toppings as Fairview Park had. The employees are much nicer though and always greet you when you come in. We really like this Menchie's and I would definitely recommend it.
