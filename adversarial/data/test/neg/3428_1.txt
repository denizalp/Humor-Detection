I have gone to this office for years, and I've always received excellent care and service! The office is beautiful and clean and the staff is very friendly! Jennifer is easy to work with and very accommodating when making appointments and my hygienist Veronica is the best! I'm never nervous coming in for an appointment and  it feels like meeting up with an old friend--very comfortable and something you look forward to. Dr.Bietz was who I grew up seeing but I have been seen by Dr.Smith for years now and I trust him just as much!
