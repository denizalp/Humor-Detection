This Ross is much better than the ones here in the Bay Area. I bought my designer handbags and shoes for a really really good price i.e., Cole Haan, Tommy Hilfiger, and few bags that I don't know the names only because it's what teenagers likes and uses for school. I think Fukuru???\n\nAs all of you know, some of the Ross stores are not clean, merchandise all mixed in together with the sale items. This place is clean and I was able to see all the items - spread out a little bit. \n\nI will definitely will go back here and Marshall's.
