The apartments themselves are nice inside, very cute actually. We've had problems with the washer\/dryer\/AC but maintenance did fix the major things. We did have problems with the office staff, but I feel the issues have been resolved. I had previously written a review about how displeased I had been with the office, the manager reached out to me and explained the situation. I can tell the manager does care about tenants, I definitely respect that. Overall, it is a nice place to live.
