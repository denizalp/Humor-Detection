Last week we visited The Saddle Ranch; as always the service was great, the Food was good & We enjoyed the atmosphere.\nI have spent quite a few evenings at this restaurant & I always have a good time, however, I'm not sure that I will be able to continue doing so because the prices are getting to be ridiculous!!\nOn our last visit, there was a Coyotes game going on; perhaps prices rise based on the Events in the area?\nThere are other restaurants, very close to this place, that offer the same quality service & food for a lot less.
