Very helpful, they didn't charge me for looking at my car. Before he had looked at it I originally wanted my valve cover gasket replaced. He saw a bunch of leaks and said me changing the gasket wouldn't change anything. I asked what I should do, he said look for a new vehicle and constantly check the fluids to optimize the life of my car. I appreciate their honesty over at the Henderson Pep Boys.
