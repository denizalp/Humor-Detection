We are so happy with our new synthetic lawn! It looks incredible and our son and dogs love playing on it. \n\nPete was really easy to work with, his pricing was by far the best I found and the quality of work was beyond our expectations. \n\nThey were in and out in one day, didn't leave a mess behind or make a ton of noise, it went so smoothly. Definitely not your typical experience with contractors. \n\nI highly recommend Evergreen Synthetic Lawns!
