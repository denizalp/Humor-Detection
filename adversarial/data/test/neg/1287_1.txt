I have nothing negative to say about El Chorro.  They improved and the food is always good.  Over the years going there has been fun brunch with friends.  I have never had bad service here.  There has been ownership changes over the years and improvements to the property and food. Those darn Bloody Mary's are fantastic.  \nIf you are from out of town and have not had the chance to stop in, please do.\nThis along with Lon's Hermosa are two of my favorite brunch spots.  during cooler months when you can enjoy the outdoors, they have fantastic patio dining.
