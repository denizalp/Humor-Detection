On a recent work visit to Vegas we ate here twice.  It was so good the first time that we took our friends.  The food was fantastic (the octopus was to die for) and the waiter\/bartender (we sat at the bar the first night) was fantastic.  They have a Happy Hour Menu.  Now the second night was different.  We sat at the bar to have a drink and wait on our friends.  My friend had wine while I decided to have another Sam Adams.  The previous night, it was on the Happy Hour Menu so I asked for it again.  The bartender (His name was Kody) said that they didn't have it.  This made both of us do a \"What?\" and explain that it was on the Happy Hour menu just last night.  He said that they didn't have it and maybe the menu had changed.  My friend was still perplexed as to why they would still have it on a Happy Hour menu but not offer it off of the menu.  Finally the bartender (Kody) said very rudely \"Well just to accommodate you, I will take care of it\" but it was said very condescendingly.  He looked and low and behold they had it!  I commented how rude he was as did my friend. My friend asked to see the manager so Kody apologized very quickly.  The only reason we didn't push talking to the manager was that there was a couple sitting next to us and we didn't want to ruin their experience.  Kody did offer my friend more wine but never once asked if I wanted another beer.  Once again - rude.  When our friends arrived there was no way that we were going to eat a table so we moved.  My friend asked for the bill and Kody said that he apologized and that it was on him.  Still not a warm apology and to be honest we would have rather paid for it and spoke with the manager.  I'm just astounded that a place like this would have an employee that acted like that.  He could have looked in the first place and it would have been fine.  We were fine with being charged more since it was after happy hour.  You would think with a $600 food bill for 4 people that a restaurant would have a nice staff.  Our dining experience was wonderful but it was in the back of my mind the whole time we ate as to how he acted.  I'm not sure if I would recommend Milos to my friends with the chance that they to would be treated like this. Maybe I would with a warning to not sit at the bar!
