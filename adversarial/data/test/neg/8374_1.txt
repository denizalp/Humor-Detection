Was in there during the week and had a great sandwich on fresh bread.  I really enjoyed the bread and asked the girl if they make their own bread.  She says it comes in and they bake it fresh daily.  \n\nLater on in the week I got a coupon from them in the junk mail and went back on Sunday to take advantage of the offer.  The owner and his wife were outside the place smoking.  Then they came in and were watching the girl make my sandwiches like a hawk.  The coupon was a bogo offer so I got two subs and went home and ate them.  \n\nPOW! BANG! BOOM! WTF happened to the bread I loved?  The bread was dry, hard, tasted old, was crumbly and totally unenjoyable!  This is how sandwiches are served when the owners are around??!?!??!?!  It was better during the week when I went and there was just a blonde haired girl working.  NOTE TO SANDWICH servers everywhere:  If your bread is not fresh, is crumbly, dry, hard, or coming apart DO NOT SERVE IT. Consistency, consistency, consistency is very important.  Now because of these crappy sandwiches I will not return.  This place is soon to go under in that spot like Quiznos did, the $7 hot dog shop after that, and now this place will fold because they can not make a fresh and consistent sandwich.  Sad, very sad.......
