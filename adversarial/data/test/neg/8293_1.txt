love the whole foods, and their pizza was way at the top of my list for many years, but in the last few months their food quality has gone down, i won't even order the pizza anymore and their sandwiches seem to be a bit off too lately, and they don't carry raw tortillas anymore either, still like it, but spending more time at fresh and easy as of late..
