Been there many, many times. The shoe selection is not too bad but the service is quite bad. Betwwen yesterday and today I've been there 3 times and about to go again see if they can finally help me return a pair of boots I bought on line and choose to pick up there. Long story short, the managger couldn't care less and couldn't make a fun call to the head office to confirm my CC# instead she made me call the head office myself and that's why I have to go there once more since the issue has to be resolved right in the store... couldn't she use her brain and call them herself from the 1st time I was there????\nAnyway... that's not the 1st time I feel frustrated with their CS that's why I order on line, so I don't have to use their CS but it didn't work this time :(
