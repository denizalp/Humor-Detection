It all started with Raymond are waiter who finally came to are table after setting there about 10 to 15 min. He went to get us two waters took him 10 min. to bring them . Place was not that busy. Drop the water off didn't ask if we were ready to order and left . Came back about 5 min. later to take are order. Had the Kobe beef burger very dry and tasteless . The weird assortment of fries was small. Not worth the $21.00 I paid. Had to ask to get more water so I could wash that dry burger down. I would not eat here again.  I mean the burger I got at Carl's Jr. was better.
