We found Kennedy tile through Angie's list! And best thing we did! We had a few people come out before they did and out of all of them they were the best priced!!! They started work on our house very soon after our in home consultation. The whole process was very fast and they did an AMAZING WORK!!! the crew was very nice and organized and kept the house clean from the work area. They made our remodeling experience such a great one!!
