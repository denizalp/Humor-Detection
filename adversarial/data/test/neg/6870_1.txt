Came here for brunch with my girlfriends. They were slammed we waited about 15 mins to get seated which isn't bad.  We ordered lattes coconut turmeric, 2 lavenders & a honey latte all with coconut milk. It took about a good 20mins or so & The coffee came out luke warm... NOT GOOD! But it did taste good i would've been able to enjoy it more if it was hot like what coffee should be. \nCoconut & tomatoe bisque soup with grilled cheese the cheese was not melted all the way & the soups were luke warm. (Annoying) We sent it back and they reheated it.  \nKale Cesar salad was great! The rest of the food salmon Benedict, empanadas, torta was mediocre.\nWill i come back? ... yes but only for the latte & kale salad.
