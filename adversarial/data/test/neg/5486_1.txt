I have seen this show 4 times.  I love this amazing show.  You can't possibly get a bad seat in this place. It's a round theatre. So much goes on you will get something out of it depending on what catches your eye. The energy is great. It's completely G rated this is such a great show for kids.  So enjoyable. A classic. Fun for ALL AGES!!
