I came here on a thursday evening. I ORDERED 3 whole chickens so I had to wait. They told me they were out of bbq.. so i got 3 whole rotisserrie. THE FLAvour was delicious and it seemed to have alot of chicken. The rice was simple and good. But the potatoes!! Were seasoned well and soft. I really enjoyed the potatoes! I wanted to try the grill chicken but   even the rotisserie was good.. so cant complain. The sauces were good. The spicy was    not spicy in the beginning but after a few seconds u feel the heat. The mild was sweet and delicious. Honestly i will come back again. And yes there are seats so u can order but keep in mind i think its less of a sit down restaurant. They are to busy at the cash to give u a full service. I DONT mind that..its the same if u go to a nandos.. call ahead of time if you have a big order.  And i do plan to come back. I really enjoyed the flavours.
