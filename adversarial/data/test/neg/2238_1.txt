Four of us dined at El Chorro on Jan. 2, 2015.  The restaurant is nicely appointed with a courtyard for outside dining; large bar inside; and a nice open dining room.  I had the seafood pasta dish which was excellent; my wife had the 1\/2 order of the New Zealand lamb chops, which was also excellent; another diner in our party had the short ribs, which he thought were excellent; and the other diner in our party had the trout almondine, which she said was outstanding.  Overall, the food was excellent.  The waitstaff were attentive but not overbearing.  Price was moderate +.  I would recommend the restaurant to a friend and we would return.
