This place specializes in fantastic hot dogs and burgers. It's a small \/ modest place with a lot of heart. Detroit-themed decorations adorn the walls. And in my experience the staff has been not only courteous and friendly but seems legitimately interested in building a relationship with its customer community. This is a gem.
