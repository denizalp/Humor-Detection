by far, my favorite club in vegas (so far!)  love that its poolside - it just made it so much more pleasant!\n\nthe music was good - a little bit of everything - and i wasn't shoved about like i was at marquee (the clientele just seemed more chill!)\n\nlike shyam p. said, its a little odd that they don't have too many bars, which can make the wait long, but it wasn't awful.\n\nnote: if you find yourself parched and waiting for your honey to bring you some overpriced bottled water, there's a water fountain near the restroom!
