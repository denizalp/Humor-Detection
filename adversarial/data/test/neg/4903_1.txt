Loved the place! \n\nI drove by couple of times and have decided to finally try it out. I'm so happy we did! I ordered a make-your-own Kind of salad which was delicious. The caramelized m-something-pineapple dressing was great!   \n\nMy husband got a small salad and the incredible and oh-so-recommend cauliflower soup. \n\nThe chocolate dipped strawberries you get for free with each order were a great addition to the meal. Overall - loved it! We're so coming back!
