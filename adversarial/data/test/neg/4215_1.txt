I really do love this place I've been here multiple times. I love the hush puppies and the Mac and cheese is so good. I've never ordered anything I didn't like off the menu. The drink prices are unbeatable. I really enjoy how it has vintage looking booths and they use candles light. The only complaint is the service can be spotty. Sometimes it's good sometimes the waiters act like they are annoyed you are there.
