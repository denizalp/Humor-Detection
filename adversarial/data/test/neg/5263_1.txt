Long story short: terrible service, try the restaurants I listed at the bottom instead. \n\n        Absolutely horrible service today. I want to be clear that I am talking about the location downtown, not the Los Gemelos on the westside (which I always have a great time at). We showed up before 8pm and ordered from a middle aged woman at the counter. It was a party of 5 and only tables of 4 were available, so we asked the waiter if he could pull up the chair. He cheerfully grabbed one for us. After sitting down for approximately 1 minute, the middle aged woman comes up and bluntly says \"You cannot pull up chairs. You cannot be blocking the aisles\". We were already starting to stand up as I said \"Oh I'm sorry! The waiter grabbed the chair for us and said it was fine\" but before I could get half of my words out, she cut me off in an even ruder tone \"You cannot pull up chairs.\" We end up moving to a table towards the back of the restaurant.\n After about 10 minutes of nothing, we wave a waiter over and ask for waters and chips and salsa. The waiter says \"We don't have chips\" and leaves to get water (at the west side location, we've always been offered chips). Maybe 5 more minutes go by and he comes back with a pitcher of water and, I kid you not, a stack of styrofoam side cups that are the size of shot glasses (to-go cups with lids meant to hold salsa, guacamole, etc). Apparently at approx 8pm, they stop giving out cups, both reusable or plastic? \n When the food arrives another 15 minutes later, it is bagged up in to-go boxes. \"We are closing soon so everything is to go.\" The restaurant does not close for another 30 minutes or so and yet they are already preparing to close and too lazy to do dishes. Not only that, half of the food is cold, the fried gorditas are soggy, and 2 of our 5 orders are wrong (they put the wrong meat on two of the tacos and forgot sides like cilantro and lime). \n We finish eating well before closing time and after putting all of our garbage back into the to go bags, we ask if the waiter could toss this in the trash. Instead, we are asked to find a garbage can outside because \"the trash cans are pretty full already\". \n Needless to say, I will not be returning. I highly recommend the Los Gemelos on the west side or El Pastor instead.
