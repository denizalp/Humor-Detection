I have to say this is one of the best pizzas I have enjoyed- I'm not a big fan of pizza but when the grandkids want pizza I'm in-- we called stumpy's and the guy that answered was patient and very helpful- we had bad reception but he was again still patient- I ordered pizza, wings and a salad- they delivered to the hotel in 30 minutes- the kids tore up the pizza! The wings were perfect! Guess we'll have pizza again later this week!
