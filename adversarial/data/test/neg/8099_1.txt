Second time here, and have decided that I would not come back, unless it was the only place I could go to with my family for whatever reason. Not sure if quality went downhill, or I no longer have the same tastes. Was a lot of variety, but nothing wowed me enough to want seconds.\n\nTo be fair, people come here for the king crab legs, and people were waiting on line, piling their plates. \n\nShrimp cocktail and Alaskan crab legs -- seafood highlights that people flocked to \n\nFruit station - cantaloupe, honey dew, and watermelon \n\nIce cream -- the chocolate one wasn't working well, and came out super slow. Was also watery and melted quickly. \n\nSoups - chicken noodle was the highlight, but they had other ones \n\nBreakfast - turkey and pork sausages, eggs (but the powdered kind, not the fresh ones), French toast that lacked any seasoning or flavor, small waffle rounds (regular and Red Velvet). Bacon that was cooked well enough that most of it was crispy. Nothing worse than spongey bacon that has fat yet to be rendered off\nSmall bagels, but only butter and mini jams, no cream cheese. Or I couldn't find it. \n\nJapanese - Sushi, but it was made with ridiculous amounts of rice. Like 60% of the roll was all rice. By the time I picked out the actual imitation crab meat\/veggies, it was so insignificant. \n\nChinese - can't imagine buffets cooking Chinese food well, so steered clear of this. I may be a little biased from NYC Chinatown, so take my words with a grain of salt. \n\nSalad bar - Romaine, spinach, and some kind of spring mix blend. Romaine looked the freshest, so got a plate of that piled with shredded carrots, onion, big juicy grape tomatoes. Wasn't a big salad bar and not a lot of veggie options to go with it, but was still refreshing enough. Had the typical dressings : Balsamic, Ranch, Cesar, Blue Cheese. \n\nItalian - had plenty of pasta dishes, but was too full to try any! Mostly red sauces, I think. \n\nDesserts - were adorable, but they always are. Little cakes, tiny mason jars of pudding or creams, macarons (although the tray went fast and they didn't replace it!), macaroons, an assortment of cookies, and so much more! \nBaskets of bananas and apples-- take some to go! \n\nLinger long enough after a late lunch and you can get first dibs on the dinner items. \nTables were spaced apart appropriately. It's hard to enjoy dining if someone is always squeezing their way in and knocking your arms\/elbows. \n\nStaff was so friendly. Our waiter came by so many times with our waters and orange juices. Was nice and pleasant each and every time. He seemed relaxed, as if he was working leisurely, but still managed to attend to everyone. \n\nAlso, Annabelle was super helpful : my sister and her family had been seated, but I was running a little late. I waited in line, but then asked if I could skip ahead to pay and join my family. Once I proved that my family was actually inside (my sister had to go and show her the table with her husband and baby! Lol, maybe people are desperate enough to lie and jump the line??), she helped me go pay and saved me at least 30-45 minutes! Really appreciated that, as she didn't have to say yes.
