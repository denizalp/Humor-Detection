It is so tricky to rate Eest because it is still not the kind of Chinese food I love from back home in California.  I don't know why it is so dang hard to find tasty Asian food here in the valley, especially in the west.  I honestly prefer Abacus Inn...but it is no where near close enough to my house.  \n\nFor being shoved in a corner of an almost dead strip mall, it is a jewel.  The decor is much nicer than most places like it and there is a ton of space.  You can tell the owners take pride in their restaurant.  \n\nWe ordered their egg drop soup and while it was pretty good, I did have to add some salt to it for taste.  The veggies in it were almost too big to eat with a soup spoon too, which was a little annoying...but I still enjoyed it.  I got the Sizzling Mongolian Beef and wish I would have asked for it to be spicier.  The waitress warned me that people say it is too hot and so I asked her to make it mild...well, it was so mild it wasn't spicy at all.  Wah!  We did really like their sweet and sour chicken as well.  Our order of pork fried rice was also worth it.  I definitely want to go back and order other dishes on their menu.  They give you huge portions that make for a great lunch the next day.
