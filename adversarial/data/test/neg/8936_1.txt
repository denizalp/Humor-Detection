Unpleasant experience \n\nWe went for lunch AYCE on a weekday and were not aware or informed of the 1.5 hour eating time limit until a rude staff approached us at the end.  We understand that such policy is common at AYCE and is meant to be enacted; however, we never expected or experienced such rude female staff hurrying us out the door repeatedly within 5 minutes of due time. \n\nThe bill including tips had to be paid before we can commence our meal. No wonder they don't bother with providing basic customer service.   I think this is a reasonable time to inform\/remind all your customers about the time limit, especially if you expect everyone to leave right on time.  \n\nThe staff should have been more polite, the first warning literally translates to \"Times up! Let's go! Don't you see people are waiting?\" (There weren't many people waiting and there were plenty of empty tables without Reserved signs) So we tried to quickly finish our desserts.\n\nWithin 5 minutes, the staff returned telling us to \"leave now\" and used a \"brushing out\" hand gesture to get us out the door. There is really no need for such tone and manners. \n\nService aside, there were limited variety of food during Lunch AYCE and nothing stands out. \n\nWe are sure we won't be missing out by staying away from this restaurant.
