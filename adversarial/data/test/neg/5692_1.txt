I enjoy going in here mainly for the Wednesday $5.99\/lb salad bar and cooked food bar because overall, this store is relatively pricey. I guess that's what to expect with grocery stores that specialize in providing organic, high quality food. But on Wednesdays, the price and quality of that salad bar is an amazing value to anyone.
