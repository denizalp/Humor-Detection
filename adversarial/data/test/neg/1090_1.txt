I am quite particular about coffee and love some independant coffee shops.... and this is on my list of top 3 for Mtl with Myriade and Olympico.... Each has a different vibe... \n\nPourquoi pas has super friendly staff... some decent space to sit... location is smack in the gay village... artwork on the wall is always interesting. The treats seem to look good - they seem to have gluten free or vegan options but I never tried any. Their speciality is their own mix of coconut and almond milk but I prefer cow milk in my cappucinos.... you need to ask for it though because the default is their own mix. \n\nGreat opening hours during the holidays...
