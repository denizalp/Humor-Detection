Let me start with why I give 1 star! I placed a to go order at 11:03 order #10 and my to go order took 25 minutes they didn't call my number till 11:28 and yes I was watching my watch! I could not believe how long it took! I was so tempted to cancel my order and ask for a refund. I was very upset with the long wait but yes my food was really good and fresh but I don't think I will return to this location.
