The place was fun to be sarcastic way. It's probably every servers dream come true and they get paid for it but not to be so violently. Like not throwing knives or fork ( they don't do that). Like throwing napkins up in the air while being colorful. The writing is very creative for the hats. Food was worth it. 9\/10
