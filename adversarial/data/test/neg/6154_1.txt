My family was traveling to Montreal. After a long morning of walking around Old Montreal, we decided to stop some place for lunch. Unfortunately, most of the restaurants weren't open yet...except for Jardin Nelson. The patio out front was completely full and there was a line to get in. We were quickly seated in the terrace\/garden. It was absolutely beautiful! The ambience was great. There was live jazz music and it wasn't too loud. It was a little hard to communicate with the waiter (we are from the U.S. and do not speak any French), but he tried his best. I felt a little bit rushed to order, so I didn't get a chance to truly look at the huge menu. I ended up ordering French onion soup and a Caesar salad. The soup was absolutely delicious! The salad was a bit overdressed but delicious nonetheless.\n\nDefinitely worth the visit!
