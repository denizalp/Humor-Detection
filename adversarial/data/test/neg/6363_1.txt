The chicken fettuccini Alfredo is delicious! The old fashion spaghetti with meatball, also on point. This is one of those market\/deli\/restaurants that are worth the awkward set up. The chicken in the Alfredo is breaded. Even though that is not my preference and I wasn't expecting it, it was still some of the best Alfredo that I've ever had. In fact, the only restaurant that has an Alfredo that is worth going out for(since carussos in Gilbert closed down years and years ago, which had the best Chilean sea bass, that I've ever had, but that's a whole other story... miss them but feeling hopeful since finding this place). They put Parmesan cheese on the caeser salad, which makes the cheese factor farther than my preference but for you parm lovers, you have that to look forward to. \nThe dessert shelves look phenomenal but we are awfully full... so glad to have a new favorite Italian place. It's harder to do than I thought it would be so I'm super excited. \n\nUpdate: Already went back. So delicious. We tried the lasagne with meat sauce. Perfect balance of cheese and meattp sauce and noodles. And their tiramisu is moist and light. If you love food, do yourself a favor and go check this place out.
