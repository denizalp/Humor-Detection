I am surprised to find out that Avis Rental is parent company to Payless Car Rental. \nPayless had very low ratings and appear to prey on those who want save a few dollars on car rental. \nI was referred to Payless via Dunhill Travel. Loved the rate since I only need rental for 2 days in Las Vegas. Did not read reviews and wished I had. I will complete my review after I return the car.
