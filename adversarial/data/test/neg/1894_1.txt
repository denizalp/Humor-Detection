My review is based off the lounge not the actual restaurant. \n\nSo you walk in the lounge you see hot pink neon and a indoor firepit. Also very dark so you get strippers on acid vibe. No worries it's just a lounge with classy servers. So my group decided to get a scorpion bowl. Well that drink is the size of my head. We all drink from it and being the drunks we  are oder more. Run of the mill bar food. Nothing too crazy, goes to my theory most of vegas food is based on how drunk the patron is.
