What an awful place to say goodbye to a loved one. Nick the Funeral Director is a clueless liar who did just about everything wrong. Not sure if he is licensed funeral director or not but my loved one looked like someone else (TERRIBLE!)and some of the most basic of things went wrong making this painful time that much more difficult. I would avoid Alfieri Funeral Home at all cost. This guy is incompetent and should not be in the profession!
