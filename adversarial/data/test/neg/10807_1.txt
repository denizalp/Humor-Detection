Really amazing stuff, I'd been craving an authentic street taco and decided to try this place out after being disappointed with the quality of several other local taco shops I've tried and this place is LEGIT! Authentic, house-smoked meats, fresh salsa bar and very friendly service. I'm definitely gonna be going there again and again after this experience. I tried 2 of each type of meat for their street tacos and each one was unique, high-quality, and DELICIOUS. My two favorites were the smoked chicken and the carne asada, however the carnitas and barbacoa were amazing as well. Depending on what I'm in the mood for I can imagine ordering any one of them again. If you want the authentic real deal you've got to check this place out! :D
