I came here several months back for dinner per the recommendation of my dining companion, who lives nearby.  This was my first real experience eating Korean food, so I wasn't sure what to expect.\n\nSince I don't eat beef, the bulgogi wasn't an option for me, so I went with the spicy pork.  It came in a bento box with three other side dishes (don't remember exactly what they are\/not sure I could identify them due to unfamiliarity with cuisine), plus a bowl of rice.  It was certainly a lot of food--more than I could eat in one sitting--but then again, I would expect as much, given the prices.  While the pork was flavorful, it was a bit spicier than I would have liked.  To be honest, it's difficult for me to judge the flavor of the pork, since I'm unfamiliar with the cuisine, but it was interesting and I enjoyed it, for the most part.  The side dishes that came with it were hit-or-miss for me, with some being very flavorful (pickled veggies) and texturally interesting (noodle-y things), and others less so.  I didn't really feel that the rice added much to the meal.\n\nThe atmosphere was interesting.  My dining companion explained to me that it doubles as a karaoke place after 8, hence the K-pop music videos playing on TVs as we ate.  Service was fine--no problems there.  Overall, an interesting experience, and I'd be willing to come back and try it again. 3.5 stars.
