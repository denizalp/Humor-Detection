I agree that the front desk is poor. I sent them all the paper work they asked for and when I arrived they asked for it again. I sent it twice to two different email addresses before they acknowledged it. And they looked at me as if I was crazy. If I managed this place I would get everyone in on some training asap. I hope I haven't made the wrong decision coming here. Front desk counts for a lot.
