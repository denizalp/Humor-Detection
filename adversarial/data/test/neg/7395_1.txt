Dined here for first time this afternoon.\n\nJK really does have all of the true components of a dive sushi place:\n\n*Pictures of various sushi (from the mid-80s) gracing the pressboard walls\n*One wall being unfinished raw lumber (maybe they're replacing the fake walls?)\n*Plastic flowers with copious amounts of dust in the women's (onesie) restroom \n*Sushi pencils attached to plastic spoon? Do ppl really steal these?\n*Vinyl seats\n\nIt works for them. Cheap prices and great-tasting sushi. Avocados were a little overripe and lifeless. One of the rolls seemed kind of sloppy, but overall - great experience! \n\nLoved the fact that the sushi chef himself came over and asked us how we were. Also thought it was sweet that the owner and his family were doing their Sunday family meal w one big rice cooker at their table! Very nice!\n\nIf you're looking for glitz and glam - it ain't gonna be here. This place is no frills and I'm a fan.
