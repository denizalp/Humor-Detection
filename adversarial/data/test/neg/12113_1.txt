This place was good with a variety of dishes that would cater to a picky eater with its many breakfast  options.  I got the chili rellenos omelette which made me feel I was eating something in San Antonio (yep that good).  They make a mean waffle so if that is your thing then this is the place to be.  Portion sizes are big and I couldn't finish it all so I suggest you bring a good appetite. If you check in on yelp you get a free muffin (well I got one)!  The muffin tasted like a banana nut bread cake. For brunch they have all the alcoholic drinks that are considered socially acceptable before 5 pm.  Place is casual. Staff was friendly and helpful.  Conclusion : grab some friends\/family and meet up for brunch.
