I'm always, always looking for vintage\/thrift clothing stores - now I have finally found a shop to call \"my place\".\n\nGreat location on Carson in the South Side, this place is truly incredible and the prices are pretty great. They have a little of everything (patches, accessories, dresses, jackets and an amazing selection of vintage t-shirts sorted by color). The men's selection is decently large and I always leave with at least one or two items. The staff is super friendly and accommodating, which only adds to the like-ability of the place as a whole. I stop in about every 2-3 weeks and look forward to browsing and seeing what new gems I can add to my closet!
