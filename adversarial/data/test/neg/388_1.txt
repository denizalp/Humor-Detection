Authentic, rustic, friendly and flavorful! \nFirst and most memorable Irish pub experience in middle of Madison. \n\nI had the Reuben sandwich and it was best corned beef outside of my mom's. Tender, moist and oh so tasty! Fries and slaw were average but nice compliment to my meal.\n\nMax had Pub burger and he said was incredible!\n\nThe atmosphere and decor was warm, classy and very inviting.  \nNext time I wanna try the fish and chips or corned beef and cabbage.
