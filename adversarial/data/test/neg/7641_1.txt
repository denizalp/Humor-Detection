I have been getting laser hair removal from Brenda for 8 years now. I am extremely happy that I'm no longer experiencing razor bumps and facial discomfort. I've had Titan both neck and eyes and Voluma from when my left side of my cheek collapsed.  It looks pretty awesome!  I have made very good friends there and I really love them.  Michael Mall is the most kind and caring guy you'll ever meet. I truly love this place!  Thank you all for everything and Happy Holidays!
