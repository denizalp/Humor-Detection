the only reason it is a 4 star.. is because......\nMy boyfriend and i went to eat here after a very long day\/night out. There were 3 other customers eating around us, one was getting ready to pay and leave, and the other couple, much ..much older than us was ordering at the same time as us. \nWe order (party of 2) pizza, grilled chicken with veggies, and a large salad. enough to feed four!\n\nOkay, He serves our water.. and leaves. (where is he for the soda, wine, or tea?)\n\nComes with our food and asks if everything is fine.. \"yes\" and leaves. \n\nNow the older couple next to us is served. HE went to them about 4 times to make sure if everything was fine, if they needed more water, more cheese on the salad, and desserts..\n\nHe came to us ZIP- ZERO- times. maybe it was our age, maybe we did not look like the good tipping type. so he catered to the older couple. \nthe bus boy came and served me more water. Guess who got extra tip? \n\nI was fuming. since i still wanted dessert, but was never asked.. he just brought us the bill.. And HE still got his good tip...  was it deserved? \n\nThe food was delicious!!!!! pizza, salad.. yum. loved the FOOD. we went back the next night. better service..... who got tipped waaaaaay better.
