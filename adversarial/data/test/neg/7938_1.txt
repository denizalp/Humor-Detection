Walking the strip and the guy said two for one which caught my attention. Service was actually really good, The drink was a little watered down. I love the steak fries and the burger was actually good. The one negative was my friend said no tomato on her burger as she is allergic to tomatoes and they still added it so we had to send it back. Over all decent place for a burger and fries.
