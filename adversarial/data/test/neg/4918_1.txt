I had a very nice lunch at Alchemy. I had the fried perch sandwich and it was delicious. My one complaint is that I might have preferred a thinner slice of bread because it was a bit overpowering. Overall the balance of the flavors of the sandwich was nice and I would definitely order it again.\n\nMy mom went with the stuffed grilled cheese and Alchemy fries, both of which she really enjoyed! I got a chance to try the fries, which were crispy yet still soft and absolutely amazing!\n\nThe star of my meal at Alchemy was the daily soup special, a coconut, beet and ginger puree. The waitress let us a sample the soup before ordering it, which I really appreciated. Upon my first bite I was so in love that I ordered a bowl on the spot and proceeded to finish the whole thing. It was amazing!\n\nI really enjoyed the atmosphere and food at Alchemy and will definitely return to experience their outdoor seating this summer.
