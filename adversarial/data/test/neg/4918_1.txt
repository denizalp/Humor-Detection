I have only tried the fry bread (Navajo taco style) but it is delicious and has made me come back for more.  I usually do the lunch special which is plenty for me.  They have three different types of salsa that are all really good as well.  The store is clean and quaint and its interesting to be able to get some of the old type candy that is in front of the register.  I highly recommend this place.
