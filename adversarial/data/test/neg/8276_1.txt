Came here because I really needed a foot massage after breaking into new shoes. We saw the reviews seemed good and cheap so we came here. I think we got a $30 foot massage + a little bit of head\/neck\/shoulder work.  I wouldn't even come here for the sake of how cheap it is..\n\nFirstly, their service is pretty awful. When we first came in, there was a female carrying her baby (I think she either worked there or was family of someone who did) and another woman (i assume she's the owner) who was kind of walking back and forth. I don't remember what she was doing or how she interacted with us, but I just remember her seeming hurried and a little bit rude. She barely acknowledged us and then we waited quite some while. She later signaled for us to go to the front desk to ask what services we want. We asked for a massage and she prepared us for it.\n\nYou are fully clothed for these massages, even if you are getting a shoulder\/upper body massage. Now I don't mind a clothed massage, but the massage itself was just not relaxing. The masseuse didn't communicate much with me or ask about my injuries (which is a huge red flag in my opinion). It felt like the masseuse was randomly kneading through random parts of my body and then later took his fist and pounded on my muscles. It wasn't exactly painful, but it certainly wasn't comforting or relaxing. My boyfriend and I were in the same room and our masseuses kept talking to each other in Chinese...\n\nMaybe if you need just a quick foot massage, I guess it could be worth the value if you want something cheap and quick, but I highly urge you not to get any other kind of massage.
