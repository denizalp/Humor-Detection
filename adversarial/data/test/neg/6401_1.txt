Yum. We finally went after the newness died down some. We had to see what the hype was all about. \n\nThe location is super cute and trendy in park road shopping center. Parking is crowded. But that's typical.  There was a quick moving line when we came in Friday night.\n\nTheir prices are high for what it is. We split a single burger, double burger and fries for about $18.  \n\nWe had no problem finding a seat. The burger was super tasty. I understand the hype. It had a nice char\/crust. Mine came without lettuce so I asked for some and they brought me a whole new burger and to keep the original. It was really no big deal. I was just looking for the green lettuce for some crunch.\n\nI liked the vibe, the food, and the experience. We'll definately throw it in the rotation.
