The environment was fun and touristy! I remember coming here to dance all night but have never eaten here until now. Great service from Sabrina, who checked on us frequently. The volcano burger which I have attached a pic needed to be devoured in to four parts.  The fries were a little cold and dry. The seafood Mac and cheese which I also took a pic of was also delicious with the lemon and some pepper to add as it tasted a bit bland. But overall we had a great experience!
