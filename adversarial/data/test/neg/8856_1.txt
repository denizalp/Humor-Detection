I planned my day so that I was able to stop by West Elm and possibly buy lighting. The store \nis beautiful and immaculate but the customer service is awful. Not one of the sales women greeted, smiled, or even acknowledged me. There was one other customer in the store and 2 of the workers were hovering over her. I waited around for 15 min and was dismayed by the lack of friendliness. Come on people, you are not Rob and Stucky. Wait, they went out of business. Constructive criticism, take it and learn.
