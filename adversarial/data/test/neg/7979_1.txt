I mentioned to my co-worker that I had been jonesing for some Thai food.  She mentioned a place called Doan's that she had been to that had a great dish called Spicy Lemongrass Chicken.  So that's what brought me to Doan's on a Saturday afternoon.\n\nI arrived right around 1130 and the place was pretty empty.  In fact, I was able to park directly in front of the restaurant.  I was seated quickly and a waiter arrived to take my drink order.  I pretended to peruse the menu, but I knew what I was going to order.  When the waiter returned, I ordered the Spicy Lemongrass Chicken and proceeded to fire up the laptop to utilize their free wifi (it is password protected, so make sure to ask the wait-staff).\n\nMy food was ready in about ten minutes.  I dug in and the dish was great.  The portion size was good and it had a really nice flavor.  I would eat broccoli all the time if it was Spicy Lemongrass Broccoli!  For dessert, I got the Avocado Smoothie.  I first tried one of these during a visit to Chinatown in Honolulu.  This smoothie is the best smoothie in CLT!  And for only $3.75, it is a fantastic deal (take that Smoothie King).\n\n\nI don't know the finer points of Asian cuisine and how to differentiate between Thai, Korean, Vietnamese, and Cambodian.  And I don't know what constitutes good Vietnamese.  But I know I received great service and the food was tasty.  And I found the best smoothie in CLT.  I'll be back!
