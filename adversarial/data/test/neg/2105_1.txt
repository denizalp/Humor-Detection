I've tried the Wicked Spoon and the buffet at Caesar's, but the Bellagio buffet is now my favorite. The service was great and there was no line when we went (4:30ish) on Sunday. It was about $112 including the 18% gratuity. \nThe food was good and selection was large. They have sections that range from Italian and Asian to american and seafood. They have an island section in the middle dedicated to desserts and the beverages are self-serve from the Coca Cola machines that have hundreds options.
