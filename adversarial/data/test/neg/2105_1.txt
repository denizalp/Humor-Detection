This is a nice little cafe. It's not what you'd expect for the neighbourhood, and I love that. There is Starbucks and Tim Hortons around, but not many independent places. It's clean, the staff seem friendly, and the coffee is good.  I got an americano and a chocolate butter tart. It came to about $5. The americano was perfect. The tart was tasty but not mind blowing. It was a good compliment to the coffee and I appreciated the chocolate twist instead of a just a plain butter tart. I'll go back.
