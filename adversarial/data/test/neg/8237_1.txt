Maggie is the truth. She's a great person, stylist and colorist. I went to her about a year ago after a bad dye job that scorched my hair - I wanted to get something so I don't have to keep dyeing it and grow back some of the natural curl I lost! She did an amazing job matching my natural color with a nice blonde balayage - it's been a year and I haven't had to get it colored again ONCE! And it still looks natural! I still make her cut my hair though because now I trust no one else! :)
