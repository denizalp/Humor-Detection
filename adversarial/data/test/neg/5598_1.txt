We tried to give it a chance,  but every step of the way was painful. Were seated and wait-people avoided eye-contact for 20 minutes 'til we finally flagged one down. Our server showed up and said it was \"confusing\" that night.  Ok, fine. We ordered drinks, and then she came back 15 minutes later with no drinks and asked if we knew what we wanted, and we ordered. Another 20 minutes and our salads came out-  no drinks yet. Then the meals came, and they were spectacularly ordinary. This was not an inexpensive meal. Then the drinks came. One of my party ordered a second drink, since the first was served in a champagne flute of about 3 ounces ($10). That second drink never came. \n   Lousy service, lousy food, lousy attitude. Not going back.
