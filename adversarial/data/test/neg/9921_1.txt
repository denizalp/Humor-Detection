This was my first time to Rainbow Foot Spa. It is very close to my home so I decided to give it a try. This place is very clean and the atmosphere was very nice. Service was amazing. Joe was my therapist and he was very strong yet not painful. I had some serious knots and he was able to work them all out. I will definitely be back soon.
