It is an amazing place with a beautiful ambience !! The patio overlooks the lake and watching the sunset is an experience by itself. The food is \" par excellence \" and the wine selections are perfect . CJ is a great \"host\" and always takes care of me and my guests. Michaela is very nice enjoyed meeting her. A special thanks to Marie !! Zou who is also the owner , is a very personable guy and Jay is a super great chef . A special thanks to Stephen who takes great care and makes sure everyone is having a good time. Would highly recommend this place. \nThx\nDR MD
