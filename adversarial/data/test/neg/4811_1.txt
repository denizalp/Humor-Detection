I think the vegtables are frozen, not fresh.  I would add a few bucks to each item and use fresh and the quality goes up.\n\nNothing special.  I work nearby and I have been once (April 2013).\n\nI would go back with co-workers if someone picks it for lunch, but I would not pick it.\n\nIt does have a great low-carb menu and the service is fine.
