I was a little skeptical at first because the menu really reminded me of Panera Bread, but the food doesn't even compare.  Every bite was as good as the last.  It was exactly what I needed for a lite dinner.  For such a small menu, I felt I had a lot of options.\n\nBetter than the food was the service!  We had a huge party come in with us (so we had A LOT of little requests) and they were very accommodating.  At no point did I ever feel that I was an annoyance from either employee that was working. At one point though they did lose the ticket for one person in the group, for which they apologized and actually returned his money.\n\nIt's not often I give a 5, but given the quality of the food, excellent service, and professionalism of the staff, it's the right choice.
