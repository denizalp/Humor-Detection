An amazing experience. The only thing keeping this from a five star review is the steep cover charge and per drink price. This place should be a 4.5 or 4.75. The pool is packed with beautiful and social people. You will meet both domestic and international travelers all looking to enjoy some fun in the sun.  Also, the music is great! The best advice is to get here early, and plan for an all day experience. This is a must-see for anyone going out to Vegas. I plan on returning in the future as well.
