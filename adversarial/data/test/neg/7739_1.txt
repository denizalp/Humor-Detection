I'm so done with the Halal truck!! First time was great! Next couple of times, they covered my food in yogurt sauce. I'm talking about just straight poured it on where there was a good 1\/2 inch puddle at the bottom of my food. Next time I asked for the yogurt sauce to be on the side since they drenched it and he POURED DIABLO sauce all over my food. Stuff is so freaking hot you can't even eat it. Never again!!!!
