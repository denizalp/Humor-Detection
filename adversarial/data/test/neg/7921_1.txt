This is my fave location.  The place is clean, staff is nice, the pricing is right and the salad bar is great.  If you walk in right before they close the staff doesn't rush you.  The staff will always get something for you if its out on the salad bar.  I always get the chicken pot pie soup, salad bar and I get a sandwich sometimes then end up always taking the sadwich home.  The best part is you always get a free ice cream cone when you leave.
