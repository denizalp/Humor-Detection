On our 4th trip to Vegas, we went to Mirage buffet. there was a good 20-30 min line to get in. Inside, the dining hall was modern like the rest of mirage. But it looked like a big cafeteria hall, without a lot of decor.\n\nThey had good options like contemporary american, bbq, sushi, mexican etc. Not to mention a wide variety of desserts.
