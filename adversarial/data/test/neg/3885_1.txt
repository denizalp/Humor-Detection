Paris to New York Nail Bar gave me, by far, the worst gel manicure I have ever received. The technician's technique was awful. She applied the white by just hastily brushing back and forth. Most nail salons \"overpaint\" the white and then sculpt the arch using a nail brush. The result I got was an uneven arch between nails, an uneven coating of the white polish where parts of my nail were showing through, and on some nails, it was applied way too thick. \n\nIt was so bad that I couldn't even leave the salon and be seen with those unsightly nails...I told them they needed to remove the gel. There is no way I was going to pay for such awful nails and have to wear them for weeks while the gel is growing out.\n\n When the manager came over to see what was going on she said, \"It's gel--it's not going to be perfect.\" To which I replied, \"I have had this done many, many times and, yes, it CAN be close to perfect.\" \n\nI didn't have a pedicure, but the pedicure chairs looked horrible. They are basically wicker chairs....not comfortable at all. \n\nCute concept for a salon, but they need to learn how to do gel nails in a way that is on par with other local salons. I will never go back.
