It's too bad that I've driven by this place a hundred times and never became interested because of the name. I was under the impression it was a healthy food eatery\/salad bistro.  Lesson to self: never judge a book by its cover! Really cool place inside! Super modern and clean, wait staff was extremely gracious and helpful with the menu. Perfect spot for a date night! They have specials daily, offer cooking classes and have a jazz night with a prix fixe menu... Salmon blinis to start, a lamb special (amazing) and a steak with mashed potatoes\/balsamic reduction. We also ordered a ceasar salad which was one of the BEST we've ever had. *Not really portioned for sharing*, but such amazing flavors!  They don't have a kid friendly menu, but chef completely accommodated ours by making chicken sliders! Just a caution though: if you're going in starving, you will be hungry when you leave!
