Copying and pasting what I send to allegiant. I DO NOT reccomend this airline. Just pay $20 more for frontier and they're 1000000000 times better.\n\n\nI'm submitting this as a complaint to the Allegiant airline. I've been at the Sanford airport since 4:30pm today to board a flight that was supposed to have boarded at 5:27. Not only was this flight delayed until boarding would begin at 7:30, once we boarded the plane there was then technical problems that prevented departure another hour. Once these problems were finally solved, we are now stuck at the airport because of weather conditions. This is shameful of your airline to be so horrible. There was another flight by allegiant at this same airport that was supposed to leave today at 4pm to San Antonio that I saw was delayed until 10pm! That is completely SHAMEFUL!! I can't believe the amount of people that are having to change their plans and\/or transportation because of your airline. I will never be flying on this airline again. This explains why prices are so cheap. You get what you pay for!
