This company is so full of themselves that they think they can make any excuse as to why they don't call a customer back who is looking for their vehicle. They use the excuse they have over 5000 tows a month so they don't have time to call customers back.. Gee no wonder they are losing a lot of their commercial businesses and private tows.. \n\nThis is probably the reason why they are trying to monopolize the police rotation in Las Vegas because without that they wouldn't be in business. \n\nI would not ever call them.
