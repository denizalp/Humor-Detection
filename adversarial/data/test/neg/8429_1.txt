Edit (5\/3\/13) - My fiance's screen went out again randomly today. She ended up taking it to a phone repair place near Old Town and according to that store the company that installed the screen (Inspect-Ur Gadget) did a shoddy job and didn't install the screen properly. Luckily it was a quick fix but it also cost us $45 for something this stupid business messed up on again. \n\nSeriously if your reading these reviews, go elsewhere. Quick Fix Cellular is good option for the East Valley.\n\n\nI had high hopes for this place. I really did! I bookmarked them on Yelp after finding out that such a service existed right down the road from me. Now if your considering using them I have some words of advice right up front:\n\n1. Use these guys if you can stand to be without your phone for possibly several days. \n2. Use them if live close by, or don't mind driving out to Val Vista\/Warner Rd multiple times. \n3. If you can't be without your phone for more than a day, use them if you are prepared to zip over to their store for their 10 am opening at a moments notice. \n\nIf you can't stomach any of the above warnings, don't buy their groupon or use their service. \n\nFirst of all, they need to stop doing Groupon. I live in Scottsdale now, in order to get same day service and not be without a phone for more than a day, I had to drive out there with my Groupon in hand and then they said they will call me when the parts arrive for the phone. Why can't I email them my Groupon? Or call them with my Groupon number? Why make it so difficult?? \n\nThen about 2 weeks later I finally call them asking what the status is, they said the parts arrived today and I can come in tomorrow. So the next day I arrive at 10:30 and they said it will be 3 hours. Bring a book or a laptop because you're stuck in this side of town. Luckily I had errands in the East Valley so I knocked them out while waiting. \n\nReally funny thing is every time I come here to drop off the phone, they ask for a cell number to call me when it's ready. Not sure how many people have 2 phones but that can't be the case for most people! \n\nGot the phone back, looking as good as new but then over the next few days we notice the screen has a spot where it does not recognize touch. This is a big problem. I understand parts have defects, its why they say they have a warranty. Now I had to drive back out again. Well I called in advance, the guy said to come down at any time. Sounds suspicious based on what they told me before on their shortage of parts. \n\nThis time I made sure to get there right at 10:00 am, the guy then tried to tell me it will be done by the end of the day. Hahahaha I didn't stand for that one bit, if it was not for my sternness I would have let these guys ruin my whole day. I got them to get it done in 3 hours, still too long in my opinion. \n\nOne thing that really worried me is that the lobby was filled with other angry customers. That mixed with the Yelp reviews makes leaves me to say I will not be using their service again. I think this could be a great service if they mixed in a lot more customer service and focus on giving the customer a good experience and not how many repairs can they get through in a day. \n\nSo to conclude, they get 2 stars since they did fix the problem with the phone no question.
