Saw this on yelp and heard from friends it's a must try. I was not disappointed! My goodness the service is excellent and friendly (at least the dude that helped me). \n\nI got the jerk chicken burrito with chow mein instead of rice with all the toppings, including guac and edamame.  So good! It was filling, the jerk chicken isn't the best jerk I've had but it was still  tasty. \n\nThe Mexican cola I got was also out of this world.. Lots of cane sugar but always nice to treat yo'self. \n\nThere is not much seating. I think for two St the window. It's mainly a take out spot and very small inside. I recommend preparing to take the food elsewhere to a bench! \n\nWould definitely go back and try the general tao chicken burrito. Heck even the vegan burrito sounds delicious from the menu. \n\nJust go!
