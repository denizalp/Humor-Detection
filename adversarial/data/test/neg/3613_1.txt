Very cool tasting room. Can't believe they grow petite Syrah grapes in AZ of ANY quality, let alone this good. Very nice dark red wines that rival those from traditional growing regions.\n\n$8 for 3 small pours is a bit steep.\n\nThe olive oils should be better labeled (where from\/first pressing\/etc).\n\nGreat patio!\n\nCan't wait to return.
