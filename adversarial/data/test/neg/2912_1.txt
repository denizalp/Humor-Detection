First time here , loved it . Very unique- you have to go down some stairs to get to the dining area . Had escargot (prepared perfectly) -delicious and not too chewy . Oysters - buttery melt in your mouth . Lobster was huge , fantastic! New York strip - great portion and vegetable side were seasoned with some tanginess. Decent wine selections too . Dessert - salted caramel gelato in a huge cone -wow ! Loved it all and would absolutely go back .
