This is definitely a five star review. Reservations were smooth, check in easy. We were seated promptly and when asked at the last minute to sit outside, they were very nice about it. The ambiance is a bit dark inside, and slightly noisy, but very warmly decorated with a great atmosphere to it.\nOutdoor seating is a must as long as it has cooled some, which it had. It was just perfect. The patio is decorated very lovely, cozy, and it's spacious, great for groups, and there are misters.\n\nA must try are:\nThe prosciutto and fig appetizer\nThe sea bass entree, light and creamy \nThe salmon, cooked perfectly and seasoned with this delicious honey like glaze and beats, yum!\nI was five seconds away from ordering a second salmon entree it was just that great\nThe desserts, amazing! A must try:\nThe toasted coconut cakes with mint chocolate chip ice cream\nTheir blackberry balsamic ice cream amazing! All fish made.\n\nIf you come to Scottsdale you cannot leave without stopping by for dinner. Trust me it's a winner!
