I purchased a treadmill. It was a floor model. At the time I purchased it in the store, I was promised \"free delivery\" and \"free assembly\".\n\nAt the store, before finalizing the purchase, I informed the sales person that I needed the treadmill delivered to my backyard, down three steps, into my basement. I explicitly told her they would have to go down an alley down three steps to get to the door. Movement of the unit through my house into the basement would be impossible. The only way this unit would enter my house was through the alley and into the walkout from my backyard, period.\n\nThey informed me that this was acceptable. They called the delivery person in front of me and confirmed that this was okay in front of me. \n\nThis occurred at 4:00 p.m. on a Sunday afternoon, during a blizzard. The blizzard continued that night. \n\nThey arrived the next day in the afternoon. Only two men came for the delivery. They told my wife, who was home alone, that they could not deliver due to snow and ice on the pathway. They also told her that two men could not deliver the treadmill through the alley. They offered to drop the treadmill off on our porch, which my wife refused, since we would be incapable of moving it from there and needed delivery into the house, as we were promised. \n\nAfter clearing the snow and ice, they agreed to come back two days later. I made sure the way was clear this time.\n\nThey sent two men to deliver it this time while I was present. Two men are not strong enough to lift the assembled treadmill. They needed my help to lift it and move it from their van, down the sidewalk, down the alley, down the steps to my backyard. I agreed to be their third delivery man and help them move it.\n\nWe moved it into my basement but could not get it through the threshold of the basement door into our finished area. They wanted to leave it there and told me to disassemble it and move it myself. I refused. I stated that I was promised delivery and assembly. They stated it was assembled - it just needed to be disassembled and then assembled again - BY ME.\n\nI refused delivery under these conditions and told them to remove the treadmill from my property. I helped them move the treadmill back down the alley, up the stairs and back to their van.\n\nIn conclusion, when you promise someone \"free delivery\" and \"free assembly\" that does not mean, (to me), drop it off at my door where I can't do anything with it because I need two other grown men just to lift it. It does not mean I have to disassemble it to get it into my house and then assemble it again. \n\nI was of course informed of Canadian Tire's \"policy\" on deliveries (they say they just drop it off at your front door) but never was I actually told this at the store when I bought the unit. I was explicit about what I needed at the store, and they said \"yes\" to my conditions. If my expectations were unreasonable, then the time to say so was at the store, before I paid for the unit - not at the time of delivery.\n\nI wonder, how do women, or the infirm own treadmills, if you need a grown man to help the delivery men just move them from the van to your house. I wonder, what is the point of \"assembly\" if it has to be disassembled just to get it in the door - by the customer, and then re-assembled by the customer.\n\nIf Canadian Tire wants to half-ass their delivery - they need to be up front about this, or tell people it's going to cost extra. \n\nI will buy a treadmill from a professional retailer next time, with real delivery.
