Yes.  Just yes.\n\nWhen we chose to have our wedding at the Rosehill, we booked the site and then started talking to caterers on their preferred list.  Most of them were really pricy for uninventive menus and were unwilling to budge much.  We were willing to scrap the bells and whistles but even so, we felt like we were hitting a dead end.  After getting the okay to talk to vendors off the preferred list, we found Noble based on a positive Chowhound review and contacted them.  Tina, the sales manager, responded with a quote that was very reasonable and fit within our budget.\n\nMy in-laws did the initial tasting in September 2009 and had great reviews, booking Noble on the spot.  Most of the correspondence was between Tina and myself.  She was very responsive, very realistic, and helped guide us towards having a great menu.  The only real question was whether the food would measure up to everything that our in-laws said was scrumptious.\n\nDay-of, Tina was on the ball and we arrived at the venue with the set-up looking great.  She made the table settings look classy and un-fussy and was totally on-the-ball.  The hors d'oeuvres during cocktail hour were amazing.  We had fries with spicy mayo in a cone, tuna \"chopsticks\", sliders, and caprese skewers.  The dinner service was spot-on.  She made sure that each person got the right meal (since they had to choose upon RSVPing) and was on the floor making sure that the service was seamless. \n\nAnd holy moly did the food taste fabulous.  The main entrees we had (choice of steak or salmon) are ones that can be easily messed up in large quantities.  Dry salmon, overcooked meat, mushy entrees?  None here.  The salmon was moist, flavorful, and complimented very well with the caper smashed potatoes.  Each piece of steak was perfectly cooked to a medium-rare.  The lobster mashed potatoes (according to my lovely husband) were heavenly.  I have never seen so many licked-clean plates at a catered event in my life.  That's all I gotta say about the quality of food.\n\nMy in-laws ended up deciding to add (at the last minute) some late night snacks which were also quite yummy.  The only thing I thought was a bit off is that they wound up ordering enough for the whole wedding.  Since it was late-night, it's pretty standard that only the big dancers will be around for the whole evening, so it was a bit strange that they weren't persuaded to order enough for half of the group (which was something we had seen on other catering quotes in the past).  As a result I don't think there was food prepared late-night for a group of 100 since it wasn't being consumed that much.  I wasn't part of this discussion so I don't know why so much food had been ordered but if it were my decision I would have insisted on ordering less food for late-night (or none at all).  \n\nThat one thing though is so minor and the service and quality that we got from Noble is just a-maz-ing.  After talking to Rosehill staff afterwards we heard that they too were impressed by the service.  Now if only I lived closer and could get my hands on some of their food more often...
