Hands down the worst tattoo experience and finished product I have ever received.  My friend and I wanted to get matching tattoos on our forearms to signify friendship, and my friend made the appointment 2 weeks in advance.  We were looking forward to the experience, as most of the reviews online were very positive.  Our appointment was booked for 6:30 pm, and my friend was called by an employee of the shop earlier on in the day for us to come at 6:00 pm if we preferred, as there had been a cancellation.  \nWhen we arrived at the shop, we were greeted with extreme confusion and disorganization.  No one working there had any idea we were even coming for tattoos, nothing was recorded on their calendar, and no one seemed to know about the call made to my friend earlier on in the day instructing us to come early.  In hindsight, both my friend and I should have taken this as an indication of the state of the shop and how business was conducted, and we should have immediately left...unfortunately we did not.\nOur tattoo \"artist\" ensured us that he had been tatttoing for 8 years, and both my friend and I were comforted by that initially.  Upon following all post tattoo care instructions, I can firmly say that BOTH of us are more than unhappy with the finished product.  Both pieces exhibit extremely poor line work and crooked and uneven portions.  These were extremely simple and small pieces, that I would have even expected an apprentice to execute with success.  Both my friend and I have many tattoos, so are familiar and adhere to aftercare instructions, and we were both terribly disappointed with the finished product.  We are very aware that most tattoos need a touch up, but the finished product is well beyond that.  Needless to say, we will not be going back for the free touch up offered to us upon completion of the tattoos, and will be going to a professional artist to have them fixed.  Our warning is, please do your research before even getting the smallest or most simple of tattoos, because even those can end in pieces you will need to get fixed or covered.  And looking back, my friend and I both thought it was odd that the shop didn't even get us to fill out a waiver or any personal information, which I'm sure is a violation of heath and safety codes.  Do not recommend!
