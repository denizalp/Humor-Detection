Great Food. Decent service. I always come here because the portion sizes are rather large. I highly recommend this Hakka establishment over others due to the fact that they offer larger portions for the same price as opposed to other Hakka places. The Bombay chicken would have to be my personal favorite but there are lots of other good dishes such as Crispy Ginger Beef, Hakka Noodles, Chicken Pakora. I also love their deep fried banana served with ice cream.
