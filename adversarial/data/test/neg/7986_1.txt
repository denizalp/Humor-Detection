After my review the owner wrote me and offered a complimentary meal which is quite nice and appreciated. Inasmuch as the reviews of the food are generally very good I would have accepted but of course I'm now home 2,000 miles away and won't return for 5-6 months. In light of his kind and appropriate response I felt it only fair to report that as well. Maybe I'll see if the offer still stands in January. Anyway as a business owner myself I wish him and Yardbird well. He clearly understands that there are a lot of good restaurants in Vegas and it's not just about the food.
