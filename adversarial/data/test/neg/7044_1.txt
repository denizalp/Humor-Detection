Such a nice ambiance. Food was pretty good but a little greasy. The line is extremely long but our concierge (Omni Hotel) gave us his business card and we were able to cut the line! Otherwise I don't know if it would've been worth it. Our waitress was also very sweet and gave us some good recommendations of things to do in Montreal.
