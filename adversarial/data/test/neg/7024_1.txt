I would give a zero if I could. What a joke. I have been having so many problems with them... Great sales person but service after sale is crap. I'm having to get a lawyer to get out of my contract with them because they are not providing me with the service I signed up for. What's even more ridiculous is that, because of all the problems I'm experiencing with my system, Monitronics WILL let me out of my contract but Sound System WON'T.  What a joke.
