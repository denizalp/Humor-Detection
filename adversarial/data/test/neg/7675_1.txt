Kathy is owner is the best. They sell Glacier Peak Holistic allergy test for dogs. Frustrated with my one year old Boston's allergies and willing to try this before $400 blood test through vet.....my baby is like a new dog within two weeks!!!!!! \nI took the results to her and we changed his food she took all the time I needed to figure all new food and new treats.\nThey have a food buyers club card, a self wash card club.\nI will never buy products from another dog store in the valley!
