EDC 2009 was my first rave ever. I was first shocked by all the people in neon colored clothing (or lack thereof), kandi bracelets, and crazy shuffling.\n\nI love electronica, but I had no idea this was the kind of culture the music is associated with. I almost wanted to leave because my prude ass was shocked and scared.\n\nHowever, just by looking at everyone, art installations and the music all blended together, I fell in love with EDC. The energy was crazy (I didn't even roll both times I went), and it's seriously just one crazy party. Friendly people (of course), amazing light shows, awesome music, cool rides... It was really a great way to kickoff the summer.\n\nWhat I loved about EDC was the venue. It's huge! You have the coliseum and the areas surrounding it. It was crowded as hell, but it's all part of the fun. EDC always has a great line up, and the performances are just outstanding.\n\nThings I didn't like about EDC? Bathrooms; they get disgusting by the time it gets dark. Also parking is terrible ($25 is the cheapest I've seen) and traffic gets so crazy around the venue. Tip: make sure you get a legit parking spot, i.e. USC parking, unlike those shady places super close to the venue... they cost around $60 and I wouldn't consider it safe... I'm sure your car would be highly likely to get jacked.\n\nI had so much fun EDC 2009 that I went to Monster Massive, which was not as good primarily because of the venue (Just the sports arena, not the coliseum). I went to EDC 2010 and it was better than 2009. The best lineup!!! One thing I did was go on the very top of the coliseum and I saw the view from up there, which included the Downtown LA skyline. It was beautiful.\n\nOverall I highly recommend EDC. It's a great way to start off the summer and it's an awesome experience. Have fun and be safe!
