The food is creative and flavorful at The Perfect Pear. There is a variety of menu items to choose from. They have sandwiches, salads, soup, pasta, pita flat bread. Plus they have tacos.  I tried Paco's Pear Tacos.  They had roasted chicken, crispy bacon, chedder cheese, avocado, southwest cream sauce, sprouts and topped with their spicy pear pico de gallo. The were good but , I would have liked if they came with a small side of something to pick from.  I thought certain menu choices were a bit expensive considering the portion size and amount of food.  In any case, they have a bar with a long happy hour; especially if you might like to day drink.  It is a cute place to grab a quick bite.
