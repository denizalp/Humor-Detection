Went there through groupon for English tea. This is a tiny place with only 2 tiny tables crowded in front of the store. If we sit there and dine in as listed in groupon, we would have blocked the door way. Server refused to cash our groupons saying these were offered by mistake. Mistake or not, 6 of us drove 1 hour to find their place only to be turned away. In the process, not a single apology. Very disappointing
