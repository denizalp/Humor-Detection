The only room I haven't done at Escape This was the Sherlocked room. I have however done the In Check, Forgotten Pharoah, and Lost Friday Night rooms. I've only been able to escape the latter. They were each very well themed and offered their own set of unique puzzles and challenges. Had an amazing time each time I've gone and would highly recommended this place to anyone looking for an escape room! The staff is super friendly and very welcoming!
