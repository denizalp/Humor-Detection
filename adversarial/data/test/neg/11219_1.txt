I really wish Hawaii had Kohl's  they are one of my favorite stores!!  While visiting California and Nevada I went to about 5 of them.  \n\nGreat deals I found a lot of cute ornaments for 80% off the regular price.  I got a few pieces of clothing and some picture frames too.\n\nYou never have to worry about parking because there are a lot of stalls.\n\nThe only thing I did notice however was that they were not speedy in service.
