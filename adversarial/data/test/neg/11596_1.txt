Why is it so damn hard for the pharmacy department to do their job? The script was written and sent in numerous times only for the pharmacy department to turf my husband to multiple other pharmacies at different Walmart's ?!?! Today he is there again trying to get his medication and was told he had to pay $300 because he doesn't have insurance or not take all the pills to reduce the amount owed.  How about you, pharmacist, do your damn job and call to verify his insurance?!?!? Not only does he have insurance but he is double covered!! If he would have coughed up the $300 he would not have gotten reimbursed and to take a smaller amount of pills even though it was written for more?  Nice \"work around\" you have created for yourself, you lazy piece of xxxx!!
