Terrible service. I requested fresh towels and the young lady said we'd have to give them the dirty towels first then they would bring us fresh towels. As a guest we shouldn't have to do anything. I understand stand clean towels in exchange for the dirty ones. But for them to say we have to give dirty towels first then they bring us clean ones is beyond me! And the young lady that answered the call didn't put in the request I called back an hour later and spoke with JJ only to find out the towel request was never submitted. \n\nNever stay at this location or recommend this place to anyone!\n\nAlso, upon check in (1130pm long flight) we were told a shuttle would come to take us to our building and the shuttle took 20m after we made 3 request
