After a few unfortunate happenings I needed a storage unit ASAP. I raced over to storage mart after work made it with just 6 minutes on the clock and was helped by an angel. When most people would have turned me away because a few minutes is not enough time to get me registered and show me my new unit Jasmin stayed over her shift just to get me set up. Great facility, clean, freshly painted, I would recommend it to everyone. Thanks again jasmine for all your help!
