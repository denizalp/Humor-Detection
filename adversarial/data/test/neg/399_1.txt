Went here because we purchased a house this year so my parents referred us to this place and they were really nice took care of us pretty fast but we did not itemize just did a simple text turn with the house on there which we could've done on TurboTax online for $40 they charged us $160 which is totally outrageous since my parents just went there they itemized and it was for both of them and only charge them $120 kind of ridiculous if you ask me
