I haven't even attempted going here during breakfast time. I walked by it one day and saw the massive line so I avoided it for the longest time. One day it was around lunch time and I was walking by and decided to go in. I have been back a few times since. I really like it. I've had an omelette and french toast.\nIt was all very good. \nAnd the waitstaff are all very friendly.
