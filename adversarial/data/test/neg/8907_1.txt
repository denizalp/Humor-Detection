Everything is sooooo expensive!  For these prices, we should have just gone to Restoration Hardware.  Amidst their vast inventory, there are only a very small amount of items I would consider putting in my home.  I'm really curious to know who buys these very expensive (but very dated) pieces.  I should have trusted the reviews and saved the drive time.
