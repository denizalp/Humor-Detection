We had a group of 5 come here last weekend and had the pleasure of having Victoria helping our table out.  The food was delicious.  My girlfriend and I loved that everything was made from scratch.  She had a chicken salad, which was amazing, I opted for a breakfast sandwich, also fantastic.  Everyone from our group enjoyed the food, and enjoyed the GREAT service from our host.  If I lived in Scottsdale, I would be here a couple times a week for sure, its too good to pass up.
