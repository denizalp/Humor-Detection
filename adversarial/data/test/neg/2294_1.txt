Love is my favorite Cirque show thus far.\n\nIt's not as acrobatic as the rest that I've seen; it's much more romantic, with an eclectic range of dancers moving in sensual rhythm to Beatles music.  But it's not just Beatles music; it's amazingly remixed, melded, and reconfigured Beatles music.  What they achieved with the music was stand-alone impressive.\n\nThere are so many aspects of this show that are mind blowing, and it all happens in three dimensions.  The show on the floor is not the same as the show in the air.  But I promise it's all engaging.\n\nYes, it's expensive.  But go feel the experience; it's really a once-in-a-lifetime-type fantasy, Beatles fan or not.
