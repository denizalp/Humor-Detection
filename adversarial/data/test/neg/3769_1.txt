I went here for my sister's birthday and I couldn't have had a better time. There is no cost for entry; the only thing you pay for is the games (most are $0.50, although they do range between $0.25 - $1.00 per play). Between four of us we spent $40.00 and played for THREE hours. I can only think of a few other things you can do in Vegas for three hours with four adults and only spend forty bucks (wink*wink*). The machines are incredible, and they aren't just pinball. There are about 20 OG arcade cabinets as well, like Paper Boy, Donkey Kong, Gauntlet and (my personal favorite) DRAGON QUEST!! The single best part about the whole thing is that it is a non-profit so all of the proceeds go to charity. When I first heard that I thought, \"Sure, right, charity; the charitable organization of the owner's pocket,\" but boy did I feel bad when I got there and hanging front and center is a GIANT copy of a check given to the Salvation Army for $400K! The only reason I'm giving them four stars instead of five is because the location is the tiniest bit sketchy (on Trop across from the now defunct Liberace museum) and it was a little dark inside so I had a hard time seeing all the buzzers and do-hickies on the machines (which is the part that's the most fun, IMHO). All in all though, it was a great time and a stellar way to spend the afternoon. Do yourself a favor and play the South Park machine if you want to play one of the few machines out there with skill posts! I give the PHF four \"Multi Ball Mode\" stars.
