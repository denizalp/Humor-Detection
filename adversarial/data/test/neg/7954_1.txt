Horrible service, waited till 145 pm for the pool tech to come to my home who my home warranty company called out to fix my pump that was working half way. He turned it on for 10 seconds and said sounds like the bearings are not working but the home warranty wont cover noise issues. I kept trying to tell him that it was not working how it was supposed to and it was causing the water to be cloudy, and not sucking how it was supposed to. He said its not cloudy. Well, that's because your office girl told me to dump a ton of liquid chlorine in the pool to keep it from turning green in the beginning of the week. He didn't want to work, then gave me a quote for a new pump. I called my home warranty company old Republic, and they said they would have covered the barrings and the tech does not call the shots on what is covered and what is not. He also gave me a quote to change the motor out. I have had Old Republic for years at my other house with a pool and never had an issue with coverage. Not sure how you could figure things out in 10 seconds, run from this company, kid didn't want to work or because I am female he thought he could get one over one me.
