Being from Tucson, I was introduced to this place by my boyfriend that lives up here. I have to say this is the absolute best bagel place I've ever been to. It's family owned and operated. The owners are very nice and remember you and what you typically order. The food is fantastic and there iced blended mocha drink is so good too! Every time I had to go back home I would crave this place. So glad I just moved up here as I'm sitting in the deli right now eating a bagel with garden veggie cream cheese and drinking the blended mocha drink. In heaven right now!
