This restaurant celebrating it's 29th year in Madison is nothing short of legendary. My personal favorites are the Red Beans & Rice or the Jambalaya, with either the cornbread or the French bread. This reviewer would encourage seafood lovers to try this place (if you haven't yet). Visit the Fordem Avenue location and check out all the music legends who like this place.
