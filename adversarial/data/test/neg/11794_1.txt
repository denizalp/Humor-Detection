We stopped in yesterday for a mid afternoon brew and appetizer.  The craft beer selection was impressive and best of all they were mostly if not all NC breweries.  It's great to see that type of support for our state.  In addition the staff were very friendly and attentive.  We enjoyed a serving of fried pickles and their wings.. oh their wings.  So tasty and meaty.  The presentation of the food was spot on and worthy of a photo.  I have posted one of the wing pics on their profile here.  Warning, the pic may cause your mouth to water.  :)  \n\nWe had no idea the GM (Dennis) was in the building, but he noticed we were snapping pictures of our food and the environment.  He stopped by for a quick chat and was very friendly and professional.  \n\nI would recommend Howlers to anyone wanting a cold craft beer (or two... or three...  :) ) and tasty food with a fun atmosphere and friendly staff.
