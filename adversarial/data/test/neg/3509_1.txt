Went to Spa Lamar after receiving a gift cert for Xmas from my fianc√©e. My friend and I got massages, facials and pedicures. We also ordered lunch which was a delicious sandwich. I really enjoyed the Swedish massage. The steam room wasn't working when we got in but I think it was user error and neither one of us nor the other patron already in the room knew how to make it work  so we decided to hang out in the hot tub outside. Even with the bad weather which meant sprinkles, it was so relaxing and nice. My friend plans on coming back to get the day pass where you can use the amenities for a flat price for a day. This was my second visit. I've recommended Spa Lamar to friends and still will. Cute spa and nice location in Scottsdale.
