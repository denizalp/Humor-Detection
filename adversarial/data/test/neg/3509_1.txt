I was suggested to go here by a bartender at Brats on my conference travels. The staff was friendly and made me laugh. They have their own brewed beers and a happy hour that cost me $2.50 for a good beer. Good times and customers where so friendly. I love you Madison and I will recommend this place to any of my friends traveling to your city!
