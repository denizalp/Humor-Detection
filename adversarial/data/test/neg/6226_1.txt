We came here for birthday dinner for my daughter to celebrate her 5th birthday. I checked in and was surprised to see that I was able to get a free appetizer because I checked in. We had a good meal but our waitress forgot my husbands one side which was a bowl of chili. The manager fixed it. We had the do the birthday thing they do. Which was all fun and such. \nMy husband is a snoot and wouldn't let me look at the bill only to find out that they never took off the appetizer
