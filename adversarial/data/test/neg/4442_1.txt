Had to make a short notice trip to Vegas and found a good rate at the Luxor. This is not a review of the Luxor so off I go to Tenders with my $20 coupon. \n\nI dined alone and went there about 5:30 for dinner. I started out as the only person in my section of the dining room but by the time I left the tables started to fill. I started with a tomato variety starter which was tasty and plated nice. I got 2 different kinds of bread, not warm BTW and ordered the lamb shank with 1.25lb lobster accompanyment. The lamb was served with some type bean sauce and a sausage link that was bone dry on the inside. The lamb meat was tender and was easy to pry from the bone. The lobster was served in it's shell prepared in a buttery cheese sauce I think. I tried to save room for desert but all I could muster was a coffee after dinner drink.\n\nThere is plenty of staff around. Maybe too many. I saw my waiter chatting with another employee while my order was on his tray.\n\nI was expecting more noise and stink since it is located right off of the casino but the noise wasn't too bad and there was no casino smell. \n\nPleasant ambiance but is a little dark around the booths which may bother some people. \n\nBeing right off the casino floor the location is convenient but it is not a high end restaurant even though the prices are on the high side. \n\nOverall, not a bad experience but northing special. Fits in with Luxor environment
