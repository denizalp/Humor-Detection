Pictures on yelp showed a very promising Taiwanese cuisine in the midst of Squirrel Hill.  We went for a late dinner with no wait.  Our server was a sweet lady who was prompt and funny.  I was surprised by the good service here since it can be a hit or miss at Asian establishments (if you want to be abused, head down to Rose Tea Cafe).  We also saw how other servers interacted with other customers.  Hella respect for good old service.\n\nMajority of the menu items are Taiwanese, but there are some Korean and Cantonese dishes in the mix.  We ordered the soup dumplings, sauteed chinese watercress, cantonese soy sauce stir-fry noodle, and beef with chinese hot pepper entree.  All that for two people.  We definitely need to be back to try the rest of the menu.  But here's the breakdown of the food we tried:\n\nSoup dumpling - LOVE IT!  Out of all the ones I've tried in PIttsburgh, I love it here best.  The soup is flavorful, the dumpling skin does not rupture, and the soup is not dried up (plenty in there).\n\nSauteed chinese watercress - good, as expected.  Chinese watercress (or water spinach) is one of my favorites.\n\nCantonese soy-sauce stir-fry noodle - very salty and a bit more wet than the typical ones I've had.\n\nBeef with chinese hot pepper - Not the best I've had.  The beef was cut very thin and the hot pepper was spicier than what I'm used to.  Not sure if \"chinese hot pepper\" is the same as what other Taiwanese places uses, which is \"longhorn pepper\".  The heat was manageable after a few bites.  The dish is still great, but I don't think I will be craving it from here.\n\nTaiwanese Bistro Cafe 33 is absolutely a 4 star to start.  I'm curious whether the Korean food is any good here.  That's for next time!
