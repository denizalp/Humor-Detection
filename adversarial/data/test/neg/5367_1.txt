I had a hemorrhoids banding procedure with Dr. Shih. He's the best doctor ever. He cares about his patient so much. Before the procedure he explained everything really detail. Like what kind of tools he will use, how he will perform the procedure. Since one of my hemorrhoid size is too big. He informed me ahead of time that rubber band may not big enough to put on. I trust him and he made it. I felt so happy and blessed.\nAll the nurses and office staff are doing great job especially LY, she really helped me a lot and very professional. They are amazing.
