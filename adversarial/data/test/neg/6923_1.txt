I was amazed by everything. I got the omelette, which was huge, fluffy, and you could put as many items in it as you wanted...no extra charge. It also came with Hash browns and two huge pancakes. I was stuffed and it all was cooked perfectly as tasted wonderful. This will be my new Breakfast place for sure! They have so much to offer, it's a must if you are close by. Try it out!
