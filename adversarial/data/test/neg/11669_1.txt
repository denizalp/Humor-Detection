I am a MC Canada fan and was excited to try out this place. Quite disappointing to be honest... To summarize it all, \"looks better than its tastes\", so don't keep your hopes up.\n\nThis place is located in Scarborough, not a high traffic or noticeable location, but the store sign definitely helped catch some attention. Store design was nice, clean and simple, let the colorful macaroons and cakes do the talking. Friendly service.\n\nI bought the 3:15 for a birthday and was quite embarrassed by it. $38 for the smallest size, which claims to serve 6 people. Looks amazing, especially the box. The macaroons on top is the best part of the cake, which you can actually taste strong milktea flavor. The cake itself, even being the one who ordered it, can't tell what flavor it is. It was a little like coffee, maybe viet coffee? While I was ordering the cake, I confirmed that it is the milktea cake, but the staff never corrected me, so I assumed that it was supposed to be a milktea cake, but it tasted nothing like it AT ALL. I had my friends do blind tasting and guess the flavor. I don't blame them for not knowing. Even when I told them what it was supposed to be, they went silent... Great, what a waste of my money. Could have gotten a much better cake for that price. The cake base was ok, not sure what flavor, the mousse was heavy, not fluffy. It is not a bad cake, just lacking in flavor and a very vague flavor, not milktea at all. I have had a much better milktea cake for about the same price. If you message me, I can tell you where to get it. I am just frustrated to see where all these high ratings come from as I feel like I was being deceived. All in all, I might possibly maybe come back to try the macaroons cuz of how cute they look and afterall, the macaroons on the cake were pretty good.\n\nUpdate: Appreciate owner, Chris' sincerity, taking the time to message me, explaining his concept behind the cake. Great chef attitude! Brownie points for that. I will probably go back to give it another shot.
