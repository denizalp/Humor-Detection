I stayed here for a friend's 21st and it was AMAZING! We were total VIP 24\/7 and the room was fabu. Trust me, we'd know...we stayed in it ALL day thanks to the night before (you know you have a problem when you haven't seen sunlight in 24hrs ;) ahaha) -see pics-\n\nAlso, the front desk was super helpful (they found my id...it was at Cesar's...I don't even know HOW it got there).\n\nANDDDD when we got into our room there was a TON of WB stuff in there, left over from previous occupants, we obvi got a new room (high floor baby!) but we snagged the WB stuff and totally were in the know before anyone else.\n\nheart Vegas
