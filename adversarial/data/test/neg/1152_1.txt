I made an appointment at 4pm. I was five mins early. I had someone to be at 5:30pm so I thought an hour and 15 mins was more than enough time. I didn't get helped until 4:45pm. \n\nOn top of them making me 45 mins late to my meeting. I hate my nails. I told her I wanted them to look natural and they look far from that. I am so unhappy with them. I will never be back. They have to respect for people's time or honoring an appointment. I will never go back.
