My friend had recommended this firm to me.  \n\nEarlier in the week, I had filled out their online appointment request for 3 possible days\/times.  No one reached out to me to confirm any of the dates as their website promised they would.  \n\nFinally, this morning...I called their office myself.  I explained in depth to the receptionist what I had experienced.  To add to the already lousy customer service, she decided to put me on a 10 minute hold where I finally hung up in disgust.  \n\nThey won't be getting my business!!!
