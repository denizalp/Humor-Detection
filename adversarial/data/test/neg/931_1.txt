I did not know there was one in Vegas! I've been to a Wahoo's in Colorado! Last time I tried the shrimp tacos! Yummy!! Today I was in the mood for fish tacos. I ordered the two Cajun fish taco plate. I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had more limes! That's why I took off a star:( Rice and beans were not bad! Nothing to complain about there! Also reasonable prices! You can't beat that!! Staff were friendly! They weren't overwhelming or rushing me to place my order. \n\nHope to be back soon to bring more people! :)
