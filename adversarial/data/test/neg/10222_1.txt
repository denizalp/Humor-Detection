I struggle with this place... there are TVS but nothing on, there is great beer at 6 bucks a beer for all beers (could be a bit lower but not a terrible price) but they won't give you a discount for bringing your own growler and it's ONLY beer, it is a great atmostphere but it's way too small... the pizza place next door is cool that there is a food option but it's way overpriced and limited (their menu has like 5 items on it- two $11-12 MOD sized pizzas)  and there are no other food really (the plant-based place way in the back wasn't open at night when I went ).  Having said all this, I will walk back bc it's close to my house... I just hope it isn't over-crowded again bc this ruins it... overall they need a bigger space.
