I was recommended this restaurant by a medical student whose wife is Brazilian. It's a bit far west, but I decided to check it out for lunch one day. \n\nThe place isn't big, but has some seating for dining in. The servers are all very friendly, and all of the employees are Brazilian, and I heard them converse with some customers in Portuguese. \n\nI enjoyed my food thoroughly, see attached photos. Prices were moderate and portions were decent. The menu isn't too big.\n\nHonestly, I don't think there are that many Brazilian places in town, so this one is a solid offering!
