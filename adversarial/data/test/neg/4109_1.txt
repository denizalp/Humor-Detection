My favorite place in the city right now for many reasons. Truly authentic Italian food, which you certainly don't get most places. Service is very personable and attentive. The prices are reasonable and Chef Rudy is like none other. He's the owner\/chef, is there every day they're open, and comes through the dining room at various times, sits with the customers, talks and enjoys himself. He also does very unique things with the food he learned in Italy through the years. What else could you really ask for in a restaurant?  Definite \"locals\" feel. This is a place for a foodie.
