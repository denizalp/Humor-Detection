I  had not idea this small chain of 68 restaurants even existed until last week when we stopped in for breakfast with the family en route to San Diego.  I can't rave enough.  Great rustic country atmosphere with a wonderfully delightful and varied menu all at a reasonable price with large portions.  Probably one of the better breakfasts I've had in a long time.  Everyone in our fam loved it and we can't wait to return again soon.  Excellent and attentive service.  Delicious food.  Comfy atmosphere,  Generous portions and reasonable prices.  What's not to like?
