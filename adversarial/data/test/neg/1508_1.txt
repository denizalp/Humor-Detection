My husband and I booked two separate rooms for our wedding in Charlotte a few weeks ago. We worked with Emily B to arrange some courtesy hold on a few rooms and it all went very smoothly. If you need 10+ rooms, you'll need to guarantee 80% of the rooms, fyi. The ladies at check in were very helpful with my small requests - handing out our welcome bags at check in, bringing a mini fridge up to my suite, etc. \n\nThe hotel is absolutely lovely, it is the 2nd time I've stayed there. First time in a suite and it was perfect for my wedding. We only had about 6 or so people total getting ready but it could have fit 10 or more! We received a little gift of cookies and Perrier shortly after arriving and a sweet note, which was a very nice touch. Also the bathroom is just gorgeous - the standup shower is perfect (I had a minor issue with my shower not draining but it wax fixed immediately and not a big deal) and the spa tub is so nice! I had brought a Lush rose scented bath bar with me and used it the night before the wedding just to help me unwind and relax and calm down so I could sleep through the night. And I did sleep! Shockingly! I was prepared with Nyquil but after that warm soothing bath and the super comfortable beds, I crashed HARD and it was my wakeup call that woke me up. I did not expect that! \n\nHere comes the semi-disappointing part of the stay and I really don't fault the Ballantyne but it would be unfair not to disclose. We had a few leftover welcome bags and gift bags sitting on a round wood table in the room, near the balcony. I came back from manicures after an hour and a half, and I noticed ANTS all over the table and in the bags! Quickly I threw the bags on the balcony and called my fiance & housekeeping. They all arrived within 5 minutes. We noticed weirdly that there were thousands of ants in the gift bag with an engraved wooden handled knife rather than in the welcome bags with the donuts & cookies. I kept thinking that they had to come from outside until my fiance observed that the ants looked like they were coming *out of the wood table*, from inside it somewhere. One of the gentleman with the hotel seemed to agree, so maybe carpenter ants. Very strange, I don't know how that even happens but it wasn't the end of the world. Housekeeping and staff were great, they immediately started inspecting all my belongings to make sure they weren't anywhere else, had a bellhop in my room to move everything to the same exact suite down the hall. The switch was seamless and luckily it happened just after we had checked in (and had already given away our welcome bags!) so I hadn't unpacked anything and my dress was no where near the ants. Everyone was very apologetic and sweet to call me a few minutes later and ask me what type of wine I'd like sent to my room complimentary. I do not by ANY MEANS think that this hotel has an insect problem or infestation, there is now way I would have stayed there for my wedding weekend if I was skeeved out in the least. \n\nSo moving on. Our wedding night we did not request or expect the hotel do decorate or do anything out of the ordinary since only a few people had used our courtesy room rate and they weren't really making a ton of money of us (you know what I mean). We came back to our suite after the wedding and it was decorated beautifully with rose petals everywhere, LED votive candles, champagne, chocolate covered strawberries, and a very sweet note. An absolutely lovely ending to our perfect day. We only wish we didn't have to rush right out to our after party & could have enjoyed the romantic set up!\n\nWhat else? I didn't get a chance to hit the spa this visit but I've been before and it is a.maz.ing. The only time I've ever fallen asleep during a massage before! The Gallery Bar is also a great place to grab a drink, I confess that I did not have any cocktails this visit but I did stop by after our rehearsal dinner for a little while to visit with some friends who drinking there. It was crowded and lively for a hotel bar. Lastly, the Gallery restaurant was awesome for breakfast. We went both Saturday and Sunday, had the chicken & waffles twice! The mimosa bar looks great too. The pool! Our wedding weekend was Sunny & in the mid-high 80s from basically Thursday to Sunday so our guests - most from NY\/north east - got to enjoy hanging by the pool and soaking up sun in late September. The wait staff at the pool is great, and drink menu looked awesome. \n\nOverall, would I stay here again? YES. In fact, we have plans to stay there for our friend's wedding in a few months. Would I recommend this to someone getting married in the area? DEFINITELY. Reach out to Emily, even if you don't think you need rooms, and let her know. She really went above & beyond when she didn't need to! Couldn't have asked for a better hotel to stay at for our wedding!
