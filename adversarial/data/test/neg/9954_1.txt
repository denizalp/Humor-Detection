Overrated. You can be inventive and have a big menu and a cool atmosphere but mediocre food. Fries were bland and burger had crazy stuff a on it but tasted like it has a bunch of random stuff on it. Burger meat was poor. Do yourself a favor and save your self some money and go to five guys or steak and lube instead. Note: this was for a visit Jan 15
