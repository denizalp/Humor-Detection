Lol   yea I still keep coming for punishment smh in there defense Garlic Parm extra wet wings are awesome if extra wet drinks nah Shot of Tequila Corona back makes dining in bearable and the game tablets. Ordered online pickup for 9:14 still waiting.  I see Angelica is still here she doesn't wear her name tag but it's her she made this lady wait 10 minutes for an extra side of ranch I guess because she told her she put two in there but the lady wanted another one. What could've been a one minute thank you became a you're gonna wait until I want to get another ranch lol that's Angelica.. 9:18 so anyway I'm still waiting Angelica said she had to go to the bathroom so I took this opportunity to ask her replacement for my wings still waiting I get its V Day so they can get the 3stars which is really for Customer Service alone I decided to get my money back at 9:25 I  no longer craved the taste
