I was not satisfied with the quality of service. The staff did not adhere to the time schedule.\nIt was the worst experience I have ever encounter... I placed an order on May 8th for Mothers Day, May 11 and they never delivered. The next day, around 11:00 am, the delivery guy shows up with dead flowers. Water was dirty and the flowers looked like they were kept in the delivery car\/van over night. When we told the delivery guy that we were expecting these flowers the day before \"Mothers Day\", he simply said, he doesn't know anything and he is just a delivery guy... WOW  In conclusion, besides the poor product that we received, their customer service isn't any better, therefore my rating to them it would be NO STARS...
