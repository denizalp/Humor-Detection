For a Fairmont, this hotel was crappy!  First of all, they do not have enough staff to check in\/out people and answer questions without waiting in a 15 minute or more line (like every time I walked through the lobby, day or night).\n\nSecond, we got a room on a 'non-smoking' floor but the bathroom definitely smelled like someone had been smoking in there or next door. When we complained to the staff and requested a room change because someone later on, was smoking in the nearby stairwell (the smoke alarms went off and even after security came and told her should could not smoke there, she continued to do so asking the staff to just 'turn off' the alarm) they said guest services would contact us- they never did.\n\nWhen my husband went down to the lobby the next day to inquire about a room change, they said nothing but told us they could put something in the room to quell the smell (I don't know if they did anything, but it didn't smell any different).\n\nI know a lot of people smoke in Montreal (well more than where I am from in California) but, really, if you want to have guests who don't smoke stay at your hotel, maybe you should really, truly have non-smoking rooms\/floors.\n\n I think I cut at least 5 years from my life due to the smoke.\n\nI also agree with what others have said, the room was very small and the amenities seemed old\/outdated, again for a nicer hotel.\n\nBottom line- look elsewhere for a hotel, I'm sure there are tons of better ones in the area.
