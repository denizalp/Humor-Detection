My favorite salsa!!!  We absolutely love this place and recommend it to all of our friends.  We have been going here since it was just a tiny little house on West Sahara and it has been great to see them move and expand.  The food and service is always amazing.  My wife likes the chimichanga and I usually get one of the combo platters.  \n\nI have actually ordered the salsa to go for parties and such at the house.  The atmosphere is great and inviting and the place is easy to get to right off of the 215.  By far our favorite mexican restaurant.
