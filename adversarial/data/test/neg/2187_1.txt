This guy was AWESOME.! He had us write personal info on a card. He was blind folded. I was randomly picked had he guessed all my info. My name, my sister, my husband. It was awesome. I thought I was going to crap my pants.  Totally funny. It's a must see show. Was worth it.  I can't get over how he did all the crazy things he did.  I would go again to see if I can see how he does these things.
