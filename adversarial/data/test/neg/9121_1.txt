There was a hiccup in getting our food(the wait was a bit long) but the brunch was exceptional. We got the Brussels sprouts hummus and tongue. The tongue was perfectly cooked with delicious grits. The Brussels sprouts hummus had a unique tangy taste and the Brussels sprouts had a nice sweet sauce that balanced it out. Worked together well! Both the sunny side up and poached eggs were perfectly cooked.
