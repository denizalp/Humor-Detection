My AC condenser fan motor died.  Rather than call a service company, I took the unit apart and pulled the fan motor myself.  The dual capacitor needed replacement also.  I went to APC and was very happy with both their price and their wonderful, patient service!  Eddie offered to prep the wires for my installation and cut the fan shaft to fit perfectly.  He made sure I knew how to reinstall the motor and capacitor before I left the store.  The entire repair process on my broken AC took me only 51 minutes!  Very pleased with APC.
