Great find! It was my 14 yr old daughters first time having anything done to her brows besides some tweezing at home here and there. The lady was friendly and super fast! I was very impressed with the results and plan to return for my daughters and myself! My daughter keeps saying over and over how much she loves her eyebrows now!
