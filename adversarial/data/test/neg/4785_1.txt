Having a quickie lunch with my better half. Didn't care for this dim sum place but we know what was good and not good from our first visit. So we ordered Chinese brocolli,  beef tendons x2, fried taro, and salt and pepper shrimp. That hit the spot and literally ate everything. Again, nice staff, very attentive. Happy eats!
