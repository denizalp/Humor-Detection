Have no idea why this place is less than five stars!  Food is always consistent, great service and entertaining!  You have to try this place, once you do, you're addicted.  The coffee is delicious and you'll find yourself taking it home as well!  Chicken fried steak best in town; bacon is delish, chicken and waffles puts lo los to shame!  Get here and EAT!  Triple D wasn't kidding this place is the bomb for breakfast!  Tell them Dee sent you!
