Please dont underestimate this place! I LOVE mediterranean so needless to say im very critical of how ut taste. I had the beef shawarma sandwich and OMGGGGG its to die for ! I also tried the lemonade and trust me you wont be ready for the this amazing blended concoction of fresh squeezed lemonade & mint ! I tried the Kibbeh Balls they were so good i didnt get a chance to take a pic be for they were gone To top things off the owner is SUPER NICE!
