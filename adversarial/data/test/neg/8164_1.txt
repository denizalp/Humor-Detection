This used to be a good a circle k, especially the old night staff. Went in and went to counter and my fiancé asked for two packs of cigarettes and the rude gentleman rolled his eyes as he had to walk two feet away to grab them. When he came back he pointed at me and said I need to see her ID and that's that. I would have no issue furnishing my proof of 30! However he was down right arrogant, rude and disrespectful. If you hate your job get a new one. I politely responded you don't have to be so rude and told my fiancé we would take our business elsewhere. Both of the Circle K locations on Gilbert\/Pecos and Val Vista\/Pecos need a serious revamping of night time employees. It's worth driving farther to go to a gas station where the workers at least pretend to like there jobs. The guy was bigger, and had glasses, was working at 10:30pm on 11\/22. Thanks to him, my $100 weekly gas trip will be taken to Valero.
