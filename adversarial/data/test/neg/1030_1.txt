Really fresh produce and cheap produce. For a Chinatown supermarket, it is your best bet. It has everything you will need for Chinese cooking, and very good prices compared to many other big downtown chain supermarkets. It's a bit tight on space, but very organized and has a huge variety. I go there very often and definitely would suggest you try it out. It's moon festival and they carry lots of different moon cakes.
