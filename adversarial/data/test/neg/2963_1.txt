I needed both U\/S and x-ray services and my requisition sent me here. I made the appointment over the phone and was booked fairly soon. I had some challenges getting to the appointment because of my condition at the time, and ended up running late because of my ride. I called en route and the staff said they'd try to hold for me, and thankfully the technician waited on me. It was the end of the day so I was spared the wait that most people endure at peak times, so I had no unpleasant experience on that score.\n\nThe technician was very friendly and seemed very knowledgeable, he was willing to comment on things although they are not actually allowed to say anything in terms of diagnosis, of course. He didn't rush, even though he had already waited on me for my appointment. I felt very relaxed and reassured through both the U\/S and the x-ray.\n\nBest of all, you can get your results without any additional cost! This is a huge benefit compared to most other labs that want fees for every possible thing besides your appointment. If you don't have your OHIP card with you when you pick up your pictures, you'd have to pay $5. Wow. Less than a Tarbucks drink for medical file photos without your health card? I'd just pay that gladly if I had to.\n\nThe entrance is tucked into the corner of the plaza, which other reviewers have remarked is a bit tired, but there is free parking and the services and equipment seemed adequate. The staff really are nicer to deal with than a lot of cold and snooty medical staff types, so that was all great. There's a very down-to-earth and good bedside manner vibe I experienced on my visit in spite of the tired surface look, so, if you don't feel comfortable unless you feel like you're in a glossy, white, pharmaceutical capsule, you might find fault with that; but, in terms of feeling like you're being treated by real human beings, there was something indescribably different somehow about feeling like a person is looking after another person, instead of being processed through a medical procedure.\n\nI don't want to have to come back but, if I did, I'd pray for a decent wait time, the same level of staff, and feel reassured it would be a good experience.
