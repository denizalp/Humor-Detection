I've been here many times over the years.  This is a great choice if you want some good drinks and some good food.  It doesn't disappoint but it doesn't blow away your taste buds either.  This time I believe they have a special going on - 3 meals (apps\/entre\/dessert) for $25 from a select menu. \n\nI ordered the grilled salmon with pineapple salsa, jasmine rice and seasonal veggies.  Overall the salmon was done nicely, but it could have used more salsa to give it a nice citrus-y flavour.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice - dark and brooding with a hint of sexy.  Great for friends or a first date.\n\nI must say the service was really nice - our server knew the menu and made some suggestions.  Polite and genuinely nice.  If you are checking out a menu at the STC this is a good place to grab a meal\/drink before or afterwards.
