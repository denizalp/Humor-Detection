We come here a lot for late night grub. Food is always hot and fresh and the service was killer.\n\nUnfortunately, the food this time was no good. Food was super cold. And after eating the food my wife got sick 30 min later. I had really bad heartburn. Then got sick 2 times in the morning.\n\nI thot it would be a great gesture to call the resturant, and let them know that there food was cold and made us sick. Then GM Fred was very unapologetic. HE asked me \"what do u want me to do.\" I can remake the food again, for u or u can fill out paperwork and I will turn it over to our risk management team. Which means what? BASICALLY. I only complain of something is really bad. Both of us are in the sevice industry(wife) and we know that complaints are supposed to handled differently.\n\nThis joker was not sorry about what happend. Maybe this happens a lot or maybe he gets a lot of prank calls idk, the thing that bothers me a lot is that he didn't say I'm sorry or try to reimbursement at all. \n\nThe question is do we go back? Food is good and Jamie they drive thru girl is amazing and always friendly. I might given it another try but Fred man u need some help on how to deal with people. If someone says their sick try to apologize first. Then maybe try to check ur health temps or train staff better\n Instead just fill out paperwork. Lame
