Cool spot with really good food. If you haven't checked out the patio this summer - it's a must! I have dined here twice now and the food has been consistently great. I would recommend the pirogies, the crab dip and the crab cakes. My husband had the Ruben and loved it. They have a pretty extensive craft draft list which we loved. The complimentary bread basket is a nice touch. We will definitely be back!
