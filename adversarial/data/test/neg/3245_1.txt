My girlfriend and I have been coming here for a while now. Finally leaving a review for this awesome Japanese restaurant. I've tried just about everything on the menu and Musashi never disappoints. If you \"authentic\" Japanese ramen and not the ramen fusion that's around town, you have to come here, it's top notch. Their sushi is spot on and you can't go wrong with their bento box offerings. We come here, at least, once a week.. so good!
