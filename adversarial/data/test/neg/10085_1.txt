I absolutely LOVE this place. I go almost every week for lunch between classes. They have the best fries around. I always order the Hawaiin burger, fries and don't forget the red cream soda. Hamburger Works is one of the rare places that carries red cream soda, if you haven't had it before you must try it. The staff here is always friendly and welcoming.
