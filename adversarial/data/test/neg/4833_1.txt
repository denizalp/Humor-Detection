Best buffalo chicken sandwich I have ever had. That doesnt sound like a common thing but I have had so many renditions and yardbirds was the best. The place is pretty pricey and I lost enough money in the casinos that I wasnt trying to gamble with 1 of their $30+ items. So I went with the $14 sandwich which came with a nice side salad and ordered the cole slaw to round out the meal. Every I ordered was good. So 5 stars from me.
