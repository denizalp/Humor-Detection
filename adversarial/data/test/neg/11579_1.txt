Made it to Ginger Monkey for the first time on Thursday night for my dog's fourth birthday. Yes, you read that correctly. Moving on...The customer service experience at this restaurant is a rare gem! Everyone was so inviting to my mother, my boyfriend and I, and especially welcoming to my furry son. They were so great about playing along with my antics and even comped his birthday meal. He had ordered the \"hambarker helper\" off the dog menu, which he said was delicious. ;) The patio is very lovely with plenty of heaters and televisions. As for the food...I honestly wouldn't recommend the meatballs. They were a bit of a miss...But the braised short ribs, the deviled eggs, the duck fat fries, and the caramelized onion flatbread were all very tasty! To top our evening off, the staff even all gathered to sing happy birthday to my spoiled boy. Thanks to the amazing folks at the ginger monkey, we had an amazing evening and an even better story!
