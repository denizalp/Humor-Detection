I love subway, it's always great. However me and my friends never go to this location because of the staff!!! They are always rude and make me feel uncomfortable. If you ask for \"lots of pickles please\" they give you barely any and you have to ask for more, they will reluctantly give you 2 or 3 more. \nI keep thinking it will change and occasionally try it again, but am always welcomed with very rude service and old bread
