Cosmic bowling birthday party.  Awesome!!  At 13.00 bucks a kid. You have two stress free hours of birthday bliss.  The owners son was courteous, friendly and accommodating ! The kids got pizza, unlimited pop and chips.  Wait there's more each kid got 2 quarters so they can play the video games. Why didn't I think of this years ago when my kids were younger!  They had a great time!  I gave a four star NOT because I had to take my shoes off by the door, but they were laid out all over the floor amongst 30 other pairs, it was a shoe disaster. A few shoe organizers by closet maid should do the trick.  Also if you do go to Cosmic Bowling bring a couple of yellow high liters and have fun with them,  the kids were glowing literally!  Great birthday and  I didn't pay a whole lot of money and I didn't have to clean my house !
