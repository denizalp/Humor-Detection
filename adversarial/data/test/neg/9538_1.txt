First let me say I love Guy Fieri. We ate here 3 times this week and the food was 5 stars each visit.  With that being said, on 2 of our 3 visits, our service was poor. From waiting 13 minutes after seating for our waiter to not being offered dessert. On one visit, we were asked if we were ready for our check. We said no we would like to see a dessert menu. After about 5 minutes our menu arrives. We then wait about 14 minutes for our waiter to come back. By then we decided to pass. This morning we ate breakfast here and waited 13 minutes to be greeted by our waiter. Let me note, they were not very busy.  So we finally order and received coffee. After running out of coffee and waiting and waiting, I decided to turn my cup upside down. Our waiter finally stopped by.  He used 2 curse words and made an off color comment about the portions being \"big and delicious, just like me\".  Really?  I love Fieri but there are plenty of restaurants with good food AND good service.
