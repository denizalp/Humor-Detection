It was our first time in a Peruvian restaurant, and found it because of a Groupon deal. Our guy server was awesome. We asked for recommendations on what to eat since it was our first time eating Peruvian cuisine and he gave his honest opinion (he's funny too!). Food was delicious. \n\nWe had the anticuchos for appetizer, which is beef heart. It's our first time eating beef heart. I think the taste is like a cross between regular beef meat and a bit of liver. We liked it, especially when you put the spicy sauce on it. My wife had the Ceviche de Camarones and she loved it. I had the Lomo Saltado. The flavor is awesome! The beef is a bit tough, not too bad though. Maybe next time, I will add the option to make it a sirloin for additional $5. We had Caramel Flan for dessert and it's a big serving. \n\nThe place was busy for a Wednesday night. The guy was the only server so it took him a while to get back to our table, but aside from that he gave good service. Will definitely go back again.
