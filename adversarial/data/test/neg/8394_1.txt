Cute little ramen place in chandler. Friendly staff and pretty quick service. We came in on a Saturday right before the rush and our order came out in less than 10mins. We ordered a Tonkotsu, Miso, Nishikawa black and some Takoyaki. Everything came out pipping hot and delicious. The Tonkotsu was rich and creamy and paired well with toppings. The soft boiled egg was just right and I also liked that they have the option to have it hard boiled instead. My boyfriend and his friend finished their whole bowl and the broth.
