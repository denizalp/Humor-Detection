This restaurant apparently changed owners recently. If you are looking to experience Amy's Baking Company before kitchen nightmares, this is the place. The service is bad, the food is worse. With a large group of people we experienced an array of bad food. I.e.\n\n1. The salad has an incredibly offensive and intense onion flavor. Strange because there were no onions on the salad.\n\n2. The chicken dishes tasted like salt block.\n\n3. The burgers were undercooked, salty, and dripping grease. Fortunately the large roll they were encased in soaked up a lot of the greasy salt and could be discarded. \n\n4. Soggy fries.\n\n5. Iceberg salad. I would never order iceberg anything, but the unfortunate individual who had, received nothing more than a chunk of iceberg with strange onion flavor.\n\n6. Salmon burger. Standard farmed salmon steak, skin on, greasy. Very salty like everything else. I can't imagine how much salt they go through, I'm imagining daily deliveries of 5gallon buckets.\n\n6. Ice cream (fried?) desert. I don't remember exactly what it was, but the ice cream was good.\n\nLong story short. Go here for the novelty of enjoying a truly terrible restaurant experience while it lasts. I don't think they'll be around much longer.
