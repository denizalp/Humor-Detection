This location is on the corner of a busy intersection. At least the interior was clean and modern. \n\nWhe we arrived we had to wait a few minutes before someone popped out of the back to come over and take our order.\n\nWhen we were ordering the cashier kept pointing to the menu behind him when we asked about toppings, very unprofessional.\n\nMy daughter ordered the vegeterian soul burger, poutine and a drink. It was all a hit so at least the food was good.
