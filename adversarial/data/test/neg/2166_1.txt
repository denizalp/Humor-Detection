I have to say that this summer I traveled quite a bit and had a full set of SNS nails done which I thought  were beautiful. I went to NY for a fill and they did a terrible job. So I returned home to Vegas and went back to Lavish Nails and Lan was my nail technician. She looked at my nails and assessed the situation came up with a plan and she nailed it!! Literally  my nails look incredibly natural and she did shaped them coffin style and took her time to achieve perfection!! I highly recommend Lavish Nails. I've also had Leon do a gel pedicure and he Nailed it as well!! \n\nI've been going to Lavish since July now and Lan is still keeping my nails looking gorgeous. She does such a wonderful job and takes her time and looks at your nails at all angles to make sure they are shaped perfectly. She's very professional and Michael is as well. The salon is beautifully decorated and it's a great place of relaxation!
