Pretty solid!  I'm taking a bus over to Greyhound and rather than getting an overpriced dry turkey sandwich, I thought I should treat myself to some deliciousness!\n\nI got the vegetarian meatball panini and it far exceeded my expectation in terms of size of meatball and flavor.  Your entire panini is essentially your meatballs.  I also consider the white bean, mushroom meatball a thoughtfully crafted vegetarian choice, compared to other restaurants who consider their vegetarian option some sort of overcooked seitan.  My only caveat is that the panini is a little small for the $7.50 price tag.  I think it would have been more appropriately priced at $6.  It's definitely snack size.\n\nWith such a great vegetarian option, I'm sure their carnivorous options are more than great!
