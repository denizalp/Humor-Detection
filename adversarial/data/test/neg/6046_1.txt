Nice to hear a GOOD tale about a business...Month back I bought a fruitless Plum tree at Star Nursery...It croaked in just a few days...Went back and showed them pixs and whithout a hassle they said to come back and they would exchange it for a different tree that might do better in our back yard...Jim was the mgr. and today he brought out two trees from the back of their lot to show me...Above and beyond...That is why I shop at STAR Nursery...You should , too...If you hit the Ann Rd store, thank Jim once again for me...OK?
