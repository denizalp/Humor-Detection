It was my boyfriend's birthday. We couldn't decide where to go and came upon this restaurant by accident. \n\nSally was our wonderful server. Very attentive. \n\nCheesy bread and ranch house potatoes was good. My 12 oz. rib eye was delicious! \n\nPrice point was a touch higher than I would expect, but we enjoyed ourselves none the less.
