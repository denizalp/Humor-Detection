Came here for the first time on Friday after fellowship with a friend around 10:30PM. It's similar to Cha-Time and Gong-Cha (or Taiwanese run bubble tea places) in the customization sense - you can custom choose your size, flavour, sugar and ice levels. Had the matcha milk tea with tapioca and my friend got the Chocolate tapioca drink. We both enjoyed our drinks and the setting was nice for tea & talking. The music playing was just right - light kpop but nothing too loud or obnoxious.
