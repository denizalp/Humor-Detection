The COSTUME, the MUSIC, the STAGE was absolutely A-MA-ZING!! So why not 5 stars? I thought overall the show was a bit slowww. They could've cut out some of the scenes and shorten some of the song numbers.\n\nI did enjoy the show overall and got a great price for the tickets so it was worth every penny =D\n\nRating for RAFIKI's singing: 10 million stars. She blew me away and gave me chills when she sang, seriously. \n\nI would definitely recommend this show but don't pay full price, I see discounts\/promotions for this show all the time.
