Great little family-run Thai joint.  Very small inside, but nicely decorated.  The food is prepared with a lot of care and the ingredients are very fresh.  The Thai Fried Rice is excellent, as are most all the dishes.  Beware of the spiciness--medium here is like hot at other Thai joints.  \n\nMy wife and I will be regulars.
