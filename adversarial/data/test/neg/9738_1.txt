Came here with a few friends on a Saturday night. Lesson learned, though: do not expect to find tables downtown on a Saturday without having made reservations (at least in the good places!) \n\nBut luckily, a tiny table in the bar area was available without any wait. \n\nWell, the first thing I noticed was the ginormous menu of beers. Woah, serious. \n\nBoth my companions ordered a 1\/2 pint with their meals (don't remember their exact kinds) but they both thoroughly enjoyed them! \n\nWe ended up ordering:\n\n1) Salmon BLT mussel bowl \n\n2) Belgian mussel bowl \n\n3) Steak tartare.\n\nBoth mussel bowls came with a side sourdough loaf for sopping up mussel juices, which was quite nice compared to the usual slice of bread or mini bun! The mussel bowls were also really huge and cool-looking (heavy, too, damn. Props to the servers!) \n\nBut the flavours weren't all that exciting. The salmon BLT one had all the salmon pieces tucked at the bottom, and not too sure where the \"BLT\" comes in. The Belgian mussels had more complex flavours, but overall nothing that was really different from regular home-made mussels. \n\nMy dish was the steak tartare: it was a good portion, the horseradish mayo was tasty (but there was too little of it!), but the steak was pretty substandard. It was very stringy and tough, and I spent majority of my time trying to cut it up into manageable bites. I enjoyed the flavours, but the difficulty I had chewing it kind of ruined it. \n\nService was in general, good, and the atmosphere was nice. Only reason to return would be for the huge selection of beers to try, but don't expect too much from the food.
