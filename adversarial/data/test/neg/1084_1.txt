Interestingly enough, the beer's not the draw for us; the food is.  They have great sandwich-and-burger style meals with a twist, and I'd highly recommend their Asian nachos, which come with chicken, cheese, and a lightly-spiced wasabi.  They have great pretzels.  Their salads are surprisingly good. \n\nThe beer?  Decent.  Like most local brewpubs they adore hops to the point of bitter beer face, but it's Cleveland beer.  About what you'd expect.  But the Brew Company as a whole is rarely disappointing.
