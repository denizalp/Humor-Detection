Ate here last night and it was great! My brother in law had the octopus appetizer and said he loved it. My sister had the French onion soup and she liked it and I had the filet mignon and it was absolutely perfect. Especially for a price of $25, which isn't bad for a good piece of steak. It could easily be compared to Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse.
