I arrived at 1 PM on a Saturday and waited in front of the order screen in the drive thru for 6 minutes before anyone took my order. And then waited 20 minutes in front of the window. (I worked drive thru when I was a teenager for 2 years and this is not how you run drive thru!). I read previous reviews and this doesn't seem to be the first time for them. I will not be coming back to this location again.
