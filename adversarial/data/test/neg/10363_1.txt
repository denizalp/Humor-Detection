Tonight was the worst experience I've ever had at any restaurant. We were seated quickly and received our drinks but were soon forgotten about because we didn't have penises. Our waitress clearly wanted to have sex with one of the five guys at the other table. She literally told us she forgot about us. We still stayed for quite a while, at least fifteen minutes in freezing conditions until we decided to leave once realizing the people who were seated 20 minutes after us received their food, before the waitress even came to us again. If all a waitress wants is sex from patrons she should be working at a strip club and not Denny's. Do not go here.
