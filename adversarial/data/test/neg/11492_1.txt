Four stars for the normal quality. Last night though got take out and the order was wrong - too far to drive back. The pork and the ribs were WAY over cooked - or better said kept hot way too long. The pork was mushy and the ribs dry and hard. I know waste in the restaurant biz is a killer but I have heard this from a couple of people now and am hoping you get back to your usual quality control. The chicken though was as perfect as ever. Don't let the quality slip!
