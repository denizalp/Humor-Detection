With many, many places to choose from, I will go elsewhere. Just dropped in for a beer and to check the place out for the first time. The bartender, walking past without stopping or offering any other greeting says, \"I need your ID's out, please\". \n\nImmediately conveying that I was merely an inconvenience in her busy day was a horrible first impression. The bar & restaurant wasn't even full at the time, a weeknight around 7pm. Not that this would have even been a justification. This person conveyed that they barely cared that I had just entered the business.\n\nShe came back and reviewed our ID's, I ordered my one beer, and the mrs said she just wanted to drink water. The beverages were brought back, and I offered money immediately, without asking the cost. I got my change back, and discovered by looking at the receipt that they charge 75 cents for a glass of water. Seriously. I was a bit stunned. I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water.
