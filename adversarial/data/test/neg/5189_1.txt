They haven't even cleaned my carpets yet and the service is the absolutely most professional in carpet cleaning I've ever seen in my LIFE! Rick is a hands-on, helpful, and very considerate owner whom answered my call and addressed all my questions even down to the solvents and the type of pet deodorizer they'd be using! He even went above and beyond to squeeze me in their busy day and even gave me a call back to secure that spot. Great customer service. I've never had a carpet company be able to do that for me, let alone make me feel like I'm calling a REAL company as opposed to just a guy with a steamer- you rock!!\n\nOnce they get here this evening and finish up I'll update my review with photos- can't wait!!!\n\nUPDATE: as I suspected!! An amazing job by Isaac, he was quick to attend to our needs and kept us entertained while we watched him do his magic!! He even explained what he was spraying on the poop\/urine stains to make sure the stain didn't come back once the carpet was dry. He also deodorized and explained to us how to air the house out.\n\nEven better, the owner himself called after Isaac had left to make sure that everything was looking good!! Made me feel like I was a part of the \"carpet monkey family\" thanks guys!! I'll be using you from now on(:
