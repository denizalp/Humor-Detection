I was so impressed with our visit today! Here were the some of the highlights of our visit: \n1. Everything was CLEAN! This is a big deal to me and should be to anyone getting their nails done. Hygiene is so important to ensure your safety and I am so happy that they used new files and tools for my daughter and I. It was a relief! After each pedi I saw someone clean not only the tub but even the surrounding area for good measure. After every mani\/nail set I saw someone thoroughly clean their station and surrounding area also.\n2. The decor and theme is so chic. I love the monochromatic black and white theme with straight sleek design. Everything feels high end which makes it all that much more of an experience. \n3. The scrubs are made in house and smell divine. \n4. Everyone is sooooooo nice. Like super nice. The staff were so accommodating. I came with my five year old daughter and they talked to her with such kindness. They treated her like a client and she just loved it. They basically gave her the same experience as she saw mommy have and she cannot wait to go back.\n5. We went a little past closing and not once did I feel that they were rushing to finish up. They were so patient. I am actually glad I got to stay past closing because I got to see how they sanitize everything at the end of the night. I sound like such a clean freak but when you have skin cells and finger nails possibly everywhere and you find a salon whose main goal is to sanitize and keep their place of business clean... I am all for it. \n\nWe will definitely be back!
