I've been here many times to grab breakfast before work. Owner is a friendly guy whom works extremely hard (he does deliveries himself a lot). Food is delicious and prices are certainly fair. If you're looking for a cool, local joint for a quick bite, this place is it! Stop in and try it out! \n\nSide note- first time I came here the owner gave me free cookies because it was my first time in.
