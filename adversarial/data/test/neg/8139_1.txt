The crab canap√© is amazing, their lamb burger is one of the top 3 burgers in town easily and their duck breast is enough to make me drive 30 minutes out of my way (surrounded by 'best of' restaurants in my immediate neighborhood) for dinner. Love the videos the owner does on Facebook every Wednesday (I now sound like a wine snob when I go out with friends for dinner)... and Willie (the server \/ host \/ all around everyman) is pretty much the nicest guy you could possibly want to ever meet. Go, you won't be disappointed!
