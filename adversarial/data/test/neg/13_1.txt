Great location if you can score a seat on the patio but you'll have to fight off the birds.  Inside isn't so bad especially with the AC on.  Our server spoke too fast and seemed hurried the whole time.  The food took FOREVER to come out and I noticed the surrounding patrons around us didn't get food either.  Nothing was coming out of the kitchen, except for drinks for a good 20 mins.\n\nOnce the food arrived, my husband's burger was good.  I got the hash and it was very dry.  The side of fries I got were great though.
