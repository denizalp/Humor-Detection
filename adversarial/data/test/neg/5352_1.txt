Sorry downgrade because:\n\na) As they have gotten older, they've gotten darker and less clean. \nb) The meat and fish section smell very badly.  \n\nHowever, they have some cheap produce and other specials that you can look for in flyers and some decent hot food (though full of sodium and sugar, quite tasty) for good prices. \n\nJust your normal average Chinese grocery store.
