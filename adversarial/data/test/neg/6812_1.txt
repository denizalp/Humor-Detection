I hate to leave negative reviews for businesses, but this is just a business you MUST avoid - especially during the time where you need to minimize stress, just after you lost a loved one.\n\nThe below is lengthy - so here's the Reader's Digest:\n**Poorly managed\n**Can't meet deadlines set by their own team\n**Can't maintain or meet their commitment\n**Can't correctly copy information from death certificate application for submission.\n**Can't follow families wishes for privacy and mourning\n**Makes excuses for every step along the way\n\n\n\n*Poor management; failure to maintain commitment:\n\nOn 8\/21, my father passed away; that same day, I met with Palm Valley who handled the cremation and death certificate services for us.  When we met with Jeremy, he asked us to complete the applications for death certificates along with providing some additional information.  Throughout the entire process, I informed them that I would be handling all matters related to my father's death, as my mother was mourning his loss.  I instructed them to call me directly for all matters for a particular reason, nonetheless.\n\nDuring the consultation on Thursday, 8\/21, we expressed that we would like to have the services the coming Monday (8\/25).  Reasonably so, they told us it was not realistic to have the cremation complete by then, but that the cremation would be complete on Monday or Tuesday.  Thus, services were slated for Friday morning.  Thursday mid-day, after not hearing from the Palm Valley folks, I called to find out when to pickup my fathers remains.  Only to find out, that they did not have them back yet.  I was told to expect a return phone call shortly, with a pick-up time for Friday morning (cutting it close, right?!).  Well, that return call didn't come, and at closing time, I decided to call them back again.  The answer I got?  \"You can pick up Friday AFTERNOON.\"  which was then corrected to be \"I mean, Friday morning\".  Stressful, aye?\n\nFriday morning, 9am, I arrived to pick up my father's remains.  Turns out, per the label on the container, HE WASN'T EVEN CREMATED UNTIL THURSDAY.  Obviously someone dropped a very, very significant, metaphoric ball.\n\n------\n\n*Death Certificate; gross errors.\n\nDuring that mess, I inquired as to the status of the death certificates, was promised that those to would be submitted on that very Monday\/Tuesday.  That turned out to be a lie.  One week past due, I decided to inquire yet again (after Labor Day).  I was told that everything was submitted and that \"due to the labor day holiday, 'the County' was backed up\" and they would be ready the following week.  \n\nThe following week, I inquired again and was told \"Oh, we called *his wife* last week and told her they were ready\".  When I reminded them about the \"only call me for any and all matters\" part of our conversations, I was told \"Oh, well the staff made a mistake\".  I was told to come pick them up anytime 9a-5pm.  At 4:10pm the following day, after a 1.5hr drive from Mesa, I arrived at Palm Valley to pickup said certificates only to find the door locked.  I called, and was told they had to close early for a \"family matter\" as they are a \"family owned business\" and was told I could come back at 9am tomorrow.  Sure, no problem - not your gas, time, or missed work, right?  Well, I complied, and arrived shortly after 9am the following day.  Much to my surprise, they had the death certificates!  Those death certificates had not one small error, but 4-5 GROSS errors.  Not even remotely close to what I put on the application.  I expressed such concerns, and asked to retrieve my application - sure enough, they can't seem to copy english from one from to another.  When I inquired about the mistakes, I was told \"the staff clearly made a mistake\"  and that it was something that Andrew had to \"talk to the staff about\". \n\nHe tried to make up for it... he said first thing Monday morning we would have the corrected certificates and his \"staff\" would call me from the County and hand deliver.  Well, by 4pm Monday (yesterday) I didn't receive his call.  I called.  The answer?  \"Oh yeah, that darn county's system is just so screwy, they aren't done doing their 'verifications'\" and that the certificates would be expected tomorrow.  He said he personally would be going to the County first thing in the morning to pick them up, and that he would call me.  Did I get a call?  No.  Do I have the certificates?  No.\n\nI will go to the County tomorrow and handle everything myself.
