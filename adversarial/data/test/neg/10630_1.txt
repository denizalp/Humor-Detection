Like many have already said, this place is just spectacular. It's like traveling back in time, except you don't have to go 88 MPH.\n\nEven though pinball is the name of the game here, I went for the arcade machines. Even though many of these games were before my time, I can still appreciate them for what they are: classic arcade games that paved the way for the video game industry to be what it is today. The machines are in tip-top shape. It's good to see that they put as much love and care into the arcade machines as much as the pinball games. Also, they have one of those \"bop the alligator heads as they come out\" games, which was a staple for me whenever I went to the Circus Circus casino as a kid. Oh, nostalgia.\n\nThey even have a popcorn dispensing machine, but I didn't try it, because I was afraid of it not being clean. That's not to say that it wasn't actually clean, but I have a weird germ-phobia for things of that nature. Oh, and they have a giant gumball machine. Cool.
