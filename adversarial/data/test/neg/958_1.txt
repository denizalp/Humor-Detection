Sashimis were not fresh and warm, yes, WARM! $14 tuna toro lacked any flavors. Sea urchins taste like chemicals, and not fresh either. Nigiri rice were warm and hard so it's probably from the day before. Steak tataki were overcooked. A good place to get cheap lunch but not for good sashimi. Service was sub par. Will never come back.
