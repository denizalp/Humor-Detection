I've heard rumors of the deliciousness of the \"Taiwanese shaved ice\" so decided to check this place out. Like any bbt place on the weekend, the wait was long, loud, and you had to almost wrestle a hostess for a number. After finally being seated, the magazine style menus fell apart on my hand. Literally. There were no staples holding them together. Sigh. \n\nWe tried the frog prince and strawberry snow ice and they were fantastic. It was new, refreshing and delicious - it was like experiencing bbt for the first time again. The bbt was good and the fried chicken wings tasty. No complaints on the food side.  If you wanna try the \"next bbt\" craze try this place out and just focus on the food... as long as you're not missing the menu pages.
