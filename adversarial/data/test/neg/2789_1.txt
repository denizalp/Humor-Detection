Who is not a fan of IKEA? The food is good for the price you pay, the chocolate cake is delicious, even for a non-chocolate fan like me. The coffee is pretty decent and a good accompaniment to the desserts. I recommend the meatballs with the tasty lingonberry sauce and gravy. I could eat the lingonberry sauce by itself. Great price on the cinnamon buns, which are really tasty and the hot dogs pretty unbeatable at 50cents per. \n\nThe furniture, well...great. It's a great place to browse with someone who's never been and I always bring friends here when they visit me. The stuff is really cheap and the quality is fair but varies. I would not recommend the down pillows and other down products. However, things like cheap glassware and kitchenware are pretty good for the price. I can't forget the $5 wok that we had at home. You can pretty much envision yourself living in IKEA.
