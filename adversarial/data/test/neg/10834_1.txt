Haven't been there in years and now I know why. I had a coupon and had about 45 min for lunch. From the time I sat down until we got our lunch was 30 minutes. It was a hamburger and a piece of fish. It's not like they were busy at all.  Now to the food..... the hamburger was all bun. A 10 dollar burger should at the very least be as good as the local fast food joint.  It wasn't.  The fish was a piece of fish and a few veggies for 12.99. No sauce, no nothing, and it was highly spiced and undercooked in the thicker sections. Outback has out lived its time.  I remember when it was a nice restaurant, now it's a glorified Dennys. No, wait, I had a nice piece of fish, 2 sides and a salad at Denny's in under 20 min for about 10 bucks.  So I guess Dennys is a glorified outback.
