This place is awesome. I was a bit skeptical at first. Once I read a couple of reviews, I decided to go in. My first visit was great. I didn't really know what I was looking for, the only thing I was sure about was my budget. I told Peter what that was and he stayed under that dollar amount. The suits came out great and they even added a \"double crotch\" lining. I had no idea that existed but it will extended the life of my suit pants. \n\nA few months later, I was in need of slack on a Saturday afternoon ASAP. I had taken the slacks I purchased here to the dry cleaners. They managed to rip a buckle and did not have them repaired and ready when I came to pick them up that Saturday. I called the store, Peter picked up and he told me to stop by. I 30 minutes to get to the store, hopefully find somethings that would fit, have it hemmed, pay and head back home to get ready. When I got there, Peter had a couple of slacks laid out ready for me to try on. I found the pair I wanted and asked if he could have them ready. He said have a seat and got them ready for me. From the time I walked into the store and out, I was out in 20 minutes or less. \n\nI have gone to big department store's like Macy's, Dillard's Nordstrom's and so on. You will not find the level of service and attention to detail at any other place like you would here. As a none believer, I highly recommend this place. You might end up writing your own review after your fist visit. It's worth every dollar.
