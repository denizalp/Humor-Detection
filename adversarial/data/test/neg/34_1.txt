V Picasso has an okay wine selection, but I was honestly expecting more interesting choices given that this place touts itself as a wine bar. The menu is not particularly vegetarian friendly, so keep that in mind if you're a more herbivorous diner. Servers here often seem a little uncomfortable, but never rude. The patio is lovely for drinks and hors d'oeuvres on warm summer evenings. Worth a shot if you're looking for a semi-fancy place to hang out.
