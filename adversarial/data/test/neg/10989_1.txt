My first review was a bridesmaid, and now I'm doing my review as a bride! \nI just LOVE LOVE LOVE this store! When I was a bridesmaid, I knew that I would not waste my time and go anywhere else when looking for my wedding dress and I stuck to that. When I set up my appointment, I had made it with Lorie, as she was the one I mentioned in the previous review. When I got there, Alice informed me that Lorie was out of town and I thought \"no worries!\" I was so blessed by Alice! She was such a sweetheart and so easy going! I had a big party with me and they all loved her. Alice was actually the one that picked out the dress for me to try on that is now my wedding dress! It's so beautiful and just what I had in mind! My total came out to be under $900. Praise the Lord! Definitely check this place out for your dress, ladies! =)
