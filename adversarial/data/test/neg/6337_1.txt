Thank you to Bookmans for helping me sell my Cd's and movies they were nothing but helpful and this location has a lot of great video games and movies as well as anything you can think of for entertainment. They do store credit or cash (I suggest store credit) and you can purchase really awesome products. The managers are friendly and the cashiers are awesome. Thank you again and I will be a repeat customer. Ethan is super awesome and gave good suggestions. He's an event coordinator. Ask for Jennifer she is super awesome and chill
