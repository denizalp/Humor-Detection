Favorite nail salon in Cleveland! Everyone is so nice and it's so clean! I have been happy with my gels and with every pedicure every time. The polish\/gel color selection is endless! \nI have seen Tina a few times and, last time, Linden. She did an excellent job. I am confident that you would be happy with whomever you see at River Nails!!
