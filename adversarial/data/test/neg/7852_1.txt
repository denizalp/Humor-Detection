If I could give this company negative stars I would. I rented through Southwest Airlines and was quoted a rate of $41\/day. I saw after all the taxes and fees that it would come out to $301 which was just ridiculous but I swallowed it. Got home and realized I was charged $408.73. When I checked my receipt, it said I was charged $107.96 for a loss damage waiver! I told them I wanted to WAIVE the loss or damage since I had my own insurance! I called to dispute the charge and they gave me a case number and said someone would get back with me in 72 business hours...yeah right! The car I received was dirty and disgusting, something I would never normally drive but it was only for 4 days so I sucked it up. NEVER AGAIN!!! For this price I could have gone to AVIS! $102\/day is way more than they would have charged for a full sized car, clean car with good customer service. Do not waste your time, money or aggravation on this useless, worthless company. They are rip offs and scam artists. Shame on you, Southwest for endorsing these thieves!
