Everyone needs a good plumber. And Safeway plumbing is about the best you can get. I had an emergency plumbing issue on a holiday weekend and Clint came out the same day to fix it plus fixed something else as well.  He was knowledgeable and professional. He's now been added to my phone contacts. If u are looking for a trustworthy plumber, Safeway plumbing is who u want to call.
