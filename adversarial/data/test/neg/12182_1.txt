I have been to several salons and this one is by far my favorite. I have been trying to grow my hair out for several years but it has been severely damaged from other stylists. Cassondra has really listened to what I want and has been helping me strengthen my hair without cutting it all off (which I'm really happy about) I love the way she cuts it. She uses a technique that doesn't take off length. Cassandra also colors my hair, I get foils and then she does a root shadow... I used to dislike the root shadow because I didn't understand it, but now I notice that my hair looks so much better when it grows as if I have an ombr√©. This allows me to go longer if I need to in between coloring. I Love Cassondra! Go see her!
