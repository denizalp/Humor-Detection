Benicio bravo!! I call it the corn bread pulled pork yummy goodness that makes my morning better stuff!! \nThe pastries are amazing, some mornings I can't decide on pork yuminess or one of those so I don't, I have both!!\nIt's a bit pricey when you throw in a coffee but it's totally worth it. \nEasily one of the best breakfasts in town!!
