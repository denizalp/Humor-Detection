My new favorite coffee shop!  I love the feeling you get when you walk in here...like to should plan to stay for a few hours and relax while having a fancy coffee\/tea, and the pastries they have are delicious! Great prices. Just watching them make the drinks feels like an adventure...I love it!  The design in my coffee made me smile :)  Well worth going!
