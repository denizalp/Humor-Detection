There are a million housekeeping services here in Vegas, and I have been using Rhino's Maid for over 2 years now every 2 weeks. Here's what I love:\n\nThey are pretty accommodating, My schedule is weird and changes often and they are good about making adjustments if I need it.\n\nThey do a good job. Something I really like is that they won't leave until you tell them everything looks good- and they manage to do my entire 3,000 sq foot house in 2.5 hours with two people. My house sparkles when they leave and I LOVE that.\n\nOnce you find a specific housekeeper you like, you can request that person again- which I often do. They have a few superstars (whom I refuse to tell others about because I want them all to myself!)\n\nPrices are good! They do offer group on deals occasionally- especially their deep cleans which are totally worth it. I like to get a deep clean 1-2 times a year where they totally empty out and scrub my fridge, do windows inside and out, etc. They are open to negotiations, especially if you want regular service. Just always deal with the managers in the office or over the phone- not the housekeepers.\n\nThey are nice, friendly, polite, quiet, and they just get in and do their job and get out! No drama.\n\nSome of their weaknesses: usually only one of the two house keepers will speak English. Not a huge deal, but sometimes a problem.\n\nScheduling with the office can get screwy- there have been a few times where I have had to call a couple times to tell them the correct time. They have been notified about this and promised to make improvements.\n\nThey don't move furniture- normally this isn't a huge deal but I do have big open spaces with tile where I wish the chairs would get moved and mopped underneath. Again, some specific people will do this extra stuff for you- but they aren't required.\n\nNOTES: They don't do laundry or dishes- if you have a few dishes in the sink and they have time they will wash my hand or load your dishwasher, but ask nicely! \n\nOverall I am pleased and will continue this service as long as possible!
