If I could give this service zero stars I would. Got off an 11:30pm flight to wait two hours in line. I should of noticed how horrible of a situation I was walking into when there were more people waiting out of line and sitting on the ground waiting. Poor service to say at the least. They have two workers at the desk. There are about 30+ people in line. It's taking an average of 10 minutes per a customer if not longer for others. The workers here seem to not be enjoying themselves working. Avoid this place at all cost unless you have an endless amount of time to waste. After all of this we finally were helped and thought we were through. We proceeded to find the numeric alphabetical lot our car was supposed to be in and find that the car we asked for was replaced by a truck that we repeatedly asked not to have due to lack of vehicles being offered. From A to Z this rental car provider is absolutely the worst.
