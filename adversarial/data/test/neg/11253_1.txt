Very nice place. As their name implies they have bfast open till close. But they also have lunch too! Burgers, wraps, sandwiches etc. we had a late breakfast around 12:30. I had chocolate chip pancakes, she had Irish Benedict. Both were very good. Fast, friendly service. Food tasted fresh and was served hot. I had a glass of milk, and it was huge and ice cold. Just the way I like it! Will go back.
