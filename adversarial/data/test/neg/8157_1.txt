This isn't a criticism on the Lowe's location or staff itself (their appliance guy Garry is very kind and informative) but more of a warning to those looking to have furniture or appliances delivered. \n\nMy partner and I went in and bought an LG Washer since our old apartment style washer\/dryer finally broke. We paid $80 for it to be delivered 2 days after purchase on a Thursday morning and were told that in the price it included taking away our old unit. The deliveries are contracted out by Lowe's and not done by Lowe's themselves (I believe the company is XPO). So the night before I get a call from the delivery company saying they would arrive sometime between 9 am - 11 am (you have no control over the time, they just let you know the time frame). So Thursday comes and I get up around 8 am and hop into the shower. As I am literally showering  the phone goes off around 8:20 and it's the delivery guys saying they would be there in 3 minutes, NOT at all within the time window I was told the night before. So I rush around and answer the door and escort one of them to where the unit will be installed and show the old one that we disconnected for them to take away. The guy looks at the unit for a moment then looks at me and says he can't take the old one. He says they expected to take a washing machine away since we only bought a washing machine. I counter by saying it is a washing machine and only one unit and still a 1 for 1 since it isn't like we were asking them to take 2 units away. He then makes the excuse that he is worried about damaging the walls or floor and doesn't think it's a good idea to move it (isn't there always this risk when moving any big appliance?). It was then that the back and forth phone games started between the delivery company and Lowe's about whether or not they would take the old unit. It ended up both Lowe's and I managed to convince the company to take the old unit and the minute they took it out they left without a word to me and even forgot a drill on top of my new washer. \n\nThis delivery company came off very unprofessional and even cemented my opinions of them when they called and said WE had to drop off the drill THEY forgot at the Lowe's location. They couldn't even bother the drive back to pick it up. Hope this is a good warning to anyone hoping to do delivery with Lowe's as the company they contract doesn't care at all about their job and is obviously just cashing in a paycheck.
