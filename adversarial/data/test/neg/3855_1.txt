Red umbrellas hanging from the ceiling. Ginger lemonade with fresh pieces of cut ginger floating inside. Perfectly organized tables and exquisite attention to detail in your meal. \nThis is just the start of the experience you will have  at Noodles Ranch. It's the type of place you'd drive right by and not even notice, but once you make it inside, you'll be ever grateful you did. I love Vietnamese food and a very rare thing happened to me when I ate here, I forgot I was in the States. From the lemongrass chicken to the fresh crunchy egg rolls, everything about my visit was great and I can't wait to come back!
