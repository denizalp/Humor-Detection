Coriander is hit or miss for me. I actually think they might have different chefs, or they have changed chefs a few times, because I've ordered Chicken Vindaloo three times and received thee very different dishes. I do enjoy their appetizers, like the samosas and pakoras. Their biryani and dosas are typically good too.
