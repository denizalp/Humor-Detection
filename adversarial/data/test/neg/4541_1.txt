Not having a relationship with a plumbing business I googled \"drain clogged\" when I experienced a kitchen sink problem and 4 business popped up to the top.  I knew these were paid ads but all touted a special price.  I logged onto the BBB site.  The first one was known to the BBB but not a member.  The second was rated A-.  The third, Penguin was rated A+ so I called them and mentioned the $49 offer.  The lady said yes, that is true and if they can't do it for that much I would be informed in advance with the right to walk away.\n\nI agreed and was told I'd be contacted when the plumber was en route.  It took only about 20 minutes to receive in my email inbox the name and picture of the technician assigned.  About 15 minutes later Larry M called to say he was on his way.  So far so good.\n\nUpon his arrival he was very personable and friendly.  He  performed an assessment of my situation to determine the best way to solve my conundrum.  \n\nHe never seemed in a hurry to finish and leave and that confirmed for me he would do a quality job.  He explained everything as he worked.  We talked about the pitfalls of old plumbing and ways to identify issues and other services which were available.   He didn't pressure to buy these additional services and that means a lot to me.\n\nWhen the job was done my charge was......  $49.  I am very pleased with my initial contact with this company and Larry.  I am seriously considering the additional services he suggested to know for certain the condition of my 48 year old drains and plumbing.  \n\nEven if I don't move forward with those other services right away,  I now know for certain who I will call the next time I need a plumber and have put Penguin's number and Larry's name in my contacts for quick retrieval.\n\nOverall an excellent first experience with this company.
