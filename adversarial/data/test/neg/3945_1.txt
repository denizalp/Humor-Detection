I had a walk in appointment on a Saturday and I was probably in and out in less than 8 minutes which I loved. The studio was super cute and the owner took the time to explain problem areas with my brows and we developed a plan to tackle the areas that needed to grow. The price is a little steep but you pay for what you get so no issue with me. \n\nShe does have a punch card loyalty system which is great--I will definitely be coming back!
