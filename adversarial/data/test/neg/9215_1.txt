Looking for a relaxing, shaded excursion when it is too hot to be out in the sun? Drive on up to UNCC's campus and stroll around the Botanical Gardens and wander around the greenhouse rooms.\n\nEasy parking in a garage and plenty of maps at the kiosks near the gated entrances, there are some benches scattered throughout. The greenhouse has rooms with plants in different climates and the tropical room was my favorite with citrus, chocolate, and coffee plants.\n\nWhat more do you need to know? Outdoor and indoor gardens, for free! #charlottesgotalot
