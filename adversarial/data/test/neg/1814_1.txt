Sorry Cleveland but this joint just doesn't hang with other similar places in the country.  Someone mentioned in a review about Condado in Columbus and said Barrio is better. I wholly disagree. Our barrio tacos were mediocre. The margaritas were mediocre (house marg is wayyyy too sweet and the 'skinny version' is super bland).  Service was fine.  I'm sure for a late night drinking adventure, this place is great. But sans buzz, this is just ok.
