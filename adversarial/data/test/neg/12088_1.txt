I recently purchased\/took home my beautiful david tutera gown from brilliant bridal! The gown is unbelievable beautiful and it is thanks to my stylist Kendra, that I found it! Kendra was amazing helping me try on several gowns, and once I decided on the david tutera, she helped answer all of my questions. Thank you brilliant bridal for a great experience!
