Recently went here for lunch with a client as the other place I tried does not open for lunch.  The quality was excellent, the service was great and while the place was not big, it was big enough and my party of three was comfortable.  The biggest thing though, was the selection!!  I have never seen so many different rolls as a sushi restaurant.  I had the spicy salad which was great and the flaming tree which was unlike anything I have ever had before and delicious.  Can't wait to go back and try more.
