First thing I would say is definitely make a reservation if you plan to go here for dinner on a Saturday night. We got there at 7, we're told it would be a 45 min wait.....and then waited over an hour. We almost left. But, redeeming qualities: the manager comped some appetizers (and would have for drinks too but we were not drinking that night); the server was really friendly; the food was really good. So was it worth the wait? Eh. I would be willing to try it again for brunch.
