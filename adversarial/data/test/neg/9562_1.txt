This has been my favorite breakfast place for maybe 2 years? I live the French toast a lot of my friends get the huervos rancheros. \n\nFor lunch my favorite is the chicken-Roma sand which. If you ask what the most popular lunch is they're likely to say this. Everything here is great though- and healthy!\n\nThe smoothies are bomb too!
