Super disappointed! Saw all the great reviews so we finally decided to check it out.  Atmosphere is great.  Managers check tables often and are very friendly.  This was a plus...HOWEVER...our server was very slow and totally lacking energy.  She was so disengaged that our table wondered why she even showed up to work.  Then our food came out.  I ordered the smoked salmon bruschetta.  It was ok, but for the price, too disappointing.  It looked like canned tuna.  Actually, I'm fairly certain they used canned salmon.  I expected fresh slices of smoked salmon, not overpriced canned food.  We paid $50 for TWO appetizers and a couple drinks each.  Too much for two people for happy hr!!!  Will not go back.
