This seems to be a nice restaurant but I prefer other organic cafes. I prefer to see my smoothie being made.  My smoothie here tasted like moldy berries! I want to see gloves used!  Clean utensils etc.   The blenders should have sound barriers.  I can get past the poor service and high prices, guy and girl with attitude but at least give me a quality drink.  Because I can't see if produce is fresh and washed I won't return.
