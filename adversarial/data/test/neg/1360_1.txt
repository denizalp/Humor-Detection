I was surprised that we were able to get a patio table on a Hot sunny Friday afternoon with no wait. Now I understand why. Slow service, bored staff, mediocre food and an over all unpleasant experience. It's burgers and salad...! How do you mess that up? Apparently you can. You're better off dining on street food.
