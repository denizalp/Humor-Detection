The food was decent. I had the wings and baby back ribs. No one at the table I ate with really had any complaints about the food, just that it was okay. \n\nOur server Carla was funny and entertaining. She was crude and rude in the right way for the theme of this restaurant. However, as good as she was about playing her role, she was slow to take our order and get us our drinks and refills. Eat at this place for the experience because the food isn't anything to rave about.
