I got a spray tan done by Kelly, and I am obsessed. She was professional and very sweet. She helped me feel comfortable and was SO nice to my kids. She had all her supplies set up within minutes and the actual spray tan only took about 10 minutes for two coats. There is absolutely no smell, and I felt even better that it's all organic. The color is very natural and beautiful. I feel like a million bucks :). I will definitely be getting another spray tan by Kelly.
