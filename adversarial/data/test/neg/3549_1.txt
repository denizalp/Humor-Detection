Excellent therapist!  Very kind, makes every effort to assess your response to the pressure that is used the modalities that best meet his clients needs. He provides a clean, quiet and healing atmosphere and is very nonjudgmental of his clients.  He is warm and welcoming and I say enough positive things about him. I highly recommend him above all others.
