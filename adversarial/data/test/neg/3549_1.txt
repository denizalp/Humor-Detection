Takee-Outee...they say...i guess that's how asians say take out?! \n\nAside from the half racism associated with this place, the food, service, and theme were 5 yelp stars worthy. \n\nI had my reservations about coming to this place, but my friend suggested we come here during our Glendale trip (yes we took a road trip from Glendale to Glendale...how cool are we?!) because he had heard about this place from Diners Driveins and Dives show on Food Network. I like that show and I expected good food with large quantities...because that's what I think of when I remember that show. So we got into the place which is a very not pretentious looking restaurant. It had a decent sized eating area with cafeteria style tables and chairs and a large ordering area with pictures and two different counters so that you can sample the different dishes. A lot of Pandas in some kind of guerilla gear with bullets, grenade guns, and everything. \n\nWhen I saw the menu, I already knew what I wanted...something super Chinese food like, and something super Mexican food like...I got their Jade Red Chicken and Carnitas. I got them plain, but you could put any of their items into a quesadilla or a burrito. Because we went with a large group, I got to try their Emerald Chicken, Jerk Chicken, and their Machaca in different burrito and quesadilla styles. \n\nPlaced my order and got my food with pork fried rice and beans inside some huge pie tin...i guess these hold about 2 pounds worth of food. Everything was really good...Jade Red Chicken...i think i could eat this every time I make my way out to the greater Phoenix area...it is like Panda's orange chicken, but less greasy feeling and doesn't have a chicken flavor...i guess the comparison comes with the texture. The carnitas was just like I would expect at any Mexican food places in the greater LA area, which was good. Moist, chewy, all that. the Emerald chicken was also good because of its salty thing that comes with it. OH! and another great thing about this place...I got to wash down the meal with fountain Diet Dr. Pepper!!!!! \n\nHard to find that here in LA, just as surprising as when I went to a place with Coke Zero or Orange Bang offered as fountain drinks...ended up taking a picture with their mascot....cuz i'm a panda too.
