Well we walked in the hostess was very pleasant seated us and wished my husband Happy Birthday 4vtimes how nice, our favorite waitress  , Rosa was their to greet us.   We haven't seen her in quite awhile, still the same friendly person,  she catered to us over the top service, food was excellent as usual, my husband had the Etoufee fish, I had lemon butter snapper, my son had the filet since it was my husband's bday she served him a special bday Flan, very nice then I had the bananas foster, out of this world.   Just want to say that Rosa is the best always goes above and beyond, we want to say with much gratitude THANK YOU ROSA!
