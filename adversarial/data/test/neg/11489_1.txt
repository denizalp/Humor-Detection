I just went a got two crispy chicken salads and they were fantastic! I swear it to be true that everything I have ever bought from PDQ is top notch! The staff is always friendly and courteous. And the unlimited sauce! I have tried them all and they are all so good I can't pick a favorite. I must say, I have never been more satisfied with a restaurant. I can usually find something I'm not fond of in a restaurant, but not at PDQ. I have told everyone I know to give PDQ a try. I also gave them my own personal guarantee  \"if you don't like it I'll buy it.\" The upper management are upstanding and people of their word. Outstanding product by people who care and it shows! I can't say enough great things about PDQ.
