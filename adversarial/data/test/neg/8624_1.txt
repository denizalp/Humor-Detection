i think that double take makes you do a minor double take, like perhaps a one and a quarter take.  it is its size and easy to navigate space that affords that take.  to put it another way, it treats itself as a mini department store.  it just happens to have used cheap clothing that might not be at the height of fashion these days.\n\nim sure the only criteria for the person who picks the clothes, accessories and objects of (minor) desire are that they are functional, as in not ripped or broken.  this would be in contrast to other used clothing stores that perhaps take more care to feature certain things more than others, to try build a collection of styles of clothing.  at double take you get what comes there.\n\nthe stock includes half a warehouse for womens clothes and shoes.  the other half includes childrens and mens clothes, books, stereo equipment, boring trinkets, jewellery, perfumes and i think dvds.  books cost as much as 1 dollar each.  the prices are extremely fair and if love the browse then this will be easy to travel and because of the large stock its likely youll find something to your liking.
