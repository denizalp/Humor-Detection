Someone else ordered it for me. They got me the brisket chopped, a sausage, some beans, and potato salad. I don't like potato salad and wish she had ordered me the grits instead but I won't hold that against Little Miss BBQ. What can I say? This is probably one of the best BBQ joints in Arizona. The brisket is the best I have ever had in this state!
