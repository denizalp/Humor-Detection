Stopped here to change my 6 month old daughters diaper. Usually McDs have really decent baby changing stations.\n\nFirst of all you can feel the mediocrity and the ambiance but we ignored it \nmy husband proceeded to the mens room to change our daughter where he knocked on the only stall to see if a changing station was available when someone responds with a sketchy HELLO so naturally my husband excused himself and started to walk out to wait in the lobby for me when out of nowhere the stranger in the stall responds with \"you can come in if you want\" (in a calm voice) by this point my husband is beyond confused and continues walking out.\n\nMeanwhile I'm waiting in the female restroom for the occupied stall since the first stall has no toilet paper but turns out the woman in the current stall is also in need of toilet paper and doesn't realize I'm in the restroom so doesn't ask for my help not till another woman comes in and the poor girl in the stall finally speaks out \"hello can someone please bring me tissues\" at this point I'm thinking great I've been waiting on a useless stall but like a Good Samaritan not me the other girl that just walked in runs out to find and employee to replace the toilet paper at this point my hubby overheard and thought is that my wife stuck in a stall so he hands the girl baby wipes like a freakin savior! And I use the vacant stall quickly and leave.\n\nAt this point back in the lobby with my husband which he told me the stall was occupied so he hasn't been able to change our daughter, at this point we're both waiting for any huge stalls to become vacant just so we can see if a baby changing station is available and let me remind you there was less then 10 customers in this restaurant \n\nWhen we notice the a man casually walk out of the men's restroom after 15mins eating a cheeseburger which my hubby then looks at me baffled and says that man invited me into the stall *winced \n\nAt this point we decided to leave and change our daughter in the car which was a much more pleasant experience to this day we have no idea if the toilet paper was ever replaced or if any of the restrooms have baby changing stations.
