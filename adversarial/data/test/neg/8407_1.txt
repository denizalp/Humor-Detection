DON'T EVER GO HERE!!!! I just walked in because I have glass in my foot and they told me they couldn't help me because a doctor wasn't in! I laughed and said so if I'm sick I can't come here. There response was \"no the doctor isn't here he might be in around 10\" she called the doctor and he said well is it a big cut idk I might be in in 20 minutes\" - WORST CARE EVER!!! Don't waste you're time!!
