I love this Shoppers. I have been going there for years now, and it is my local pharmacy as well.  For years, the pharmacy was run by a man named Marty, he has since left but it is still great. \nThis shoppers is no doubt a great one stop shop for all those that live in Mission.  It has everything you would expect from a SDM but it also has:\n\nA Canada Post Outlet\nFrozen Foods\nCanned foods and Dry Goods\nHealthy & Organic Food Section\nPet Food\nCleaning Products\nDigital Cameras\n\nAs you can see, it has just about everything you could need.  I was there tonight picking up a prescription and needed to pick up some coffee cream, it was on sale for 99cents marked down from $349  This wasnt stale dated, it was just a sale. As I looked around, I saw more and more items that were significantly marked down. So there are some good mark downs and deals to be had.  Make sure you get a shoppers optimum card  ( loyalty program), the points add up. \nIn addition to street parking all around they have free parking behind the bldg. Entrance is off 25th St. \n\nThis shoppers is excellent and a great addition to a great neighbourhood.
