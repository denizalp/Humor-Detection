Had lunch here on a nice Saturday afternoon- we sat at a table by the open air windows- kind of like sitting on a sidewalk patio. I dint have a beer for lunch but they looked great- they make them upstairs in the back. I passed the brewing tanks on the long upstairs and downstairs trek to the bathroom (washrooms as they call them in Toronto). You follow yellow dots on the floor- you would seriously get lost without those dots!  Wifey had the chicken avocado sandwich on ciabatta roll. Very good she said. I had the meat lovers burger- smoked meat (kind of like pastrami) on top of a burger- with sauerkraut and horseradish mayo.  Excellent- but note that they cook them medium well. The waitress looked at me like I was foreign ( I am!) when I asked for it to be cooked medium. Good food and nice ambience. Plenty of space- 2 big rooms on main floor and a big area upstairs. Close to Yonge Dundas Square. Check it out!
