Absolutely my new favorite Phoenix dining choice.  Small, chef owned restaurant serving fresh, flavor packed food.  The Trio appetizer is a great starter with Fundido, Guacamole and salsa with chips.  The beef birria and the barbacoa green chili enchilada were so good I wanted to lick the plate.  The chef\/owner came to check on our meal and spent several minutes chatting.  If you are even remotely close to Phoenix stop in for a great meal.  You won't regret it.
