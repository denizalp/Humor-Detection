When my friend from grade school decided to go to a nine week certification away from his family, the least I could do was go to one class... one unlimited classes for 14 days promotion later, and I was hooked, am hooked.\nI love the Bikram program, but the service at this studio is unparalleled! In addition to individual manners and politeness and genuine kindness, the entire staff is well versed in how to talk to , treat and deal with customers and potential customers. Usually at studios or Jim's, the recommendations are for particular people and or particular classes... Honest to god, at Bikram yoga Pittsburgh, every class is a work of art.\n\nPS the owner instructs, is multi-national champion, students compete and some have become champions and then there's me, one of the slowest in the class and ... It doesn't matter : I, and others like me, are in the same class with the elite and it always works.\nI I was never one for group class in anything... I'm sold on this practice , at this studio, indefinitely
