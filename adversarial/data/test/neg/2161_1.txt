The one thing Las Vegas needs are fried chicken restaurants-specifically, elevated Southern cuisine, and Yardbird hits the mark on both accounts with flavorful, heart-y dishes. \n\nI returned after a few messages back and forth with the owner of the restaurant.  Not expecting anything except a better experience, we (my husband and I) booked a reservation for Saturday's supper hour (they call it \"supper\" on the menu listing and not \"dinner\", holding true to that southern charm).  I didn't say anything at the hostess counter except for my name and time slot.  The manager sat us at a table near the kitchen were I could peer around the corner to take a decent look at the setup.  Our server was fantastic and made sure we were never without the entire evening.\n\nThe kitchen is open to the public eye, showing off a pristine work area, bustling cooks, and chefs.  Even their coffee area located behind a swing door could be viewed when servers flipped by, showing a very neat and tight space.  Nothing stayed at the window for more than 60 seconds, if even that.  All the servers delivered plates with thumbs underneath the plate rather than on top of it.  No wrapper from the fork and knife were left on any tables, nor were water glasses even half empty.  Overall, the kitchen and service are impeccable.\n\nThe food started to come out, first course-our french fries with bacon salt and a buttermilk dipping sauce that had even more bacon on top.  I love that they recycle old menus as the paper on their side dish plates.  It adds to that home feel.  The fries were crispy, airy, and the bacon salt adds a unique flavor to the potatoes.  When dipped in the buttermilk and eaten with the bacon crumble and salt, it's truly heaven.  Their bacon salt is smoky and captures that bacon flavor so well.  It took less than 2 minutes to down this pan of fries.\n\n\nOur food arrived no less than five minutes later.  This time, instead of watermelon and a waffle, I opted for the 2 things I love-biscuits and chicken.  The famous Lewellyn's fried chicken sat on the left, while the biscuits were cut in half, topped with pepper jelly, and a piece of boneless fried chicken right in there.  It's served with housemade pickles and onions.  Trust me-adding both of those into this biscuit makes this sandwich amazing.  The contrast of sweet and spicy jelly, the salty, chicken goodness, then the bite of pickles and pickled onions is absolute heaven.  It's incredibly simple, incredibly easy you may think, but those biscuits are on another level.  The chicken here takes a brine swim for a few days-and not in buttermilk.  They're then coated and pressure fried to perfection.  The chicken is very juicy, extremely tender, flavorful, and that coating packs a punch.  I recall saying I would not pay the $26 for their chicken.  I take it back.  I'm definitely going back for more.  Plates emptied, we had to order dessert, and instead of the oreos we ate last time, we opted for the bacon butterscotch cake with pecan filling, bourbon ice cream, and butterscotch sauce.\n\n\nLet me start by saying that the cake is Vegas-sized, and every table around us noticed this giant being brought to the table.  Heads turned-that's how big this mammoth mountain of cake goodness is.  I dove right in, letting each layer fall from the tip, gathering it all up with butterscotch sauce and a dollop of bourbon ice cream.  It's served cold with this crazy icing and pecan filling that isn't too sweet, then that salty, sweet, butterscotch goodness mixed with the bourbon ice cream is one of the perfect sweet bites I had in a long time.  Don't worry-the cake isn't filled with bits of bacon, so don't be afraid of this.  Love it.  Love it so much to set a calendar reminder to eat one every Saturday morning at brunch.\n\nI said back in March \"the food was good but I am still searching for my Perfect Fried Chicken in Las Vegas\".  After a redo meal at Yardbird, I have to say that this place is the restaurant for Southern cuisine and has one of the best fried chicken dishes in Vegas.  It's not just the food that impresses-it's the Southern hospitality.  Yardbird is more than just a restaurant-it's an experience.
