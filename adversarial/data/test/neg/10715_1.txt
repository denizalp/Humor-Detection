Now this is what you call a Coffee shop! okay fine \"Espresso Bar\" whatever. Really really good coffee (try the Aroma Mocha coffee mmm..) and I'm not a big chocolate fan but the piece that comes with the drinks just tasted so good!\n\nMy only complaint is they need to clear tables much more often given how busy the place is; there's trays and empty cups all over the place. But who cares, Aroma is exactly what I look for in a fancy coffee place and it's not even that expensive.\n\nOverall a great place to sit down with someone and have a chat over some coffee and free Wifi.
