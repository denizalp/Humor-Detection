The place looks beautiful at first glance, but don't look too close! This place is in need of some TLC and perhaps a little bleach and elbow grease. It is not kept up and the kitchen is extremely dirty! There were dead flies everywhere in the kitchen and it looked as if it hadn't been cleaned in months! It's not a place you want to serve food from. The refrigerator was packed with old, moldy food. Who knows how long it was left there. I don't think the floor has ever seen a mop. Completely disgusting. If this place had been a restaurant it would have been shut down. The bathrooms were not clean either. If this is how they take care of the venue, how are they going to take care of the people they rent it to?
