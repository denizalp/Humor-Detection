Wonderful experience with BREL, specifically Lisa Bednarski!\nAs a first time home buyer the experience can be a little daunting, especially in a city like Toronto. Lisa was helpful, answered questions and would follow up with helpful articles and links about different topics. \nI was buying a condo while living in a different city, and Lisa would organize weekend condo shopping trips for when I came into town, and was more than willing to go look at things for me and do FaceTime tours.  She was always available, and was very responsive to emails and phone calls. She was very organized and helpful.\nVery positive experience, I highly recommend the team and Lisa!
