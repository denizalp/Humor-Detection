I love this laundry.  I am not a resident of Toronto but visit fairly frequently.  Always like it each time I used this place.  It's clean and the machines are efficient and economical.  The wonderful woman who takes care of the place is lovely and very helpful.  Was delighted to see on my return they have a whole batch of new machines including new triple sized ones which are perfect for large items of bedding etc.  Would recommend without hesitation.
