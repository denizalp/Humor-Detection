This is one of my all time favorite buffets due to the fact that every time we go to the Bellagio they always have something new.  Some of the past favorites that include Beef Tartare which was extremely flavorful, Chicken Wellington cooked to perfection, and Bellagio makes the best Miso soup that I have ever had in my life.  It is so light airy but packs a mean flavor profile its salty, sweet and earthy all at the same time.  Desserts, Bellagio always has a nice variety of desserts to me.  My hubby tried the flan and loved the undertones pineapple throughout it, not overly sweet and baked to perfection.  I had a chocolate dome white a dark chocolate drop on the top and a white chocolate candy.  The chocolate dome is for chocolate lovers only, it is dark chocolate and extremely rich.  As you eat it you can taste different chocolates, dark, semi-sweet, possibly milk chocolate, it works though.  Their cheesecake is always so good, creamy, sweet and this time it had a raspberry reduction in it (made with real fruit).  So if you want to try something new, try the Buffet at Bellagio and you will be pleasantly surprised because you never know what they'll be serving
