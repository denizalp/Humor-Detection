Definitely go to Chica when you are in Vegas or just go to Vegas so you can experience Chica. We tried almost every dish on the menu and loved them all especially the Meyer Lemon Chicken with Chimichurri and the Empanadas. There was one vegan and one gluten free guest with our group and they had wonderful dishes for them on the menu too. Try the Some like it hot Margarita with the Duke tequila and the espresso martini with dessert. If you are lucky Chef Lorena Garcia may come by your table and say hello. The ambiance and service were all 5 stars as well. Cannot wait to go back!
