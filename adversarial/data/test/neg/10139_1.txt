It had been a few years since I visited this B&BW location. When I stopped in this past weekend for some shopping, I was disgusted with how dirty the store was. The storefront was lined with dust, the ceilings were dirt black, and overall felt like the store needs a makeover. Lots of wear and tear on everything. Unfortunately, the messiness didnt offer a pleasant shopping experience.
