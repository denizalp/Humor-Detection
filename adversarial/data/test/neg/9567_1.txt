This is for the vans off the wall store. \nGood products but the workers are a bad joke. I bought a skateboard there that came out to 150$. They offered to put it together. I went on a walk around the mall and when I came back the grip tape was put on, with chunks taken out the side.  Then she couldn't connect the trucks to the board. After finally connecting them they went to put the wheels on. The wheels where crooked either the bearings or the wheel were messed up.  So after all that I just got my money back and left.
