Finally had a chance to get to Perfect Pear! It was lunch time, so as usually pretty busy. Took a few minutes to have the hostess greet us and then ask if we wanted to sit at the bar, since there were no tables, so we sat at the bar.\n\nWe were asked for our drinks right away and got then really quick. Our order was taken and food came out in a timely manner. I got the southwest philly with the seasonal side. It wasn't bad, it had great flavor, meat was cooked perfectly and the sauce was great! \n\nMy only issue was that it seemed disorganized. The person that took our drink order, was not the same as the person who took our food order, and then we had someone else ask if we wanted our check and brought it out. Everyone seemed to be working in so many different stations and not on particular ones. The restaurant needs to do get a little more organized to be more efficient. \n\nOverall, a nice first visit.
