Don't bother! Not only was the food not so good, but also the service was TERRIBLE. The inside is a little shabby, my seat was moving every time I adjusted (bench seat in a booth), and the service took forever. We ordered nachos that took about 20 minutes to come out and were cooled down a lot by the time we received them. We also had to ask the host to get our server just to pay the bill. If the food or the service is amazing then I am ok, but it was neither :(.
