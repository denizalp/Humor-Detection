This restaurant was such a surprise! Don't expect classic Italian pizzas. These pizzas are chunky, full of fake meat and heavy! Nonetheless, so delicious! If you're hungry, are vegan and need fast food pizza, that's your place! My boyfriend enjoyed the pizzas a little more than me. 2-3 slices are more than enough. Their bigmac(?) pizza was phenomenal. Their donuts not our favourites (dough tasted like pizza dough and we wished it was softer). We gladly tried their selection of beers from microbreweries (they were very good!). Oh and their fried jalape√±o with cheese....Just try it, don't question it!
