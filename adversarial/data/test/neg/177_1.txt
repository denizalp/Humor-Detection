This restaraunt across the street from the Boulder City Hotel on Arizona Street deserves more attention than it gets.  The Zaloof roasted eggplant appetizer with warm pita bread was great.  The salad could been more Mediterranean like.  Crispy romaine lettuce and a slice of tomato and cucumber\n\nThe fresh grilled salmon was excellent.  A little bit over cooked but great flavor.\n\nNice dinner musicl\n\nPlan to go next door for a locally brewed beer
