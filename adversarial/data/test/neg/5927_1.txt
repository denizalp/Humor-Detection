Yes, as I sat and waited for our name to be called and went through all the yelp reviews, they are 100% correct. They truly act like they don't even want your business. \n\nOk, you guys run one of the best deals for eye glasses 2\/$69.\nGuess what? You're going to get a ton of customers. \nMaybe you need to rotate your staff every 2 hours, medicate them, let them take naps......something. \n\nI was treated like I was the 1000th customer that day, and the staff was about to crack. From the front counter people to the irritated little hispanic woman that took us in the first room (tia?) \nShe has NO business dealing with any customer, she talked to my son like she was 2 seconds from losing her sh*t. Even I was shocked. \n\nThe eye Dr. is like 80 years old, also acted irritated with my son and very rushed with his exam. No bedside manor at all. I hope that his glasses are correct. \n\nThe ONLY positive spin on this staff was the young blonde that put all the info in the computer and did the adjustments on his frames. She was the only one that spoke to us like she didn't want to kill us. \n\nAgain yes, it is the best deal for eye glasses if you can get through the completely horrible staff and the constant up selling.
