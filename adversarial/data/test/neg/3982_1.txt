We came here for lunch on a Monday. The place was empty, but the staff was friendly and attentive. We had chicken and beef hibachi. The food was very reasonably priced and came out quickly. Both the chicken and the beef bowls are delicious, and very filling. The veggies are one big chunk of each carrot, broccoli, and zucchini. We will definitely return.
