Let me first start off by saying I used to come here 1 to 2 times a week.  It was always my regular spot after softball for some wings and drinks.  It has been getting worse and worse and after this last time, I am not going back and will find a new wing place for after softball nights.\n\nIn addition to some pretty mediocre service, this place has some real crappy policies.  Some are just irritating like the fact if you order ranch with your wings, they are going to bring you 1 tiny cup.  Yep, 20 wings...1 tiny cup.  Feel free to ask for more and it will be cup by cup until you have enough.  One time our whole table had a cup each and they were filled half way!\n\nThe biggest issue for me is their decision at this location to essentially shut down the kitchen now 2 hours before closing.  That's right, this restaurant is open till 11pm during the week but we were there on 7\/21 (Tuesday) and walked in 20 minutes before 9pm and one of the waitresses was giving us the stink eye.  We sat ourselves in the bar area and she came over and just dropped off some menus after about 10 minutes of sitting there and walked off, not a word said.  Another guy came over, was friendly and took our order but apparently they had already shut down the oven and so the individual pizza one of the kids ordered took about 25 minutes.\n\nI get that the staff want to go home early or right after closing, it's obvious.  They had sections closed off at 9:15 for cleaning, including the bathrooms.  My issue is you work at a restaurant and food is a part of that business, not just alcohol.  Whoever runs this place needs to know that this place was really closed by 9:45 pm because no one came in as the waiters and waitresses were telling people the kitchen was closed and everyone that was there was gone by 10pm because we all know that without food, it isn't worth paying $5-$10 for a drink out!  Good luck to this restaurant, I doubt it lasts another year with these policies in place!
