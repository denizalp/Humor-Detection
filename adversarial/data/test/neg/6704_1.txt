Buffers just okay! Came here as brunch turned into dinner on a Saturday. Wicked spoon seems to be a better buffet. Buffet tables are messy at Bellagio and staff are not friendly at all. Seems like they can't handle the crowd. Not very impressed for such a nice hotel. Go visit Wicked Spoon instead. Also I just noticed the desserts have no tongs to pick them up. You use your hands!
