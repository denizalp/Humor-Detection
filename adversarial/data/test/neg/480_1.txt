I hesitate to post a review because I want to keep this gem to myself. With about a dozen tables inside and additional patio seating, this is an intimate restaurant. Fantastic and unusual wines, beers, and menu items. We have been several times in the evening and today tried the Sunday Brunch. Fantastic.  Tried the honey fried chicken with brioche French toast. Crispy and tasty chicken and perfect French toast. DH had the clams and mussels. Generous portion in a delicate and favorable broth. The Bellini three flavors for $14 is an amazing deal.  Love this place.
