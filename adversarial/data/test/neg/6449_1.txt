My experience with Perfect Patio was not so perfect.\nI placed an order for a 6ft by 4ft metal frame with a cushion covered by Sunbrella fabric and 2 rectangle bolster cushions. I placed the order on June 2, 2016, I did not receive the product till first week of Sept. 2016.,\nIt took 3 deliveries before the all cushions were acceptable. Not Perfect. Sandra is the sales rep I wrote the contract terms and conditions.  She over promised and hyped how great their production team and warehouse personal would be with my patio furniture.\nmy observations are as followed:\n1. No Quality control before product is delivered.\n2. Delivery personnel not white glove service, delivered \n     cushions finger prints 1st and 2nd time and not \n      sewed correctly. \n3. When you call the numbers on the invoice the \n      warehouse personnel answers the phone. That was\n       my personal experience. Sandra was not available.\n4. Then every time I called they had me call different \n     Cell numbers for different warehouse personal who \n      Couldn't answer my question about my situation.\n5. When I finally got a hold of Sandra she insisted on \n     cushions made correctly. I give her a grade of \"E\" for \n      effort. But it still is frustrating when the product \n      cost $1,757\n6.   In the end I rate their product and service \n      \"NOT SO PERFECT, and very expensive for the \n      quality of the seamstress and frustration of getting \n      it some what in an acceptable condition. \nWhat one see in their show room is beautiful and perfect. Beware of what your actually going to get. \nNot once did they offer a discount for the frustration or \ninconvenience of this situation. \nI talked to Sandra on my last phone conversation she did apologize sincerely and promised this time it was \nperfect and I would like it.  I like it. But it's not perfect.\nmaybe I'm to picky. Maybe I'm not. Buyer beware.
