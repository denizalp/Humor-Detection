Went there for dinner with my husband. We got seated promptly. Our waitress was pleasant and friendly and very attentive. My husband and I ordered the Surf and Turf. The steaks had no flavor. The Lobster tails were dry and rubbery. We couldn't finish it because the dinner was so awful. We won't be going back which is sad because I love seafood.
