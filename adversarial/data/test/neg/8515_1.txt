Closer to 3.5 stars for me. Came for lunch on a weekend trip to Vegas had reservations and showed up early for lunch - they could easily accommodate us. Good selection of fusion foods (Japanese\/Brazilian?\/Peruvian). Service was top-notch, the server walked through the menu with us and also told us about the set tasting menu. Really detailed and made sure we had everything we needed. Water and plate removal was efficient. Atmosphere was good, food was also quite good, but perhaps because it was fusion it wasn't all that memorable to me. Had the sea bass skewer, which was alright - the peruvian corn was harder than I would have liked. The yellowtail taquitos were good and the flavour\/seasoning was nice. The waygu gyoza had a nice meaty flavour, but was not as crispy as I expected it to be. The staff was also really helpful with setting up a surprise for our party. The churros were delicious, but a little softer than I would've liked.
