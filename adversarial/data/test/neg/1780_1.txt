We needed carpet replaced at seller's expense in a home we're buying, and Cosimo met our budget with quality products in a way that none of our other quotes came close to doing. His crew was prompt and efficient, and the carpet is SO much better now. Cosimo was fantastic to work with, and I'd recommend him to anyone looking to replace flooring. Thanks, Cosimo!!
