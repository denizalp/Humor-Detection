Great food--good choice of beers. Neat atmosphere. All and all a place you really should stop by if you are in Madison and you are interested in checking out a cool place with great food and good beer.\nThe only downside is that they take cash only (but do have an ATM inside). The other downside is that it can fill up pretty quick inside and also get a bit loud....but then again--consider your location!
