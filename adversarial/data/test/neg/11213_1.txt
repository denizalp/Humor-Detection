Arrived mid-evening and wanted something small and simple.  We decided to eat here because it was close to our elevators.  Service was fast and very friendly.  We had the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich and bowl of clam chowder and shared.  When the sandwich arrived I was caught off guard.  It didn't look at all like a Philly Cheesesteak sandwich and I even asked the waiter if it was our sandwich.  They were nice to cut the sandwich in half as we told them we were going to share but for $17 the sandwich was way too small and it was only average tasting.  What surprised me was the sandwich was served on a paper sheet.  No plates.  For $17 I was expecting a plate. The clam chowder was good though it had a \"kick\" to it.  Paid $10 for a bowl and I thought the price was okay.  Forgot to mention we got a pickle with our sandwich
