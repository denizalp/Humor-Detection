I love this place. I usually go about every other day. Today was my 16th visit. Great reasonable prices. Great service. Great products. A very diverse menu with soo much to choose from. Wether you are looking for a meal replacement, an after workout drink, an energy pick me up, or just wanting to trim some pounds. They have litterally anything to your hearts desire. For vegetarians and vegans both they even have smoothie categories to choose from for you! Bring the kids they have choices for the little smoothie enthusiasts.\n I only have had one very minor bad experience by one of their regular employees. However , great news about that is I brought that to the Store Manager's attention the very next day and he went above and beyond my expectations on resolving the issue. Again great truly exceptional service. Don't ever second guess stopping in, they are not your typical smoothie at the mall kind of shop. Smoothie King Fitchburg is THE BEST smoothie store in all of the Madison area. Stop by next time your passing through the south side of Fitchburg =)
