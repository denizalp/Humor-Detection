I bought a bike from them.  Drove from San Diego.  They would not go down $200 dollars on the bike.  And they lied about my bike trade in.   They tried to sell me on the $800 bike check which they did not do.  And then they brought my bike down by $800 for a bike check.   They screwed me over and their customer service sucks.   They are rude and not friendly to deal with.    I would never recommend them to anyone.
