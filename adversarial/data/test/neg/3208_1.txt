Upon the recommendation of a friend, I knew I had to check out Peppermill, even if I was going solo.\n\nThis retro lounge really hit the spot. The fire pit is definitely special, though all the coves throughout the lounge make it an intimate spot or great for a group.\n\nI went for the Blue Hawaiian with Grey Goose ($10.50), and it went down easy. No skimping on the alcohol.\n\nI did find it a little weird that all the servers are wearing long, black, busty gowns, but they looked classier than at other places, for sure.\n\nThey played old, live music clips of 90's artists singing their biggest hits, like Jewel, Hootie, and Sheryl Crow. Again, a little odd, but pleasant.
