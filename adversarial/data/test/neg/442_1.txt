I frequent this Safeway quite often since it is right across from where I work. I can easily walk here or drive. A Starbucks is inside, so I can stop before work to grab a coffee if need be. Otherwise, I really like their chicken tenders at lunch time. The chicken is moist and the batter is really crunchy. My husband and I agree Safeway has the best chicken tenders of all the grocers (Albertson's, Basha's, Fry's). The deli service can be slow at times, but that's just because they have three employees in the wine\/liquor section at all times. Granted, when I needed some liquor for work, I had three people to help me find everything I needed. Otherwise, the store is rather large and pretty clean. I like this Safeway much more than a few of the other ones I've been to in the valley.
