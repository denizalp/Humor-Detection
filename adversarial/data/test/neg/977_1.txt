Been here twice. First time stunk, atmosphere-wise, but second time, much better. Food both times good. For me, the lunch crowd was more my speed than the evening crowd. Having said that, going in a group would probably make me like it better!\nBoth times, the staff was wonderful-maybe the best part of the trip. I'll be giving this place another go.
