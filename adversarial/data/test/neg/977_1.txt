Best take out in Verona!!!!!  Everything is good, I am especially fond of the pork tacos, loaded grill cheese, and flour-less peanut butter M&M Cookies.  Made from scratch with a chef's touch.  My hubby enjoys anything with pork or beef.  I have also tried a number of their specials and I have never been disappointed.  The owners are always there and the service is stellar.  Do yourself a favor and wait the 7-9 minutes for awesome take out.
