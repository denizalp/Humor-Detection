There is a lot I could say, but it is not worth it.... I have been with them for four years. I had a wonderful doctor that I saw for about a year and she was wonderful. Also most doctors I have seen have been nice. However the doctors turn over every six months so good luck actually finding one that will stay longer than five minutes.\n\nAlso the allergy doctor is AMAZING!!! \n\nMy issue is with the rest of the entire staff... the nurses, the administrators, etc are absolutely terrible. They are rude, make you feel bad about yourself and quote policy and procedure more often than speak to you like a human. Look everyone understand policy and procedure, but don't read me the dam manual. \n\nThis place is just endlessly disappointing. I gave them about four chances and didn't want to give them the fourth but I had to because something come up and had not found a new PPO... they did not redeem themselves.\n\nThe doctor is important and most doctors in general I think are great, but get you staffs stuff together. Stop treating me like dollar signs or some dumb person
