Came to this location for lunch on Thursday with my girlfriend and my server was Tim. He was extremely attentive and took my orders shortly after we seated. The food was amazing and affordable. \n\nThe staff in general were all very polite and helpful. Our water glass were full throughout our whole meal, we are very appreciative of that. \n\nEasily my favorite kabuki location here so far, will most definitely come back again.
