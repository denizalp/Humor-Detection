Wow it's so sad to see how far downhill Slices has gone. This used to be such a great place. Lately it's dirty, the help is rude and the pies all look like they've been made days ago. It's a shame because it was so good in the past and is in such a convenient location in Desert Ridge. I hope they get their act together and return to their former standards.
