Great ice cream place. I am a big fan of Oreo and surprisingly they had an Oreo dipping. Compared to other La Diperie places, the dipping at this location seems to melt pretty fast on me, which leaded to a total mess on my hand. Fun fact, the temperature was 18Â°C so I was pretty sure it wasn't because of the weather!
