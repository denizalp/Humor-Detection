My husband is a dirtbike rider and I work a couple blocks down the street from Carter Powersports. From time to time I will stop in to order and pick up parts my husband needs to save him a trip across town.\n\nThe good: \nService is pretty friendly. I am almost always welcomed when I arrive, and thanked when I leave. \nThey carry some items that you can not get in any other shops in town..\n\nThe ok:\nThe parts department is hit or miss. I have had to take items back because they didn't include required parts. I have also had to wait for part department employees to get someone else to look things up because they were not familiar with them.\n\nThe bad: \nPrices! The vast majority of what Carter sells can be bought elsewhere for less, either in town or online. Just recently I picked up a tool my husband needed for my dirtbike at another shop in town for $9, Carter wanted to sell us another brand for almost $60! \n\nI know I will end up back at Carter Powersports sooner or later because in a pinch they usually have what my husband needs. There are cheaper alternatives around town though that I prefer to support.
