I purchased a gown recently for my daughter from Anna at Brilliant Bridal.  She was very helpful and gave us a lot of help and suggestions. With all the excitement of \"Saying yes to the dress\", I forgot to check in on yelp to get my 10% off my total purchase which would have been $145.00...I called the store right away the next day asking if they would honor the discount as the charge had not yet even been applied to my credit card. I was of course told there was no way this was possible. \nI feel we should have been offerred the 10% off at the time of purchase...We were even charged $25.00 for the dress bag. At least they could have given that as complimentary??
