This review is for John, the most helpful service attendant I have ever encountered. Had to get a suspension issue resolved. He was always available anytime I called, called me back often to give me the status, and just was all around honest and helpful with my situation. Nice to know where I can find someone with integrity to bring my Range Rover to.
