This hotel was a fantastic stay for me and my friends. Stayed in early September for FanExpo. Despite lots of young nerdy comic fans running around, the hotel kept a very professional appearance.\n\nPros:\n- Delicious whiskey bar. Amazing recipes for incredible drinks that are well worth the price.\n- Excellent breakfast buffet. Every morning I rushed downstairs to get full up on all the good stuff.\n- Incredible staff. From the room service to the lobby attendants, everyone was unbelievably friendly. Must be that Canadian upbringing. One late-night attendant, Kristina, was instrumental in helping us get situated as we arrived well past midnight. Her attention to detail and and willingness to spend time solving our issues with lost room keys and whatnot, was super appreciated.\n- Short walk to everything important in downtown Toronto: the harbor, the CN Tower, great food, etc etc.\n- It's very clean and modern!\n\nCons: \n- The parking is a bit expensive. Can't win 'em all I guess.\n\nWill definitely be staying here when I return to Toronto, which I hope is soon!
