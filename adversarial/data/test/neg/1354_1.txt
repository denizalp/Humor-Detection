We've literally been coming here for 8+ years. For a time, we would go every Friday and sit in Josh's section. He was awesome and trained the other servers. Everyone was amazing and attentive. It was ALWAYS packed and had a great neighborhood feel. For the last couple years, it's gone steadily downhill. The fire only exacerbated that. The new space is cold and awkward ... We've switched to takeout. Tonight's tater tots and wings were overcooked, the marinara tasted burned and the food overall wasn't great. They're clearly struggling to find their way. Too many other choices out there. Not sure we'll be back anytime soon. Sad that this family tradition has faded away.
