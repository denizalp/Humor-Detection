Quick service and friendly staff! Me and my friend came here for a late lunch on a Saturday (around 1:20) and it was empty except for one table. Naturally I would expect fast service when there were fewer patrons and that is exactly what I got. It seems like their happy hour is all the time which is pretty great. There were about 10 rolls on the happy hour menu which were all half off. Me and my friend each got one and they came out very quickly. We also ordered a fried chicken dish as an appetizer. It didn't look like much but man was it juicy and full of flavor. We literally couldn't stop talking about how flavorful it was as we were devouring it. We weren't that hungry so we shared a chirashi bowl for our entree. The rice was perfect and the sashimi tasted very fresh. Near the end of our meal, the owner himself came over to fill our waters (or at least I think he was the owner..I could be mistaken) which I thought was nice. Overall great experience and will be coming back soon to try more dishes!
