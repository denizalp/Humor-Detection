Stopped by this with the initial intention of going to Burrito Boyz next door but did not want to wait in the long line up of \"bros\" with their gym bags getting their burrito protein fix or listen to them talk while wait in line.  This place in my opinion had one of the best shawarmas I had in the Greater Toronto area in years, as the chicken in it was soft, fresh, and non-oily.   The price was good for what I got ($8 including a canned drink) and it was quickly made.
