What an incredible experience. After suffering severe dehydration due to food poisoning, I reached out to Reset IV around 7am. Within a half hour, I had a WONDERFUL RN (Cheri) arrive at my friends home to administer two bags of saline. Her demeanor and professionalism were second to none. This was by far the best option rather then going to the ER. I couldn't recommend this service any higher - well done. Looking forward to utilizing you guys again when needed!
