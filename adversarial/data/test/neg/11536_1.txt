I was never a big fan of curry, but Archi's has changed my mind.\n\nThere are several Archi's in Las Vegas, but this location is my favorite.  I love their pineapple chicken curry and they put the right amount of spice (#5). \nThe service is good, very friendly, and check on the customers regularly.  \n\nThe atmosphere is simple and the restaurant is clean.  I would definitely go back and must try an new item.
