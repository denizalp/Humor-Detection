This is our go to place in Gilbert when we want to grab dinner. It's close by and the food is always hot and delicious! I personally like the buffalo chicken wrap and the burgers. My family frequently get the ribs and the monte cristo. \nOnly 4 stars because sometimes the service isn't be the best- but it's never been horrible!
