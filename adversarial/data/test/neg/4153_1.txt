Ive been going here  for years never had a problem, decided to go here tonight and had a awful experience. The service was good, the food was good. It wasn't until it was over that the experience became a bad one.  I've never had to pay a gratuity here even in groups , go to other restaurants and it's up to you. Tonight it was a shock to my system me and my child ate each meal no more than 10 dollars and some how I had to pay 31 dollars because of it. Shame shame shame, did I say shame? Really upset it isn't written any where in the restaurant never seen it so I'm really upset.  The service wasn't that good for it to be automatic all of a sudden.  Shame on you landmark, update your menu, decor and bathrooms. And the women at the cash register that greet you and cash you out are horrible. The red head one with glasses really rude, I was talking to her about my order, she didn't want to listen to me the customer she was more interested in talking to the other rude women at the front. Landmark has really changed. Wow
