I don't get it, man. This restaurant gets tons of hype and people love it.  I think a lot of people love it because it's the cool thing to do, but this food is seriously mediocre.  I go here occasionally and only because other people want to, and every time the food has been bland and boring.  I mean, the presentation of the food and the atmosphere are very nice, and people wanna go somewhere trendy in Tremont, so this place does fine, but in terms of food... just nah.
