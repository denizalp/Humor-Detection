Had a Las Vegas Craft Lager from Big Dog's Brewing Company. It was \"okay.\" Came to me in a can, and had somewhat of an aluminum can taste. Not overly impressed with the beer, although I love the brewery name.\n\nMy pizza on the otherhand, was heavenly!!! I had the Prosciutto pizza which came topped with San Marzano tomatoes, goat cheese, mozzarella, wild arugula, and you guessed it...prosciutto. The prosciutto was like butter! It was thinly sliced and just melted in my mouth. At first, I thought the kitchen may have left the goat cheese off but a few bites into it, it made its presence known. Wasn't visible, but a tasty hidden gem! The crust was thin and delicious! Had the char marks from the wood fire oven and a nice crunch.\n\nI've always been impressed with the food and service that I've received at Wolfgang Puck's restaurants!!!
