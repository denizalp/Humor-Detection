The conversation amongst friends went thus ---- \n\"I feel Asian tonight\"\n\"I feel like Guu tonight\"\n\"I don't want to blow my money on dinner, rather on drinks\"\n\"I don't want to eat alot\"\n\"I want to go to china town and have seor ak san\"\n\nThe obvious answer was Oddseoul. Kinda like the ugly duckling next to swish by han, Oddseoul is wayyyy dingier and slightly lower priced. And also slightly lower quality too while we're at it.\nBut some key dishes that always stand out - the chicken wings and the bulgogi cheesesteak.\n\nI don't care much for their drinks personally. I'd like to pay the prices i'm paying on a little more liquid that also has more quality. Serving it in a stupid little glass does not justify. \n\n\nAnd yes, this place could do a lot better on the service. They need to figure out if they DO actually take reservations, or not. this friends and family bullshit is just not cool.
