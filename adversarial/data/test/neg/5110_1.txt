I'm writing this review after my second visit to Ravi Soup.  I went for a quick dinner on a Wednesday evening.  My previous visit was a couple of years ago during lunch on a weekday.  I remember the place being busy, but the service was prompt (although the food took a while), and the food was delicious.  \n\nFast forward to tonight.  Dinner time around Ravi must be a dead zone because it's night and day versus lunch time.  We walked in and there was nobody except two girls just finishing up their dinners and leaving.  Otherwise, it was completely empty.  After poking around a while, someone finally comes up from the basement to take our order.  Weird.\n\nThe place being empty gave us a chance to at least get a better look at the place.  It's not a sparking gem, but it's functional with a larger seating area at the back.  There's a counter at the front with stools.  In warmer weather, they open up the window in this area so that counter sitters can enjoy a nice breeze with their meal.  However, the counter itself wasn't exactly clean (not filthy, just not clean) and the stools were uncomfortable.\n\nI ordered the pork shoulder wrap, and my companion had the organic chicken wrap.  We didn't co-ordinate and both ended up getting the mushroom soup.  I don't remember what I had a couple of years ago, but the lasting impression was that the food was delicious.  That hasn't changed.  My wrap was moist, delicious with a lot of flavours going on.  Definitely not a Mega Wraps style wrap.  The chicken wrap was also proclaimed to be fresh and tasty.  However, we both agreed that although the mushroom soup was very flavourful and deep, it was much too salty.  I wish we had gotten different soups so I could see if this is a problem for only the mushroom soup, or all soups.\n\nI was a bit torn between 3 or 4 stars, but after mulling it over, I think 3 stars is more appropriate.  Yes, the food is delicious, but overseasoning is a sin of cooking.  And as at it's heart, Ravi is a soup and sandwich place, I don't necessarily care that their decor is virtually non-existent, but cleanliness and comfortable seating should be a basic even here.  It's too bad.  I really did want to rate this place higher.
