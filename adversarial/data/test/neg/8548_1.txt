The atmosphere and workers here are patient and high spirited. Yesterday I came here and Ryan was  back and forth with customers but very attentive when answering my questions and providing me with fish. He even stood at the large log tank trying to get the last Cardinal. Today I was just loving watching the interactions and bodies that I wondered what other stores had to offer so I went to tropical treasures and reef monsters both stores were disappointing in price and staff so I went back to aquarium arts where again I was greeted, this time by the store owner. He answered my questions and when most places would just get a fish and go he examined the tank and picked one he would take home he stated. He was asked questions while he was working with me and would let me know he would be right back and was, as of course my wandering eyes looked at others I wanted. He also let me know my fish needed a higher protein since I only have had Bettas, a Molly, and Glo eyes, who eat flakes.  I will definitely be back.
