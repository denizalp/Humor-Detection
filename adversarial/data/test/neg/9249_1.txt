I usually go hot and juicy if I am craving about seafood. One thing good about this place is that it is not too crowded like hot and juicy. \n\nAll the staffs are super nice and friendly. \n\nIt's my first time trying to eat alligator and frog lag. \nNothing special about alligator. \nWe all like frog lag. The taste and texture of frog meat is approximately between chicken and fish.
