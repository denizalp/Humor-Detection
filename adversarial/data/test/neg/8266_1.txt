So happy we stopped here for our last meal before our red-eye flight home! The vibes are awesome and the food was delicious (as well as the drinks...of course!)! We sat outside at the bar (string light ambiance always wins me over), and our bartender was very nice, as well as helpful (we had a hard time deciding what to order since everything sounded so good, so she took the time to show us the way). Highly recommend the Sweet Corn and Avacado Ceaser Salad w\/ steak + the Watermelon Mint Margarita. Without question, you need the guac, too, because guac is life. Can't wait to go back one day!
