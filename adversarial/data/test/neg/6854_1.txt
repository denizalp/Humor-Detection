The menu is very small but there's really no need for a lot of options because their noodle soup really is the star!\n\nYou can choose the noodle shape (round or flat) and width (thin or thick). I chose the thin noodle because I find it infuses the broth better than thick noodles. Of course the noodles are individually hand pulled for each order. Love the texture! Nice springy chewy texture.\n\nWhat really blows my mind is their broth. It's very clean tasting. Although it is clear, it packs SO MUCH flavour. I got spicy but really it isn't that spicy. \n\nCame around lunch and had to wait about 5 mins for a table. The place is small so there's limited seating. But definitely worth the wait! Tastes just as good if you decide to grab take out as well :)
