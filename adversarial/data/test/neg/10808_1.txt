We are a big fan of Matt's Big Breakfast Downtown. Food is amazing, even though the wait is frustrated sometimes. I love their 3 eggs scramble special. Also the waffle is delightful. When they opened new one in Camelback location, we were so excited since its much closed to where we live. Even though same owner and menu, the food is not quite the same. May be just my taste. Anyway,  Matt's Big Breakfast is still one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix metro!
