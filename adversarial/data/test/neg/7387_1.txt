Best Sportsbook ever.  With the new upgrades that were completed in late 2015, the new screens are unbelievably clear and numerous!!! I actually come here to watch all the EPL games as they are open 24hrs showing all sorts of sports.  In addition, the chairs are super comfortable.  They only downsides are it gets packed on football Saturday and Sunday's. To get a seat, I recommend showing up pre-9am at the latest.\n\nLove love love love this place!
