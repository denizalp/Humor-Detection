Located just outside Monte Carlo, it has a nice location, nice atmosphere. Price is very reasonable for Vegas and most other places. I had a pizza, made to order. Staff was friendly, clearly explained their custom options. Pizza was hot and tasty. My only negative comment is they used too much olive oil - my pizza wilted from all the oil.\nI did find the taste and price better than \"secret pizza\" at Cosmopolitan.\n\nI recommend this, and will go back on my future visit.
