For 8 bucks you can get a basic sushi roll, your choice of ramen or udon, miso and a salad! The more complicated rolls will cost a little more. Ive ordered the ($8) spicy tuna my first time the ($12) las vegas roll the next. Both were yummy! The salad come with this tasty creamy dressing on it. The miso was flavorful. The Ramen noodles were kind of soggy but we did get our food delivered which took about 45 minutes to an hour. For the price all was definitely worth it.
