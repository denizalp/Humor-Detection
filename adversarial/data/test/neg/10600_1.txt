I love Guy and was so excited to try his restaurant while in Vegas with the family earlier this summer. We walked in around lunch and had to wait for aprox. 45min (they will text your phone when you have 10min for your table to be ready).\n\nIt was myself, my husband and our 3 kids (6, 4, 1.5).\n\nWe had the breadsticks for appetizers. They are breadsticks wrapped in salami and you dip them in cheese fondue. This was SOOO good!! 5 stars! My husband had the hamburger for entree and really liked it, I had the potstickers salad and it was also good. The potstickers were fried and I prefer steamed potstickers so that prob. would've made the salad even better for my personal taste. The one and only negative is that there is no kids menu, our kids had some mac n cheese and didn't really care for it. They also don't have any plastic cups or cups with lids. We were there right around the time they opened, so maybe it has changed now. \n\nOur overall experience was great and we would def. come back.
