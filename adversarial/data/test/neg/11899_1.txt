I usually dont give 5 stars.  I have been to Pita Pit on Maryland pkwy numerous times in the last 2 weeks.  The staff is always extremely nice, friendly and they go out of their way to make sure you have a good experience.  The place is also spotless not a spec anywhere.  Now on to the food.  You order what Pita you want and then you choose either white or wheat pita.  After that you can watch them cook your meat on the flat top .  Next you pick what you want to add and the list is endless.  I have to say i am partial to the Dagwood.  Awesome pita.  Also they are open to midnight on the weekends. Keep it up guys lovin your food.
