Honestly, for the food I will give 4-5 stars. I had some issues with their serving and 2 stars would be fair. We Have been there couple of times, three times we were served with the same waiter, I didn't ask his name. Two of these three times this guy forgot to place part of our orders and let us wait for nothing until I asked him where is my dish. I had been waiting for an hour and got to leave, so asked him to cancel that dish. This guy almost yelled at me: I just placed it for you! The manager was pretty nice and apologized to us, but this guy didn't say anything till the end.\n\nIf they still hire this kind of waiters, we will never come back. Their serving doesn't match the high quality of the food, what a shame.
