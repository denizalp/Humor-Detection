I love coming here to self-wash my dog! On Tuesday's, it's $10 which includes shampoo, blow dryer, brushes, & towels. \nI've only gone twice but will keep coming back! It's so much easier than giving my dog a wash at home. The staff are very helpful with any questions that I had & also gave me tips to help blow dry my husky quicker! \nMy dog loves the treats they have & I always like to buy him 1 after his bath. They are very inexpensive as well! \nThey have a lot of different food & treats in the store but I haven't personally checked those out.
