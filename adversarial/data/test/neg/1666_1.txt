Absolute worst customer service ever. When you place the order they don't tell you to expect the package at 8:30pm. Then, when no one is home the don't leave a notice, or anything. Then, they just sit on the package for days. Then when you call, they just outright lie to you. They say, oh I'll check on that and I'll call you back, and then never call back. I talked to 3 representatives, and each one said they'd call back with an update, and SURPRISE, non of them called. \nI ordered SAME DAY shipping, I had to cancel the order after 3 days.
