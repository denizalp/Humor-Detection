My first visit to this urgent care and I was very impressed.  The place was very clean and the service was super fast and courteous.  From the receptionist, to the technician who checked me in, to the PA who cared for me - everyone was very kind and considerate.  I appreciated the fact that the PA (Nicole) had a sense of humor and made me feel at ease. I would definitely recommend this facility.  It is not the closest urgent care to my home, but I would definitely choose it over the others.
