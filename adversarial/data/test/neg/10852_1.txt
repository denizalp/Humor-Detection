Stress for the parents, no fun for the kids.\n\nImpressive looking facility but horrible service and disappointing instruction. Most of the teachers don't teach, don't seem to know any of the skills they're asking the kids to learn. But the biggest problem seems to be the management, and its accounting department - overcharging customers without regret or effort to fix. Burden is on you to make things right. My daughters have thrived at other schools and will do so again at the one we've recently joined. \n\nSuggest you look around - lots of schools in the area.
