Was so excited to find out Pittsburgh got a rolled ice cream place! Went on a Friday afternoon and surprisingly was not busy. I got the s'mores with vanilla base. Loved watching them make it, but more importantly it tasted great. They put in a lot of effort from toasting a marshmallow to putting mini marshmallows on the rolled ice cream. I will definitely come back. Only issue is the ice cream is  tough to get out with a plastic spoon and it is a little pricey for ice cream.
