I've been heading to P&L since they opened a few years ago. It was my favourite burger, even compared to The Priest just down the street. Unfortunately, I think this place has gone seriously downhill. I ordered The Deluxe - a pretty classic burger. The place wasn't busy. My Deluxe was one of the worst burgers I've had in awhile: bland and dry. Well, see ya, P&L. I'm heading to The Priest from now on.
