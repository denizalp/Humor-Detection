I was just traveling through Phoenix from LA, and I came across this little place. As you pull up, you think it's someone's house... But it kinda is, which makes it even better! The waitress was super nice and attentive. I ordered a skillet with veggies, and French toast with berries and cream. The food was amazing! It tasted just like a fresh, home-cooked meal. I'd recommend this place to anyone. Even if you're located in Phoenix, it's WORTH the drive.
