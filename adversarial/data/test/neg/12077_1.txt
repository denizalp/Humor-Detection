Great meal here one time, a few months later, a horrible one. \n\nLooks like they changed the menu recently, getting rid of many of the favourites and replacing them with ones that left a lot to be desired. The worst part of the meal was the fried bone-in pork, which was $21, and a plate of over fried pork on bone. It was very fatty, very dry, and quite bad. Had to send it back to the kitchen to have them cut it up in an fashion that would make eating possible, but by that point, the meal was a failure.\n\nCocktails were tasty though... lychee!
