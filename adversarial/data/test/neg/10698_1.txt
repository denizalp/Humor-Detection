Well, it was back to this Metro Pizza emporium for the second time.  And, once again it did not disappoint.  This time, besides the fine small Dinner Salad with great homemade zesty Italian Dressing, which really wasn't that small, I opened with Metro Pizza's double delicious homemade Pizza Dough Bread and butter, along with a medium-sized bowl of Minestrone Soup.  By the size of this bowl, I learned that ordering the large variety would probably have put me under the table before my pizza had even arrived.  This scratch made soup was every bit as good as the one I have had at the Tropicana Avenue location.  It bristled with cooked carrots, tomato, zucchini, White Onions, and even Italian Green Beans in a robust tomato-based broth.  But its crowning feature was Mozzarella Cheese melted over the top.  Ahhh!  It was a most savory and comforting soup!\n\nStill, as it should have been, the highlight of my meal was the pizza.  I went all in for a five-topping large New York style pizza.  My selected toppings were pepperoni, mushrooms, sausage, cooked sliced tomatoes, and cashews that Diane brought from home.  When this pizza arrived, it was perfect!  The pepperoni and sausage were mild as I prefer; it glistened with baked cashews; the dough was firm yet supple at the same time; all ingredients joined to burst with flavor and complement each other; and the large slices reflected the perfect blended balance of cheese and sauce.  A first-rate New York style pizza in every respect!  Meanwhile, Diane greatly enjoyed her large New York style pizza of ham, cashews, and extra cheese.\n\nWe arrived with a full unopened can of salted whole cashews, and after we inquired about whether any remained, our server checked and informed us that none were left.  If the prep staff ate the remainder in the kitchen, we didn't care.  But there were so many cashews covering our two pizzas that it is possible that the entire contents of the can were dumped on top.  I appreciated this accommodation in any event, for not every pizza parlor will accept cashews to add from the outside, and we have found some places that will only augment their in-house ingredients if the can or bag of cashews has not been opened.  As you can probably tell, I like cashews topping my pizzas, and Diane simply loves them as her favorite pizza ingredient besides extra cheese.  \n\nService was a little slow on initial water and other drink arrivals, but exemplary after then.  And my La Voce Club Card was honored for a 10% discount on our meals.  It was all good!\n\nI gobbled down half of my pizza, and enjoyed the rest at home within the next three days for two lunches.  It still tasted great after being reheated in the oven!  Metro Pizza's pizzas retain their flavors and have extraordinary staying power.
