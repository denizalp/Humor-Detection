Who doesn't love baked goodies? This is definitely the place to go for that! Stopped by here 2 weeks ago on a Thursday with my husband. As soon as I came in, I could IMMEDIATELY smell that fresh baked bread with undertones of sweet cinnamon in between. If I could, I would really buy everything (and I mean EVERYTHING) in this store. Everything looked and smelled so good. My first thought upon entering in here was I wished there was a place like this near my home. \n\nI ended up purchasing a jumbo cinnamon roll (this cinnamon roll was pretty big), a croissant, cinnamon stick that had a taste like a churro, a few raspberry filled pastries and a small shortbread cookie. Everything was really good, even the next day. I was surprised to find that some of our baked treats were not stale the next day. \n\nEverything here is so cheaply priced and would love to stop by here again if I am ever in town. Oh and by the way, there is a $5 minimum for credit card transactions.
