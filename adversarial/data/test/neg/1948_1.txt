Hands down, the BEST dining experience I have ever had in my 30+ years in Las Vegas! The food is all amazing, the service is absolutely TOP NOTCH, the atmosphere is beautiful! Our main server, Russell, made us feel so comfortable. I felt like I was going back in time! I can't say enough good things!!!
