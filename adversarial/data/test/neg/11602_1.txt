Excellent food, drinks, and service.\n\nWhenever I am thinking where to go for a drink on a patio with some delicious snacks, trinity commons is usually the first place on my mind (and if its not I kick myself for wasting time yelping when I inevitably end up here).\n\nI have never had a bad experience, bad cocktail, or a bad plate of food. The fries, mushrooms, sausage... just all delicious. \n\nThis is my go to place and now that the weather is warming up, my ass will be a permanent fixture on that patio
