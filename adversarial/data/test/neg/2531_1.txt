Seemed like a small step above most Chinese buffets.  Crab legs, soft shell crab, a few kinds of schrimp, lots of meat choices, a Mongolian grill, salad bar, plantain, vegetables and scoops of ice cream  (not a machine of soft serve) for desert.\n\nI didn't notice anything unclean or messy. I'll definitely go again.
