I'm not a very patient person. However, I will drive 6 hours outside of California and wait 3 hours line for even just a piece of Little Miss BBQ's Brisket. They have the best tasting brisket I have ever had in my life! We tried the brisket (fatty option), beef short rib, pork rib, and sausage! All delicious! Brisket was my favorite though! Tender as f--! \n\nThe staff was amazing! They made the whole experience even that much better. From the opening announcements to the free samples of sausage while we waited! Everyone was super friendly and attentive! They made us feel like we were right at home! \n\nThe hype is real!
