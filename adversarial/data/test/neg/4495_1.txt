Dining in complete darkness was a new concept to me. I have heard of places that blindfold guests but being seated in a dining room completed void of light was too intriguing to pass up.\n\nI made a reservation for the earliest of the two seatings available and selected the two-course, prix fixe meal which featured an appetizer and entree. I opted to skip dessert.\n\nI greeted a young woman standing in the doorway to the dining room and followed her direction  to place my hand on her shoulder. She lead me through the door and into the darkness.\n\nThe experience of dining in complete darkness is definitely something everyone should try. The server provides excellent direction in terms of getting guests seated, helping them to orient themselves with what is on the table and making sure they have everything they need throughout the meal.\n\nI found it fascinating to gain a better understanding of what it is like to live in a world without the benefit of sight. It is also exciting to have this opportunity for people who are blind to, not only work in the \"front of the house\" of a restaurant, but to also interact with the public in this manner and demonstrate how they can handle themselves, and the meal service, so capably. \n\nListening to the conversations surrounding me, everyone seemed to be enjoying their food as well as the entire experience. No mishaps or order mixups as far as I could tell.\n\nThe food was very good but I did miss out on the chance to enjoy the visual presentation. The menu options are limited in comparison to the extensive choices offered at other restaurants but the dishes available do offer something for everyone, vegetarians to meat eaters.\n\nMy only difficulty came from trying to spear the lettuce leaves on the appetizer dish with my fork. What I believe were shrimp were easy enough to eat but lettuce can be very elusive in the dark!
