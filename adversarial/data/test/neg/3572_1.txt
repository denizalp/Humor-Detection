When I first started a membership with this location the girls were all very knowledgeable and were consistently giving me tips on how to better my tan! They are all so friendly and welcoming! Bri is always checking in to see how my last visit was and making sure I am comfortable with the amount of time and the lotions I had previously used! She definitely cares about her customers and insures a relaxing environment for everyone! I look forward to each of my sessions!
