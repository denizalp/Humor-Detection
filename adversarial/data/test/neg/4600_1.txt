I love this place. The wide selection of beer on tap is pretty awesome. This place has quickly and easily become my local hangout and the staff here are all friendly (and have amazing facial hair!).\n\nThere are two levels which means enough seating for everyone. Also, it's located in a great part of the city, right off Bloor in the heart of the Annex. \n\nI have already brought a few friends here and will continue to spread the word about this place. I've only ever come here for drinks but this place has pretty great reviews for their food, too.
