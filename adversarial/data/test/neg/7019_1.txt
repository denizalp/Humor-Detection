I ADORE this place. I've eaten in the restaurant and in the bar\/lounge area. \n\nThe food is amazing. The atmosphere is amazing. The selection is on point. The cocktails and wine selection are delightful. \n\nThey have this amazing patio, but I suggest making reservations for it, because it's a bitch to get a table out there with out them.\n\nThey have an amazing cheese and meat\/ charcuterie selection that I highly recommend you choosing from for your appetizer.\n\nSometimes we just go for the charcuterie and cocktails! \n\nThis place is not particularly easy to find and when you do find it you think that perhaps you're in the wrong place. Don't let that fool you! Just because it's in a business park doesn't mean anything except it's a hidden gem!
