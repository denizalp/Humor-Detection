I wasn't that impressed with PDQ maybe it was because I was comparing it to Raising Canes but the tenders lacked seasoning. Something about the honey mustard tasted weird to me so I let me son taste it and he said the same. I will try to give it another chance as I saw they have a turkey cutlet sandwich on the menu. The peanut butter cookies were delicious as well as my drink. I won't count them out because they do honor our military with a Military Monday deal of 50% off. This in itself earns it another try.
