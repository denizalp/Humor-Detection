After many dinners at the house, last night was the disappointment.\n\n1.  Hostess called to confirm our reservation. We were told we would need to leave out table promptly at 8:45 to give our table to the next reservation. The restaurant was never at capacity with many empty tables throughout the evening.\n\n2. Whe we were sat there were no menues! The restaurant was half full and they don't have any menu's? Really?  We waited 15 minutes to get a menu.\n\n3.  The Crab rice was WAY oversalted! After bringing this to the managers attention, we were told it was to the chef's taste.  Minutes later the manager returned to the table and said the chef tasted the rice and it was oversalted when prepares by the sous chef, they pulled it from service.  Does the chef not taste his own food?\n\nI have frequently dined here, this last dinner may be just that.......the last.
