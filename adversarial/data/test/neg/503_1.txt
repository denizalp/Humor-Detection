I wanted to take a moment to share with you an experience I had over the weekend.  I must preface this by saying that it took me 48 hours to calm down and write this post - as I was too insulted on Sat to write anything objective.\nOn Saturday morning my husband and I decided to visit 'Merchant Square Antique Market' on AZ Ave and Warner.  We saw it on 3 TV on Friday morning and were so excited to see something like that in Chandler.  One of things that the reporter from 3 TV raved about was the food and the new café the owner just opened.\nWhen we arrived it was extremely busy.  We spent almost 2 hours walking around looking at the different booths and enjoying talking to different people.  In fact, we really enjoyed the 'antique market' part of Merchant Square.  However that was where our enjoyment ended.\nAs we were checking out, the girl that helped us raved about the new café and the amazing food.  She was even quick to point out that previous to the café opening that Pittsburg Willy's use to be that space before opening Wimpy's Paradise.  Being HUGE fans of Wimpy's - we were so excited to try the café so we stopped in for lunch.\nWe got there at 11:30am.  There were still plenty of empty tables and no one in line to order.  We ordered our food - spinach salad, pulled pork sandwich, and 2 bottle drinks - then went and sat down to wait for our number to be called.  After waiting about 10 minutes - my husband got up and went to the counter area to wait.  We were concerned that perhaps they called our name and we couldn't hear it.  My husband ended up standing there for another 20+ minutes before we finally got our food.\nHowever, that wasn't the worst part.  After we'd been waiting about 20 minutes, a couple sat down beside us.  The owner practically ran across the restaurant to greet these guests by name and made a huge deal about their presence.  He brought them menus and personally took their order.  He even brought them a free cinnamon roll to munch on while they waited.  Being the naturally curious person I am (plus they were sitting less than 5ft from me, so I could overhear everything) I asked how they knew the owner.  The gentleman was very nice and forthcoming and told me that he ran a blog on Instagram that the owner followed.  I found this interesting.  I would expect family members to get special treatment, but I find it disheartening that an owner of a business would give preferential treatment to someone who has the ability to write a 'good review' on this business.  I find it even more upsetting that the owner not only gave these individuals preferential treatment, but after personally taking their order went and put it in front of all of the other orders that were currently waiting.  They have an open kitchen area so it's easy to witness this.  Seeing the most recent post on their FB page, I now know the nice blogger was from Phoenix magazine.  I wonder if he would have said the same thing if treated the same as everyone else?\nNeedless to say it went down from there - after a 30 minute wait we finally got our salad and sandwich and they were passable.  They would have been much better if served fresh. Our food was served in plastic to-go containers and we had to beg for a single plastic fork.  But the blogger and his girlfriend got their food on real plates, with linen napkins and real silverware.   In fact the owner's wife delivered it to them personally.  At the same time, an elderly lady asked if she could get a knife to cut her sandwich and the owner's wife looked put out to give her a plastic knife.\nWhile I will definitely return to Merchant Square for the antiques - I will never set foot in the café again.  I cannot in good conscience give my hard earned cash to a business that doesn't appreciate or value his paying customers and put's reviews and ratings above them.  These paying customers are what will keep his business afloat and if he doesn't understand that - then I feel sorry for him - as his business is destined to fail.  I really hope that everyone else has a better experience than we did on Saturday and doesn't leave Merchant Square feeling insulted.
