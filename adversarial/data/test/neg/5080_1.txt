When you are in Las Vegas ofcourse you have to see a show of the fountains of Bellagio Hotel. What an great show! Every 15 minutes there's a beautiful show with ofcourse very proud songs of the USA. This is a really must see. \n\nYou will find this place in the middle of Las Vegas Strip Boulevard. Next to Ceasar Palace and Hotel Paris.
