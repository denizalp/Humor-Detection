I had a nice afternoon seeing my boyfriend. He was driving off to Montreal for work. When we met, we weren't hungry to do lunch. Instead, we visited a cafe, had tea and coffee, and snacked on some pastries. \n\nTwo hours later, I was driving home and hunger pangs hit. Where to go? I had originally wanted to got to the teriyaki place across from Michael-Angelo's. I went in there and the cook apologized profusely. He was having technical issues with his screen, meaning that the cash register and all debit\/credit payments were locked down. \n\nSo, I decided to try the marketplace. I have shopped here once before and loved the Portuguese egg tarts back then. They were fresh and yummy. \n\nI went for the hot (temperature-wise) foods. The variety is wonderful! I am recovering from a sore throat and hacking, mucus-laden cough. As a result, black pepper makes my throat worse. I could eat the fried rice, macaroni and cheese, stir-fried veggies, mushroom and peas, and coconut Thai pork. I was thrilled!\n\nPrices can be rather steep when you are paying for your food by the gram. My plate of food was $9.61. Despite the price, the food was flavourful. I sat in the seating area and enjoyed my meal. There's free wifi, too. \n\nAfter I was done, I needed to visit the women's washroom. It was clean and modern. The blue light means that you can enter and exit the restroom. Red means no -- that it's occupied. \n\nI got a six-pack of Portuguese egg tarts. They were in a fast clearance price. Yay! I also got a bag of avocados, as I need more good cholesterol in my diet. \n\nStaff are friendly. The store is clean and inviting. I'd definitely go back for hot food and groceries.
