I prepaid online with budget declining the upgrades and extras. I got the car twithout any problems. No waiting and no lines. The clerk seemed nice. He said he will upgrade me at no charge and I declined the extras and offers once again.  Their is where YOU need to BE CAREFUL! He summarizes contract with me. It sounded fine. No mention of upgrading the car, adding damage waivers, gps and other items . Those words were never mentioned so I initialed my name. THEN when I returned the car and got my receipt for over $200, that clerk charged me for everything! Now they say it signed the contract and its final!!
