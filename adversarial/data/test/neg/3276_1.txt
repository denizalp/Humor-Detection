If you have a craving for some Chinese food, come here. I like this place because it's one of the few Chinese restaurants on the strip that comes kind of close to tasting like it. And the price is reasonable considering where it is. Everytime I come here( I go to vegas 2 to 3 times a year), I've always had fast service. Of course it won't be as good as the restautants in the SF Bay Area though.\n\nI know they have some other 'non-Chinese' things here like sake but they have mostly Chinese dishes. This is what I ordered the last time I was there: \nHot and Sour Soup(kind of spicy but I like spicy)\nRed Won Tons(kind of plain but not bad)\nSpicy Beef Tripe(this was good although I wish it warm, didn't know it was a cold dish)\nSi Jiu Beef(this was good)
