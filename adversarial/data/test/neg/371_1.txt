First time here and we *LOVED* it. The Bi Bim Bop dol sot (hot pot) was fantastic.  I've been to a lot of places where they don't get the stone pot hot enough, so it doesn't crisp the rice at the bottom... the one sizzled for a long time and the rice was crispy and delicious.  The pan fried mondoo was very good... and the bon chon was great.  One of the better things I liked was the ko chu jun that was brought out... it was pasty and delicious.  Too many places nowadays bring out sriracha and try to pass that off as Korean hot sauce... not here... they give you the real stuff :)
