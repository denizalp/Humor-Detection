Love this place because it's open 24 hours. Most of the times we came its been full. There would always be a short wait. It's a typical Korean restaurant but has both floor seating and regular table seating. You must take off your shoes for floor seating. \n\nI've always ordered from the kbbq section of the menu, never actually ordered anything else. The BBQ sets usually come with the regular set of side dishes, two bowls of rice, a bowl of soup, some lettuce, two different sauces and the plate of meat. I find that the meat they have here is higher quality than most places. The beef is usually marbled and soft. The soup is strong and flavourful. I prefer the soybean soup over the other choice. The set is very filling for two people. \n\nI would really recommend this place as it's one of my favourites!
