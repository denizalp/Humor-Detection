LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. The first time we came here I was hooked! One of the most modern and beautiful hotels I've ever stayed here in Vegas. Awesome view of the strip, designer furniture, accessories, amenities, etc. Very clean and service is excellent. Not to mention the materials used makes THEhotel so sophisticated, from the marble, dark woods, plasma tv (in bedroom, bathrooms, elevators). \n\nNo strong or offensive odors that reek the hotel or casino like many other places. Cost of room is not the cheapest you can get, but definitely the best 'luxorious' quality for how much you pay. I'd give more like 4.5 stars just because the food is a bit overpriced, but delicious. So far my favorite hotel, we'll see what happens when I visit Vegas in May!
