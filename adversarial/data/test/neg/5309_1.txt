Finally made my way down to Communal Mule in effort to complete my list of go to cafe's in Toronto. I like this place, it's small and quaint with it's own individual charm. Has a slight retro-ish feel to the decor, I'll call it classic rustic minimalist. There is seating for solos, doubles and of course communally. The clientele seem down to earth. Sure you get the laptop crowd but not the business laptop crowd if you know what I mean. Many times I've passed the place I could see young woman reading books whilst sipping cappuccinos, a good omen.\n\nTheir coffee comes from Counter Culture Coffee in the US, a roadster I never knew of. I asked the barista what he recommend and he suggested their espresso done up in cappuccino. The final product was impressive. It's a very different tasting cappuccino, I can't say it falls in line with any common espresso flavor profile i.e. nutty\/cocoa or fruity. Caramel tones, perhaps some blackcurrant, something else I can't quite put taste to. Very good though, refreshingly different espresso blend that cuts through milk well. Espresso shots are done on their sexy exotic Mirage Espresso Machine by designer Kees van der Westen.\n\nI believe their baked goods are from Circles and Squares and since I am a fan of that bakery I give Communal Mule a thumbs up in the munchables department. \n\nOnly a lone staff member present when I was there. He was very friendly and more than willing to talk coffee shop as well as go into some details about their chosen coffee roaster.\n\nAll in all I am a fan and if you are in the neighborhood I suggest dropping in for some good coffee.
