If I can give this Taco Bell less than one star or negative stars I would.  A few different reasons made this place less than favorable. \nReason number one. I had a large order one of the orders I specifically asked for a simple soft chicken taco. The lady taking the order repeated it several times back to me. When I got home she might wear today surprise they had given me. I am very very allergic to beef. This was strike one. \nWhen I return to make them aware of their mistake and simply have them fix it, it was a complete disaster. No one wanted to take responsibility for the order. And when they finally did it they were going to charge me extra. This was only strike two\nAt this point, as you could imagine I was furious with them. The lady shoved the bag at me. And stated \"here's your food\"\nI went inside and asked for the general managers number they toss me a receipt and then just walked away. No one acknowledged that I was even standing there. I asked for a manager and they smirked and laughed.\nWhen the manager finally approached me he did not even introduce himself. He said that I just needed to come back tomorrow and talk to then.\nThis was strike two\nWhen I asked for an apology everyone at the store looked at me as if I were speaking a foreign language. It was highly embarrassing. I had to raise my voice for them to even acknowledge that I was speaking. Every time I talked they cut me off and made a condescending remark. \nOne of the cooks came from the back and started yelling and cursing at me also. We got into a screaming match in the store. Very unprofessional. Very out of character for me as well.\nI would never return to this place. It was embarrassing and upsetting.\nI will not be returning to this Taco Bell do you to the lack of professionalism and accuracy. This was not the first time that they had gotten the order wrong. Or spoke in a disrespectful way to a customer. So sad
