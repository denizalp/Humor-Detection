The worse full set I have ever got!!!!!! No curve to the nail got oval shaped and they are not even and they insisted on using white tips and they are all yellow. Just had them done 10 minutes ago.  it was $60!  I live in SF and I have never spent more than$30 for a new set!  Eshie was the worst nail tech I've had in my 25 years of having my nails done! You'll be sorry if you have this lady do your nails.
