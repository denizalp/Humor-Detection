We were a big group of 12 which means we've tried over 65% of the choices in the menu. Unfortunately, every single dish was SWEET! Is it an Indian sugar shack or what? Besides the decoration, there's nothing indian about this place and the \"fusion\" (by simply adding sugar), is not the proper way to re-invent the amazing food this country has to offer.
