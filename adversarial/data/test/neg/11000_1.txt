By far the best nachos in the neighborhood. I was however sadly disappointed to bring a friend here after raving about how good they are to discover that they don't offer nachos on their lunch menu. Our waitress was great and tried to convince the kitchen staff to make them for us anyway but they wouldn't budge.  We had our drinks and moved onto another pub for our lunch nacho feast. So for that I'm only giving them 3 stars.
