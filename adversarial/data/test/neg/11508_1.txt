Best BBQ I have ever had! Well worth the wait! We went on a Saturday morning and arrived at 10:15 (45 minutes before they open). There was already a long line, and the people in front had some large orders. As soon as we got to the counter, the owner offered us some meat right away since he knew we had been waiting for so long. \n\nIf you have not been here, I would recommend it to anyone!!
