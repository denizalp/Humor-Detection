It's average Mexican food served very quickly.  Roberto's is designed to rush Mexican food out as quickly as possible.  It's still pretty good and pretty cheap despite how fast it gets made.  My usual complaint from this place is that it's rushed out so much that often I get meals with cheese that isn't melted when it should be.  For example, if I buy nachos, I would normally expect the cheese to be melted, but it never is.  Instead I get cold cheese on some chips with beans, meat and other stuff.  I do like the flavor of their Carne Asada.  It can be Asada nachos, or an Asada plate, does not matter it tastes very good.  I haven't gotten to adventurous so Ive only ordered the chicken tacos, chicken enchiladas, Asada Nachos, Asada Burrito, and cheese enchiladas.  Everything was pretty good, but not too special.  Basically exactly what I expect from this type of place.
