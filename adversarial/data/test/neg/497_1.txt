Went in with my daughter tonight, and shared a small dairy free yogurt w\/ strawberries. Bought some cold brew that I am really looking forward too opening up tomorrow morning. They do let you sample before buying as well which is great. Staff is always. awesome. After our treat we played with the potato head family before heading home. Great night all together.
