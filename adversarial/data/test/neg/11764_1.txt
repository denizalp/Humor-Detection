I give the food 5 stars but the cleanliness and decor a 3. The place is an antique shop, but I use the word shop loosely. It looks like a very disorganized basement with junk. I have never seen anyone buy anything in here and frankly the place is so dirty that I'm not sure that you'd want to. I don't think that anything has ever been cleaned in there. Where you eat the food seems better, but I noticed a fly or two around some of the food. It is laid out in a home buffet style. I did notice one gross thing. Each table has its own placemats. I figured that between people they would change them...Nope! The hostess scratched the crumbs and such off the place mat and then seated other people there. Again, the place has great food but after waiting there for almost 30 minutes with the junk, I couldn't wait to leave.
