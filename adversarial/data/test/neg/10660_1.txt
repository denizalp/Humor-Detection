Love this store! Such a courteous and knowledgeable staff. You can tell how much they care about the health of your pets by their willingness to let you try some products before you buy, because they really want to help you get it right! As a new customer this helped me tremendously because my pet has health and diet issues.\n\nAlso, love the green grass-looking tile floor and the store is very bright and cheery. \nIt's a fun place.
