Go down the street versus wasting time at this Dunkin Donuts. Never have waffle cones (6 different occasions). Can't get a banana split because they are out (BTW Harris Teeter next door). \nIce Cream has ice crystals. Overcharging for Cronuts ( $2.75 ea.)  And they were stale.\n\nBreakfast Bagel had to be discarded. Stale and Hard as a Rock.\n\nConsider this your warning.
