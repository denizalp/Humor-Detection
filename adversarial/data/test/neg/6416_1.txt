I hate to say it but we must go to Ru San's 2-3 times a month. It's essentially the only sushi place we'll go to in Charlotte anymore. It's not high end, but it's great for what you pay for. There's a very casual atmosphere inside their huge Dilworth restaurant with plenty of booth, table, and bar seating. They're almost always busy but the turnover is pretty quick so you shouldn't have to wait all that long. The staff are very kind and attentive, always checking in to be sure you have what you need. The atmosphere is lively and kind of loud, but exactly as you'd expect for this sort of restaurant. \n\nThey have a very expansive menu with everything from your usual appetizers, a plethora a regular and special sushi rolls, nigiri, ramen, noodle dishes, and beyond. They have the more traditional Japanese beers and sake along with a good selection of local craft beers on tap and in bottles\/cans. \n\nWe always order three rolls that aren't actually on the menu anymore, but used to be on their specials. They're more than happy to continue making them for us. The miso soup and appetizers come out quickly and the main courses follow at just the right time. They have more basic rolls, healthier rolls, or gigantic deep fried rolls, depending on what you're looking for. I have yet to have anything that I didn't like. I do want to try their ramen, fried rice, and yakisoba at some point, but I always end up getting the same thing time after time. \n\nThey need to replicate this same restaurant in North Charlotte!
