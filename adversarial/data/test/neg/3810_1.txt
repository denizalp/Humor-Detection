I am a little upset at this place, I been there a few times over a 4 year period and a few times there when going through the car wash and the wheels start going down the metal track during the wash... they always bust the air valve on my tires.. this has been done in several different vehicles. I am not sure if it's the way they are build or what but it's becoming ridiculous. This last time I went it did the same thing to BMW... and I was sooooo pissed, honestly not coming back again. Plus the dryers there are horrible, the quality of the service has gone down a lot! Probably the best thing they have are the free vacuums.... but that's it!!! So try at your own risk! By the way my tire repair was $89 for a freakin $15.99 car wash!!! I keep calling the office but no answer I am NOT coming back so please refund me my Unlimited Wash Pass!!!!
