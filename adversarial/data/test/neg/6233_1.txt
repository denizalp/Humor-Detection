This is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. I went here recently with a friend for restaurant week. The food was delicious as always. Their menu changes frequently but I am always pleasantly surprised at their unique offerings. I would definitely recommend the bruschetta as an appetizer. I really enjoyed the Chile Con Tempeh as my main dish. The stuffed peppers in the middle are delicious! Their dessert options are great as well. This is a great and unique place to go if you're in the mood for something fresh and innovative.
