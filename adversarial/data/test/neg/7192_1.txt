Just found out this is one of Cameron Mitchell's restaurants.  I'm from Columbus and am a huge fan of Ocean Club and The Pearl.  The salmon and lobster bisque were the highlights of my meal.  The bisque was one of the best I've had.  The atmosphere on the fancy side and the price point is on the higher end.  They have complimentary Valet and are located next to the Doubletree in Beachwood, near the junction of Chagrin and 271.  I can't speak to the steak here since I don't eat beef but they do serve seafood, chicken and lamb.
