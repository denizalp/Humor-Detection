We live in the neighborhood and have been enjoying all the local restaurants--saw the Wild Thaiger on Check Please and decided to try it--we eat out often and had never been there. It wasn't crowded but the few booths were taken--the hostess took us to a table directly under a spot light--we politely asked if we could be moved to one of the many empty table that were directly next to it that were not quite so bright--her answer \"no I am seating you here!\"--there was no one else waiting--there were at least 5 empty tables in the same vicinity out of the spot light--no sorry--no explanation--. We just smiled and said no thank you we will be leaving--and she said--okay.  If the the rest of the service is anything like the Hostess we escaped a less then enjoyable experience--we moved on to Switch where we are always\n greet amiably---too many wonderful restaurants midtown to tolerate rudeness---and many more new ones opening up--I am sorry for the owners however to have a young lady represent them so poorly.
