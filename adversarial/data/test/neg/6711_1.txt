Had pedicure and gel manicure with Nga and she did a great job!  Showed her a picture that other places couldn't do because they thought they needed a sticker, but she free handed it and my nails came out looking better than the picture!  Had them done the day of my sisters wedding and everyone was complimenting me.\n\nNice massage chairs too and decent prices.  The ladies are all very sweet and friendly.
