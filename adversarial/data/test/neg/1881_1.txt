I've been to several Pita Jungle's in the Valley.\nThis one breaks the mold, I felt like I was in a 5 star restaurant.\nThe decor, and the food presentation was 10 fold any other P.J.\n\nMy spanikapita was presented beautifully!!\nTurkey Burger, perfect.\nEven my daughter ALWAYS has the chipotle chicken lavosh pizza, and it tasted better than any other.......Why is this one so different?\n\nOur server had the personality of a wet mop though, he was one piece of this puzzle I didn't get.
