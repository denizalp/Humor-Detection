NEVER AGAIN WILL I EVER STEP FOOT IN THIS ESTABLISHMENT! Attitudes in overabundance! Called ahead, owner agreed to mani & pedi BUT immediately upon arrival were told by same manager that we had to choose one, plus they were pushing pedicures. Well, we BOTH wanted gel manicures. Once they reluctantly agreed, we were screamed at and told that one of us needed to go to the back station. My daughter wanted to wait on Polly so I bit the bullet and went. I was immediately reduced from a gel manicure to a gel polish change. WOW! SO MUCH FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE! When she got up to grab her tools, she stated, \"But everybody's different, Tony\" after she had spoke to him in her native language then when she returned with tool, she dropped the cuticle tool on the floor out of the sterile pack. The nasty girl, rather than obtaining a new one, simply rinsed it off at the sink and dried it with a paper towel. Hmmm, it's not surgery so I let it slide...Then nail tech was scraping my cuticles with buffing block and jabbing them with cuticle tool while removing old gel polish. I took it and didn't say a word! Then when another customer sat next to me, the other tech gave my wallet and phone to my tech. I asked for it and she said, \"No, it can go right here\", placing it next to her. I took my wallet and cell and put it in my chair behind me then the rude tech laughed out loud and said, \"Ok, WOW!\" This is where I ended the service, nothing had been done beyond removal of old gel polish-see pic for proof! I asked how much I owed and she tried to say, \"a gel polish change is...\" and that's where I stopped her! I said, \"You have not completed the job, how much do I owe you for what you've done?\" She charged $8! She got $8.00 and not a cent more! FOR GOODNESS SAKE GO BACK TO SCHOOL AND REDO CUSTOMER SERVICE PORTION!
