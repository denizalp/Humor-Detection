First off the picture for this park is incorrect. That picture shows one of the Tower Parks in the Vistas. Not the Vistas Park itself.\n\nThis park really shines! Literally blinding! The maintenance is superb. Always clean & the grass is always green (when it's not summertime).\n\nThe park is always full of people! Joggers. ballers, mothers! They're here! Watching little league, tennis-a-racketing, football fieldin, bar-b-qin'!\n\nThis park's got it all.\n\nDownside was that the lights were off at 10pm! C'mon, it's summertime, & I'm still active! :]
