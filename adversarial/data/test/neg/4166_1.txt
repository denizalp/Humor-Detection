Love love this place, food is great, it's kind of a tapas place , they do catered for a younger crowd, sit and mingle kind if this. It's is also kind of a tapas place very small plate, but very tasty. I love the fried pickle, my favorite. Price is very reasonable 3 of us and we order a few plates and my husband had 1 glass of wine and our bill was like $45.00. I  just wish the had parking, cause I was pregnant and the walking distant was not that close from where we park.
