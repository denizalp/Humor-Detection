For the first time, I'd say I can't wait to return to a pho place not because of the amazing food, but the hospitality and the charmingless of a pho restaurant. \n\nCute decor, round wooden chopsticks in individual package; Vietnamese music, AMAZING tea, cute teapot, Spring Rolls on the house; individual dipping sauce. It's like you stumbled upon a Vietnamese household and you are the owner's old friend. By the end of the dinner we were also given sweet sliced oranges and persimmon . This is by far the best pho experience i'd had.
