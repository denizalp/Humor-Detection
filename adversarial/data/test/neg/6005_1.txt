Awesome grocery store with aisles upon aisles of products to choose from as well as freshly prepared and cooked dishes in the back! Being from Queens, NYC this is what I love to see when I seek out a place to eat. Some of the best food I've eaten has been in grocery stores, markets, temples, etc. Laos Market is definitely worth a visit and one of the many reasons I love Las Vegas for being such a culturally diverse city with amazing options for food.
