Paid 40 bones and entered food heaven.  I came during the right season.  Steaks, chicken, dessert (oh the desserts).  I had everything that I completely blacked out.  All I remembered was I juicy and sweet them chocolate covered strawberries were.  This was the only buffet I tried during my brief stay so I can't compare it to other places in Vegas.  For 40 bucks though, I believe I did get my money's worth and I am very satisfied with it.  The service was excellent.  The selection was plentiful and thats important because I don't like seeing the same boring stuff over and over again.  Nice to have a great selection of food.
