Worst food and service ever. I do not recommend this place at all. The menudo was smelly didn't have enough meat with a bunch of hominy. We walked in an nobody greeted us or told us you had to order at the counter. After waiting for someone to come we finally figured it out. You think someone could have said something. But no, no hi no bye no thank you nothing. We will not be back.
