What a great experience!  This was my first time being in a Michaels since high school, I think.  My sister sent me in to get an item for an arts and crafts project I decided to take on for myself.  I went in there the typical guy -- completely clueless as to what I need, wandering the store with a piece of paper with the product my sister told me about written on it.  It wasn't easy finding an employee that could help me out, but once I did, the guy had a 10 minute conversation about my project and showed me all of my options.  Whereas I had trouble getting across my vision at one of Michaels competitors, this guy totally understood my goal and steered me in the right direction.  Thanks!
