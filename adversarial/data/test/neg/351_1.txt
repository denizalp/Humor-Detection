I love my vehicle but the process was full of unfulfilled promises and lots of hidden fees. If you do business with this dealership, ask TONS of questions, get things in writing and explained in full even off you are told it's included ask for details and ask to have all fees explained up front. There were several things we were promised that were not delivered and several fees that were \"hidden\" very discreetly in the paperwork and never explained. I would not personally give them my business again.
