We came here for my son's birthday lunch to satiate his meat cravings.  Service was polite and appropriately attentive.  The meat options that came around to the tables were good- beef, sausage, chicken were all deliciously seasoned and tasty.  Buffet and dessert options were okay- just okay.  We ate a lot, but could have enjoyed a greater variety despite the limits of lunch service options here. We have eaten Brazilian BBQ lunch at Pampa as well and did note the fewer buffet selections here compared to Pampa.  I tried the Brazilian coffee- yum but strong, so be prepared!\nNot sure we'd come back here for Brazilian BBQ as preferred the greater variety at Pampa- but wouldn't be disappointed if we do.
