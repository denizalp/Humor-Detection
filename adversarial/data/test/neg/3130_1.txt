stopped here late one morning for some food because we didn't feel like getting earl of sandwich or panda in the planet hollywood area, and we were kinda feeling pizza.  i have to say, they say it is the best pizza and all that jazz (but what place doesn't), but i was kinda let down.  all the pizza is thin crust, which i am not a huge fan of, but the crust being that thin was still soggy under the ingredients which was a turn off.  the toppings were pretty good, and there were a good amount of them, but lets face it, nobody like soggy pizza.  the staff was cool though, and the owner came out and checked up on us and had a small conversation with us which was a nice touch\n\noverall, it was decent, but i don't see myself coming back here anytime soon.  round table or numero uno is a much better choice in my opinion (not sure of those are in the vegas area though)
