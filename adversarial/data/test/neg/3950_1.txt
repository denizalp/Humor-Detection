Andy and company were extremely professional, always available and just awesome to deal with. We got our pool resurfaced with Pebble Sheen and had our deck rebuilt & painted. Also went to their office to pick out new pool tiles and the staff were super helpful. Their After Sales service was also excellent. (thanks Andy!)\n\nWould recommend to anyone in the future. The experience was absolutely above and beyond what anyone could ask for.\n\nWe love our new pool. Thank you Swimming Pool Service & Repair!
