Love this place! You can tell that everyone who works here has a real passion for animals. We recently needed to find a home for our snake Rosie. We spoke to Logan and he was so pleasant and willing to help. I have bought fish and plants from here and enjoy looking at the dog accessories. They carry some unique items and have an impressive fish selection. Love this place!
