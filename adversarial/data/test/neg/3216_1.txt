Yes! Dr. M rocks and I am stoked to be his patient. I went to have some fillings and he (I can't believe this is going to come out of my mouth) but he quick and I barely noticed he was in there. That's how good he is!!! \n\nI have one more appointment on Thursday and am looking forward to laying back in that massage chair and get some work done. I think my fear of dentist's may have been lifted. \n\nOh and his staff! They all rock! \n\nThanks Southview. I heart you and my grill thanks you~!
