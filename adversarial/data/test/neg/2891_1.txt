Tonight I went into Walmart after my mustang not being able to start due to a bad battery. We purchase our batteries through Walmart to get the good warranty that they offer along with the convenience offered 24\/7. When going in the team members were not able to help but did get a manager that would be able to. The ASM, Drake, came up to help which is when I showed him my reciept and had the battery available to return. Drake rather argue with me stating that he was unable to help which i then asked for his boss to be contacted. At this point he wanted to get an attitude with me and was not willing to help me anymore. This is not a way to get along with customers to come back. I will now take my business elsewhere and rather pay the extra few dollars to a company that has a willing staff and management to help with purchasing items.
