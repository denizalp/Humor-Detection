All the parents may hate on this place for shushing their kids, but I appreciate that this is not a Chuck E. Cheese. Games are srs bsnss here!(Also I noticed the noisiest people in there were not the kids, but their parents. Go fig.)\n\nI got my Tetris on, that's all I care about. A buck lasted me over an hour and a half and I made it to the top of the not-pre-programmed fake score part of the high score table. (They seem to turn off the machines overnight as the scores were reset the next time I came in.)\n\nThe hubs killed at Ms. Pac Man, as always.\n\nAlso, I loved the interactive flying bicycle game, Prop Cycle, from 1996. Way better exercise than Wii Fit. You have to pedal like a mother to work that thing. (Own your very own for only $4695 online! A steal compared to a DDR machine, priced at $15,000, and this one has a real ride-on thingie!)
