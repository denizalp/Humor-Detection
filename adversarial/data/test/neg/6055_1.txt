Our friends end suggested this please and we all enjoyed a great lunch. The hot wings are OK, sauce was ok, not quite a buffalo taste I've had at other places. Still worth getting. We each had a bowl which were all tasty. Didn't care for the big broccoli stems, some weren't fully cooked. The desert was very good soy cream.
