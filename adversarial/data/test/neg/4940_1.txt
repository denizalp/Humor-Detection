Best BBQ in all of AZ. We like it so much that we get our Thanksgiving Turkey from here.\n\nGo early, atleast 45 mins before they open to get a good spot in line. \n\nIf you think waiting in line for 1+ hrs is not worth it you are wrong. You will not find better BBQ meat in AZ. \nDo yourself a favor and go atleast once. \nStaff is always friendly and welcoming.
