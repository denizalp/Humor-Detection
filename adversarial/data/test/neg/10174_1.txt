Fastest service I ever got at a St.Louis, and on a Tuesday too!\nHostess was courteous and offered us seating options, which I really appreciated, and the servers and waitresses were very nice. \nThe food was on our table within 10 minutes of ordering and we were out in less than an hour. \n\nOrdered the Hot & Honey wings and my boyfriend got the Sweet and Spicy Sriracha. I expected Hot & Honey to taste like hot honey garlic, but it was more of a spicy and sweet BBQ flavour, so I asked for some honey garlic sauce on the side. The Sweet and Spicy Sriracha was really good. Both were 2 flames and I don't disagree. \n\nDefinitely coming back to this location. I mean, Tuesday Wings and Movies? Heck yeah.
