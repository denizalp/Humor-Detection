Never judge a place based on others review! Jose (our waiter) such a humble soul and very helpful! our food.... Oh laaaawd have mercy yum yum for me tum tum! Biscuits and gravy almost orgasmic! Yes sausage in the gravy HUGE chunks, the gravy nice and thick and soooo flavorful! I substituted mash for fried potatos and oooh boy it bust all my jaws!! Coffee yes coffee off the hook goodness! Thank you Hash House for a awesome sauce experience... Aloha from Hula Land
