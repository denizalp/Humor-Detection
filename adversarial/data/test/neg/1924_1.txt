I ate here 3 times in 3 days during a work trip. Yep. I told this to a work associate, and she recently emailed me asking for recommendations since I'm basically an expert on the menu here now. So here is my email back:\n\nHahaha OMG YASSS so good! Definitely go. Haha so embarrassing I went 3 times in 3 days - but at all different times I swear! Lunch, Dinner, and Brunch.\nSo, first, obviously - the fried chicken and waffles. Delicious - the fried chicken is really good, but it's the combination with the kinda savory waffle + maple syrup, plus there's watermelon on the side...I ate it with my hands. No utensils. I had it at dinner, but I think it's on the menu no matter what time of day. There is an awesome salad that is only on the lunch menu - a low+slow smoked chicken salad. Like so good - it's more chicken than salad though, not a lot of lettuce (which I was kinda happy about) and there is a slice of pan-fried cornbread on the bottom that like soaks up the dressing. That smoked chicken is no joke man. The cornbread is good, but their biscuits are good too - I wouldn't be able to say which is better. The plain biscuits come with a homemade apple jam that is really good. At dinner I also tried the short ribs - which were good, but not anywhere near the chicken items so I'd stick to chicken haha. There is a fried green tomato BLT appetizer (pork belly!) that I got 2 out of 3 times haha. I didn't get any cocktails but they all sounded good.\n\nClearly I love food a little too much. Let me know if you like it!\n\nSo, the bartenders told me they were thinking of opening a location on the west coast - either LA or Hawaii. I hope they choose Hawaii bc if it's LA, I will overdose on fried chicken.
