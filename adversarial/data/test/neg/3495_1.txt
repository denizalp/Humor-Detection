We had dinner at Border Grill on a Saturday night.  The place was about 2\/3 full, but the patio, where we ate, was completely full.  It was a nice cool evening, and they had the heaters on.  We were directly underneath them, and I actually found myself a little warm.  Not uncomfortably so, but I definitely was noticing the heat. \n\nThat wasn't an issue however; I clearly enjoyed the meal.  To start, you are brought 3 different salsas and chips.  Of these, the green was my favorite, although I liked both red salsas as well.  Our table of 5 decided to get the queso fundido to start, and 2 of them got guacamole.  The guacamole was good, certainly fresh.  It could have used some heat for my taste.  The queso was FANTASTIC.  Made with chorizo, it got crispy on the bottom where the cheese melted against the hot metal bowl.  I seriously considered ordering another serving of this, it was that good.  Crispy, melty, a little salty from the sausage.  Just a fantastic cheese dish.  \n\nThe meal only got better from there.  The wife had the short rib enchiladas, which were great.  Loved the sauce, and they were covered with a ton of veggies.  But, the showstopper was my meal:  the gaucho steak.  This is a large ribeye (cooked to a textbook medium rare, by the way) on top of a HUGE bed of maybe the best chilaquiles I've ever eaten and served with a roasted onion half and roasted garlic.  If ever a dish was composed well, this is that dish.  All of this stuff went together fantastically well, you could get a perfect bite with all 4 components.  The chilaquiles were soaked in sauce and served with what appeared to be 2 different types of cheese.  The garlic and onion were roasted long enough to become sweet, flavorful and soft, but not so long that they were burnt in anyway.  \n\nI've been to many of the best steakhouses in Vegas.  While the gaucho steak isn't going to make me forget the reserve ribeye at Carnevino, it certainly is one of the more memorable steaks I've had on the strip.  Can't recommend this enough if you are a beef person.\n\nFor dessert, the table had the tres leches cake and the chocolate cake (can't remember the exact menu title).  Both were good, but I found the chocolate cake to be far superior.\n\nService was good, they leave a carafe of water on your table, which was nice.  And, when that was empty, they brought a replacement very quickly.  We'll definitely return, and I 100% will order the gaucho steak next time.
