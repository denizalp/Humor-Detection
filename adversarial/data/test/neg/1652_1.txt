I brought in a bike tire for repair because new tubes kept going flat. Within minutes they had it pulled apart, discovered a metal bur, filed it down, and installed a new tube with the existing tire. I purchased a few other items while I was there and left paying less than $18. I did not find them pricey at all. The time and hassle they saved us from doing it ourselves was priceless! Very knowledgeable, friendly, and fast.\n\nNo bike parking because the City of Surprise prohibits it.
