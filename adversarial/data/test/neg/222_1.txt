Love this little mom and pop shop! Their handmade fresh veggie pizza is my favorite! With artichoke, sweet bell peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes, zucchini, onions and spinach. I always add pineapple to it for that extra sweetness!! Oh my gosh it's so good!! Amanda, the tall girl at the counter is always my pizza maker or delivery girl. She's like a one man show. But she is so sweet, and delivers the greatest customer service. She is the heart of this restaurant and she is why I keep coming back!! \n\nThis is on my top 3 pizza spots in Vegas!!
