It has been years, but I was in a bind -- and they were friendly and happy to help. I needed to swap a pulley onto a water pump for a DIY boat generator repair, but I had neither the correct puller or the shop press. I called around and most places wouldn't get involved with DYI work or a boat part (even if it was just like a truck part). A couple were willing to do it, but it would be a few days -- it just wasn't a priority for them. I brought it into Pep Boys. They took it back and in two minutes came back with it, pulley swapped. It was, quite literally, great service with as smile! Thanks much!
