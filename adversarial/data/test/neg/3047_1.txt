Expect to wait for a long, long time. I waited for about 20 minutes in the waiting room, and then another 45(!!!) in the actual patient room before the doctor came in. Her front desk staff was friendly. There was a woman hysterically crying in the room next door and it really stressed me out. When the doctor finally came in, she was very very curt. No warmth in her mannerisms. Everything felt very clinical and it was over. I hate to go to gynecologists and would never come here again. Mainly because you need to wait an hour before you even see her and she doesn't really have a great bedside manner.
