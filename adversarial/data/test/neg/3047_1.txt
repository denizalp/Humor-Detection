I was told that this is a MUST on every first timer's trip to Montreal so I had to stop by.\nI was pleasantly surprised by such a simple yet delicious meal. Although I would never eat bologna as an adult, it was somehow okay in this sandwich. The sandwich itself is nothing special, I think all the hype is about the location and ambiance. I was able to get a seat at the counter and the staff and regulars were very nice. It's definitely an interesting place if you are in the area.
