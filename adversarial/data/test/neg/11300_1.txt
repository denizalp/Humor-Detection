This was the only place near the strip that I knew with out a doubt I could get pho. I read menu after menu for 5 days looking for pho. The price was ok... for vegas. 2 bowls of chicken pho was just over $30. I didnt Care for the chicken itself. But it was basically as expected.  Clean atmosphere. Fast service. But it was served food court style. Pick up at the counter when it was done. The Rio is pretty far off the strip. So you have to taxi or catch the right bus unless you want to walk across the freeway.
