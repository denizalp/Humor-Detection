Excellent food with excellent service!  We had lunch there today and thoroughly enjoyed it.  We both had the tortilla soup, which was really tasty...I had the sicilian sandwich and my wife had the strawberry fields salad...both were delicious.  We shared the humongous peach\/pear cobbler for dessert and had to be restrained from licking the bowl clean...it was THAT good.  \n\nThis restaurant has only been in its location since September but they've got a good thing going, so give them a try...you won't be disappointed.  They have a nice, varied menu of soups, salads, sandwiches,pastas and appetizers - something for everybody. Five stars from us!
