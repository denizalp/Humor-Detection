Great concept...why didn't I think of this??! We had a very nice experience here, although the line was long, it moved quite quickly thanks to a quick staff. Don't think that quick equals rushed and hurried, it wasn't. The pizza was really good, the wood fired ovens make a big difference. Pieology doesn't even come close, that stuff tastes like bad frozen pizza. Blaze does it right.
