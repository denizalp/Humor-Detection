I have been here a few times now and am never disappointed.  They have great lunch specials... you can choose from a  pizza + soup or salad or a sandwich + soup or salad for $8.95.  Today I chose the Roasted Mushroom pizza with house-made mozzarella,pancetta, green onion + a chopped salad... so yummy!  I have also had the Schreiners Sicilian Sausage pizza with roasted fennel, house-made mozzarella,\ntomato sauce.  Like i said ... never been disappointed:)  the service is always great too.  So go check it out!:)
