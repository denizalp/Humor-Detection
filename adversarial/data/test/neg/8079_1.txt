This was my first visit to this Beauty Bar.  I usually go elsewhere but wanted to try somewhere closer to home today for convenience.\nI was a walk-in but ended up scheduling for an hour later than my arrival due to them being a bit busy & I wanted a few things done.  They do take walk-ins but sounds like they get a lot of appointments & this may be a smart idea next time.\nWhen I re-arrived for my appointment I was taken in right away.  They were super quick but did a great job!  I had some waxing done, shellac manicure & a classic pedicure in just over an hour.  The price was pretty reasonable I think in comparison to other nail salons in Toronto (just over $75 for everything).\nThe place was really clean & the staff were super nice as well.  I will definitely be going back here again.
