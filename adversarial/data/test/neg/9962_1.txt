Working one building over, Nook is extremely close by and convenient, especially on a crazy busy day in the office where a lunch time stroll is not an option. All the sandwiches, pastries, soups and salads I've tried are fresh and delicious. Their breakfast options are also quick and satisfying on mornings where I'm rushing to catch a morning meeting. The dining area is nice and cozy. The price can be a couple bucks more than a chain sandwich place like Subway or Quiznos, but the variety and convenience is worth the premium. And based on the lunchtime line ups, I suspect many office workers in the vicinity would agree.
