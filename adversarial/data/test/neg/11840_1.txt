Customer service rocked!! We had our sons birthday party here two weeks ago and I was beyond impressed. I redeemed a Groupon for this party and made my reservation over the phone and the team member was very helpful. \n\nThe day of the party I was greeted at the door and staff immediately helped me with my gift bags and cake. They literally made the experience stress free and the whole family had tons of fun. The facility was very clean, they provided us with socks (included in the birthday party package), have many play areas and they greeted each one of our guests as they arrived. Our party host was great as well and to top it off at the end of our party they surprised us and gave my son a Rockin Jump tshirt that they personalized with his party theme. I love this place and will be back for many more times to come. Thank you for the great service Rockin Jump!!
