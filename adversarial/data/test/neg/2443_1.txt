T has been doing my hair since 1999 (since before Fringe) and I and my hair can't imagine life without her! Over the years we have done gentle relaxers, various colors (including bright purple last year!), extensions, and all kinds of amazing cuts and styles. She always keeps the health of my hair in mind throughout all this, AND she's one of the sweetest people I know.
