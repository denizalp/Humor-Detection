Great museum, lots of things to learn, and always friendly to everyone who visits. I do like to go to our science museum in Houston, but this one is my second favorite because of the variety of activities and things to do. There are about four or five levels of exhibits and areas of science to explore. They also have a theater for shows, and reasonable admission prices. \n\nWe went here on our first stop in Phoenix, and automatically we were hooked. Of course it was on a day where day camps were exploring, but we made the best use out of our visit. I enjoyed the prehistoric section where there are facts about dinosaurs and fossils. I was also impressed with the health and human body portion of the museum. Tons of facts about the human body. There is also an astronomy section and ocean life to explore when you go visit. \n\nAdmission is $15-20 if I can remember correctly. You can also sign up to be a member for reasonable prices. I would definitely go back, and I would see what other museums are around the Phoenix area.
