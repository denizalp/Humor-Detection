I've never had a bad cut with any of the stylists at Gianna Christine but I've really got to recommend Shannelle.  When I moved away from my last beloved stylist, I really didn't think I'd find anyone else I was comfortable with.  I thought I was doomed to trims and the same stylist until I finally got back to him.  Now I've got the best short cut I've ever had in my life and actually feel comfortable taking more chances.  Heck, I might even go back to getting it coloured... who knows? \n\nThe salon is beautifully done.  It's a relatively small space but never feels cramped or anything less than airy and immaculately clean.  Like at any Aveda salon I've been to, I can always start my visit with that wonderful tea and walk out feeling gorgeous and refreshed.
