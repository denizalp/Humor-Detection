Had lunch with family- started OK, chips & dip\/queso good. Server started off spilling creamy jalapeno sauce down my sons back and chair- didn't make much of an apology. They don't give side plates out so you end up spilling salsa and queso all over the table. Server wasn't that friendly and patient with people not familiar with menu. I rang ahead and asked if they had many gluten free options (for my daughter) and they said they did- turns out all they really had was some salad items, corn tortillas and cheese- not even rice.\nThen they got my sons order wrong - twice, we were finished before he started. Of the adults 2 liked their food and two unimpressed. I had fish tacos- very mediocre and bland, reminded me of 80's style tex-mex- big disappointment given hype of how different they are. Finished the meal with server setting to-go box in spilled salsa mess on the table- waiter needs to find a different job, seriously. Waiter made no effort to right the spills- food mistakes- not coming back.
