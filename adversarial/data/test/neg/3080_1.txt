I am very disappointed in their customer service.  They messed up our first order and had to re-do the bathroom counter top.  The delivery and installation has been delayed for the second time - with no communication from them at all.  If we get any info from them, it is because we have to call them.  They now say they can install NEXT Friday, putting our move-in date over a month behind!  The installers were very nice, but their customer service is very lacking.  I would not recommend them at all!
