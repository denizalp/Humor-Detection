Ambiance and setting were superb. Food was great. Service was very, very good. My wife has food allergies which will stymie all but the very best waitstaff. Our server warmed up to the task and she soon had some truly delicious braised short rib in front of her. I enjoyed an awesome preparation of Halibut with Mexican shrimp and chorizo. \nThroughout the meal we commented on how beautiful the patio and dining room must be once the weather cools and into the Holidays. We'd love to bring our three daughters and their Significant Others!
