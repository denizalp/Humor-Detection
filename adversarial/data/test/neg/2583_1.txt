This is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. Everytime that I have eaten here, everything has been delicious and the staff is very courteous. If you dont like Spicy food, this is NOT the place for you. Even the food on the menu without the pepper next to it has a little spice. My favorites are the hard chicken tacos, carnitas, and adovada short ribs. If you save enough room, you have got to try the sopapilla with ice cream. You'll thank me later.
