HUGE slices, so be hungry. Good deal- you can get a slice, a garlic knot, and a beer for 10.99! Or with a soda for like 8.99! That is cheap for Vegas and by the end of it fully satisfied. Good pizza, I've had better but still very good. Garlic knots are the bomb. Small business so expect lines, boo hoo you have to wait, it's Vegas, stop complaining and enjoy the ride.
