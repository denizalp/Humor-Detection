Looks like a good place to eat. Friendly bartenders. Small-ish. Good decor, for what it is. Has a bar (only bar in this area of the C gates). They are flex on when they close, apparently. On the day I found myself here, they stopped food service just as I walked up (right before 8pm), but the bar was still open. Last call at the bar was 8:45pm. Big bonus: There are outlets at the bar so you can charge up your devices. Friendly bartender and outlets won me over. Wish I could've tried the pizza.
