I am not sure I have ever had mole before or if maybe I have had it and not liked it so stayed away.  Whatever, I did like the mole on my chicken enchiladas.  The enchiladas themselves were soso.  Quite often in Mexican restaurants I have to mix the rice and beans together to get them down for several reasons.  This time the rice and beans each stood on their own merits.  The chips were good and served warm.  I preferred the red salsa, even though it was hotter, as it had more flavor to me.  It is sort of runny and is a bit hard to chase around the little plate that comes for that purpose.  The enchiladas came with all white meat, my favorite, but I could have done without the chunk of cartilage and two bone pieces I found.\n\nMany of the customers there during lunch on a Friday seemed like regulars.  I don't think I heard a single word of Spanish from either customers or employees the whole time I was in there.  The dining room with it's flagstone floors has a nice comfy feel to it.  There were two waitresses that seemed like they were working as a team and I didn't wait long or want for anything.  The parking lot holds small cars easier than trucks but there were several work trucks in there.\n\nA good solid place to eat if you are in the area but not a destination place from far away.
