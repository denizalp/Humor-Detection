Fantastic flavors, quality service, squishy seating just about sums up my experience. Went here on Saturday night and enjoyed the overall experience. My friend and I started with Miso soup. Then, when looking at the menu, my friend raved about sea bass. I said I wasn't sure if I've had it... this time was memorable. Before we ordered, we asked the waitress what she recommended. She mentioned the Sea Bass and Miso robato to share and a few rolls. We picked one roll not on the menu and the BoBo Brazil. Nom Nom Nom We loved it all. The skewers of sea bass were delicate with nicely flavored sauce. It came with giant corn pieces that were sort of fun and different. The BoBo Brazil roll was very nice - I think I had this particular roll at the Chicago location, the Kobe beef gets me. The sauce on this one was a bit tangy and citrus-y. I think there were The roll that was not on the menu had tempura shirmp inside with crab on top with thinly sliced avocado. The flavors and textures were incredible. Highly recommend this place for a nice meal. My only issue was with the seating. The hostess had to literally shift over the table each tiem she sat a new couple - we were in a tight area full of tables for two. We came on a busy Saturday night, so I also recommend reservations.
