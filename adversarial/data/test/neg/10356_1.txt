A bit disappointed with this offering after having quite high expectations.  Lobster roll tasted good but was pretty small.  It was just about 8 pm when I received my order and the the fries were stale (got take out otherwise I would have returned it).  At $15 for this meal I think I have quite a bit of other options I will be going after.
