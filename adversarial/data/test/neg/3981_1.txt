I tried the bacon avocado burger and it was just okay. The kale side salad it came with was the single most flavorless salad I've ever eaten at a restaurant. I also tried some of the prime rib cheesesteak and it was nothing special. The au jus it came with was really thick which just didn't go right with the sandwich. I also had the duck wings which were made with a basic hoisin sauce, also nothing special. The only part of this restaurant that I really liked was their decor.
