An excellent pizza parlor with personal attention and moderate prices. The owner check with you at your table, greets you and your family and everybody seems to love him. While we were there, a stylist from a nearby business stopped by and had a salad and some pasta. Always a good sign the neighborhood has him as a pivotal business.
