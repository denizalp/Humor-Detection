one of the few a la carte hotpot places in toronto. what their specialty is was apparently the premium level meats. so we came here ordering wagyu beef. the top grade one. and the berkshire pork which for those who know pork is the kobe beef of pork. we also ordered an assortment of handmade balls and veggie platter as well watermelon juice. the one thing that rubbed me the wrong way was charging for dipping sauces. even though it is 49 cents a person. it really seems cheap of a restaurant that is selling premium. sauce to hotpot is like utensils to eating. charging extra for dipping sauce in hot pot. is like charging extra for soy sauce and wasabi at a sushi restaurant. that is just stupid. outside of that. the beef was good. although not anyyhing that blows my mind. and the pork was good. but again did not blow my mind. the lamb and beef tongue we had ordered was below standards of even ayce hot pot places. which in my mind is kind of inexcusable for a place that is a la carte. quality is supposed to be above everything. my 3 star rating is pretty on the nose in that this restaurant is not one i would go out of my way to try again. or to avoid. it is meh at best. and if you want to try premium meats in hot pot sure. try this place but be prepared for it to cost you as much as a ayce place anyway it cost us about 51 dollars a person with tax and tip. and thats ordering an assortment to try everything. definitely not worth the money.
