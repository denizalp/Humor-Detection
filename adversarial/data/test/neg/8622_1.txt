Nice selection of small and large plates. Our table of 4 shared 2 orders of the fried chicken, and it was very tasty, although mine could have benefitted from a little more meat on the bones. \n\nFor my main meal I had a burger and a kale side. The burger was very tasty but I was more surprised by how much I enjoyed the kale. It wasn't over prepared -- simply warmed with some oil and maybe a little spices. It was delicious. I am a recent kale convert and i typically prefer to disguise it in a smoothie, so this should be considered high praise. :)\n\nI will remember this restaurant fondly as my dining mates were 3 lovely former coworkers who I had not seen in 15 years. We had a thoroughly enjoyable time reminiscing, and our waitress never rushed us to free up the table. Thanks for contributing to a memorable experience.
