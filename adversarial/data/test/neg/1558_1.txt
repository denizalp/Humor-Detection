This place used to be Nob Hill which was \"famous\" for their lobster pot pie but glad to see some new blood in town.\n\nWe had a business dinner here and ordered off a fixed menu.  For starters we had the choice of Ceasar salad or heirloom tomatos with barata cheese and balsamic.  I went with the tomatoe salad and thought it was fresh and delicious.  \n\nSecond course option was lamb meatballs or lobster risotto, I opted for the lamb meatballs.  There were 4 meatballs in a marinara sauce.  The meatballs were a little on the dry side, but overall the dish was pretty tasty.\n\nThird course was choice of half a lime chicken, steak, and one other choice.. I went with the steak.  Portion wise I'd say it was about 4-6 ounces, served on toasted baguette.  \n\nDessert was a plate of 3 items, choc mousse cake, cheese cake, and a choc dipped macaroon.  All 3 were good, my favorite being the cheese cake.\n\nCoffee rounded out the meal and boy it was very very good coffee.\n\nAs most have noted, it's small plates mainly mean for sharing.  As far as the meal went, while I thought the portions were small, at the end I was completely satisifed and actually quite surprised at how delicious everything was.  Did I mention the coffee was fantastic?\n\nI'd be willing to eat here again on my own dime.
