This place is my go to lunch spot. From their perfectly cooked fish on the Blackened Tilapia Caesar salad, to the tender juicy pork in the Pernil Tacos, I love this place! \nThe location is a bit small but the food is worth waiting for. \n\nService at lunch is spot on and all the servers are friendly and can answer any question you may have. Parking kinda sucks at lunch time unless you work downtown, you can park in the garage under Cityscape but get there early or you will be driving around for a while looking for a non-reserved spot (this is the only reason they get 4 stars).
