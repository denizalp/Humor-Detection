There are so many Italian Restaurants in Toronto.\nMake sure you stop here at least once. We stopped in for a quick pizza and a beer. Well, that didn't work... a pizza, 2 specials and several beers later, we are stuffed at the table as I write this review.\nThe food is incredible! Pasta fresh made in house. Everything was perfect.\nIf they have the grilled octopus, trust me, get it!\nVery surprised and an unexpected delight. Coming from The heat of Scottsdale Az, this was a fantastic treat.
