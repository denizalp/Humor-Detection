This was a great place for hand pull noodles. It was my first time there and was recommended by one of my friend. The place was small, but the environment was nice and cozy and a great place to have a good meal with your friends. It got pack really quickly for a late lunch\/early dinner, but we got seated pretty quickly. \n\nAlthough the menu was small, they do give you the options of the different type of noodles you want like flat noodles, round noodles, and etc. There was a great amount of side dishes to order from as well. When the food came, I didn't realize how big the bowls were. It was a good amount of food for what you pay for. The noodles were amazing. The taste was on point. \n\nThe service was great, friendly, and helpful. They were able to answer all my questions about the menu. This is definitely one of my top to go to places in Toronto. I will definitely come back here again.
