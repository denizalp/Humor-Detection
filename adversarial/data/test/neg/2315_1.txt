Extremely unprofessional front desk staff! After waiting an hour past my appointment time, I asked when I would be seen and the girl got an attitude with me. She told me I was next and I explained that they told me that 30 minutes ago. She said \"WELL the doctor can spend a half hour with a patient!\" If I didn't already pay my copay, I would have walked out. \n\nI used to be a patient here a few years ago and stopped coming because I felt that the nurse practitioner did not treat a certain situation right and I ended up in the ER. I came back today because another doctor said this other doctor is highly recommended. \n\nAnother note about the staff...I shouldn't have to navigate through nurses and staff laughing and joking around in the hallway. Literally four or five people...super loud and not acting like this is a doctor's office.
