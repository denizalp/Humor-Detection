I purchased my house a year ago and wanted to replace the old broken blinds that had turned yellow from the sun. I did my research and called a few places for quotes, but I ended up going with Perry and I couldn't be happier. He is down to earth, honest, friendly and professional. His technician Arnie worked fast and diligently and got the job done. I had Onyx install shutters in the whole house, 14 windows! The house looks like a million bucks now. It is worth the investment and you will not regret it! This company is amazing. I would recommend to any person looking for sleek clear view shutters that will last a lifetime! Not only do the shutters look good, but they keep the power bill low and keep the house cool in this Vegas summer heat! Thank you Perry & Arnie!
