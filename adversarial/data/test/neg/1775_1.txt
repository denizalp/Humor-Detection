I went to this place first time on a Friday evening after work. Luckily we made reservations. It was very busy. We got seated at the bar. We ordered beers, wasn't super cold as you would want on a super hot day. The second drink was bourbon lemonade, it was delicious. I would totally recommend that if they still have it on the menu. For the main dishes, we ordered, the mergeze, linguini with mushrooms and Italian sausage. The three dishes were very well done and we were very happy with the quality vs price.
