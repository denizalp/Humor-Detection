Mary was awesome and easy to work with. Even when I wanted to make changes to my gown at what was supposed to be my final fitting and was only a week and a half before my wedding, Mary listened and was very understanding. Their prices are fair and she did everything she said she would do. My dress fit like a glove and I felt fabulous on my big day thanks to her handiwork. Thank you Mary!!
