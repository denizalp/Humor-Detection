You definitely get your money's worth.  They had a three course special so my boyfriend an I both ordered the special.  The salads were huge.  The bread basket had three different varieties, I think ciabatta, pretzel, and a wafer looking one.  The bread and salads would have filled us up if we had eaten all of it. I had ordered lobster bisque in addition to my meal deal, it was just average.  \n     My filet and crab cake was tasty, the sauce that was on top added flavor.  My boyfriend got the filet and shrimp scampi.  The shrimp scampi was the best I have had.  I'm not a dessert person but my boyfriend is, he got the creme brûlée, he said it was really good.  They packed up my key lime pie, we took it to the hotel, unfortunately we didn't eat it- so I can't say much about it other than it looked good!\n     The bill was just under 100 dollars, which was less than we thought it would be.  The only bad thing about the place is the outside condition of the area, maybe that's just Cleveland!
