I have been to this restaurant twice and everything that I have had has been wonderful. I absolutely love the Papaya Salad, the peanuts give it a great crunch and add texture to the dish. The coconut chicken soup is creamy and rich. The entrees are delish too. I have been to Thailand and this is the best since I have been back. The coconut icecream is homemade and very good (not too sweet). The lunch options are great with a great value. Check it out.
