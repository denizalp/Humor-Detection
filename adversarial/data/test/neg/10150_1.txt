Eggslut is one of those places where all your millennial fiends tell you \"you HAVE to try it\".\n\nYES eggslut was good. They didn't have my dairy free buns for an egg sandwich, but they accommodated with a plate of bacon and eggs.\n\nWe waited about 40 minutes to get our food... a bit much for a bacon egg and cheese.\n\nMy recommendation-- if you come here and there's a long line, skip it and go somewhere else! It's just a (pricey)!bacon egg and cheese!
