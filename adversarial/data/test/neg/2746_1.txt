Ordered an el pastor taco, fish taco and a chicken taco. The best of the 3 was the pastor. The talapia in the fish taco was mushie, wasnt prepared fresh, not crispy. The service was nice although she charged us for an extra taco, we ate it anyway. I'll continue on my search for good mexican close to home.
