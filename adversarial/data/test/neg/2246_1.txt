We loved the atmosphere and how quick the service was. We only had time to eat at one place in Phoenix and this place was worth it!! We had the tour de Fuego and it was enough for us to split. The food was fantastic - loved the meatball sliders!! The spicy empanadas was great, not too much spice. The taco was our least favorite. It was double wrapped in a corn tortilla and overall the flavors just didn't compare to the other two. We shared a remix sangria and a dos Equis and it went great with the meal. Prices were reasonable. Definitely recommend swinging by if ever in Phoenix!
