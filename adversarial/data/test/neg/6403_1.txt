Yay, I am a fan! This little spot has been consistent in providing fast, delicious Korean food. Typically I order Chop Chae which are pan fried noodles w\/ vegetables & beef with a side of Kimchee.. with a drink it typically comes out to about $11 and the portion is HUGE. Usually my sister and I split it and still have some left over. Service is not bad or great,  professional and to the point  -- I really don't expect or require anything more from small joints such as this. Definitely recommend.
