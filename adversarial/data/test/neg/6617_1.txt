This place was great especially the crab legs!! They don't skimp out on you and give you a generous portion! Comes with drawn butter and it it so tasty! They have tons of options for people who are in the mood for anything! Their seafood was out of this world and they meant selection was pretty big. It was hard to cut through my prime rib with a butter knife but maybe I missed where the cutting knives were. There are tons of desserts to pick from some that I've never heard of before. Would definitely go back!!
