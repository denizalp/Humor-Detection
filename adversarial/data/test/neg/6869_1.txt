Not your regular bubble tea shop. This place has a wide variety of fruit teas and fruit based beverages. I tried the fresh strawberry fruit tea with mousse and my friend ordered the fresh orange fruit tea. They were both refreshing and not too sweet. They also have a cute flower wall which is very instagrammable. They currently have a buy one get one 50% off promo until the end of August. A good time to check it out if you haven't been to this place!
