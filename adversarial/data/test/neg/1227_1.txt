I've been going to Charles for over a year for Botox and have never been disappointed. He has never pushed additional treatments on me and has always been honest when I've asked him about other services. When it comes to my vanity I am extremely picky and particular in who I have \"work\" on me. I have no hesitation with Charles at Glo Medspa. He is a guaranteed 5 star.
