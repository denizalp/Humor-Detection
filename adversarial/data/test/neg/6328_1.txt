We had a great experience at the Venetian! I won a few nights free from a game show and only had to pay the resort fee which included super fast in suite wifi so I didn't mind. The lady at the front desk upgraded our room to include a view of the pool because she saw my birthday was a few days earlier. We had a luxury suite which was the standard room but there was nothing standard about it. It was seriously nicer than my apartment! Just absolutely beautiful! The bed was like sleeping on a cloud and the bathtub was huge and luxurious! I took off one star because getting to our room was slightly confusing having to use 2 different elevators and the food was pretty pricey. Plus it is basically at the end of the strip so we had to walk far or take a cab to some places. If you have the money though, it was pretty incredible and everyone was very friendly. Would love to stay there again!
