I don't bowl very often, this was the first time I've been in a bowling alley since moving to Arizona and I was very impressed by this place. \n\nIt's clean, trendy and has really cool red lighting. The employees were really friendly and checked on us regularly, asking if we were having a good time. The Fundue we ordered was really good and the drinks were awesome. I've been to some really sad and dingy bowling alleys but this one was great. I really like that they don't charge up front but tell you to bowl until you are done and you pay after, giving you a no obligation to finish games you already paid for. We bowled two games and had a great time. I'd love to come back to play again.
