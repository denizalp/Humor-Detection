Can a bakery be sexy? You bet your sweet buttercream it can!\n\nI ventured in here one night after a dinner date with my husband, and I fell in love. The Victorian style furniture, the soft candlelight, the decadent desserts...It's all quite romantic. \n\nWe split a lovely pear tart and a huuuuge slice of chocolate cake with curry chocolate frosting. My husband also had an espresso that he quite enjoyed.\n\nI love that they are open late so I can appease both my sweet tooth and my inner night owl. Everything was great and I absolutely don't mind paying $6 for a large slice of delicious gourmet cake. We'll be back for sure!
