I bought a living social deal for a mani\/pedi here, and I made an appointment as requested. They did well sending reminders about my appointment, however, it went downhill after that. I had a difficult time finding their location as it is not well marked neither outside nor inside the building.  I was never greeted at my appointment time, had to ask someone in their space (different company) where I should wait, waited for 20 minutes after my scheduled time with Mavis and then took it upon myself to check in with her & find out she was running at least 40 min behind. I never received a call to let me know of this delay. Mavis was rather rude and offered no apology. I can't speak to the quality of their nail service, however the customer service was very disappointing.
