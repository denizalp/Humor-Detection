I have never had a bad experience here. I first went years ago for lunch and immediately fell in love with it. It was good food, in a nearly \"historical\" place, that smelled like a burning fireplace. County, if you will. At that time, I was searching for venues for my rehearsal dinner, and based on the size of the restaurant I figured this would be a great place. \n\nA week later, I brought my fianc√© there for dinner. Everything was WONDERFUL! I had filet, he had prime rib and lobster. We were sold, this was the place for our rehearsal dinner! \n\nI spoke with their manager over the phone and he graciously helped us plan a menu for our event. In October 2012, We had approximately 30 attendees, and our servers were so professional and relaxed, you would have thought we were a party of 4. Bob Taylor's will ALWAYS be on the top of our recommendation list. We have been to about every steakhouse in Vegas, but we love it here. It's a no-nonsense menu, good service, unpretentious, old school steak joint. No need to dress up too much, but show some respect and don't dress like a bum. All long-term Vegas locals know about this hidden gem.
