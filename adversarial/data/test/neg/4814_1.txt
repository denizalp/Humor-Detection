A co-worker returned a vehicle on Sunday 10\/13 and left some of my belongings in the vehicle.  I went to Avis 2 hours after the vehicle was returned.  Avis gave me the run around and gave me Larry's phone number (lost and found guy) 702-510-2170.  I called Monday 10\/14 morning and left a message with all the details the recording asked for.  I called again Monday evening and left another message as no one returned my call.  Tuesday 10\/15 afternoon, left another message.  Wednesday 10\/16 morning, left another message.  I called again Wednesday afternoon from a different phone number and Larry answered.  I asked him if he had my stuff, nothing expensive just a cooler, and some other small stuff.  Larry had the worst attitude I've come across in quite some time.  He must really hate his job as he was absolutely no help to me.  Why it took 4 days to get in touch with someone is beyond me.  \n\nThanks for nothing Larry 702-510-2170.  I hope you are as miserable as you sound.\n\nJohn
