My bf found this place on yelp and we met up for dinner on a Friday night. There was just 2 or 3 other parties when we entered, and the hostess was very nice and let us choose a table. The menu is very vast, and we spent a few minutes going over it. We decided to get a small order of the jalapeno cilantro hummus with pita bread, which is very good (spicy!). Deciding between a panini and the kung pao chicken pasta special, I went with the special, which was my one mistake of the evening :( It took a while for the food to come out, so I probably wouldn't recommend this place if you were in a rush, but we kept ourselves occupied. The kung pao chicken was not the fried version you may expect, which I was fine with, but it wasn't spicy or extraordinarily flavorful. The noodles they used for the dish were very thick and not al dente which I prefer. My bf had the gyro sandwich and a side of fries, which he enjoyed. I like that they are all organic and everything else I saw looked good, so I will give them a second try.
