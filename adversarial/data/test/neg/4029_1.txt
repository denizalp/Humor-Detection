Outstanding. The prosciutto and melon was the best I've had since Italy. The pasta is handmade every day and menu changes each week. I had the fusilli and my wife had the pappardelle. Both wonderful. The service was attentive and friendly. Try to sit at two tables near kitchen so you can watch the chef and staff prepare the food.
