Loved this place!! Kat was an excellent server! Informative and sweet! Started with a delicious Frozemont-yum!! There were so many fun drink options- it was difficult to chose. We'll definitely be back to try some of the others:) the seasoned fries were perfectly crispy and hot. The nachos were covered with tons of cheese. The chicken sandwich was great! No complaints:)
