Remarkably unremarkable.   $76 for a bison steak (no sides, no nothing) and a cocktail and tip.  The steak was flavorless.  I don't eat steak often and save it for a special event.  This was a real disappointment.  I wish I ate a GOOD In And Out burger instead.  Service was OK but this is Vegas and I expect it to be exceptional.
