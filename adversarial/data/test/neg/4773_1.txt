This is the (real deal) Deli. [10320 N Scottsdale Rd, Scottsdale, AZ 85253.]\nI am from out of town, and located it with a search, while in Scottsdale AZ for a conference. \nNOTE: The Deli is open ~6:30 am. ***However, they lock their doors at 3:00 pm until the next day***\nREVIEW: \nFresh, authentic Bagels, also Bialys are available.\nCustomers may choose the size of portions from\nNosh, Plate, Platter. The White Fish is excellent. The Pickles, Cucumbers, Tomatoes are fresh.  Service is good. We took Uber to the Deli on the first day, on the second day, I discovered the doors were locked and the hours limited to 3 pm. However, this place is worth the trip, try it. They even have a bar. \nI
