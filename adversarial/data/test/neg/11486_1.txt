What a fabulous aquarium shop! I went there with my daughter today for help setting up a salt water tank, and the owner Joel was a wealth of information. We brought in a tub of equipment, and he cheerfully sorted through it and told her what would work with a salt tank and what wouldn't.\n\nHe offered already treated water so she could get her tank up and running in a couple of weeks, and he carefully laid out exactly what she needed to do. We've been home two hours, and thanks to his excellent advice she already has the rockscape in and the tank filled.\n\nThe coral and anemones in his tanks were jaw dropping, and he even had sea horses! It was hard to drag ourselves out of there. Good prices too. He has our business for sure.
