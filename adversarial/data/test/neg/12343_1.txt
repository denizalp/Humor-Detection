Very nice place. Cool design and a nice atmosphere.\nFor a sushi lover, it's a let down. \nI know they have 3 different cuisines, but my review is just for the sushi because that is what I tried. \nI went here with my husband. We LOVE sushi. We overdo it sometimes. We are the type of people who will have sushi 1-2 times a week so we know what's good or bad and when it is fresh etc. \nThe fish was fresh no doubt.  The prices were okay considering the quality of the fish. That being said the rolls were not special.  The flavors did not compliment each other or the fish.  We had three cut rolls and one hand roll and didn't even finish them. The hand roll was great but the cut rolls (sorry don't remember the names) were very boring. The flavors were simple or overpowering each other. Non of the rolls stood out even the one the server recommended (he said it was one of their best). \nThe service was great!
