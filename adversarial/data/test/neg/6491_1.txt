The staff does not have much regard for health code procedures.  Both the food server and the expediter continuously touch their hair and face and then everyone's  food (that's how you get people sick!!!). I even saw a bus girl with green\/black hair actually flip her ponytail into clean beverage glasses then proceed to put them on the table anyway, with her fingers inside the clean glasses.  No beard nets or hats on cooks.  Manager drinking and eating in the food prep area.  Food trendy and mediocre.  Nothing special here.
