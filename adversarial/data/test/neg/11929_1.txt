I have been kart racing since 2008, at over 30 tracks around the country, and K1 Speed Concord is one of the best facilities in the nation.  Having 2 tracks allows for a sped up race schedule and not as much waiting as other tracks in NC. The staff was incredibly friendly and would highly recommend this track to others and would rather come to K1 Speed than Victory Lane any day of the week.
