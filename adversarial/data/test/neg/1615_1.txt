My boyfriend and I are regulars here. We love it so much that we come at least once a week or every other week for their bulgogi stone pot. We love the broth so we always ask for extra broth and a fried egg on top. Their seafood udon and pork belly salad are also favorites as well but the stone pot is a must everytime
