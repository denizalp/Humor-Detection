Went today with my girlfriend to eat here, she recommended it to me so I thought I'd try it. We both got the garlic shrimp came with fries,rice,shrimp,salad. Also tortillas. Everything was amazing the flavor was so good. I've tasted a lot of shrimp in my day but this is be far the best I've ever tasted. I highly recommend this place.
