I've always been impressed with this store.  I've tried a lot of thrift stores, and sometimes even drive as far as Freedom Drive to the originals, but for my time and money, I almost always find something better here.  The prices are very good, they are pretty well organized, and they do offer that weekly clothing deal mentioned in another review (that people *really* take advantage of).  I notice many more racks of Women's clothes than Men's though.\n\nThe only real problems I've run into are minor.  This store should reconsider some of the things they're putting on the shelves\/racks.  At this store, I've come across shirts that look as though they were accidentally dropped in a bucket of Clorox, and\/or drawn on by kindergarteners.  Yet 5 shirts over, you'll find one that has clearly never been worn or washed.  They should not automatically hang everything on the rack.  At least give it an inspection to make sure a person would actually pay for it.  Otherwise, this store should donate it to the overcrowded Goodwill across the street, and let them deal with it :)\n\nOn the same note, I came across a pile of heavily abused SOCKS for sale that nearly made me throw up.  We should never live in a world where we're buying used socks\/underwear.  That's sickening, and they should not be selling something like that.  In my mind it's a health hazard.\n\nAlso, some signage is baffling.  A lot of electronics here are marked \"no guarantees\/no returns\" (if they don't work).  But I find it really hard to trust that they are tested before being placed out on the floor.  And with the plethora of employees you can hear rollicking behind the \"employees only\" door, they have plenty of time to address both of my concerns.\n\nEven if they didn't fix these issues, this place still qualifies as the best thrift store in Huntersville & Cornelius.  The two other big name stores are much too hard to navigate, and lack those amazing finds that I get here.
