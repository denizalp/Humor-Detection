This place is like a pinball museum with so many different pinball machines, but you can actually play the games here. I am so glad that I finally came here. My husband and I came here on a Sunday night and it wasn't crowded. I immediately exchanged a $5 for quarters right when I got there and we played a ton of fun games for 2 hours (not bad for $5 of entertainment for 2). The games are from $0.25 to $0.75 per play. The older games are $0.25 and are actually really amazing to see how they still run and how they work.\n\nNot only are there pinball games, but there are also old school joystick arcade games here as well and other old relic style games. I love that there are index cards on most of the games here so you can read a little bit of the fascinating history over how the pinball hall of fame acquired the games in their possession. Some of the stories are pretty interesting. \n\nSome of the games at this place are just really cool. I have never played some of these games or seen some of the type of games before at other arcades or the one arcade that reminds me of the place on Fisherman's Wharf (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/mus%C3%A9e-m%C3%A9canique-san-francisco-4). \n\nWill come back here the next time I am here (by the way, this place is pretty close by the strip and is located in a plaza with a camera shop).
