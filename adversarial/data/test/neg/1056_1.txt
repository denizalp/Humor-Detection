I had a facial which was average at best. The massage aspect of it was too short and too light. My normal aesthetician is much better for half the price. However you're paying for the spa amenities. The spa itself is really nice. The treatment rooms are large, the robes are soft, the jacuzzis are great and the pool is beautiful. However, there wasn't an attendant\/waiter at the pool to take any food or drink orders. I understand it's October but it was 77 degrees. If there isn't anyone to serve food or drinks just put up a sign and don't leave menus out. Next time I'll only spend $50 to use the amenities and pass on the treatment as they're way too expensive.
