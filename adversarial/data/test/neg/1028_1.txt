This was my first visit to Right Toyota . I have to say ,this is the most professional dealer in a mid range price market i have ever experienced. From my salesman Shane to the manager to the GM to the service dept. I bought a 4 runner for my son and i felt like i was buying a Porsche from Penske who i usually deal with. They are very caring people and make sure you are happy. Bravo
