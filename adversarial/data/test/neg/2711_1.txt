I've been bringing my dog here for the past year and a half-- very happy with the service. Dr. V and Dr. Arnold have been tremendously caring.\n\nThe building itself is pretty no-frills compared to other vet clinics I've been in, but the staff has been competent and caring, and the prices very affordable.\n\nI originally started bringing my dog to this clinic because a friend of mine who rescues cats has brought all of her rescues here (along with her own personal cats) and highly recommended them-- then later I found out several of my friends also drive across town to bring their pets to this clinic as well. I had no idea!\n\nWhen my dog needed a tooth pulled last year, this vet was over $400 cheaper than another clinic closer to my house-- and they did a perfect job. No complications or issues.\n\nIf you want a vet office that feels like a visit to the spa, this is probably not your clinic-- but if you don't mind the no-frills building itself, I find this clinic to be honest, competent, and affordable-- and for what it's worth, I've never felt that I was being sold unnecessary services like I've felt at other vet clinics in our city. Don't even get me started on some of them...
