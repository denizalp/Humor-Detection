An uphill battle ALL the way. Inefficient and unorganized. Brought my iPhone for a screen replacement. I was told it would take a few days since they had to order the screen in. I had to call them at least twice per week to get status and such. Two weeks later they tell me my phone is ready but they changed it to black. What?  My phone was white and they didn't even ask me. I politely asked them to please put it back to white and I will wait another few days. Another week went by and 10 phone calls later my phone was to be ready. I was promised it would be ready the next day, no need to call just come in. I came in.....not ready.  I decided not to get anything done to the phone. When I tried to take my broken screen phone back they apparently lost my battery. Very unprofessional :(
