Tott's is our new favorate place for Asian food.  I ordered the Sweet and Sour Orange Shrimp along with the chow mein noodles.  There were actually 10 large shrimp in the delicious dish.  Wonderful orange peel flavor and was brought to our table in less than five minutes after being made fresh to order.  My wife ordered the Korean style chicken with the medium spicy sauce which was also cooked to perfection.  The restaurant was very clean and the staff was very friendly. Highly recommend this jewel in the rough and am looking forward to trying the wide selections of dishes offered.
