We came here on Father's Day. The food wasn't good at first because the noodles weren't cooked all the way! HOWEVER, our server and the manager more than made up for it. The manager had actually gone around earlier giving all the dad's a $10 gift card for next time. When our server mentioned to him our uncooked noodles, he came over with freshly made dishes we had ordered to go and a cake we didn't order to show his apologies. Great! A few minutes later, the waiter came by and explained that everything was taken care of and we didn't have to pay anything. Not for our drinks, not for the bread sticks, salad, my meal (which was different from the other three I was with and was actually fine)...nothing. I was taken aback because I wasn't expecting it to be free.\n\nI don't condone complaining about a place after you've ordered but the noodles were uncooked in the chicken alfredo. \n\nWe'll be coming back because my fiance loves Olive Garden. I think they're all over priced and I personally feel I can make any of it much better and for cheaper, but hey she likes the bread sticks.
