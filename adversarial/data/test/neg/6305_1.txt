Love this place! \nEvery time my family and my parents come to visit and stay here at the Golden Nugget we always have to eat here at the Grotto. There food is always delicious and very filling. And the pizzas are amazing too!!! \nThe staff is always very friendly and accommodating !!! Over this past weekend we were very well taken care of by Jeff Kucesa and the rest of the staff. I love how they treat everyone as equals unlike some other places. \nThanks again for always being great!
