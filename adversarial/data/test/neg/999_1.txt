I've been going here for years and the food is great and the servers are great too! \n\nI've only ever had one issue with them when I went one time but I believe it was because the server was new (most the staff has been there for years)\n\nGreat family restaurant, and if you want you can order in advance and just pick up your food to take home.  Every time we have done this (maybe 5 times recently upon discovering you could) our orders are always right, and they always give you extra chips and yummy salsa!
