This grocery store is a bit disappointing since it's kind of my local grocery store. The only good thing is that it's in the same plaza as Starbucks! yay.\n\nparking here is pretty packed at times.\n\nIt's a small location, there are lots of things they don't have. \n\nI just can't get everything I need from one trip if I come here. It's only good if your looking for something specific and they happen to have it here.
