So I was delighted to walk in here. Used to the glittering and endless gems filling NYC consignment shops, I never expect much in Cleveland. But I've found solace in The Apple Core, and most recently, Closets Consignment Boutique. Holy crap.\n\nThe Good:\nHUGE selection; huge. I probably took over 20 things to the dressing room with me; a perfect mix of things I wanted to buy for my mom (50s) and things I personally couldn't live without (I'm 23). While the previous reviewer is right, it caters more to the middle-agers, I found a TON I loved; Sunny Leigh, Free People, Poleci, oh my!! I literally had to spent a solid 15 minutes narrowing down from what I loved to what I could realistically afford. I WILL be back with mom.\n\nThe Bad:\nI spent the duration of my visit (about an hour) being entirely ignored by the staff, hence why I can't give a rave review. It was actually distracting me from enjoying my shopping; the fact that I was blatantly disregarded. Which, to me, is a big deal, especially since Joyce at the Apple Core knows me by name and asks how my mother is every time I'm in there. When the owner knew I was about to drop a hefty sum on some merchandise, she warmed up, but was still...blunt, which perhaps is her nature. \n\nRegardless, this is now one of very few consignment shops I love in the area, and shall return.
