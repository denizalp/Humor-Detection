My fianc√© and I had a wonderful time. The house was so beautifully decorated for Christmas, but it is a gem on its own. The rooms were comfy and well-appointed. The inn keepers were what you want from this experience ... Friendly and knowledgable. If you are in the area, just stop in to the bar and enjoy this beautiful place.
