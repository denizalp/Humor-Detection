I gave it 4 stars for these reasons, (1) I had to wait approximately 25 minutes for a gel manicure (2) the smell of the chemicals in the salon were extremely strong and (3) I'm not sure what they were saying, but a customer came in complaining about her nails and they were pointing and laughing at her behind her back, obviously a language barrier. My gel manicure turned out to look great my technician was very skilled and they looked very busy. It might be best to make an appointment. Overall good job.
