Let me start out by providing the following information:\nI am a big fan of the Fox restaurants in Phoenix and Scottsdale. I frequent them often. \nI have dined and lunched at Olive and Ivy dozens of times and most of the times happily. \nToday was a disaster. \nI hosted an out of town friend who had specifically asked me to eat at Olive and Ivy. A friend of his had made this recommendation. \nWhen we arrived we were PROMPTLY seated outdoors as requested. \nIt was at least 10 minutes before our server, Richard, showed up at our table. \nFull of energy he proceeded to get going. \nThe water was out shortly. \nAnd then Richard disappeared. \nThen when he reappeared my dining companion ordered an Old Fashioned. He tells me that this must be the worst old fashioned ever. \nNext was the Manhattan. Same story. \nSo, are you guys just inventing new versions or just have lost the recipes. \nAnyway, I was embarrassed and not sure I will bring my guests here anymore. \nThe food was okay. But not excellent enough for my friend to erase the memory of the awful cocktails he had been subjected to.\nFRC is a great company. But as they grow they must be mindful of quality assurance in menu and service.\n\nUPDATE!\nJust about 20 minutes after I posted this review I received a call from Jimmy at Olive and Ivy who is responsible for addressing customer feedback. \nThis level of responsiveness is something I have never experienced before. Jimmy, you rock! I feel important, I feel you care about how I feel. \nSam's got a good team. \nThank you. \nAfter my next visit I will update my review to let everybody know what the status is. \nCheers!
