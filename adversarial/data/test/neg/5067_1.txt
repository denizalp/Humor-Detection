OMG!!!! Love Charles! Found Glo Medspa on Yelp and  booked an appointment online last night for this morning. Love the convenience of that! He did a fantastic job and has a very gentle touch. I love the fact that if you check in on Facebook you get a promotional price. Vey smart business move!\n I spoke to him about other skin concerns I have and will definitely be back to see Charles at Glo Medspa!
