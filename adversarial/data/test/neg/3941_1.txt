This guys are great, went with a flat, I was coming from the discount tires all pissed off after they try to rip my off convincing me that the tire is too old to fix blah blah, the car is kinda new. Any ways, Automall wheels was easy and fast, I was able to drop off the tire and just come pick it up like 15 minutes later and the price was great too, $15 not bad at all :) thanks guys for being awesome.
