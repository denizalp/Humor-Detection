I enjoy their organic foods and hope they will continue expanding in this area. I made a purchase at the Parma location and the following day finished up my shopping at Strongsville. While at Parma, the cashier had trouble using my cartwheel app. We figured it out, but in the interim, I forgot to use another electronic coupon on a purchase. When I went to Strongsville the next day, I was given the difference in cash. Quick and painless! The security breech could have happened to any store. I think the year security monitoring was a nice gesture and I will continue to support Target, especially at the Strongsville location.
