I love service with a smile. Even more, I love a good doughnut. I received both when I went to Carl's Doughnuts this morning. Awesome service and awesome doughnuts. It doesn't get much better than that. I won't go into the \"you must try this\" mode, but I will say that I haven't had a bad bite yet. My favorite, so far, is the Maple Old Fashioned. Yum...This will definitely be my \"go to\" doughnut shop. Welcome to the neighborhood.
