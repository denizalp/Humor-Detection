The worst Hooters I've been to as far as the food goes.  Hooters are known for their wings, but this place fails miserably at it.  My family ordered the naked wings with original sauce, bbq (smoked?) wings, and the boneless.  All were overcooked and dry, especially the bbq wings, the edges were burnt and the dry rub they put on was too salty.  We got the ranch and blue cheese dressing which were too watered down.  Wings are the easiest meats to cook, especially when they're deep fried.  Just set the damn timer!  It's not rocket science.  Our waitress was...very amateurish:  barely any eye contact, not outgoing, never asked us how everything was, and she brought my daughter another full glass of water and said, \"here's another glass of water incase you want it.\"  Then immediately turned around and left.  Really awkward.  She brought the check the same way too.  Never asked us, \"would like some more water\", or \"can I bring you the bill\", or \"here's the bill when you're ready, no hurry.\"  \n\nOn a good note, the fried dill pickle chips were excellent!  A must order.  And the host was really nice with a big smile.  She made us feel really good about being there (the beautiful black woman who worked on the eve of 2 Jun 2018).
