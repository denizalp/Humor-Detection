When we found THE house, Teressa Seger advised us on a winning strategy for how to get our offer accepted!!  It's a beautiful house, fit every criteria, and we knew we had to have it.  I can't tell you how happy we are to be in it, and Teressa's suggestions during negotiations were instrumental in securing the deal.  She was the perfect person to be in our corner, negotiating for us.\n\nThroughout the process, Teressa understood our needs and was quick to execute our requests. My partner and I run a business and have a tightly packed schedule - We had to see many houses in a short span of time and she wasted no time. \n\nWe found Teressa on a referral basis, after asking people in my community, and I feel 100% confident referring her to my friends and family.
