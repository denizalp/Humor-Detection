For years I go to this small restaurant that serves only wonton soup with or without noodles. The menu is short and simple. Typically I order wonton noodle soup and veggie plate. You can also buy fresh raw wontons if you prefer to cook a couple at home. $14 for a dozen you can freeze. I like their big wontons loaded with sliced shrimps. My only complaint is the broth. They used to have very good tasty broth. Now it taste more like powdered wonton broth. There's also discrepancies in prices if you ask for order of extra noodles. Everyone seems to be in defensive mode when I asked for extra noodles. The menu says $2 for extra noodles but I was told I must order it ahead of time together with my order not after I ate my food. Otherwise, it is $3. What in the world is this stupidity!  Why can't you order it after?  I still have soup and I feel I still want more noodles. Anyway, I think this is stupid!  I said forget it!  This place seems to be going down in quality.
