If you are craving real food, real old school burgers, I recommend the OTB Cafe.  I have found the wait staff to be very good and the food quite delicious and satisfying.  There's nothing at OTB that feels like a chain.  Personally, there are way too many TV screens, and I find that distracting.  The decor is quirky and fun and I like the bicycle theme.  I also like that I can visit this place while biking and not feel awkward about my helmet and other gear.  This is a fun place to meet other outdoor enthuisiasts.
