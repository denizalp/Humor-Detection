I have never shopped at Lowe's for their nursery products, but I would like to review them on their gift shop.  When you walk in the gift shop, your eyes don't know what area to look at first, as everything is so enticing and interesting!   As an adult, you feel like a kid in a toy shop, as there are so many things you immediately gravitate to and want.  These are unique products that fit into just about any d√©cor.  The negative aspect is they are a little bit pricey, but then again, these are not common treasures.  They have great sales, and those are the times you definitely want to go back and make your purchases.  I also used the florist service to get a quote on bridal arrangements, as they have a reputation of doing an awesome job and I wanted a lot of greenery and not so many flowers.  I got the quote and my jaw dropped...they were definitely out of my price range so I will never know first hand.
