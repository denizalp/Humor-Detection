Reminds me of going to one of those places on the boardwalk that has surfer appeal. The burgers are excellent. I had my first ever ghost burger with ghost peppers because I wanted to live dangerously. Full of flavor and sneaks up on you. While I could only eat half my leftovers were just as good the next day. \nThe place is small and the wait can get long so get there early
