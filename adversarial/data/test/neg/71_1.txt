Updated: Concerned at the lack of attention we have received in two separate situations where our animals required immediate care. Neither instance were we able to get an appointment nor did we receive any follow up from the office to inquire as to how our animals were faring even after receiving medical records from the ER vet. \n\nWe were referred to the emergency vet in both cases without really any other options or discussion. In the second case, the ER vet was surprised to hear that we were referred without an exam or discussion from our primary vet.  What we are unsure of is if a vet was notified of the issue when we called asking for an appointment at VC of FtM or if we were screened by the front desk staff. Either way, as our animals are patients, wouldn't it be courtesy to find out how they are faring once an issue was brought up? \n\nOur prior visits for shots and check ups were handled well. I am disappointed in the manner that we were handled when we had issues.
