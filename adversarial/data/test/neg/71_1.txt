This is a small store that sells used dvds, music, etc. We came in here after browing Chapters & hubby found some used dvd sets he ended up buying. But I didn't find anything interesting for myself. There was only one store clerk, dressed very casually in a t-shirt & jeans. Another store clerk came in as we were cashing out & looked a bit grungy. Hey I know it's just a used music store but pls people try to look presentable if you have to deal with customer all day long!
