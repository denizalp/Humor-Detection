Their chicken curry soup, shrimp roils and house special vegetable curry are all excellent dishes. The salad rolls are made fresh for each order. They have not been setting on a tray in the fridge waiting for someone to order to speed things up. The owners are like my friends, as I have been going here for years. The old gas station building hides a very special noodle house, so do not let appearances deceive you..
