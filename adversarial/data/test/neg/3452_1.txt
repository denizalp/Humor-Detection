This place is a must stay if you can get it for cheap.  I suggest you go gambling there and see if you can get on their mailer list where they give some good deals on rooms.  \n\nThe hotel has undergone a renovation and the rooms on the higher floor are the first ones that were redone.  Definitely ask for a high floor to get the best bang for your buck.  \n\nThe rooms are a suite.  That is why the retail price is so high for these rooms.  If one goes and looks at suite prices at other major resorts, one will see similar rates.  Try AAA to see if the deal is better.  I have seen the price of hotel rooms go down the closer it is to the day of staying.  It really depends on the time of the year in Vegas and what is going on.  I've used the $20 trick and have been upgraded to a strip view a couple of times.  I also got a very nice upgrade to one of the tower suites on my birthday!  \n\nThe gambling floor is very big and is on the higher side for the strip gambling.  Be prepared to buy in for higher limits.  The cool thing about this casino is that it is also connected to the Palazzo.  I usually check both sides before I start playing to see if I can get a lower limit gambling tables.\n\nThere is plenty of shopping that can be done in the Canals shoppes and Fashion Show right across the strip.  The Wynn and Encore are super close as well.
