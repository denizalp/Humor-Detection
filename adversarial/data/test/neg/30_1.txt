I have been taking my dog there for almost 9 years.  For a long time I thought they were great.  I still kind of do.  I recently, within the last year, noticed that they are kind of shady.  I have had tests ordered without me saying yes and then charged.  Quoted 1 price for medication and then told a higher cost later.  At this moment I am thinking about a second opinion for my dog for possible thyroid problems because I don't see the symptoms that the vet said she has.  I have seen many vets come and go so I guess that makes sense.  I honestly now feel that they are all about the money and getting as much cash as possible.  Their staff are nice ladies and are always nice and helpful and I have caught them a few times looking at me weird or at one another when the Dr. requested something (ie test) and snuck back in to let me know there was a charge.  Sometimes they have an \"im so sorry\" look on their face as if they have seen them do that before.\n\nThis sucks.\n\nIt's interesting that almost all negative comments on here talk about how they want your money.
