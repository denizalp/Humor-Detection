ABSOLUTELY AMAZING !   We live here in Las Vegas and have FINALLY found a restaurant that we loved and will be our special occasion place from now on,  I haven't had a meal in my life so good!  We felt like a King and Queen,  We had the Special bone in filet and Lobster as our main course,  A Caesar salad made from scratch in front of us,  French Onion soup that was  amazing, Potatoes Aug gratin.    When they brought out the desert display it was Beautiful,  we choose the New York Cheese cake with Berries,  they also give you a plate of chocolate dipped strawberries, apples, bananas, and other treats and a huge bowl of fruit.   During the meal they bring a fancy small sorbet to clean your palette and they pour Dom Perion  over it .   The whole experience was our best ever and we can't wait for another special occasion to go back.   Yayyyy
