Absolutely love Sheiban Jewelers. Going there you know you will get amazing service and excellent quality. I wouldn't even consider going anywhere else. The Sheiban family makes sure you feel special and not just another sale. Chris does a great job going through all the options and if you still can't find exactly what you're looking for, he can custom make it. He also does NOT pressure you to buy. Every time I go I have a great experience. Highly recommend Sheiban.
