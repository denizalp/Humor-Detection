First off, I'm the type of person who panics when confronted with an unfamiliar menu. Suffice to say that my first glance at the Everyday Noodles menu was anxiety inducing. \n\nSomehow, on this of all days, I had a breakthrough and instead of stumbling through my options trying to find the one perfect thing, my wife and I just started ordering stuff. Anything that caught our eye. And it worked. \n\nWe picked somewhat at random, partially based on descriptions, across different sections and ended up with a satisfying array of options. Plates and bowls of the Taiwanese style Dan Tsu Noodles, Vegetable Dumplings, Pork Wontons, Chicken Soup, and Steamed Broccoli were the end result.\n\nThe highlights of the day were the Pork Wontons with Mung Bean Noodles and the broth of the Dan Tsu Noodles. I wasn't a huge fan of the Vegetable Dumplings, but I think that was just my personal taste, as my wife did enjoy them.\n\nThe chicken in the soup wasn't super appetizing, but that may have been our only collective compliant. On the whole, it was a delicious and satisfying experience. There's not much that can beat a warm bowl of noodles on a cold winter day. \n\nWe will surely be back to explore more of the menu.
