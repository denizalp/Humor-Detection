We have eaten here several times and have yet to be disappointed.   Table service was very good...servers have always been attentive without hovering.....they know the menu well if you need to ask questions.  We've also ate at the bar a few times...and well...the bartenders seem to be much more harried then need be....service was still very good and friendly  but it wasn't the best bar service we've ever had.  \n\nThe food..I can completely recommend the ahi tuna appetizer, truffle fries and the grilled Ceasars salad is worth coming here for itself alone, they cook a steak to perfection,  any seafood has been fresh and wonderful.  This is one of the few places we save room for dessert...for their small cheese cake 'shooters' of various flavors they will bring to the table in a rack so you can choose.  They are just large enough to finish the meal...but not so large you leave stuffed.  Also, they are one of the most affordable desserts I've seen in a restaurant of this quailty.  \n\nThis is were we come when we want a nicer evening out and know we won't be disappointed.
