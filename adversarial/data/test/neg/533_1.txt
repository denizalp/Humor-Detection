I really appreciate the local business. It was an awesome place to come in and check out. But being that I am not rolling in cash, I was bummed out to see that when I picked up a used CD, it was listed at $14. There were lots of cool records to look through. I noticed that there were even little notes for artists whose concert was going to be in the area on their CD section. It's small, but it was well worth checking out. But again, I wasn't sure if it is what the local business needs to charge in order to keep running, which I completely respect, just by no means affordable by me.
