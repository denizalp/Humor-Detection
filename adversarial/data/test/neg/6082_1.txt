Leena's used to be located in Oakland, where my wife and I found it while frequently visiting Magee Hospital. They are now located at 4180 William Penn Highway, Murrysville. I just had lunch there and found that the food quality and quantity are the same as the Oakland store. I had the Gyro salad with double meat and it was delicious. My co-workers had a gyro and chicken kebab and they also enjoyed their meals. We will return. So happy that Leena is now in Murrysville. Leena has changed the menu slightly, from Oakland, but the staples are all still there
