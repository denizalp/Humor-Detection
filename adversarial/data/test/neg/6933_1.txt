Great locally owned and operated business. Pretty clean. Some of the design or print may have been a little dated but not too bad. Great place for a kid's birthday party which is what got me there. I had wanted to go for a while. I could have eaten even more than I did and I was told I was over doing it. They have so many tasty options I hadn't thought of. They have the classics too of course. They do a great job with the big orders that come in all at one time like this party I was at. If you are any where close and are looking for a casual place for a killer Hot Dog it worth getting to. I drove 25 minutes and wasn't disappointed. The design is bright, happy and hip. Like I said before, it just needs a little freshen up. It's well done though. The entire staff is super friendly and personable. I talked to cashier cooks and management. All super nice. Be back soon
