Two blown tires was not exactly how I wanted to spend my first few hours in Pittsburgh, but it happened. After my car was towed to Pep Boys, I perused the Yelp reviews and was nervous by the low ratings. Fortunately I had an incredible experience here. The customer service was amazing and the service was quick and efficient. I encountered 4 different guys while getting everything sorted out and all of them were very nice and sincere.
