I got take out from Time Out only because I had a Double Take gift certificate so I can't speak for the service.  I ordered a White Chicken Ricotta Pizza, a NY Thin Pizza and a Club Sandwich.\n\nThe White Chicken Ricotta Pizza was made with steak instead of chicken.  Still good, but not what I had ordered.  I expected the NY Thin Pizza to be cut into big wide slices.  It was not, but it was still okay.  The Club Sandwich was pretty good, stacked high with meat and cheese.  \n\nI'm not sure if I should give 2 or 3 stars.  If the order had been correct and met my expectations, I'd probably make this a 4 star review.  I want to give a 3 because the food was good, however my order wasn't entirely correct so I want to deduct my review down to 2 stars.  Since I wasn't mad (just slightly disappointed), I'm settling with 3 stars.  And that's kind of how I feel about Time Out Pizza Pub and Grub in general.  Going there is settling for something just okay.
