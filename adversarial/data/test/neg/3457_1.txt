Visited today for the very last time!  Last Sunday, showed up at noon, to read a note on the door, \"No more appointments today,\". Went home and called.  Was told I could come in the morning to schedule an afternoon appointment.  Tried that today.  Note on door, \"Come back at 12:30 to make afternoon appointments.  At the desk they said it's because they aren't sure how many therapists will show up for the afternoon shift.  WHAT?!  Isn't it their job to schedule enough therapists?  They were very rude and unprofessional at the desk, there were 2 therapists yelling at each other in the parking lot.  I've told everyone I know to GO there...and now I will tell them NOT to.  Goodbye.
