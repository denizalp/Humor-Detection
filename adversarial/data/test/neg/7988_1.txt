This food is definitely good.  But not spectacular.  We go the bean dip for an appetizer.  It very tasty and had a little spicy kick to it.  It's weird it came with regular chips and not tortilla chips, but was still tasty.  My friend got the conch chowder.  He really liked it a lot.  The main dishes we got were a slight disappointment.  The cuban was really bland and not tasty at all.  The chipotle aioli wasn't that great and didn't really help make the sandwich taste much better.  My friend was super excited to try paella for the first time, but he wasn't really excited by the taste of it.  It was good, but not great.  It seems the appetizers and soups are a little better.  I will be back, but I may just stick to the starters.
