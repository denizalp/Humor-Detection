The Stow UPS store is a fine example of what true customer service looks like. You are always greeted at the door and if there is a wait they make sure to let you know that they will be right with you. If you aren't greeted at the door you will be greeted at your car because 95% of the time if it looks like you have a heavy package they come out to assist. The folks that own this location are friendly but not overbearing. I truly wish every store and restaurant owner would spend some time here because I will seriously go out of my way to do business at this location. Thank you Matt and Amy for showing what real customer service looks like!
