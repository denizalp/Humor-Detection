I don't know what drew us to this place but from the moment we walked in we were greeted by the most inspiring man who happened to be the owner who happened to be the infamous Rudy Janeo Jr (google him) I just told him what I liked he brought me the most unbelievable dish I've had, sat down and broke bread with me and my family, shared his story and made us some off the menu food that was out of this world! I will most definitely be coming back to this gem as well as to visit my new buddy Mr Chef Rudy! This place is a one of a kind experience
