Cozy BYOB very close to UPMC-Shadyside.   The rooms nicely lit and service was very good.  Ordered the Wagyu Meatloaf based on reviews and it didn't disappoint.   Server was kind to substitute potatoes for a vegetable!  Complementary bread with wonderful chive butter provided before meal while waiting.  I look forward to coming back again and brining nice bottle of wine (flew into town and didn't have time to purchase, although server mentioned Giant Eagle close by now has liquor store in it).
