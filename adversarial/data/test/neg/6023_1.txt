I have been considering buying some rental property and I wanted to get some info on having the property managed. I spoke to Mike, and he was very thorough in explaining what they do and how they manage your property. He made me feel confident that they would take care of all my needs so I wouldn't have to deal with all the headaches that go along with being a landlord. Before you rent your property, call them first!
