My first time here and it was really a great experience. I took my little sister with me and we both are very satisfied with our visit.\nMy sister got white coffin shaped gel nails ($43 for full gel set + $7 for coffin shape) and she's very happy with them. I don't remember her techs name but my sister is in love with her nails which i'm happy with. \nLan was my tech and she was very nice throughout the whole time I was here. I did a full set gel mani, I got ombr√© nails ($60) with a regular square shape, rounded a little and narrow. No charge for the regular shape. She uses a powder and not paint to get the effect and tops it off with a gel top coat. I also got a pedicure, Lan did my pedicure as well, with regular nail polish ($28) I'm guessing the basic pedicure scrub but it was really relaxing, especially after a long work week! \nlove that they use sanitary prepackaged tools and have covers over the foot tub.\nMy older sister also joined us and got a pedicure with me as well, she did white tips so her total was $33 ($28 + $5 for french)\nThe owner (I believe that's who she was) and other techs were very helpful with us especially since we had appointments for different times and not all three of us were doing the same thing which was really confusing but they dealt with it and were very nice and compensating.\nThe three of us are very satisfied with everything and I will definitely be back!! \nLan is really amazing!!
