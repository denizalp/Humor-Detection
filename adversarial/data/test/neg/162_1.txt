Went for first time last night and thought that the Food was excellent IMO. A friend and I shared the Naan Basket, Dal Tadka and the Manchurian Gobi and it was GREAT! Loved every bite! Excited they are so close.\n\nI do agree with the others that the service and environment was a little less than inviting, but nothing bad enough to keep me from ordering again. Food Quality, Portion size, and Taste  trumped any other opinions I may have considered : ]
