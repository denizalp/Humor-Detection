This is happy hour review only...which was great. The prices weren't an amazing deal but (most of) the food was definitely worth the price. The mussels were the only thing that weren't good and that we didn't finish (and we NEVER leave food behind). \n\nSpicy tuna roll and tempura beams were delicious! Will definitely be back for a regular meal, especially the sushi!
