We went for lunch. The best thing about this buffet is the many stations, each a different type of cuisine, so lots and lots of varied choices.  Its weakness is that while some of the food is quite good, some is not.  Nice thing about a buffet, is you can just stop eating anything that turns out to be not so great and go get something else.  Standouts according to family poll on this trip were cold and hot jumbo shrimp, coleslaw, cornbread, Italian chicken stew, bok choy, carne asada, flan, and chocolate mousse cake.
