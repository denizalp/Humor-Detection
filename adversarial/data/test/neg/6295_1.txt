We hung out at this lounge during happy hour and got 2 drinks for the price of 1.  The drinks were very good.  It was not busy at any point when we were there.  They made good drinks and you can't beat the price during HH.  There are TVs at the bar and we sat at the bar the whole time. Would come again next time I stay at Monte Carlo hotel.
