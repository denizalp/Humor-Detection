After our 2nd Sunday in a row dining at Dickey's, I needed to write a 5 star review. Not sure why this location only has 3 stars? I believe they just opened and maybe they needed to work on some things.\n\nAnyway, we've tried everything from the brisket to the chicken breast. While the brisket and the chicken was very good, the pork ribs and turkey made it to the top on our list. Ribs fall off the bone and the turkey is moist and delicious. The sides are so good but the Mac and cheese is so good the kids are stealing it right off our plates. I even needed to buy an extra for my littlest because her Mac plus my Mac was not enough for her. Guess I should've ordered a large side to start. She really doesn't eat any restaurant Mac but I had no choice as she does not like nuggets. Glad I did! Did I mention that kids eat free on Sundays? Umm ok! The other kids loved the nuggets with side Mac and of course the bread. They love the Texas toast though and yes they stole it off our plates. Luckily there is so much food we still went home with leftovers. \n\nWe'll be back for more bbq soon! Staff has been very nice and helpful! Place is clean! Did I mention that the prices are great?! Especially when your dining with 2 and sometimes 3 children.
