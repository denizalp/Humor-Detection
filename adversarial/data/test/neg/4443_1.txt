I visited Everly for the first time today and my brunch was excellent! Great design and atmosphere and delicious coffee. I ordered the chilaquiles and every part of the meal tasted fresh. The service was attentive and the manager stopped  by to make sure we were enjoying our meal. I will definitely be back here!
