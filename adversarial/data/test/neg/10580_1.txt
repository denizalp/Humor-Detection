Not impressed. We started with the skillet nachos which weren't bad. However, opted for a salad with chicken after that and it wasn't great. My son got the boneless wings. It was processed frozen crap chicken and the BBQ sauce was gross. Service was good, Bar looked ok and they offer nice happy hour specials. If I was going back it would be to sit at the bar and watch a game. If the family and I are going out for dinner this place would not be the first choice.
