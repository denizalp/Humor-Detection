I am a store manager of Steak and Stone of gilbert and I was helping Johnny one of the guys from disaster when he pointed out a leak in my bathroom. He asked if he could check it out and before I knew it i had John in my restaurant diagnosing the problem. These 2 are an amazing asset to this company and provided stellar customer service in every way. After talking with them I definitely want to use this company for any restoration issues I may have. Will be recommending them to many different businesses that we are in contact with for more jobs! Thank you so much gentleman!
