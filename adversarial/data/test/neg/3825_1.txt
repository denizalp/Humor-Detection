I had my first visit with Dr. Dameron today and I have to say I was very impressed. The office staff was very kind, attentive, and informative. Dr. Dameron was great and has such a calming presence for those who are bit nervous to go to the dentist. Not only was he kind but I really loved that he educated me about what he was doing and told me what he was going to do as he did it. Very professional and pleasant experience all around! I would recommend Dr. Dameron to anyone! Thank you Dr. Dameron for bringing my smile back!
