Five star establishment across the board. Let's first start with the ambience. The moment you walk in, you know you are at a nice bar because of the decor, architecture and views! The service is very accommodating of any drink you can think of and the servers very fast and knowledgeable! The main reason we were there were the drinks and that was amazing!!! We all had different types of drinks of all varieties and everything was made to please. \n\nService: 5 stars amazing!\nAmbience: the best part of this bar! \nDrinks: top notch and great variety
