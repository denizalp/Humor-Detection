I've been here twice, once for dinner and once for brunch. Dinner was good, but menu is a bit pricey. I have to say that a weekend brunch is where this place excels for me, the siciliana pasta was delicious and well worth the cost. There is ample seating indoors and it is not crowded as it is during the weekdays. A must visit for a nice meal at a fair price, if u are in the area during weekend brunch.
