The drinks are really good here- it does not take a lot to get the night started. However, I was not too impressed with the food at Jolly Bob's. It was mediocre  and I thought the prices were too high for the neighborhood\/food. I do appreciate this cuisine in Madison though.\n\nThey have a really nice fish tank in the middle of the restaurant.\n\nI would recommend making a stop for drinks. I plan on giving the food a second chance.
