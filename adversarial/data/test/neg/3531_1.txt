I'm glad there are finally some coffee options around Yonge and Eg! I went in recently expecting nothing, but came out very pleased at the quality of the espresso and the friendly staff. They're pretty busy in the mornings but the staff is efficient and very helpful. This place was above my expectations and when I'm working in that area I will go back.
