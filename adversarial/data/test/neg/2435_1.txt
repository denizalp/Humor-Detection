I easily got a table without a wait on a weekend at dinnertime. The waitress and her tag-along trainee were both nice. The waitress did talk a bit too much, so she could scale back on the smalltalk. The appetizers and fish entrees (I ordered the cobia) tasted good. I was not blown away by the taste of any dish, especially for the price, but the food was solidly good.
