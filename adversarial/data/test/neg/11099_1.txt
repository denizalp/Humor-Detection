Shaina is absolutely amazing! This was the first time that Shaina has done my eyebrow waxing and it was so nice that she spent time getting to know exactly how I liked them and what I wanted. She gave my suggestions on what she thought would look best for me. I felt so comfortable with her doing them and loved that she wasn't rushed. She took her time and made sure I was happy with them. She did them right the first time and I didn't need or want anything changed but if I did she would have happily of done it and not acted annoyed, like previous places I have gone to. After she was done she even gave recommendations on how to keep my eyebrows looking good in between visits with her. I didn't have an appointment and just popped in and she was able to get my right back, which was nice since I had my daughter with me. The place is decorated really cute and is super clean and inviting. Definitely recommending her to my friends and family. I just recently moved to California and am sad that I won't be able to come to her regularly,  especially since I just found her.
