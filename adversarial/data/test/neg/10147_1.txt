Located in MGM hotel. Nice environment, and decent lunch price. I like the pasta, but the salmon is kind of plain, although other things in that plate are very tasty. Buttermilk sandwich is a little bit salty, waiter is nice, and they have a large selection of wines. Overall, a nice place to have lunch if you live nearby!
