Lean and fatty brisket, best I've ever had!  Great friendly service, well worth the wait, but very expensive.  Meat by the pound options and they always give out samples and water while you wait in line.  Get there at 1030am on weekdays to get a good spot in line.  I thought the jalape√±o grits were a little bland, but the coleslaw and ribs both incredible and fresh!  The pickles and onions are a nice touch and go well with all the meats.
