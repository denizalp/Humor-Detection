Went on a Sunday with my family to celebrate an anniversary and I left feeling like I 'swallowed a bowling ball'.  We ordered our own mains, I had the ribs and chicken entree.  The ribs were a little sweeter than i remembered but the meat fell off the bones and were cooked well.  The chicken was not only miniscule, but somewhat dry.  I only ate a small piece.  For an appetizer, we shared the family seafood platter which contained grilled calamari, scallops and fried calamari.  It was ok.  Nothing special other than a little olive oil marinade on top.  We also had the spinach appetizer which was way too runny and the chips were 'meh.  Overall, I left unimpressed.  The menu has been the same for years.  They used to be great but other places caught up, and surpassed, this restaurant.  They seriously need to re-vamp the menu.  Service was good.  Attentive but not obtrusive.
