I was skeptical at first but I am so happy I took the chance!! The tour is pricy, we did the float, land and helicopter tour to Grand Canyon and Hoover Dam which was close to $1000 for 2 of us. Our tour guy \"Juergen\" was amazing, fun and very knowledgeable. He really catered to all of us and showed us the best spots for pics. When I return I will definitely book other tours with them and hopefully we will get our new friend Juergen to guide us ;)
