Stopped in for a quick lunch. The guys behind the counter were hustling to fill orders as it was busy. Only a few tables indoors so I was lucky to snag a table. Too hot to eat outside. I had a Chicken and Carne Asada Taco. The Chicken was spiced nicely and tender. The Carne had no flavor and was very chewy. The beans and rice were very ordinary. I would give it another try for the Chicken Tacos. BTW on a warm day, it is very warm in this restaurant with the grill going and the sun streaming in. Crank the air.
