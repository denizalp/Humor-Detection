It's a nice restaurant in a nice setting and very central and the steaks are fine here.  There's nothing to complain about.  The d√©cor is what you'd expect from a Hy's and the service, even in the bar lounge where I ate.  You see, no one in our party decided to wear anything other than shorts, so no dining room for us.  Fair enough, that would be our mistake.  Bar eating is fine with me.\n\nThe meal in the bar is exactly the same as that served in the dining room so there's no loss.  Even so, the bar itself is pretty well appointed and decorative.  The staff are pleasant and the meal comes to order as you'd expect.  There's worse steaks in the city for sure, but I can't help feeling that there's also better.  Regardless, you're in for a good time.
