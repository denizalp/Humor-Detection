Okay so I'm not really sure why so many reviewers are semi-positive about this place. I can't say I'd ever go back. One positive is the lobby of the Artisan is really cool. Great attention to detail.\n\nWe didn't know where \"Mood\" was so we asked the front desk guy, who, rather coldly, just pointed in its direction. We then arrived to what we assumed was the restaurant (A giant menu poster gave it away, so we thought).\n\nWe then stood in front of this menu poster for 10 minutes waiting for some sign of life to greet us. We then decided to venture to the bar to try and get some understanding how the seating works in this place we nicknamed \"The Twilight Zone\". The bartender told us to just sit anywhere. From that moment on the meal and the overall experience was a real snooze. The server had no personality and the food was okay and definitely not worth the prices.
