LOOK HOW MANY BAD REVIEWS!!  I absolutely hate writing bad reviews and hope I'm smart enough to start reading reviews before I deal with another business like this place.  The staff is very rude and it seems that they feel entitled.  I cannot believe how disrespectful they are.  This is a money oriented, turn and burn shop!!  I'm a military vet who served on an aircraft carrier and started to lose hearing in my left ear about 6 months after I got out.  I informed Dr Richardson that I felt like the reason I started losing my hearing was because of the rehab they did on the ship, jets, gun fire, helicopters, etc,....  She mentioned that she doubted that was the issue because her opinion was that my hearing should have declined equally in each ear.  Really?  Unbelievable!!  At that point she kept asking if I fired guns on a regular basis because that could seriously diminish my hearing.  Well,... let's just say that I did,... shouldn't my right ear be as bad as my left?  Makes no sense at all!!  She didn't listen and was in a huge hurry.  I told her that I was trying to get a professional opinion from a professional outside the VA.  She was sure that she was right, thinking that my hearing loss had nothing to do with the military and didn't feel comfortable stating that there was a 50\/50 chance that my hearing loss was caused by the rehab, jets, helicopters and gun fire.  She mentioned that there was an extra charge to fill out paperwork, and i told her that was fine.  She left the room and it was done.  I went and saw a person who tested the BAJA hearing device on me.  She was very nice and helpful.  I told her I'd think about getting the Baja and went to the front.  I asked the receptionist if I could speak to Dr Richardson to see what her final thoughts were and she informed me that she left.  Her assistant was extremely rude and said that I could schedule another appt to speak with her, I told her that this is my appt, I'm here now and she continued to be rude.  Finally I had to speak with the office manager who took my credit card number in case Dr Richardson felt there was a 50\/50 chance my hearing loss had something to do with the military.  I was called the next Monday and was told by Tori(officer mgr) that the Dr didn't feel comfortable stating this.  Tori left a message with the news, and stated that she'd shred the military paperwork.  I called back 15 minutes later and asked to speak to Tori & to tell her not to shred the paperwork because I needed it.  She picked up the phone and before I said anything she stated,...\" I said Dr Richardson CAN'T help you!\"  I said,\"yes,.. I got your message, but wanted to tell you I need that paperwork, please don't shred it.\"  She said,\" okay, come get it and I'll give it to you.\"   LOLOL  I don't think I've been so disrespected since I was in military boot camp!!  They just don't care at all and act like they're giving a free service.  Now I have to pay for another professional opinion outside the VA,.. I'll read some reviews and hope to find a Dr that cares and has more than 10 minutes.  A Dr that has my best interest in mind and isn't just about selling me a $20K Baja surgery and device.  And to charge a vet,.... or anyone $45 for filling out two pages of paperwork,....HA!  I was asked to show up 30 minutes before my appt,(which I did) then filled out 6 pages of paperwork!!  These people feel like we're a burden to them and they really don't have time for us,.. but they have no problem taking our money!!   I visited another Valley ENT in the past and had a great experience.  I'm not sure if it's something in the water by this area or what,... these people are ridiculous!  I hate confrontation and hate a negative situation vibe even more.  Do not go here,... I'm not sure why these people are so rude and miserable but do yourself a favor and stay away!!  IT'S UNBELIEVABLE!!!
