Awesome breakfast food, insane line. The line was at least 30-45min the first time I tired to go. Would recommend going early or late to get some delicious breakfast food without waiting a ton of time.\n\nI got the bacon sandwich. Was phenomenal. Lots of meat, plenty of eggs, tons of flavor. These are snacks, not full meals (or maybe I just eat too much). I'd recommend getting a sandwich here and 1-2 sides to really fill up. You won't regret getting something here, though- great for a snack before going out!
