We've been meaning to try this place many times and eventually got to to it a few weeks ago, only to find it was closed for renovations.\nSo we tried again last week. \nIt was quiet, but we were early.  The owners were very friendly and helped us choose a few items. \nWe started off with the Samosas and Onion Pakora. Both delicious, but the Samosas were the star.  In hind sight 1 order of Samosas is enough for 2 as an appetizer, the owner warned us, and he was right.\nNext we had our entrees which consists of a veggie korma for my wife, goat biryanni for me and an afghani boti kobab to share accompanied with rice and garlic naan.\nEverything came out hot and perfectly cooked. Portions are just right, but with our large appetizer we did have to take a few bits home.\nAll in all, really enjoyed the meal, food was good, owners inviting and made us feel at ease. Will be going back.
