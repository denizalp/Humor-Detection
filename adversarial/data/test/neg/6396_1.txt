Today my cousin offered to take us here for lunch! I must be honest, I haven't been to Olive Garden in YEARS because of the service and the food wasn't that great. But today this wasn't the case, my cousin was RAVING about the new duo deal that they offer during lunch time. All you can eat soup and salad. I simply told her if it wasn't all that you're making it out to be I'm going to be MAD {that's what really hungry people say} LOL!\n\nWhen I walked in I was IMMEDIATELY blown away by the beautiful upgrades, yes its been that long I didn't know that had updated the location. The bar was beautiful, the Italian wording on the walls, and they even had bottles of wine in glass cases on the wall. It had to be about, not sure who or how those are kept clean but kudos to that person lol.\n\nWe were seated by our hostess and provided menus, shortly after our server came out. I liked how prompt she was and she greeted us with a smile and her name... VERY important. Alex offered the wine sampling for us and offered to start us with waters. We knew what we wanted to order so we all went with the soup and salad. My cousin and I had the Chicken and Gnocchi - A creamy soup made with roasted chicken, traditional Italian dumplings and spinach, and our other cousin had the Zuppa Toscana - Spicy Italian sausage, fresh kale and russet potatoes in a creamy broth. Made with gluten-free ingredients.\n\nAfter finishing up our third round of the unlimited soup and salad we were able to able to take what we could not finish home. I was happy about that, usually, when restaurants offer unlimited you're not able to take what's left on your plate and the restaurants throw it away. This made me very happy, and as i'm typing up this review i'm enjoying my leftovers. \n\nHappy Cusotmer!
