Store update\nWell you left a sour taste in my mouth. I don't remember what is your credit card minimum, but I came in here to buy ice cream for my family after dinner and was told you could not accept credit cards because I didn't meet your minimum. You do know you have some very high prices for some food items. Good luck staying in business as more competitors are popping up. I really hope that we get an H-Mart.
