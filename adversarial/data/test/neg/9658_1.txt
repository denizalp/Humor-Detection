This restaurant was recommended by a co-worker.  The food was very good and the service was great.  Was with a group of friends when I came here a few months back.   The brushetta was to die for and the stuffed grape leaves were delicious.  We had the gyro platter which consisted of beef and lamb carved off the shank and Mousaka which was an egg plant and potato dish that melted in your mouth!  It is a lively place and they had a nice bar.  The waiters were wonderful too.  You'll like this place so check it out.
