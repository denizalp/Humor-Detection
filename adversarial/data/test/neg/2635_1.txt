Awesome food at Pork on a Fork!  The pork is so moist and tender.  And the brisket and chicken and ribs are so tasty!  You gotta love this place.  Their customer service is exceptional.  Whoever smokes the meat really knows their craft.  If you want great BBQ...please go to Pork on a Fork!...btw...I loved their bbq sauces too. And Matt Beard  is a very friendly catering mgr.\n\n- Doug Howitt
