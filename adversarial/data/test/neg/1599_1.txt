Atmosphere was very appropriate for a smokehouse with brick, brown wood booths with sufficient privacy and a central bar with sports tv and just enough smokey smell to enjoy the ambiance.\nService was prompt and friendly enough, but with just a touch of perfunctory, like an orator who gave the same speech once too often.\nThe drinks were served promptly, but the table service was a bit lagging and our sectional staff seemed more interested in talking at a table that either had their family or current or former staff. \nOur table had a short rack of pork ribs and beef brisket with sides of Mac and cheese and Brussels sprouts and French fried potatoes.\nThe rack was served without the 4 sauces which were available at the table for individual taste. Both the ribs and brisket were just average and the brisket was barley warm at service. The ribs were noticeably salty, sure to the dry rub.
