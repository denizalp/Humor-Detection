Very good! Delicious coffee drinks. I had the latte and my friends got the cappuccino. We all got the Venezuelan creole breakfast which came with the most amazing scrambled eggs, cheese, shredded beef, and black beans. On the side was a fresh, hot arepa and they also brought us some creama sauce to top it with. We split an order of tequenos. They were cheese sticks but the breading was a sweet yeast type dough, kind of like a croissant with cheese inside and deep fried. Wow!!!! So good. We were very impressed with Ava's and excited to find a little gem in rock hill.
