3 stars for the food, 5 stars for the ambiance, so 4 stars overall.  This place is retro, but in a good way.  Crazy colors and wait staff dressed in old school uniforms, it's definitely a place to check out at least once if you're in Vegas.  This place does an all day breakfast, and their portions are serious.  The ham steak is literally the size of a large dinner plate, and they grill it so that it gets some great flavor!  Their hash browns are great too, and they use real potatoes!  And I like that they use shredded potatoes that they griddle the heck out of, because I like my hash browns crispy.  And for those that want\/need a drink in the morning, maybe to recover from the night before, they have a full bar from the lounge next door that you can order from.  Overall, fun place to go, whether for food, drinks, or just the atmosphere.
