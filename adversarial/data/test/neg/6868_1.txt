I told my mom the buffet at Wynn was supposed to be fabulous (based on Yelp reviews) but she didn't want to wait in the line so we headed to the Terrace Pointe Cafe.  The menu is small but lovely, the food is presented in an artful fashion (my mother loved the caramelized sugar on her lime half), and the food was great.  I would certainly eat here again.
