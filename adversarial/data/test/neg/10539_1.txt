Can I say this was the best place I think I could of gone to for something I absolutely know nothing about ! Carlos aka Charlie took his time educating me about stereos and features that I might like to have. Not only did they install the stereo and speakers I needed, they also installed a lighted wind Restrictor, dash lights, and special lighted door rails that I walked in with ! It was a pleasure to go to this business where they want you to be absolutely happy with their service ;)
