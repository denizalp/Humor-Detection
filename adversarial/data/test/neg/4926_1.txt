We went there with 45 mins exactly before our KA show started. We asked the lady at the desk if we would be able to get food in that time span, and she recommended any non-grilled items. We were swiftly sat and the server was right with us to order drinks. The lady had told him we were in a rush as he was super attentive, going out of his way to rush our order. By the time we were fed and out the door, we still had 15 mins to spare before the show!! Very impressed with the service, the food (gnocchi and lasagna) were excellent and overall experience was perfect :)
