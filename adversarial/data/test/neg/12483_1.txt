Though it was my first time to Red Robin, overall the restaurant left me with a good impression! My friends and I came after an exam and it was close to where our school is. Also, got some shopping done since it is inside the Galleria Mall!\n\nRight when we entered, the service was quick and our server was really nice. The waiter came around multiple times throughout checking in when we needed refills on drinks and french fries.\n\nI had ordered the Burnin Love burger hearing from my friend that it was really good. And he was right! Though Burnin Love consist of fried jalapeno circle rings, it did not make the heat too spicy or ruin my taste buds. Rather, it gave a smokey taste in the burger. I usually can tolerate spicy really well, so that may be the reason as well. In addition, the burger is really filling! And the portion is decent!\n\nThe seasoning that is available to be placed on your fries, be sure to try it! I love the dry spice seasoning, I never thought about such an idea! It made the fries have an explosion of flavors in your mouth. In addition, our server also brought us two sauces, ranch and a mustard poppy-seed one. Mustard poppy-seed was a new sauce for me, however, it was pretty good. If you are into a sweeter sauce, that one is a definite to try!\n\nI was very satisfied with the service and the food here. Definitely will come back again.
