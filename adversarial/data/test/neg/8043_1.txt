After visiting a sushi restaurant in downtown Charlotte that did not have a lot to offer, I immediately turned to Yelp in search of something out of the ordinary and found Ru San's! It was around dinner time, the restaurant was packed and the service was fast. Ru San's menu was overwhelmingly large (no complaint), and they had a lot of interesting speciality sushi rolls. There were so many sushi rolls I have never seen in my life! I was so incredibly stoked, until I received them. I eat sushi pretty frequently, and while their rolls were very interesting, they were not very proportionate. This made the plate not only look unsatisfying, but the sushi tasted unbalanced. I looked at the neighboring tables and their sushi seemed to look a lot more appealing than mine, so I am willing to give this restaurant another try. Maybe I just got unlucky? I ordered what the waitress said was their most popular roll. I do not know but I have had better sushi!
