Have been a regular here off and on over the past several years as my schedule allows. Everything is great and the staff is welcoming. I love the original G sandwich with fruit as a side and a soynami as a treat while I wait for my food or catch up with a friend. It can be busy at lunch and dinner for those who are new. Don't let this discourage you. It's a great place.
