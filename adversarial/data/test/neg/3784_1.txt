Make sure to check your receipt. The cashier charged me 9 dollars for a 6 dollar burrito.when I asked her about it she tried to tell me it was because of takes. Then because of a soda then finally she said it was just extra that day. And also the food is  basic at best.try tacos el Gordo or Pepe's instead save your self the hassle and disappointment.if you want great food stay away from here.
