Tried this today and all the hype is real. Easily some of the best bbq I've ever had. Get there early or you risk losing out. Line can start as early as 9am for tickets. Beef ribs and fatty brisket go first. Pork ribs and pulled pork are my  favorites.  We waited in line for an hour and it was worth every minute. Highly recommend!
