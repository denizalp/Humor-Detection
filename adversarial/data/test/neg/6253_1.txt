Chino Bandido's website says it serves food that is a blend of Mexican and Asian cooking style. But then what on earth is Jerk Chicken and Jerk Fried rice doing on the menu? Isn't Jerk a cooking style related to something Jamaican? I don't know and I'm not sure. But one thing I can be sure about is whatever your doubts are about CB's cooking style, they will all be laid to rest when you're done eating your Jerk Chicken with Jerk Fried rice and refried Cuban Black Beans served on the side. I've tried a couple other items on the menu and I especially recommend Pollo Diablo if you're looking for something spicy. Oh! And don't forget to eat that Snicker Doodle cookie; it is so delicious.
