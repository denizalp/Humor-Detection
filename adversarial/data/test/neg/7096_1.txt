I love California sandwiches. I generally always order the eggplant parm. This time my sister told me try it w the chicken as well. So i did the chen parm add breades eggplant. It was super delicious. Crispy and flavourful, not too much sauce, right amoint of cheese and onions. \nOf coirse the sandwich is huge so I ate half and my friend enjoyed the other half. Will definitely be back\n\n* ordered through skip the dishes*\n\nCame nice amd hot on arrival not one complaint.
