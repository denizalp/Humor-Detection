Sandwiches are unique and tasty.   Decor is a charm but the best part is the  cupcakes!!  Tried them all when the owner approached me on the street with two boxes of gourmet treats.  It was like winning the baked goods lottery!   That random act of kindness made fans of me and a covey of cupcake lovers that indulged in those yummy treats.
