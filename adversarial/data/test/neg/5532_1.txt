Not a fan. I feel so rushed when I go to this location. They don't even give me time to look at the menu. The soups are not always fresh. I've gotten old soup at this place twice already. I expect fresh soup made every morning at thier prices. Not reheated soup from the day before. Some of thier soups are also too salty.
