It is hard to find a place that serves Pepsi rather than Coke.  That's great!\nFries are crisp, fat and good.\nButter Burger, fries and soda for 3.99!  Awesome!\nNext time I will try the kids meal and get a custard with it!\nTables were clean,  employees were courteous and smiled.\nNo issues for us!
