Very close to my work so I come here for my lunch time to time. Love all the foods served here. They have much more taste than most of the places. However, I would appreciate much more if the service was better. The waitresses seem stressed out when they are serving (at least during busy times they are..). Other than that, a great place to eat Korean dishes.
