Loves it! Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken is AMAZE. Located in the far end of the 'dining destination' at Downtown Summerlin. Food is fresh and Southern fabulous. Pickled cucumbers are the only vegetable LOL, but they rock, and I e asked them if they'd sub fries for a salad for me once or twice and they were very accommodating. The staff is friendly and fast. I dig it :)
