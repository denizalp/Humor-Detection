Korean BBQ on a chilly spring day really hits the spot.  Korean Grill House is located just a block north of Yonge & Dundas square; there are two floors of grilling goodness.  When you arrive and are seated, you have the option of ordering from the a la carte or the all-you-can-eat menus.  We opted to go for the $9.99 AYCE lunch menu which gave us chicken, beef, squid and fish to grill (they had pork as well but we were going kosher today).\n\nAlongside the unlimited access to meat, they have rice, soup and korean side dishes that can be replenished as well!\n\nService is ok, our waiter had his hands full with the packed first floor.\n\nKorean Grill House is on the revisit list for cheap AYCE eats!
