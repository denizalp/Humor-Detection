This pet store is Awesome!  I highly recommend them.  Everyone is very nice and helpful.  We have 2 fresh water tanks,  2 salt water tanks and 3 dogs.  The store has everything we need for all our pets.  Setting up tanks can be challenging and we frequently ask questions as we learn how to care for our tanks.  They take time to help you and answer any questions you may have.  Yes,  they get busy and yes there may be a but of a wait to get to talk to someone....  But when you do you get the best service!!  Totally worth it! They care about their customers and their pets a lot.
