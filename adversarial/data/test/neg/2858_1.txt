Great spot to be on a snowy night as it wasn't too busy.  Started off with the Cherry Bomb appetizer that is unique and really tasty - it's a hollowed out tomato with sausage stuffing and then fried.  I tried the pasta & scallops special as well and that was excellent.  No room for dessert this time but I'll try to save room next visit.
