So... all of my reviews for awhile are going to start with how pleasantly surprised I am by a quality independent restaurant here. I read such bad reviews about the food in the Phoenix area from foodies like myself who come from places famous for their independent food scene. Once again... HAPPY! Granted the meal I ordered was simple. Had the new york strip with green beans.But it was perfect! I ordered medium rare and it was truly medium rare. The steak was quality, the beans were cooked perfectly and spiced beautifully. The one negative was weird.. the plate was tiny. So small that I had to take half my steak off the plate and put it on a side plate to be able to cut it. The sauce was falling over the side and the tiny, avante garde plate had a bizarre swoop in it so i couldn't rest my knife on it without it sliding off. That should really be changed. But back to the good stuff. The bartenders were fabulous! Both recommended wines were perfect, they were friendly and funny and best of all... quick. This is going to become a regular haunt for sure.
