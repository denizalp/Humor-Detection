\"Trop\" is probably my favorite smoothie place. I just wish they had locations in Reno so I could get one when I'm at home and not just on vacation. \n\nThey have a wide variety of flavors and display all the delicious ingredients and add ins to truly make the best out of your morning breakfast. I wish they had some of the nutrition benefits of them but that's just my inner college nutrition student speaking. I LOVE the chia banana boost smoothie with whey protein. \n\nI usually don't get their food but their wraps I have occasionally and they're pretty good! Nice if you're extra hungry and want to supplement your smoothie. \n\nThe service is moderate-good. It truly depends on how busy it is because it's a smaller place. If you go early enough, you get served right away and can enjoy your delicious health packed breakfast! LOVE LOVE LOVE!
