I started coming here when I was 16. Almost 9 years! For so long they were so amazing, cared about what they were doing and did a fantastic job. Now, they are lazy, half-ass their work and get frustrated when I ask them to do something too time consuming. I am paying you and leaving you a tip to do a good job. Yesterday I was overcharged for my gel manicure and it didn't even turn out good at all. Sad to say..... I will no longer be going here.
