Excellent Customer Service!!  \n\nYesterday walked over to get my burrito fix and the local Qdoba at Park Central, went through the line got all those yummy fixens and then realized I dropped\/lost my money!!! (UGH) I looked at the gal at the register and said hold this I will trace my steps and be back to pay for it... she steps around the counter and hand me my burrito and said \"Merry Christmas\".  I looked at her oddly and said \"What?\" shocked ... again she said \"Merry Christmas have a nice lunch\".  Merry Christmas to you too, walked back to my office ate my yummy burrito.\n\nAfter the lunch rush slowed down I went back to pay for the burrito, I found her and told her I was here to pay for my burrito... her manager said, \"I have been there have a Merry Christmas are you sure, yes ... have a Merry Christmas,\"  I wished them a Merry Christmas a well.\n\nNow I am not saying they will do this for everyone I just thought my fellow Yelpers should know there are businesses and folks running those businesses that have a heart and understand sometimes you drop your cash or forget your credit card.  I just know they have my business.\n\nMerry Christmas to Everyone!
