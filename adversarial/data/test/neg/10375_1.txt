I stopped in for a pedicure one day and Kim was friendly, professional and did a lovely job on my neglected feet. The vibe of the shop is so warm and relaxed that I brought my husband back the next weekend for one and so I could get a Gel Manicure for the first time. Tam was also professional and very kind as she helped me get familiar with the UV light. She did beautiful work on my nails and I couldn't be happier. Paul makes everyone feel welcome, scheduling is easy and accommodating. I'm planning on being a regular:)
