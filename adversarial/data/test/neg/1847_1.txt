Little corner restaurant in Verdun. I don't have to go far now to satisfy my korean food craving. I've tried their fried chicken and kimbap upon recommendations. Kimbap was good. Fried chicken was good too, but I still prefer the one from another korean restaurant. The chicken was crispy, but I find the inside too moist.  I will definitely go back to try my favourite comfort soup.... soon du bu!
