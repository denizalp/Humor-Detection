A good restaurant that (barely) failed  to live up to its hype.\n\nThe good:\n1) Really lively \/ trendy place, great for hanging out for drinks.  \n2) Good beer and cocktail selection.  \n3) Wait staff was very friendly.  \n4) The sea bass was very good.\n\nThe improvement areas:\n1) Hostess team significantly under-estimated wait time for a table.  Not helpful as we had a business commitment later that evening.  This created a rushed experience\n2)  Food was good, but didn't live up to the hype.  Interesting, creative menu, but lacking 'fillers' to go with the expensive fancy entrees. \n\nOverall, good place for happy hour and when dining on the company's dime.
