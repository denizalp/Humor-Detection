We were there for a Sunday afternoon lunch and the service was super slow because they only had one person serving the entire patio.  Management seems to miss the fact  that on a fine Sunday afternoon people would want to be dining on the patio.  Otherwise why would you only have one person running around trying to serve so many tables?
