Aura at Midtown is an amazing apartment complex with an unbeatable location, helpful staff, and great amenities. My husband and I love that multiple grocery stores, coffee shops, and restaurants are within walking distance. Plus if anything is too far the City Bikes and light rail are right around the corner. The staff has been extremely accommodating and all work requests have been responded to within hours. Those things coupled with great amentities inside and out make these apartments ideal! Where else can you find wood floors, swimming pools, fire pits, and community gardens!
