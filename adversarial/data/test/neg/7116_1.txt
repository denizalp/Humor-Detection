As a Coronado resident, I appreciate how this renewed space treats its neighbors: free cup of coffee. (They couponed my door earlier this week.)\n\nToday, though, I paid for my scone and macchiato since I'd left the coupon at home. Totally worth it. The espresso is up there with Giant. And the dark chocolate and cherry scone was appropriately sized, not a big box bakery Goliath. Perhaps too much raw sugar on top. I brushed a bit off. \n\nThe space offers a better feel than Coronado Cafe and Urban Vine (terrible name) did. Decor is Lux meets Cartel,  and the wood floor homifies it warmly. \n\nThough no demitasse cups yet, the super-friendly and accommodating barista offered me the macchiato in a tiny glass jar. Worked for me. \n\n$2 off signature cocktails during happy hour. A very intriguing lunch and dinner menu with nearly all entries vegan. Can't wait to go for weekend breakfast. \n\nWelcome to the neighborhood.
