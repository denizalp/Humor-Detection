Chicken Curry Dumplings? Crazy tasty. Chicken and Coriander, OH YES! My friends did pork and beef too, but that's not really my thing, but I can assure you they like it. \n\nThis location is much bigger than the original one on Lincoln St near Concordia, and looks clean too. When I went to pay I watched 2 ladies rolling out the dumpling skins and stuffing them up ready to be steamed or fried. \n\nThey have a few select dumplings available frozen too! So if you are ever in need of some dumplin' lovin' I definitely say yes.
