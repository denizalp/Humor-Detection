Took my son in for yet another ear infection. The girls at the front desk were very friendly and helpful. The doctor was amazing with my son and even educated me more on my son's  chronic ear infections then even his primary care. They even did a follow up call which no urgent care I've been to has ever done. I've always felt all urgent cares were the same and which ever is closest and open would do. I will definitely be making this my urgent care of choice!
