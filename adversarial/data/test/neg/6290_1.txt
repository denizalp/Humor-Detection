I needed to get an ultrasound done after being told multiple times by an OB I would get one, or OB's suddenly no longer doing prenatal care. I searched up on Google and I found this gem rated extremely high and I called to find out if they took Medicaid. They do not take Medicaid, but for 25$ they do the ultrasound, print out the photos, tell you your due date, and show you the heartbeat (if it's there). The ladies were very nice and answered all of my questions and even told me to come back around December for the gender reveal. \n\nOverall I will be back for another. I cant wait to see my baby!
