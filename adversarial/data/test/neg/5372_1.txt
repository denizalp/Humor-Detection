Pizza is amazing although the space is very small. It seems to be family owned which is a neat factor. There's really not a lot of space for a line even, the tables are setup to where you might be in the way of the line to be served. The menu selection is great, lots of pizza toppings to choose from and it also includes calzones, desserts and drinks. I only give it 4 stars because the space is so small.
