There is a lot to like about this place. For starters, the menu is extensive, includes lots of seafood, chicken, and other healthier choices.\n\nThe presentation is very well done.  The chef must have studied somewhere, because the little presentation details on the plate remind me of fine dining in larger cities.\n\nThe food itself is very good.  Lots of interesting choices for ingredients.  My dish tonight included a chicken breast with apples, onions, and yams with a maple reduction.  Very good as you might imagine.\n\nService was prompt, friendly, and continuous. This is a big reason why the place gets 4 stars from me.\n\nWill return for sure if I ever get back to town.
