Why is 0 stars not an option?\n\nI have one word to describe this place: racketeering. Never mind that the office is dirty, grungy, cluttered and poorly run. The people that work there are rude and absolutely unprofessional. I run a service desk, I know what good customer service looks like, and you won't find any of it at Ewing Bros. It became painfully obvious that you didn't need a high school diploma or any common sense or courtesy to work here. \n\nWe called one night and were put on hold for almost an hour. They never did get around to answering the phone, about 5 min in we hung up, called back and were put on hold again. We got sick of waiting and drove over there (still on hold), we walk in and there are 3 people just sitting around doing nothing while we are still on hold. \n\nMy friend was in a motorcycle accident, he was not at fault, instead of leaving his bike at the shopping center where he crashed (like they said they would), Metro (there's another pleasant bunch for you), had it towed to Ewing Bros. as he was being transported to UMC. After doing a bit of research, I found out that if your vehicle is ever towed by Metro, say it's stolen, abandoned, you're in an accident, etc., it will end up at 1 of 2 tow yard, Ewing being one of them. \n\nThey charge some $250+ for towing it and a $29.50 daily fee for holding it. God forbid you don't know it's there (stolen for example), you are still stuck with the crazy fees. And there is an additional $50 to have you vehicle moved from their yard to the street to have AAA tow it. They charge extra for getting your vehicle after normal business hours. \n\nThe moral of this rant is, don't use this company, and if you are forced to and they give you the runaround, then report them to the Nevada Transportation Authority: http:\/\/nta.nv.gov\/uploadedFiles\/ntanvgov\/content\/Forms\/ComplaintForm.pdf\n\nGood luck, Yelpers!
