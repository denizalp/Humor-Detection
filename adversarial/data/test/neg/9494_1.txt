Black Bear Diner excels at breakfast. 4 or 5 stars easy for that.\n\nThis review is about the Friday all you can eat fish. Ok, they can call it all you can eat fish-sticks. Sure they are big, but they taste just as frozen as the fries and the coleslaw was that distinctive costco taste out of a bucket -- huh?\n\nThis is not the Black Bear Diner that I know, and I was at the original and many along the Northern California routes they are found.\n\nI would not do this Friday Fish thing ever again, though I will return for breakfast, and expect to be vindicated by a massive plate full of the best freshly prepared good ingredient breakfast I could imagine getting there. Let's hope for the best!
