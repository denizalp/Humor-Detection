Terrible service! Unsanitary. Worst manicure\/pedicure of my life! Along with horrible service!\n\nI walked In and she had the tools sitting on the table; I didn't see if they were sanitized or  not. She had absolutely no idea what she was doing. She was rough despite my flinching, pushing my cuticles all over the place. At one point I pulled my foot back and yelled. She painted and repainted my toes several times because, again, she had no idea what she was doing. I was contemplating even doing the manicure but had to because I had a Groupon. I had to tell her to push my cuticles back before she started cutting. It seemed foreign to her. The nippers were going all over the place and I was afraid of her cutting SOMETHING off! She was painting my fingernails while they were suspended in midair (imagine that!) Without holding my fingers. I believe her name was mirna or something like that. Not that one person's name matters, they were all just the same because when I told someone how terrible and frightening the experience was, nothing was done about it. \n\nDon't even get me started on the checkout process when I told them I had a Groupon!  I never went back to use my other manicure\/pedicure deal! And needed to get the word out for others to save their money and time and potential loss of fingers\/toes!
