I've been looking forward to watch this show and I was not disappointed, in fact, during the whole show,felt that I was In different dimension, our ticket was a little pricey as it was last minute but  we were in one of the best seats and it's worth every penny..I'm sure even those who watched from the seat farther, enjoyed the show as much as I did. Performers were great, sounds and of course the Beatle's music was amazing ,  I want to watch this show 5 or 10 more times. For my sons who were natural daredevils, it will excite them to the max and to my daughters who love music and dancing, it will surely amaze them. I plan to watch this show with the whole family next year. To the whole production of \"LOVE\" well done, great job, and more power to you, and may you continue to awe more people with the greatness of your show.
