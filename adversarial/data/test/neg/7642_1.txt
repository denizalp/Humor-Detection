Chris and Kyle did an awesome job helping us load our 3 bedroom house into a 26 foot Uhaul this morning. They showed up on time, got straight to work, and moved everything carefully and efficiently. Not that we ever want to move again, but they did make it much less terrible, and if we do end up moving, we'll know who to call! Thanks again!
