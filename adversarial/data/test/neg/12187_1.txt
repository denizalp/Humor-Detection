Good, but not great, food.  Nice wine.  Total time from sitdown to depart just slightly over one hour.\n\nImportant to travelers is that this is not the fastest place in the airport.  I would recommend allocating just over one hour for lunch and that is simply sitting, ordering a drink, ordering lunch, eating, paying.  No after lunch chatting.  \n\nDecided to try Beaudevin as an alternative to the traditional airport stuff.  It is pleasant looking and you can either sit outside where the action is going on or go inside for a respite from the activity.  I sat outside but if I return I will sit inside. Prices range from $15-23 for a good lunch plus drinks.   The wine I ordered was very nice but at $19 for a 9oz pour one would expect as much.  I ordered the BLT with a salad.  The salad was the highlight of the meal.  The BLT was good, not great, but good.  The server was extremely pleasant.  The only downside was the time it took for the overall experience.  My opinion is that it is a kitchen issue rather than a waitstaff issue.  However, if you have a bit over an hour to spend on a good meal and glass of wine at CLT this might be your place.
