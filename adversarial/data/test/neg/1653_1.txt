Little neighbourhood brunch places are the best places. This little joint is tucked away between parkdale and roncy. \n\nDaily menu is on the chalkboard and has a small offering. Which mean all the choices are delicious! No alcohol choices but the coffee was tasty!  \n\nI had the scramble with sourdough toast. The portions were great and ingredients fresh. Shoutout to the jalape√±o aioli! Especially tasty! I want that on everything! \n\nI can't wait to go again and try the French toast!
