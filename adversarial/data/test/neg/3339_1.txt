I went for the first time to Cibo on the weekend for a mother's day brunch.  They actually don't have a brunch - but that was my mistake!!  Anyway, the food was good, but not brunchy.\n\nI believe the manager seated us and was very friendly.  He told us about the building and the repurposed wood etc.... my mom was thrilled to hear about it.\n\nOur young blond female server took forever to come to the table, wouldn't come back to check on things at all, and had very little personality.  A male server took over for her and he was much better and made some good suggestions on the menu.\n\nThe food is good.  I'm a low-carber so I asked for some suggestions.  The server suggested I have the chicken liver pate with iceberg  lettuce instead of the crostini's it's typically served with (mmmmm very good)... unfortunately the grilled squid salad has a very sweet dressing on it (delicious, but not low carb)... I guess I can't expect servers to understand what \"low carb\" or \"no sugar\" actually means.\n\nAnyway, 3 stars is appropriate.  Great location, good food, a fun manager, and at least one decent server!  I'll definitely check it out again, but not for the high carb Italian food... hahah definitely a good patio session is in order!
