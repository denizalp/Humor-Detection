Tried this place once, was not impressed with food or service - would have given it 2 stars.  Decided to give it another shot but between the two I can't give more than 1 star.\n\nIt took almost 40 minutes to get our breakfast orders (ham and eggs, eggs benedict).  My eggs benedict was cold.  Not just lukewarm, but actually cold.  When I finally flagged the waitress down to ask for a new one, she seemed to not be able to understand what I was saying and called her manager.  I told the manager my food was cold and she took it to the kitchen and told me she'd be right out with a replacement.  Ok, no problem.  Until 20 minutes later and my husband was done with his meal (since I was starving by this time and shared his) and I still hadn't gotten my food.  I would have just cancelled the order had I been able to get someone's attention to tell. By the time I got my order (over an hour since we'd arrived), we were running late and needed to leave.  The manager was upset that I told her I no longer wanted the meal and only very reluctantly took it off the bill.  \n\nIf this was my first experience here, I wouldn't give a review like this until I tried it again.  But this second try was our first visit all over again, just magnified.\n\nThe only good thing about the place are the prices - eat here if you are seriously on a budget and have lots and lots of time and patience.
