Whole Pet has taken care of my shih tzu for almost 3 years.  Every staff member from front desk, to tech, to vet is so kind and informative.  The always offer advice, detailed descriptions, as well as take-home reading.  I also love that they are on top of their e-mail for documents and scheduling. Great service.
