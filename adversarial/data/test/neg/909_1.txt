This was a bright spot in the culinary adventures of Vegas.  We went for a early dinner before heading to the airport and it was lovely.  The restaurant is clean and have awesome decor---I felt like I was in Vegas eating somewhere that I should see people or that it should be 4am and I should be getting a huge breakfast after a night out at the clubs.  The restaurant had a couple of others in it (we're talking dinner at 3:45 so its even early for the early birds) but they sat everyone in places where you didn't feel like you were on top of the others.  Service was prompt, nice, informative, and thorough.  The food was great, I had a fantastic salad, and my bf had a sandwich which looked yummy.  When he realized it had bacon on it, and he doesn't eat pork, the waitress took it back no questions asked and had a new one made for him.  The manager stopped by to ask if everything was okay, and thanked us for coming in.  I would highly recommend Peppermill to anyone going to vegas for quality food, reasonable prices, fun atmosphere, and genuine service.
