I love this Trader Joe's the best. The staff is so friendly & affable. If you're a frequent shopper like me, they recognize your absence. Love how the checkers make recommendations on items for you pertaining to your purchases at the check out register in a friendly way. They offer stickers or a balloon to your kids when they have some. The store is always clean, organized & decorative.\n\nIf you love nuts, they have a great variety of nuts & dried fruit for a good price. I love how they have reasonably priced organic fruits, eggs, dairy & other food items as well.  I bought these organic trail mix cookies there that were so good. It was made without dairy, eggs & gluten free. I couldn't stop eating them. They have some good hummus dip, salsa, cheese & lunch meat. A lot of their cereal is good too. The Triple Berry Cereal is so good!  Many of their things are good & very reasonably priced. The Greek yogurt is good. The drinks are cheaper. I bought the 100% cranberry juice for half the price I would pay at Albertsons or Smiths.\n\nIt's cool because they have a sample counter for their food, coffee & juice of the day. I love to buy their coffees & teas too. The expresso they sell called D'Aquino from Italy is really good. It's smooth...\n\nI usually go there on Sundays, & I noticed that they have a wine tasting. Pretty cool, huh? Their wine is pretty good. They have different kind of beers too. \n\nThey don't have a big selection of raw meat & chicken, but the ones they have are quality. I usually get my meat or chicken somewhere else because for the price, it's not enough to feed my family.  The same goes for their fresh herbs like the cilantro. It doesn't come in a bulk like at Albertson's, Smiths, or even the Sunflower Market. \n\nOne last thing, I like their plants & flowers. They are always look good & also low priced.
