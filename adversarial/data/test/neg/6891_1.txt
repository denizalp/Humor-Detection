This is one of the trilogy of the Goodlifes in this area (Manulife, Yorkville, Park) . In my opinion this club ranks third among the others. It has a pool though, the other two don't. For some reason, which I never understood, their BodyCombat classes are waaaay better than the other two, even if they're taught by the same instructors. I guess the regular BodyCombat crowd is just so much more fun than Park and Yorkville. Another good thing about this club is that you can get your protein shake from the deli below the gym, right after your workout.
