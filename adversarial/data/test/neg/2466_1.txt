Cool spot i finally got to.check out last night. I was cool because it was a slow night so the service was good and.we got our food very quick. The decor is so cool specially the outside area with a tree and a tv and the lighting is awesome. We had really good wings and some fish tacos that were excellent the drinks were on point also so. Thumbs up from me.
