This review is a year past due unfortunately. In may of last year, my old car died on the first day of my vacation. Which worked out, I now had the time and money to find a new car. After looking at 9 used accords from 7 dealerships and a couple of private individuals, I was done. I started to convince myself that I don't need a car etc. My car shopping experience was a nightmare between the cars themselves and the overly aggressive sales people to shadey individuals. Last day of vaca i see arrowhead honda post a car no pic yet due to just being added to their lot, carfax shows it was originally purchased at Arrowhead Honda, serviced on time through the years at Arrowhead Honda, then traded in at Arrowhead Honda, so I had to see this car! I get there and from the start the experience was amazing, especially compared to the others. The car was almost perfect for an 09 accord, got a great price on it, the salesmen (if i remember correctly his name was Dan) and the manager that worked the price for me were courteous, professional and honest in fact all staff I came into contact with were. After I bought the car they still had to do all their normal service to it as if they were still putting it on the lot beings it had just been traded in that day. During that time they discovered a couple things that needed to be addressed (again used 09 things are going to come up). They replaced\/fixed the issues free of charge. I don't feel that the other dealerships I went to would have done the same. The car, a year later, is still great and has been maintenanced twice by Arrowhead Honda and those experiences have been impeccable, their service department is top notch. Will recommend anyone to them for new\/used cars and service. Thank you again Arrowhead Honda. Sincerely Brandon C.
