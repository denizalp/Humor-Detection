Some great variety of food available here, reflecting the diverse populace of Calgary. Reminds me slightly of places such as Chili's or Friday's, but with better quality food, service, and much more variety. I had the privilege of being treated to lunch last Sunday here by my hosts while visiting town. My friend's grandfather had the fish and chips, and my friend picked a noodle bowl along with a line-up of some rather nice sushi, some sort of roll with a great spice and crunch (of which I don't remember the name of, sadly). My dish was the planked salmon, with a beautiful green curry sauce and served over roasted root veggies. Good moistness, not dry, and with plenty of flavor in the curry that didn't overpower the veggies or fish. Definitely not only a place to get a good lunch, but somewhere to talk over food, take time, relax. Like a neighborhood joint, but only better. I was also told by my friend that some of the locations of Earl's are privately owned (perhaps this one is one of those?). At any rate, because of the limited locations in the U.S. and this location being close to where a dear friend happens to live, I hope that a visit with that friend may bring us to Earl's for another nice time.
