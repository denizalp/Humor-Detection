this casino is beautiful. From the 16th chapel at the front entrance to the gondola boat ride this place is a piece of Italy in the middle of Vegas. Loved the layout of the shopping area and we were able to walk over to Madam T's wax museum as well. Would love to stay here one day and see what the rooms look like.
