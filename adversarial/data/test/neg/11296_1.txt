This is one of the best salon experiences I've ever had. I called to make an appointment and Adam got me in almost immediately. He was very flexible and I was even a few minutes late and he waited around 10 minutes for me! I was seen immediately! Adam spent about 20 minutes trying to figure out what I wanted and made me extra comfortable because I was weary of the new style change. I've been to about five other hairdressers and they messed up each and every time. During the haircut, he made sure that he liked what I saw and walked me through the entire process of what he was doing before he made the cut. He does super clean lines and perfect fades and not only does exactly what you ask for, but he does even more than what you expect (in a good way). He is a true artist and your hair is his canvas. You definitely feel the care and compassion he has for his customers. All of my friends go to him and my coworkers. He is also one of the most chill guys you've ever met! I would recommend this to anybody and everybody with any 30 mile vicinity. Make an appointment with Adam today!
