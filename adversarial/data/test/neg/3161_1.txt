This review is for the service I received at the hotel. I stayed for the weekend at this hotel and had a pair of new and expensive earrings stolen from me. I am absolutely positive I left them on the bathroom sink (I hesitated to do this in the first place) and when I returned after the maid service came in to clean they were gone. I looked everywhere and they were definitely gone. I called the operator and was told that I would get a call back immediately about the situation. I never received a call and will never return back to the hotel. HIDE YOUR STUFF SO IT DOESN'T GET STOLEN TOO!
