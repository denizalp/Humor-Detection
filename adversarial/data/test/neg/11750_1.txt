Loved this buffet.  As a fish-eating vegetarian (ok, pescatarian) all-you-can-eat buffets are rarely a good deal, but I definitely got my money's worth at this one.   \n\nThere were tons of interesting non-meat options; beyond an abundance of salads and pastas there were also less common-place grains, noodles, and well-prepared vegetables available.   Loved the unlimited sushi.   The desserts were plentiful and tasty.   \n\nI wish there hadn't been a 1 hour wait to get in (Monday night in March) but that was my only complaint.
