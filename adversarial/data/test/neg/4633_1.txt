I've been here a few times now, and each was an amazing experience.  Their specialty is definitely seafood, and I would consider this one of the best, if not best Portuguese fare in the GTA.  The sardines, grilled octopus and tiger shrimp are definitely favourites.  If their stellar food wasn't enough, their service puts them on another level.  The waitstaff is courteous, knowledgeable and helpful without being too intrusive.  \n\nTo emphasize the kindness of their staff further, my sister was just walking by Chiado on a rainy day, and a staff member came out and just gave her an umbrella (she returned it the next day). She wasn't even a customer! It's the little things that leave a lasting impression on people, and this was one of them.
