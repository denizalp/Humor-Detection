As huge Marvel fans this is the only thing that Marvel has let us down on. This was pathetic. The 'host' made a bad thing worse. Instead of letting you look around and read things and do things at your leisure you are forced to stay in a group. Sometimes way too fast so you can't read the info and other times way too slow. The bad jokes were pathetic and so unprofessional. This is for 5 year olds at best. This is our new benchmark for the worst thing we've seen. Waste of our time and money. If you are a marvel fan or an adult without kids DO NOT go. Seeing some set suits is not worth it.
