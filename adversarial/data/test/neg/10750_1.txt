I went into this place to ask some questions about a room for my upcoming move. I spoke with the manager, Shannon who was super nice and answered my questions. He sat with me and helped me determine exactly what size I will need and gave me all the information I will need when I'm ready to rent. When I'm ready to rent, I'm sure the manager will take good care of me.
