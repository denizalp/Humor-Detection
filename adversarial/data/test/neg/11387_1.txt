Anatolia! After hearing so many great things for a few months, I was excited to finally come here. Metered street parking is available directly along the same street, it was Sunday and I had no trouble finding a spot. \n\nIt was a beautiful day so we sat outside, it took about 10 minutes to be acknowledged, though not too busy outside, maybe it was busy inside. \n\nWe ordered the traditional Turkish salad, the cheese cigars, and the chicken and lamb kabobs. The salad I am used to and absolutely love, loved it here too. The cheese pastry cigars are amazing, kind of salty but I love salty and these were really delicious. The chicken was undercooked, rubbery texture which grossed me out. The lamb was flavorful but still felt like something was missing, also didn't think that it was cooked to its full potential. \n\nFor dessert, we ordered the knaffeh, which is a dessert I am very familiar with, and they earned 5 stars on dessert! It was absolutely delicious and I would probably come back just for the knaffeh dessert. \n\nWe experienced service with a few different waiters, all of whom were pleasant. I will definitely be back here for the knaffeh but next time I will try different menu items with better luck, hopefully.
