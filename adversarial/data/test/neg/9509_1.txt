If I could give 0 stars I would, but unfortunately you can't.  Pep Boys proved that they don't have any versatility in fixing or even looking at cars.  I made an appointment with one guy on the phone to bring my 2002 BMW because my coolant is leaking.  Brought it in the following day and was straight up turned away because it's a BMW and they can't work on it with that type of issue. What a completely silly situation.  Terrible operation and would never ever trust any car with pep boys in the future.  Continue going to your local mechanic who is trustworthy, no corporate garages. Save your time and money.
