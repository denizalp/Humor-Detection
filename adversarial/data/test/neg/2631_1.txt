I ordered the fried stinky tofu thinking that was just the name but quick to realize I had mistaken. The service is not great and the stinky tofu is absolutely repulsive. After I told them I could not eat it they said they can't do anything about it and still charged me. Also the Kung Pao chicken had FAR too many red peppers. Would not go again
