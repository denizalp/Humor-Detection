A group of us hit up sushi D for my birthday on a Wednesday night. We have had takeout from there before and loved the Rock Shrimp. On this trip we did all you can eat and it was really good! The orders came to the size relative to our group, the sushi chef prepared us a special avocado and salmon dish that was not on the menu and provided as a token of there appreciation.\n\nService was great!, can't wait to go back!
