I had high hopes for this place because of the reviews.. I got beef kabob dinner (comes with rice and salad).. and I got 6 Falafels on the side. My friend had the chicken shawarma on a pita. The beef kabob barely had any flavor.. I should of followed my instinct and got it at a Real Middle Eastern Restaurant.. where it is tender and flavorful.. I'm sorry but his one Lacked Flavor but it was fresh.. which is good! But I was so craving that tender flavorful beef kabob and I did not get it! I didn't even finish it.. I took a bite and got turned off because my craving wasn't satisfied! The falafel was good! The garlic sauce was okay, nothing special. Now.. I took my friends chicken shawarma on a pita.. that I can admit was good.. although I would prefer more toppings on mine.. we ended up trading because he saw how irritated I was, that I didn't get my craving satisfied.. so he sacrificed.. Smiley Face.  Yip, good friend indeed! I got the Al Juice in pomegranate flavor and I didn't like it much. This place isn't bad.. but it's just not for me.. I wouldn't recommend it personally.. but you can try it for yourself. Customer service was very good and friendly and she gave me recommendations.. but these stars are based on the food.
