This is informational for you.  I scheduled with them because they are a provider under our insurance, Avesis.  Per my conversation with them for scheduling and verifying insurance, they said Avesis was $10 copay for the exam and $130 towards glasses or contacts.  Contacts were discussed because that's what I've primarily worn for a long time and I asked if the carried the brand of contacts I have worn for several years.\nI was emailed 3 pages of paperwork which I printed and completed before the exam.  Upon arriving, I was handed an additional consent sheet that was specifically for contacts.  I had to sign and consent to being charged another fee of $69 or $99 for contacts prescription numbers.  Whether my additional charge was $69 or $99, I would only learn that after the exam.  If I did not sign the form and consent to the extra charge, I would only be given prescription measurements for glasses.  They said I could use the $130 towards the additional exam charges, leaving $31 or $61 insurance credit towards my contacts depending on what my additional fee was.  \n\nI elected to not sign and therefore not do the exam. I will look elsewhere.  I know that I have not paid an additional contact exam fee like this in the past. I wish they would have emailed this consent form with the other forms they emailed.  Two weeks have passed since first scheduling, after them rescheduling due to doctor illness, and learning of the additional fee only upon arriving for the rescheduled appointment.
