This has the be the BEST dentist office I have been to. They treat you with the utmost respect and are patient. I have had my wisdom teeth pulled and many other things completed and have never had an issue. They are very up to date with technology which is a plus for someone like me. They send you text reminders of appointments so you don't have to answer a call on your busy work day. Thank you Dental Depot for all you do!
