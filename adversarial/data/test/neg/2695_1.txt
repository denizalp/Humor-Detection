AZ Party Mart is the place to go!  Scott is first very personable, he listens to your needs and is a great business owner.  His store has very fun unique items.  I just had my daughters 29th birthday.  I had him fill a huge 2 and 9 balloon on 12\/22\/17.  They are still floating perfectly in her room.  He had some really fun items to add to the party.  They are very helpful and will make happen what you want to happen. Love this place!
