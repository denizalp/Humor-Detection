If you're not signed up to the Hertz rewards program. You better hurry up and do it. It's free, you get points even when you're not renting a car and those points never expire. I signed up for it last year when I went to Las Vegas. My husband and I didn't have to wait in line to pick up the rental. It picks a cars for you in the category you choose when you reserve the car. You can change cars or even upgrade. My husband and I upgraded last year for free. Yes! We always go to LV for our anniversary, so we let our points add up over the year. Last year we rented at car for 4 days and paid almost $200. Not a bad deal. This year we rented a car for 3, short trip this year. We used our points that we saved to get the free weekend deal. We only paid $80. I was so excited to only pay that much. You can't use the points you get on all the cars but, I don't need a fancy car. We got an Impala and it was just fine. I can't wait to go back so we can use our points again. THANKS HERTZ!!!!!!!!
