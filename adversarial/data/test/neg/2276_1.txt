Unlike many of the reviews that have been written about this Steak 'n Shake, I have enjoyed all of my experiences here. Whether it is a late night run or just after a soccer game, I can confidently say this place is a fine eating establishment. I normally get the $5 cheeseburger, fries, and a side of honey mustard which has quickly become one of my favorite meals from any restaurant. But the biggest thing that makes this review go from 4 stars to 5 is the waitress we seem to always get, Doris. Every single time my friends and I have shown up while she is working, we have never been disappointed. So to sum this all up, I really enjoy this Steak 'n Shake and can't seem to understand why it has received so many poor reviews throughout the years.
