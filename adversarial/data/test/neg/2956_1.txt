We started with chips and salsa, which were good. The chips are thick and crunchy and all 4 salsas were good. \n\nI ordered the veggie burro. It was very reminiscent of elementary school cafeteria food. It was made up mainly of carrot circles that tasted like they were frozen and then steamed. \n\nEveryone was very nice, but the service was really slow even though the restaurant was nearly empty.
