3.5 stars.\n\nWe came to Buca Yorkville without a reservation at 5pm and got a seat at the bar. It was the only seats available! It was nice as the server\/ bartenders were friendly and it was fun watching them make drinks and talk about what was in them. \n\nNice ambience. It was different from the Buca on King West in the sense that it felt more like an older crowd. \n\nMy drink was to die for! The highlight of my experience at Buca Yorkville.\n\nI got Il Fiorista - it was a heavenly foamy lavender drink. Not too sweet and very delicious! A+\n \nMy husband got a L'Esploratore - This was essentially an apple cider with 3oz of alcohol. It wasn't bad. On the sweeter side. I definitely liked my drink better. B+\n\nWe ordered:\n\n1. Nodini - warm bread knots - a signature dish. Can't go wrong with this! A\n2. Bigoli - little did I know that I've tried this dish before at Buca on King. I actually came here for the Maccheroncini di Campofilone because I wanted to try the red sea urchin, but the menu online was not updated because they didn't have it! It was replaced by lobster instead and I just wasn't feelin' like paying $42 for lobster today.\n\nThe server suggested the Raviolo Al Tuorlo, which is one big ravioli filled wih cream cheese and black truffle. I wasn't feelin' like having a heavy meal with the cream cheese, but the people next to us got it and it looked AMAZING!\n\nThe Bigoli was not bad. The flavours were good and you can taste the duck. The only feedback was the pasta was a bit too al dente for me. B\n\n3.  Scamorza Pizza - This was super spicy for me. The crust was thin and burnt.  The toppings were good. The peperoncini and cheese created a nice flavour. I don't really like burnt things so I didn't enjoy this as much, but my husband liked it. For what it was worth, I give it a B-\n\n4. Tiramisu - Not your traditional tiramisu. It had the flavours of Tiramisu with espresso, mascarpone cheese, but it was served on a dark chocolate ball with a cracker and some type of jelly. The tiramisu flavour was light, foamy, and delicious, but I didn't like the chocolate ball like cracker thing. It's not a cake so beware if you are expecting a traditional tiramisu. I am glad our server warned us before head or we would have been disappointed. Overall, not bad so I give it a B. \n\nThe server told us the menu is updated every couple of weeks so don't trust the menu online! It really should be monitored!\n\nNext time, I want to go back and try the sea urchin and drinks! Loved my drink!
