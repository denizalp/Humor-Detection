I've been there twice and both times the service and food have been exceptional. The mussels are some of the best in the city, maybe even the country. We've also tried some of the other items on the menu like the steak and they've also been spot on. \n\nAs a bonus their kitchen is open late!\n\nA reliable choice that won't disappoint.
