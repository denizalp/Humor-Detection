Good stuff! This store has pretty much everything a menswear boutique needs to have to be successful - interesting lines (variety of japanese, english, canadian, and american brands), a cool space, a good location, and super cool people working there. Even if the brands aren't necessarily to my taste, it's worth coming in to check out the Porter buys. Nothing to complain about.
