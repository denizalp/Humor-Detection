I'm honestly not a fan of pasta generally, so I would not go to a restaurant that specializes in that cuisine... but my boyfriend absolutely loves pasta and we were both curious to try their food. I ordered the family meal. You get an option of two of four pastas, we agreed on the classic spaghetti and meatballs as well as an order off the chicken tetrazzini. \nYou get to choose one of two salads, I went with the tried-and-true Caesar salad. We decided to try their honey garlic chicken wings as an appetizer and with the family meal we received 4 loaves of bread. \nThe chicken tetrazzini was very good. I really enjoyed the mushrooms and chicken, as well as the creamy cheesy sauce. The pasta was cooked perfectly, I had feared I would receive pasta mush, but this was far from it.\nThe spaghetti and meatballs were flavorful and very nice, once again the pasta was perfectly cooked. I found the meatballs to be really well seasoned and very moist.\nThe honey garlic wings were a little fatty, but they were still equally delicious.\nI enjoyed the Caesar salad, they were very generous with the bacon bits, dressing and croutons.\nThe bread was delicious, I had expected hard unpleasant loaves of bread and what we received was soft loaves of bread that seemed freshly baked, I was pleasantly surprised.\nFor an Italian meal that would comfortably feed four adults for $30 (without the wings), it was really impressive. Bravo on quality and great portion sizes.\nWe will certainly be repeat customers, as the convenience of delivery, as well as the food quality are well worth it.
