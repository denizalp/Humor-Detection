This place used to be amazing about 5 years ago...now it's sucks. I will never eat here\/take out from here again. Called to order pick up and could not understand what they were saying because the music in the background was so loud. When I asked them to repeat the order they finally got it right, but when I got home and opened the bag it was totally wrong. Also the food quality has really gone down!  The proportions compared to other popular Hakka restaurants is totally weak!  Please do not eat here. Save your money and go elsewhere.
