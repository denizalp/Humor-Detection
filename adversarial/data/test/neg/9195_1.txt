It makes me sad to write this. I tried to handle this privately, via email and received no response from the owner. \nI live around the corner from Rustic Caf√© and work very close as well. We frequently (several times a week) order breakfast for the office. \nIn recent weeks, we have had severe issues with the food quality, quality of service and care taken with our orders. \nUndercooked, overcooked, incorrectly prepared, or just plain incorrect, the expense of eating here, when not being able to actually eat our meals due to meat being dangerously undercooked, French fries being frozen and bacon being burnt to charcoal status makes it difficult to support a small business who clearly doesn't care.
