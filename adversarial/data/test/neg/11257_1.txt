I used to like this place until today.\nFirst of, you should know that their prices are higher than other starbucks.\nWhen you order, if you want a cup of water they will charge you an extra $1 (yes a whole dollar for tap water). Their excuse is because of the  plastic cup (which I'd be surprised if cost them more than a penny) but in reality they are probably hoping you don't notice it or end up buying their outrageously priced mineral water, as a sales booster tactic. Not sure if it's true? Just ask to get the water in a ceramic cup and see what's the response you'll get.\nWanna sit with your laptop? Think again, all their outlets are conveniently not working for months now, according to the barista, which I've asked after trying 5 different outlets to finish my work email before my computer died on me (why fix it when it makes people stay longer).\nSeems like the owner is really one-time-customer (tourists...) oriented and couldn't care the less about your experience as a customer.\nThere are better locations around, I'd recommend avoiding this one.
