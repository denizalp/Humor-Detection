Food was good. Found out some of our favorites are going away. I'm sad.  Hope the new items will be just as good or better. The bad thing about dinner last night is a customer was on a conference call 2 tables away. It was so loud we couldn't talk at our table. The waitresses were talking about how rude and loud this lady was. She had the conference calls. 3 of them   On speaker. Not one staff member or manager said something so the rest of us could enjoy our meal. We won't be going back since no one has any back bone.
