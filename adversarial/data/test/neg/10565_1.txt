A great bike shop for service. I took my mountain bike in with a brake issue after shuttling Mt Charleston with no rear brakes.  The shop owner, Carl was able to diagnose the problem quickly.  He had the replacement parts in stock and was able to make the repair fast.  What I was most impressed with was the time he took adjusting the rotor and pads to make sure the alignment was correct. I left the shop confident the fix was done right! Thanks Irwin Cycles!
