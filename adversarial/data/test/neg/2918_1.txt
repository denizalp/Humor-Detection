Best thing about this place is it's open 24 hours!!! The bf and I stayed at Stratosphere and would have late night snacks; of course, we didn't wanna travel outside of the hotel at 3am so, and this spot was perfect.\n\nThey had onion rings, shakes, malts, breakfast, burgers. It had that 50's vibe! Felt like I shoulda put on my best poodle skirt.\n\nService was pretty good considering these people were working at late night\/early morning. And that place was pretty packed with people.\n\nNot complaining because it was better than I expected.
