On a scale of 1-10 of my knowledge of topas restuarants I would  grade myself a 3.75 of 10.. lol ... But, I can say that after visiting Sabor in Glendale I was able to hit my mark and have improved to 6.5.... \nThe atomosphere is great, warm feeling inside like everyone is thier for the same reason - a great experience.  I started off with the \"croquetes\" and a nice glass of  Albrino . The croquetes were warm, firm, slightly hot and delightful- yes delightful. I took the next step and ordered off the drink list and had one of the  Signature cocktails the \"guapo mojini\"  -basic mojito w a twist they use VEEV made from acai berrys.. nice drink.  My next venture lead me to the Raxo - Tenderloin w\/ potatoes.  That was such a great dish.  My favorite.  The next step - time to try the signature dish.  I was told my trip would not be complete w\/out diving into the \"Paella\"-  I got the assorted meats paella - I did not like the chicken on the bone....But the combination of rice, beef, pork and spices was a true experience.  \n\nI ended the night with a slice of heaven I call Tequila.. With a snifter of Sol de Mexico Anejo... wow that was great.  \n\nI think the place has some good MOJO going on and will only get better and get the Detail to perfection. A very friendly & cozy lounge. Thank you for a great experience and the food made me appreciate what I did not know.  Looking forward to my next visit and watching this Sabor grow.  Heard they will have live acts and DJ's after dinner ...
