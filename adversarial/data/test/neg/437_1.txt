I've been here 3 times with mixed results.  Being a vegan, I have only tried the pizza listed as \"vegan\" on the menu, although they will gladly omit meat and\/or cheese from any of their pizzas upon request.  On the vegan item, they are very sparing with the thin sauce. The olives and sweety drop peppers come from a jar, and the basil is generous and fresh.  I understand they source the best meats and cheeses and the prices may fluctuate based on the market, but this meatless, cheese-less, jar-based pizza jumped from $10 to $14 overnight.  (Who knows, maybe it was the flour.)  Maybe I seemed surprised at payment, because the friendly cashier then offered a $2\/pizza discount and an itemized receipt. Thanks, Fabian!  \n\nThe dough is awesome when it is oven fresh, though it tightens up quickly as it cools.  This can be unpleasant when they forget to bring out all the pizzas at once.  During a dinner, they brought out 2 pizzas, and over the course of 20 minutes I had to ask twice on the status of the third one. From the confusion in the kitchen, it appears our pizza had been forgotten. I got an apology, but no explanation, and no follow up from the staff.  By that time, we had one fresh pizza and two cold, rubbery ones.  I'd cut them some slack at this time, since it was only their 2nd week in business.\n\nBig eaters, don't expect to gorge on a big greasy Amurrican pizza pie for a small wad of cash.  These are dishes made with some skill and dignity, and we could benefit from employing these qualities in our eating practices.  I've eaten an entire pizza at each visit, but it's something to be savored and shared.\n\nI really hope this place succeeds.  I will be back!
