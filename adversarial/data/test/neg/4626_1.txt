My family has been coming here for years.  I remember having my Little League banquet here when I was 11 or 12.  Thinking back, it was kind of a dump then, and it is a dump now.  There are two dinning rooms, and an old carpet that looks like it is older than me.  They have those old Chianti bottles (the cheep kind) hanging from the ceiling.  Cheesy looking maps of Italy hung everywhere and mounted in the glass of the tables.  This place has not been updated since the 70's, and it shows.  Still surprisingly welcoming after all these years.\n\nThe service is fast and friendly.  Though, considering not many people come here, I think they are just happy when a party walks in.  Food comes out quick as well.\n\nThe food is that over stuffed cheese and sweet marinara sauce faux Italian that is found all over the country.  Manicotti is bland, except for the overly sweet sauce.  For an app we had fried ravioli.  Which was OK.  The pizza, again OK.  An overly garlicy crust.  Canned sardines, the pasta is probably not freshly made.  An average wine list, crap beer list.\n\nSaying all that, this place still has a special place in my heart.  Years of coming here as a kid and with family makes this worth the nostalgic visit every once is a while when I come back to visit the family.  Though I wish Dom's was still open...
