Before I start, I have to say that Sushi Ken was my favorite Japanese restaurant for a long time till my recent visits. \n\nI love authentic, affordable, and fresh Japanese food and Sushi Ken has been my number one choice for many years.\n\nNot sure what changed, but in the last six months, my experience with this place is nothing but unpleasing and sour.\n\nI understand they are busier than normal at times, but I waited for 30 min after being seated by the sushi bar to have my waitress bring me a menu and ask what I would like to drink. \n\nI also noticed their food and drink portion has decrease quite tremendously in the last few months. My friend's melon cream soda went from floating to half full. Curry Katsu went from full plate to there's barely any curry on the rice. And when I addressed my concern with the staff, her response to me was because they charge cheap  for the food \"since economy is bad and customers can use a break\" I understand they want to \"give us a break\" for our wallet, but what I saw was the portion taking a break.  \n\nOnce, there was a fish bone in our sushi that almost chocked my friend and when we kindly mentioned it to our waitress, she just walked away without even an apology.  \n\nAlso, be prepared for the wait if you decide to order some sushi\/sashimi. Once my friend and I placed the orders at the same time. He got and finished his udon noddle and katsu rice way before I even see my first sushi roll.  \n\nI don't know what happened to my  favorite restaurant, but I don't think I am going back anymore.
