I saw this place a few days ago as I was looking for a good place to celebrate PI day, but time got away and I wasn't able to make it.  This morning on my drive in to work their name came up on the radio and I knew that it was destiny that I eat here.\n\nI came with a group of 8 people thinking we could sit and enjoy a nice lunch together.  As we walked up we notice how small the building was and our plans quickly changed.  \n\nWalking in we could immediately smell the delicious food being cooked in the back.  We placed our orders and the man was nice enough he seemed overwhelmed and frazzled at how many people had stopped by this afternoon.  He did advise that it would take a while for the food as they weren't prepared.  We enjoyed the weather and he offered lemonade while we waited. \n\nI ordered the turkey and Swiss and was very happy with my selection, because it was amazing.  It was not your typical sandwich the bread made it. The mac and cheese was good but not fantastic. I was very disappointed with the lack of flavor.  I also ordered an apple pie which was good but so small and not nearly enough.  The chocolate croissant was good but again not fantastic.  I had a bite of someone's Shepards pie and it was underwhelming as well.  Someone in our party ordered a feta and spinach pie but got chicken and mushrooms.  \n\nI think it was a good place but not worth all the hype.  I will be back for another sandwich but I definitely will order ahead and save my money and not order anything extra
