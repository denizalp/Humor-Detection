Came on Taco Tuesday and was pleasantly pleased. Came in and the booths were closed so got a seat at the bar. Bartender was fast getting to us and friendly as well. \n\nGot guac and chips for an app, came with a good amount of chips and guac was fresh and tasty. Would order again. \n\nOrdered the $5\/6 margaritas, pretty regular. Not bad, not amazing, but good nonetheless. \n\nLastly got the $2 tacos. Got mahi-mahi, carne asada, and chicken tinga. All veryyyy flavorful; I was surprised yet very happy. The tacos are decently sized with complimenting toppings\/sauces. Definitely going again especially on taco Tuesday's. \n\nThe atmosphere is loud and almost club like, so probably not somewhere for a first date or someplace you go to talk about your life problems or story time. But great to go with friends or even solo to listen to a variety of music, possibly dance and grab some food and drinks after a long day.
