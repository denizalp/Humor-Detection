Do not stay here! The price is nice but you get what you pay for.  Our room smelled of smoke and air deoderizer.  The room is old and out dated. The floors were sticky. The ceiling and walls were painted over bubbled water damage.  Bugs kicking it on the curtains.  Screen torn apart in the bathroom window.  Our 2nd party entered their room and were met by 3 very rude men already occupying the room.  We complained to the front desk about it and got a \"Men can be rude, sorry about that\" and a smile.
