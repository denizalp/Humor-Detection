Small seating, but thye are mainly a catering outfit. I was lucky enough to attend one of their catering events and it was southern BBQ\/BBQ chicken was delicious! The sweet tea is okay.\n\nSince I'm gluten-free I couldn't eat the pasta salad, banana pudding or the brandy soaked bundt cake but, they were definately favorites at my table.\n\nIf you have an event check them out, I grabbed there catering menu and the prices were right in line with what you would expect to spend.
