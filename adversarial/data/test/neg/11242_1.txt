Heather's review bellow mine is telling. This is like the Wallmart of skating. Back to school style. And thats not a slam on the shop.... The place is just HUGE. They have everything from every big brand all merchandised perfectly. LOVE all the shoes. Its really a trip to walk around in being used to small to hole in the wall sized shops. Staff was friendly. great selection of hardware in addition to soft goods. My last trip to Montreal was 10 years ago and I hit up Underworld forging for gear at its old location. How the time passes. Good to see them still around.
