Came here for brunch one morning with my boyfriend on our get away, we were staying in the hotel and we heard this place was good. \nIt was great food! Tasted so good and the portions were great! \nBut what brought the rating down was the fact that they gave us the wrong bill and didn't give us a change to look at the check. \nWe only saw what was charged and didn't see an itemized receipt. \nOnce we walked out I asked my boyfriend how much it was he said almost 70$ \nWe got two plates and an OJ. It shouldn't be that much?! \nI made him go back and ask. And they gave us a check for a family of 5!!! \nOur check came out to 35$! \nWhoever our waiter is needs to pay attention next time. Cause just for that makes me not want to go back!!
