Quite possibly the cheesiest and most corny show I have ever seen and I LOVED EVERY MINUTE of it!  To start, our party of nine was prepared to use a handful of 2-For-1 coupons but scored decent seats for a mere $13 per person.  Upon entering the theater, we were immediately moved to two tables at the front of the stage.  The cheap ticket and front row seat combo made the show worth it, even for a majority of the group who left unimpressed.  I wanted to burst out laughing a few times but the awesome feather head pieces, cosumes, and choreography made up for the goofy choice of skits and the creepy MC guy.  The fact that you can cram 85 showgirls and boys on stage in full costume while all are singing, dancing, and smiling seems like a feat in itself.  Both showtimes are topless so this is definitely not a show for the kiddos.  If you can get a good price on tickets and have a couple of hours to spare, I would recommend seeing Jubilee as it is the oldest show in Vegas.  Several in between acts of aerial stunts were pretty cool.  The audience seemed pretty lackluster but I did hear a few people commenting on how \"brutal\" and \"hilarious\" the show was which may explain the lack of cheering and clapping. Nonetheless, I loved it!
