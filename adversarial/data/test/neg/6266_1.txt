Aria is the closest hotel to Team Mobile Arena Las Vegas not even as far as walking to your mail box if you have a long driveway!!  Saw Imagine Dragons and Walked just a Few Feet From Aria The T-Mobile Amphitheater and it was spectacular! \n\nWe stayed at the Aria which I could not believe was only a few steps from our hotel and then WELLAH into our second row seats! The theater is very well staffed, security very in tune and everyone had a good seat. Aria is the place to stay if you are going to a major concert at this venue. Acoustics are awesome also. I met who I felt would be my future husband for just the length of the concert - if he had only known I would say YES! I will remember him as \"Reno.\"\n\nAsk Deborah Dolen about T-Mobile Arena\n\nhttps:\/\/www.tripadvisor.com\/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d10129915-r530405558-T_Mobile_Arena-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html#
