YUMMMMMMMY!!! We went here for lunch today and ordered the edamame (appetizer), firecracker chicken and broccoli w\/ jasmine rice and the gluten-free jeweled beef. Everything was fantastic and our server, Alicea, was awesome. The service was fast, friendly and we had a great time. \n\n(Also, they have happy hour from like 11am to 6pm!) \n\nToo bad we can't take advantage of that extended happy hour, but some day *shaking my fist at 'The Man'* midday drinking will become an acceptable work phenomenon again. *giggle*
