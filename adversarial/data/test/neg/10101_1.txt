I really like this Sprouts.  They just renovated and moved things around, but it is much more spacious and easier to see everything when you walk in.\n\nLines are always short and if they look long, someone will open up another register, so that is nice.\n\nGotta try the little sandwich\/soup lunch market.  Their sandwiches are cheap and tastes like your mom made it.  Sooooo good.\n\nI would suggest trying their chicken salad.  Great flavor and super fresh!!!
