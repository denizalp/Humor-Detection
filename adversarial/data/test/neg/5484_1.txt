We stayed in the newer Venezia tower. Rooms were beautiful. However, don't bother paying extra for either the continental breakfast which was so-so, or for access to the Venezia pool. I was really looking forward to the special pool access, but the pool just as crowded with kids as the main pool. Instead use your money to get a day pass at the Canyon Ranch spa if it is serenity your desire.
