I went to the Ten Spot for a first time wax, because I've heard such great things about the place. And for a beginner, they were great. They explained what they were doing as they did it so I wasn't confused or freaked out, they were gentle (as much as one can be when ripping out your hair) and encouraging. It was super quick to do, and I loved the convenience of booking online. It turned out a bit lopsided, but that was my own fault - they leave the room at the end so you can check to make sure they didn't miss anything, and I didn't notice the lopsidedness until I went home. Oops.\n\nHowever, when I got home I also noticed that there was some wax on my shirt, up by the collar. There must have been some on the waxing bed itself in order for that to happen.
