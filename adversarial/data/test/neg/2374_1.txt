Futo Buta is really as good as it gets. My boyfriend and I ordered to go on a Sunday night and it was delicious. We started off with the Tori Kara Age (Japanese friend chicken) which came with a chili mayo dip. While the flavor was on point, the fried chicken wasn't as crunchy as I anticipated which I'd argue was due to taking it in a to-go container. I'd be interested to try it again at the restaurant.\nOnto the ramen--ah the delicious ramen. I got the Tonkotsu and added bok choy. It was INCREDIBLE. The bone broth was outstanding--super rich and earthy. And the smoked pork belly makes my mouth water just thinking about it. My boyfriend got the Hiyashi and loved it, although it was more of a noodle bowl and had less broth than mine.\nI will absolutely be trying Futo Buta again, hopefully sit-down next time!
