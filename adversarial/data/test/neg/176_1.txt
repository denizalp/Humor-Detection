Not a smile or any level of friendliness when I walked in. I greeted the lady with a hello, asked if they could take me, and what it would cost for a gel fill. Then the first lady pulled out powder, and when I told her I had asked for liquid gel, told me it was another five dollar charge. Which, I was fine with and had no objections. By the time the lady was done, my fingers looked like they had blocks on top of them.  Thick, lazy application, half my nail bed was white because I'd requested French, no shape. It looked like someone that hadn't graduated from cosmetology school yet, had practiced on me. I walked out feeling like the woman had charged good money $40 for a fill plus tip, for substandard results. Really bummed because the place was clean and a convenient location.
