Our first visit to Jupiter's.  The outside looks like it could be classy; the inside is an upscale chucky cheese.  Even though the place was half empty, we were left waiting until they could find us a space in an almost empty row of booths.  Our waitress was good, the pizza was good, but a little slow.\n\nThe best thing I can say about Jupiter's is that our meal didn't cost a lot.  We won't be in a hurry to come back.
