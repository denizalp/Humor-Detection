Excited for pizza over the weekend because the last pizza I had was amazing. We called ahead an order of 2 pizzas and a kids spaghetti. Staff was a little slow. It also seemed like we were a inconvenience when asking for water refills. The food was good, but not as good as we've previously had. The dough was flat and not as think as normal. The spaghetti was pretty bland and uneventful. The reason I'm doing a 3 is because a $76 pizza visit should be pretty extraordinary in my mind. Hoping for better za's next time!
