I went in and tried on dresses in August and Soondis was absolutely wonderful!! Even though they didn't have the specific dress I had when I was online shopping she did an excellent job finding me comparable styles. I ended up falling in love with the first one I tried on. I had heard Bowtie Bridal nearby had that one online dress so just to get it out of my mind I wanted to try it on. Soondis and the gals were totally understandable and sweet about it. Ended up trying it on, not liking it, and immediately returning to buy the one I fell in love with! A very memorable experience.
