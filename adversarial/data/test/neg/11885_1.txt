Extremely disappointed. Went back to give this place another shot. Same outcome. Food had flavor however they always mess up the order. First time they put pico de gallo on the tacos and gave me the wrong type of meat on my tacos. After telling them they messed up my order and walked her through it again she said it would take 25 mi Minutes and the place was empty.\n\nToday I went back to order a burrito with rice,beans and cilantro and onions. They forgot the rice and charged me 2.50 for it. The servers are rude and no matter what language whether it is Spanish or English they don't get it right. Sorry I'm here to order food no one is trying to hit on you just get the order right. LOL. For 9.58 I could go up the street to chipotle and get a bigger burrito for 2 more dollars and walk out satisfied with the service and the food.  I'm sorry but I can be very patient as I was once a server and a busser but there are hard working people in the establishment trying to eat at least give them great service.
