Consultation service with Paul was excellent a few years back.\n\nInstallation service was OKAY - its installers did not do a thorough job in cleaning up their mess.\n\nWARRANTY SERVICE NOW IS TERRIBLE AFTER A FEW YEARS:\n\n05\/04\/2017 - The supervisor Shawn came and saw quite a few louvers of one of the shutters warped & offered to order new replacement.\n\n06\/22\/2017 - Appointment was set at 8:30AM.  Technician did not arrive until 9:15AM; and he only brought 2 and a half pieces of louvers when there are a minimum of 5 louvers needed to be replaced.  The technician was told by Angie to take pictures of my warped shutters.\n\n07\/10\/2017 - Received phone call from Angie of Sunburst Shutters requesting that the supervisor need to come to inspect my warped shutters & to take pictures again.  Appointment has not been set at all.  So who knows what is going to happen!!!!!!!!!
