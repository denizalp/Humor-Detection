A friend had a few $5.00 vouchers to Chop'd & Co, so we decided to give it a go for lunch one day. In all honestly, I wasn't overly impressed. \n\nThe place itself was very nice and clean, so I'll give them that. It's also in an ideal location - right by the McGill campus - which is convenient if you want to grab a quick lunch. It's similar to Mandy's in the sense that there are a few salads on the menu, or you can create your own. The ordering process is a bit disorganized and essentially results in a bunch of people waiting at the end of the counter for their order number to be called. I also want to mention that it's extremely overpriced. My salad cost over $18.00 before the $5.00 discount, and it was just lettuce and veggies. I'd also like to add that a few things I ordered weren't even put in my salad, even though I was charged for them. \n\nThe salad itself was good, but nothing extraordinary. I would recommend trying this place out if you have a coupon of some sort, but it's not exactly worth the price if you don't.
