Advantage only receives one star because the return process went smoothly. The same can't be said for the rental process. I went through AARP to secure a rental for my recent trip to Arizona and was told I could have additional drivers at no charge.\n\nLo and behold, the latter was not the case as I was told that additional drivers at no cost was not their policy. Add a flippant attitude displayed by the employee behind the counter to the equation and you have a most unpleasant situation.\n\nNeedless to say, I was the only driver of a car that was provided with a full tank but a filthy exterior. Me thinks a recommendation for Advantage is out of the question.
