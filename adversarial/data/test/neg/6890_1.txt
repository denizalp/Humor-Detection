I like how you can call your order in and they'll make it fresh for you. I had the Mexican wrap and Lebanese salad and the macaroon that came with all for $10. I really enjoyed the salad and macaroon not so much the wrap but I will definitely be back. The cashier was very friendly and asked if I would to sample anything which was very appealing for me to return to try new items on the menu.
