We try our best to avoid this location because the customer service is horrible. From the unfriendly cashier to the unhappy and confused baristas.  Completely different to the Starbucks atmosphere that we are used to. \n\nAlso I wish that Starbucks will implement a review option on their app. Why wouldn't that be an option for your customers if you're willing to apply a tipping option?!!
