Nice hotel on the outside and lobby area. Our room was fine but the TV was out of date and malfunctioning. You can see a hole in the wall under the TV set. Kind of weird. \n\nThe couch bed was super uncomfortable but the normal beds were awesome. \n\nStaff was awesome and accommodated all our needs including free shuttle service to nearby places. \n\nHotel was clean!\n\nBar was kind of boring, but they had Tito's!
