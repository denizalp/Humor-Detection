The customer service here is so terrible. I called and they didn't even say hello or anything they just put me on hold. This is the second time this has happened. The last time they kept me on hold just to tell me they weren't taking orders anymore and I had to come in to order. This would not have been a problem if I wasn't coming from work and would have missed the last call for food. They are very rude at this location.
