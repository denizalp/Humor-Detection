My friends and I went on a bagel pilgrimage, walking the miles from our Old Montreal hotel, through the park past Mount Royal, and into the Jewish section where we found the original bagel shop. No tables there, but it was fascinating to see them making the bagel dough, cutting and rolling it into rounds, dunking the bagels in liquid, and sliding them into a brick oven on long, thin wooden palettes before dumping them with a flourish into a huge bin. The front of the store was filled with stacks of flour bags, there was a long line of customers picking up brown paper bags full of bagels to take home, and it all felt marvelously authentic. One of the workers was very kind and patient in mapping out the walk to the cafe, and off we went on the next part of our adventure.\n\nThe cafe has some charm, especially the big wooden (?) bagels hanging on the storefront looking quaintly Old World. Unfortunately, our experience inside wasn't the best. My Long Island friends ordered the Traditionnel bagels with cream cheese, smoked salmon, capers, and red onion. They weren't all that impressed, particularly not thrilled about the denseness of the bagels. (Clearly this is a matter of personal taste, but we all prefer a bagel that is tender under a chewy crust.) I had a multi-grain bagel which was very heavy and dense. My first reaction was that it would be something to feed to a horse. We did enjoy the fruit cups. Our server was perfectly nice, but when I asked for more hot water in my tea press, she came back with a coffee press. Ick. I also ended up with a fly in my water, not a big deal, but the overall cleanliness of the place was a bit lacking. Finally, the little breakfast ended up seeming rather expensive. Sadly, I wouldn't go back.
