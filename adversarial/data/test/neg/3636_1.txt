\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times\", sums up our most recent visit to Archies. \"The best \" was the food. Pork Satay, Pad See ew and Pad Kea Mow are favorites and always perfect. \"The bad\" was the service. Usually its okay at best, but today they acted like we were interrupting them by showing up. Every phase of customer contact was terrible, from the time we walked in and waited at host stand for 10 minutes just to get a grunt of an acknowledgment. to the server who seemed almost angry with us. Would have given 5 stars if service was good. Will still go there, but no as often and will probably try other locations first.
