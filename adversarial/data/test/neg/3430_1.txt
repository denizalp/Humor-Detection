Just as I said in my review in February, I returned and had the Insaladda della Casa then the Complimenti alla Mamma pizza.  Just like before, everything was excellent and I would order it again.  I just wish I remembered to read my earlier review before returning so I would be sure to order something different.  All the pizzas sound good and I want to try each one.  The service was very good.  Our waitress didn't seem to mind that we kept wanting to sample wine before we bought a bottle.  Their wine selection, by the way, is very good and reasonably priced.  Finally, I must add that sitting inside can be a bit noisy when it is crowded.  Temperature permitting, the patio is a better place to sit, eat and chat.
