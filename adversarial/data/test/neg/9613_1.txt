My second time here. The first time I didn't get anything as the waiter wouldn't show up at the table for 15 minutes. The second time today I did order and get that mac and cheese burger and my girlfriend got the pastrami one. Both of them were horrible, no flavor, no salt, the patty on mine was falling apart.  For the $21 burger - not worth it. It has been 4 hours, the burger is still stuck in my throat.\nI personally would not recommend- a very fancy and overpriced spot.
