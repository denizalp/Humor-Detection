My favorite place in Las Vegas.  My father from Japan likes seafood.  He is retired but still the don.  We ended up there with a party of 10 with some other business clients.  We spent about $100 each including drinks.  The food was excellent.  Everyone has raved about this place even to this day, a group of Japanese men and women who are very hard to please with American cuisine.  This was the only location everyone agreed to come back and in fact they came back the second time after two days.   Anything you pick from steak to scallop to Sushi were all good.  I was responsible for ordering their dishes and I just wanna thank everybody in the restaurant for bringing this together!
