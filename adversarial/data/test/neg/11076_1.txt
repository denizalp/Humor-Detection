Lucky Foo's... My wife and I love you, but we're breaking up with you.  We've been here 6 times now (3 check-ins on yelp) but you have a chronic glaring service problem that we have to consciously prepare ourselves (and friends we bring) for- every time we come.  And, we're not sure we'll be back again because of it.\n\nArrival was nice- hostess walked to the front, greeted us, confirms reservation and sat us, per usual.\n\nToday is Valentine's day, and my wife made a reservation for a 1pm brunch.\nWe sat down and it might have been (trying to be favorable to the restaurant here) at least 10 minutes before someone came and asked if we'd like to start with drinks.  My wife a bloody mary and water, myself- an espresso and water.\nWe also ordered starters but said we were not ready to order entrees yet.\n\nWater was served shortly after, and the bloody mary shortly after that.  Espresso never came.  \n\n25 minutes in:  \nStarters were served and the gentlemen putting them on the table asked if he could take our menus, and I informed him that we hadn't ordered yet.  The gentleman says \"Oh, i thought you already had!\" Correct sir, I feel like we already should have, but the waitress never came back to check in for 15 minutes after taking the starters and drinks.\nWaitress comes: my wife orders the Lox with a side egg.  I order the poached eggs.\n\n40 minutes in: Finished our starters.  No one has checked in at the table.  Still no espresso.  The young girl finally checked in to see if we wanted more water, and I asked if she could check on the espresso.  She did- came back and stated they were out of stock.  I wasn't that invested so I requested no substitute drink- they did offer. \n\n50 minutes in:  My food is delivered- my wife's side of egg is delivered, and at THAT moment is when they inform us that they are out of stock on the lox, so they never made her plate!  At no time previously did the come out and present this, so she might adjust her order & we could eat together- on Valentine's day.  she passed on a change of order at this juncture, because we agree'd that it would have been more of a hassle to try to order something else at this time.\n\n75 minutes in:  I finish eating.  Fortunately the starters helped my wife not be so annoyed that she didn't have a proper meal.  We're about to ask for the check when suddenly the woman, that I can assume should be our waitress, brings out an espresso!  She said there had been trouble with the machine.  I'm agreeable- I enjoy a cup at the end of the meal just as much as the start.\nNo coffee accessories were delivered. I know that espresso is usually straight, but it wasn't offered either. \n\nI'm pretty laissez-faire about things when it comes to service.  My wife- less so.  I just want to enjoy some good food and company, but this inability to inform us that things are out of stock, or that you're having issues, and allowing us to change our minds so we may still have a nice Valentine's brunch together, did rub me the wrong way.  I should not have to even think about the service.  This time in particular, the staff was fervently apologizing to the table next to us for something also!  We don't know the particulars but we weren't terribly surprised either, as we prepare ourselves.  \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is an example of the level of service that happens here EVERY time we've come.  The food here is truly outstanding, both cooked in back & from the sushi bar..  We LOVE it.  It's unique, creative, delicious.  Your Cedar Plank Salmon on the forbidden rice is my favorite salmon dish in the city.  (once served to me raw\/cold in the middle)\n \nBut dealing with the level of service has become a real chore.\n\nPrevious visit:  Server delivered wife's entree- held it up in the air- 1 inch from her face until she took it from the server's hands.  in retrospect, my wife thinks the fella might be special needs, so she forgave it.  But please, just set the plate down on the table.\nPrevious visit: Delivered me the wrong order.  Made my correct order which, again, staggered my wife eating her plate then I'm eating mine.\nDifferent visit: Delivered us another table's order.\nOur second visit there: Had no waitress.  20 minutes in, actually had someone come to our table and apologize for no service, and hostess came to help and take our drink order.\n\nWe LOVE your food.  We love the design, and the feel of the place.  The music is relaxed but upbeat at the same time- perfect choices. We love how you try so hard to make up for your errors.  The people are so nice.  But like a relationship partner that just keeps falling short-  we leave feeling a little disappointed- every time.\n\n\nAmbiance\/Environment: 5\/5\nFood: 5\/5\nService: 1\/5
