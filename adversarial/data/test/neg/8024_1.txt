The price of food is fantastic! And to think I almost went across the street to Burger King!!\nThe front desk personnel were so friendly I was thrown back.\nBut I have to let everybody know how fresh the burrito tasted and the salsas were awesome I can't say enough about this place and it's all at a marvelous low price
