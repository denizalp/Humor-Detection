**3.5**\n\nThis place is packed on the weekend but don't worry, their service is fast and you'll get a table soon enough.\nI like the whole iPad menu concept (I like to see pictures of what I'm going to eat) and I tried the crystal bento box. Mr. H has two rolls, crunchy salmon and tuna. The bento box was ok, I was not a big fan of the tempura or the teriyaki (basically I've had better and I prefer the bento box at Spring Rolls). The quantity however was a lot! The sushi rolls were better than my bento box, so I'll probably go again to try that. \n\nWill try the AYCE once for sure...
