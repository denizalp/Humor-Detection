I was over at Chase Bank the other day along with my mom to open a new checking account.  We met Mr.Â Garrett Truman, personal banker at Chase Bank, and he graciously assisted and explained the various accounts and walked her through all steps necessary, explaining various options and safety measures to protect the account.  He was meticulous and very patient in answering her many questions. They certainly have many safety features (22) you can choose from to bank online via your cell phone.  Also, we were so impressed with their automatic teller machines where, without a teller, you can deposit and withdraw from your account at the teller area in the bank.  I recommend Chase Bank to everyone.
