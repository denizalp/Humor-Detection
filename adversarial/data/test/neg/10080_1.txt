The food here is actually quite good.   We ordered Spring rolls, egg rolls, orange\/sweet & Sour\/honey chicken and a couple different soups.    Really well prepared, lots of flavor and it was pretty obvious they're not trying to cut corners.   It tasted...fresh.  \n\nI knocked off a star; We ordered delivery and it took an hour and a half to get to us (mistakes happen), but we'll definitely try them again to hope to put that star back up there.  \n\nThis is great Chinese food!
