Started out  with a party of six, headed for Haus Murphy but they were hosting a party for about 150 people and weren't taking walk ins. Too bad. I was so in the mood for oompah  music and slimy brats. So we walked down the block and into al Fornos. Mind you. I'm a displaced New Yorker and usually dread Eye talion food in AZ. But this is different. We didn't order pizza. Just entrees. Pesto Lasagna, Frutti Di Mare, one order with red sauce another with white, Rigatony , large antipasta, (split six ways)etc.. All dishes excellent. Love the food. Excellent service. Prices very reasonable. My new favorite semi local place. One star off for the awful chairs. Hard and uncomfortable especially if you have a boney ass.
