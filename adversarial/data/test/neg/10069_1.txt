Why haven't I been here before? Don't know but am glad I finally did. I've probably driven by here lots of times and have never gone in. It took friends that live in Phoenix to get me here. It's not the greatest atmosphere inside but the service was great for the most part and the food was really good from the rice soup, wonton soup, and appetizer platter to the main courses. We had a huge table of food. Fried rice, Honey shrimp, the house beef special, and cashew chicken. The cool thing at the end of your meal you're given these crunchy dessert fried wontons with bananas in a sweet Carmel sauce. I was told they only make a certain amount a day so we were lucky to get them. I'll definitely be coming back here for the most authentic Chinese food I've had in the valley.
