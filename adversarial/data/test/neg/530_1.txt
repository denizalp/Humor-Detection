I have been SCHOOLED...and I liked it!\n\nIt was my sister's last night in town, and we decided to try something new.\nShe said it was one of the best meals of the trip, and I agree!\n\nEverything was delicious!\nWe started with 3 appetizers - \nMac & Cheese....sprinkled with potato chips! I know sounds weird, but was really great!\nBacon & Chedder Tater Tots.... Good flavor, the homemade ketchup was awesome. They were a tiny bit soggy and mushy. They lacked that wonderful tater tot crunch.\nand Buffalo Cauliflower- Just...YES! Yummy!\n\nWe all loved our entrees. Chicken and waffles was a big hit! The flavor in the shrimp & grits was fantastic.\n\nOver all we really had a great meal!
