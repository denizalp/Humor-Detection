Service was great! Really nice menu, with a lot of options. I had strawberry pancakes, which were very flavorful. Also had mexican omlette, which had carnitas, jalapenos and pico de gallo. Very good. We love the variety of dishes offered. You can choose to go simple, or can choose something with a little bit of a twist and not be sorry. We will definitely be coming back.
