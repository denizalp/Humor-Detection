I have to say finding this place was serendipitous. I had just ran out of gas and was able to roll up to a gas pump. I went inside to pay and smelled delicious, well seasoned meat sizzling away on a grill. I'm like...hold up. There's a taco joint in here? \n\nI wasn't too hungry, but I could eat. I ordered 3 carne asada tacos--which were seasoned to perfection. So of course I was obliged to return. I came back the next day to get a burrito. Returned the next for a chimichanga. \n\nI think the bottom line here is I may require rehab. I'm addicted.
