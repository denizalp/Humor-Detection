We came here for lunch and were one of the first customers seated. Maybe because of that, service was lightning fast. And the food was quite tasty. I got the fried chicken sandwich... the chicken was terrific. It needs a heartier bun, because the one on which it was served was mushy. But other than that, all good. The deviled eggs were great, I loved the mac & cheese. Everything hit the spot.
