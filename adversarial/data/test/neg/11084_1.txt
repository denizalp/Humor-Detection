I have only been to this place for a quick stop. Had the soup, it was amazing. The owner made sure to let us know that its a family run restaurant, and everything was home made. Then he was very attentive when i needed hot sauce, freakin mind reader! i was thinking, man i need hot sauce and within 2 seconds he came over with the look like, \"oh you know you wanted this hot sauce.\" incredible!\n\nThe food was excellent, i had the soup and some hummus and the pita. My wife had the chicken plate. Everything was perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, and even visually appealing. (see my photo)\n\nWe cant wait to go there again and try the salmon!
