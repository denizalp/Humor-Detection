This place is another good Hawaiian style place with a korean influence. \n\nThey have my all time fav, portuguese sausage and over easy eggs over rice... that is the ultimate comfort dish and they make it great here. \n\nBoiled peanuts are a nice starter too, the owner is totally laid back with a Hawaiian accent. Which is a good thing cause who like their Hawaiian food made by someone that has never even been to hawaii.\n\nMan writing on yelp always makes me hungery...
