Troy from THM Services installed an over the range microwave in my mother's new home, replaced a shower converter, installed a mailbox, and ran a water connection throughout the kitchen for our dishwasher and refrigerator. He is busier than most handymen but that's because he's the best! He was incredibly nice and very honest about the work to be done. The price was just right too! I will definitely call him again!
