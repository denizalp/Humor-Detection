Absolutely loved coming to Brilliant Bridal! This was my second shop during my dress adventure.  I worked with Talyn, and from the minute I walked in, she was very friendly to me and my friend.  Helped explain the process and let us choose options, but then assisted by suggesting some of her own for me to try on. \n\nI tried on quite a few dresses but found the one!  It was a bit over my budget, but, not a lot.  Something that sold me on this bridal shop was the good testaments to their pricing range, the dresses are overstock, and are offered at discounted prices!  So I was soo happy to have found a dress here.  Thank you to the team at Brilliant Bridal for helping me make my dream day come true. :) You guys rock!
