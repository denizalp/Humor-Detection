I am so glad my friend took me here on a whim. You could drive by it daily and never know this little gem you're missing. Excellent atmosphere with a killer pandora station playing. The food and cocktails were outstanding and well crafted. The service was perfect. Check out the bathroom- it's a total trip. I will definitely be returning soon.
