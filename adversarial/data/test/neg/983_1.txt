Hands down ... The best damn Mexican restaurant in town. Been a fan since their old location. Nowhere else compares. The margarita was amazing. Literally huge and had 3 shots. The price was really awesome. I get the Molcajete El Charro and share it with another and we are always both impressed and full by the end. It's a ton of food and it taste amazing. The owner and staff are friendly and very accommodating. The atmosphere is perfect.
