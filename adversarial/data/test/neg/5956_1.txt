This is by far the best Chinese I ever had. It's a little pricey but worth every penny. I been going here for a couple of years now and I haven't had anything I didn't like. The general tso's is great. I recommend any of the beef dishes. The beef is so tender. The sushi is good. The have great happy hour menu.
