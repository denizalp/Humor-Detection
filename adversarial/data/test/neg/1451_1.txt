My partner and I celebrated our Anniversary at The Keg on King and the folks there were just amazing!\n\nIt was great service and to top it off they gave us a free slice of delicious ice cream mud pie almost too large to eat (with sparklers in it!) and a cute Happy Anniversary card.\n\nThanks for making it memorable. These guys deserve your business. The staff work very hard to make your experience the best.
