DO NOT GO HERE!!!!\n\nThis is by far the worst customer service experience ever.................\n\nSo, after my third replacement phone (iPhone 5) through Verizon in three weeks I decided enough was enough and it was time to go talk to the big dogs down at the Apple Store to finally get my phone fixed.  \n\nI arrive at the store, which like all, are mobbed and a rep finally asks me if I need help.  I tell her my issue and she asks if I have an appointment.  I say not technically but my 29 mile trip to their store was appointment enough.  An appointment in a retail store? I think not.  So they tell me that they can see me in 30 minutes, that I cannot leave the store and direct me to a stool to sit in and not move.  I need the help so I patiently oblige.  Finally, a person arrives to help me.  I explain my problem (the phone, which I have had for three days will not connect to WIFI or Bluetooth) and she takes it from me to do a diagnostic.  She says, \"Oh, it looks like the battery is going bad.\"  I'm like cool, lets get this fixed.  Then she informs me that the phone is out of warranty and it will cost $250 to fix it.  I inform her again that I have only had the phone for three days.  She says, \"sorry about that but we will not be helping you unless you pay.\"  Wowzers!!!!  I inform her that I have bought over $8500 worth of Apple products over the past three years and I am not looking for something for free, I just want the device to operate correctly.  She shrugs her shoulders, says sorry and walks away leaving me.  \n\nI should have known that I would get this response because as I watched them help people before me with faulty devices get told the same story.  How in the world a multi-billion dollars company could care so little for their customers is unbelievable to me.  My only choice was to get up and walk out and hope Verizon could help me which they have done their best to do.  Steer clear, very clear, of this under staffed, unprofessional, under expierenced and rude store.  After the years of using Apple products I think I may be going back to their competitor that actually do care about there customers and want them to stick around, forever.
