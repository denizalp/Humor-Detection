A few of the items were pretty freaking delicious but not the best grub in Vegas, but worth the stop if you're a fan. Our favorite item was the trash can nachos, actually delivered to your table inside a metal trash can on a plate, fun display :)  They lift the lid to expose all of the layered cheesy, brisket goodness then lift the trash can, allowing the nachos to pour out the bottom onto your plate. Definite must share! There are a lot of nachos in that can!\n\nThe Mac & Cheese Bacon Burger by far was an awesome display and not just in looks, but the wonderfully seasoned beef and fries lived up to hype. And if you love mac & cheese, get a side of it to share too (not on the menu). However, I recommend getting the fried onions on the side (think they're out of a can, not fried in-house). A couple crisps are good with a bite but mixing them all in overpowers the mac & cheese yumminess. \n\nNow for the disappoints. We were really underwhelmed by the Pepperoni Fondue Dippers ... so not hype worthy. The dippers were simply pepperoni flavored chewy breadsticks - NOT wrapped in pepperoni as advertised or in \"some\" Yelp pics. Booooooooo for not telling fans when ordering that they're getting end of night leftovers. And the drinks were meh.. a few can be seen in pics, served in water glass without any real presentation or umph. Plus no copper tins for the mules which was a bit of a bummer.  \n\nFun for a one time visit to check off the list but there are way better options if in town for a limited on time.
