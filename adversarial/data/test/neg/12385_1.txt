I have nooo complaints with this truck!! Don't let the location Decatur @Lake Mead in front of auto shop fool you! I been here several times, the food is super yummy! Ive always been sceptical of taco trucks cleanliness but they have an.\"A\".rating in there window. Always clean when I go. Did I mention home made corn tortillas! Don't ask me how they fit that machine in there! You can't beat $1.50 carne tacos abd super delish. $5 Tortas!! This truck is a must try!
