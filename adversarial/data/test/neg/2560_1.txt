Great breakfast place! Went with a group of five for brunch and the meal was delicious. We ordered a couple of breakfast sandwiches, the eggs florentine, french toast and a steak sandwich. The portions sizes were also pretty generous and there are a lot of options on the menu. Our server was great and we'll definitely be coming back!
