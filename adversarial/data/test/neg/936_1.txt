I love this place! They expanded this location and the wait times have decreased. I ordered the waffle club. Not my favourite but it was not bad. We always get the veggie chips which is so good! Ask for the chipotle dip. Candy bowl is usually gummy bears and worms. Their lattes are not bad. I always get tea when we play board games. It can get pretty loud but it's supposed to be like that. It's also clean and the lighting is nice. Not too dim or too bright. You can easily spend hours there if you like playing games. It's 5$ a play per person. They recently started serving wine and beer!!! Love this place. I wish they would replenish their games with new sets because some had missing cards\/pieces. Overall the staff are very helpful. I would rate this place a 4.5.
