I ordered food online this week from Thai One On for me and my teenaged kids. I paid approximately $75.00 on VISA and the food never arrived! We waited for two hours for the food before giving up and ordering from another place. In those two hours our calls were ignored (the line just rang continuously till the line disconnected), and our emails to Customer Support were never answered (they sent me a standard response saying that someone would contact me soon but, other than that, I got no response). It's now been almost two days since I ordered and paid. I sent them a follow-up email yesterday but I'm still waiting for a response from Customer Support. I told them that, at the very least, I want my money back. No response. \n\nI've been ordering food online for years and this ranks as the worst experience I've ever had, by far. Who keeps hungry people waiting for food that never arrives? Who treats their customers like crap by ignoring  phone calls and not answering emails sent to customer support? Who takes your money and then disappears without giving you what you paid for? The answer, of course, is people who don't care and who don't know how to run a business. My advice would be to save yourself a big headache and take your business someplace else!
