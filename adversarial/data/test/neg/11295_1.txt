The pedicure was nice, I really enjoyed it.\n\nMy nails are CUTE but I would have liked them to offer suggestions\/designs. I guess I should go in there with a picture next time which is okay.\n\nEveryone was nice and the gel nail polish has lasted 2 weeks like they said and is just now starting to peel a tiny bit, so I am happy.
