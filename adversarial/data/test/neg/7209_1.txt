DIY planning to build or renovate a kitchen need to try Ikea.  I have purchased half a dozen kitchens from here and having shopped all around I can tell you that this is the best bang for your buck solution.\nI find they have a lot of different styles, the quality is very good (like I said I have had some experience buying and using their kitchens), and because it is so cheap you can actually change it in 5 years (because you decide your taste have changed) and not break the bank.\nThings you must know: You should have an experience person taking the measurements (cause once it is cut it is yours no changes), remember that everything here is straight, so if your new place is like a lot of places (on the plateau for example), then you will need to shimmy and consider the fact that your wall is crooked not the cabinets.  So take your time.\nThere are often delays due to backorders, so allow some leaway in your timing, or you may end up with an issue, the safest way to go about this is to ensure your installer has some flex time and order well in advance, remember they will store it for a grace period so better safe then sorry.\nThe Ikea installers are safer but more expensive\nBe prepared to spend at least 4 hours at Ikea to pick out your kitchen with the Ikea designers, it is not a fast project but it is a very satisfying one.  Be sure you have all your measurments, (checked twice or three times), if your using a contractor bring him and her along.\ntip: be sure to always check their tel quel section they have one in any Ikea.
