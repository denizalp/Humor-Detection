We came to pick out a bargain bin book for our book club, but ended up staying to browse through other sections.\n\nI have been looking at the Foxfire series on the web, but hadn't gotten a chance to read one. Barnes and Noble had the Foxfire Christmas book at a reasonable price, so I picked it up. This is the kind of book browsing experience you can't have on the web.
