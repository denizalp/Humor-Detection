Moved here in September 2014 from Washington state. Staff was very helpful taking the stress out of moving to a place sight unseen. Amazing move in specials! Corner unit. Big open floor plan. Fairly quiet area.\n\nWhat we didn't know: apartment was not move in ready. Place was filthy! We spent several days cleaning cupboards, carpets, bathrooms, you name it. If they ask for cleaning payment when we leave I will show them move in pictures! Window in living room was broke and to this day the part is still on order and has not been fixed, entry tile is broke and sunken;still not fixed, exterior porch light hanging and broken; still not fixed. Overheard staff say \"if they haven't needed it by now then they don't need it\".\n\nPut up a baby gateways at porch entrance to keep dog from getting off porch and we were told we couldn't have that because it wasn't uniform with other gates in complex. Was told we could purchase one from there vendor for $125. Why would I purchase a gate for a temporary residence? They stated we could take it with us when we we moved out. What use would that be? We're taking a gate custom built and mounted to this specific space. SCAM much?\n\nBenifit! They pay water. Woohoo! Downfall: they have complete control over it and is usually shut off with no notice several times so far. They will always tell you it was an emergency and that they did not have time to notify tenants.. How hard is it for maintenance to say we will Need to turn off water for this repair , take 20 minutes and call everyone before we start.\n\nAnyway I have vented and will continue to stay here untill my lease is up, but renter beware and be informed. I will post updates as we continue  our residence in the hope that things will improve and better their review.
