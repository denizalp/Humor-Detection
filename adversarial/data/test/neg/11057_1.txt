This little family run place has wonderful sushi!  The owners are Korean, but they serve sushi and many traditional Japanese dishes in addition to their own Korean Bulkogi.\n\nI prefer their sushi and their tempura over the Korean dishes.  The sushi is well crafted and fresh.  The have a nice light tempura and several other nice dishes.\n\nIt is quite inexpensive.  I like to pick up a few rolls to share with friends  on the way home
