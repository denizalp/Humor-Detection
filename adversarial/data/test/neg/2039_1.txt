Started with the Thai lettuce wraps, which I always do when I'm here. Had the blackened shrimp and chicken which was very good . Very little on the plate though. I tried their cheesecake for the first time. That changed my perception of cheesecake because what I've tried before(not here)I never liked it. only real problem I had was the waiter took so long to come back with my cheesecake and check. My meter expired and I got a $25 ticket
