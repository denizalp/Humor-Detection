You really can't expect much from SQL I have come to realize. I went in to have some blood work done for my one year old. They didn't have any record of my son's appointment so they said we had to wait about an hour as a walk in which is really fun with a small child. We finally get in to a room and the guy looks at my son and starts saying this isn't going to be a pleasant experience and to expect lots of crying and screaming. Fun. They have to draw blood from his arm as he is \"too big for a foot prick\" and he feared being kicked by my 26 inch, 17 pound baby. Um ok. The process was like a scene from a scary movie. My husband held my son on his lap and the guy had to call in an additional person to help him hold down my son's arms. Couldn't get a vein from that arm so of course we now have to do this process again in the other arm. They barely got any blood but were still able to run the tests on what they did get so kudos for that. I really just think they need to re-evaluate the process for kids because that was awful.
