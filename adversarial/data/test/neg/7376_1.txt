Ok so I'd like to start out saying I've been to Top Golf a few times and have always had a good time hitting balls and hanging out with friends. The food is pretty good and I've always had good experiences with the host staff.....that was until my friend's 40th bday party on Dec 4th. There was a large group of us (4 bays worth plus some that did not hit any balls). My friend paid a pretty penny for this party with food and drinks included for everyone. The party was booked for 2 hours. 40 minutes before our time was up the staff started clearing away everything, including the drink tokens (again...prepaid) and food. We asked for to go boxes for the left over food and were told no, they don't give to go boxes (hello...already paid for food AND they do have to go boxes because I've taken my leftovers home from there before) due to \"health codes\". When asked to let us use the drink tokens, we were told that they called \"last call\". Along comes the \"manager\" gal who listens to the complaints and then promptly begins arguing with my friend stating that \"her staff is VERY well trained and asked everyone if they wanted to use the tokens (last call)\" This was a complete lie...not one person in our large party was told it was last call (again, 40 minutes before our time was up). I've never heard anyone argue with a customer the way she did. My friend was being very calm and asked her why they didn't come directly to her and inform her that there were tokens left so she could tell everyone. The manager just kept insisting that her staff asked everyone. Never offered a solution. So then along comes another manager, I believe his name was Shane, but I can't recall. Anyway, he was better at solving some of the problems and after learning we had planned to go to the bar there afterward (and spend more money I might add) he did offer to use the remaining tokens (I believe there were 9 in all...do the math on mixed drinks at say a minimum of $7) and did bring 2 buckets of beer to use at the bar. I can understand the \"party rules\", but I've never been to a place that starts cleaning up before the booked time is up and usually they ask the host if they would like the left over food wrapped up, after all it is paid for.\n\nWould I go back...sure because it is a fun place, however I will NEVER book a party there and would not recommend it to anyone else. (I'd be surprised if anyone who attended this party would book one here). The main reason...the complete lack of customer service by the 1st \"manager\", she was horrible and was borderline belligerent. Might want to send her back to training, just saying.
