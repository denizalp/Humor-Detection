Warning: Their Old alignment machine may Not be able to do a 4-wheel alignment on a  sports car.\n\nTechnically, I didn't actually get any service here. I'm just documenting my experience.\n\nWent in for a 4-wheel alignment, and 4.5 hrs after dropping it off, I get a call telling me that their old alignment machine can only do a 2-wheel alignment because my stock Nissan 350z is too low. I REALLY wish they had warned me about this possibility in advance.\n\nPros: \nSeems like very nice people working there.\nFree fast Wifi in waiting room.\nThey have a free shuttle service, but it involves using Your car.\n\nNeutral \/ FYI :\nThey needed to keep my car for about 7 hours to do an alignment, which should only take about an hour. I was willing to wait a couple of hours, but that wasn't an option.\nNo free estimates -- $30 to look at your car.\nCheck for squeaking noise costs $99\n\nCons: \nMercie J Auto Care will Not use parts that I buy elsewhere (often at a much lower cost than what most shops charge).
