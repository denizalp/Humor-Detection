I love this place: chill atmosphere, friendly service, and delicious caffeinated and\/or alcoholic beverages. Not only is it open 24\/7, the drink menu is full of creative flavors and delicious coffee. I fell in love with the Joyous Almond which is a mix of their toddy iced coffee, mocha, coconuts, and almonds - bits of coconuts and almonds come in your drink, and a regular is about the size of a Venti at Starbucks, with much more taste and not at all the over priced tag to it. \nThe staff is super friendly and knowledgeable, (at least the ones that come between 9-12). They'll give you tastes of the beers and recommendations, and hook you up if they're out of something with the coffee drinks. There's lots of seating, and this sounds so small, but the fact that all their chairs have comfy cushions on the backs, is amazing. When you sit for long periods of time working, this makes a huge difference for back problems. As for the clientele, I've seen a mixture of students, healthcare workers, gay guys, and old timers. Basically anyone and everyone could walk through the door, and that's pretty awesome.
