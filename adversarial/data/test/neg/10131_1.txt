Very disappointing experience. Servers unaware of specials, inconsistent attention. Waiter came to our table brought orders, left us hanging. Went in to bar and got attitude from the bar tender. She literally chucked my boyfriend's ID back at him across the bar. My annoyance with getting ignored by the server and a manager who came out to talk to our table about pricing problems, when all I wanted to do was order a drink, was palpable -- but seriously who wouldn't be annoyed. Btw, even after manager said they would take care of pricing problem, final bill didn't reflect it. This place is the pits.
