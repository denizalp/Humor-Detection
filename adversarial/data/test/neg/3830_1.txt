This place is seriously ginormous! \n\nTons of things to buy and enjoy from ammo, BBQ grills or even just window shopping. \n\nThere are tons of guns to see and even has a shooting range.\n\nThis place is definitely a must see.\n\nI enjoyed the fish and man made water falls.\n\nAssociates were friendly and helpful and I noticed the place was so clean and organized.\n\nIf you're searching for even snacks, they've got it all. \n\nJust wished they had the ammo I was searching for.\n\nThey were sold out simply due to their competitive prices.\n\nIf you're in the market for a boat, they have it too! \n\nI'll be back again as I like to visit the Silverton and this place is a hop and a skip away.\n\nIf you're heading to Vegas make sure to visit the inside of this huge outdoor store!
