This place deserves 5 stars and a Michelin star for the food and service.  The food was creative, delicious and perfectly executed. We had the bass. It was moist and perfectly seasoned.  The duck\/ foie toast was amazing. The dan dan was flavorful without being overly spicy. The chicken dish was moist however the chicken confit cake that accompanied it was dry. The octopus was tender and perfectly grilled. Service was pleasant and knowledgeable. This is a great find. ( ps. We came from New York City for Mother's Day which is usually a tough restaurant day and it was a perfect experience.)
