The service is good.  The food is disgusting.  The spring rolls were ice cold.  The prime rib was cold.  The Asian cuisine dishes all taste the same.  The ice cream cups look they unthawed and refroze.  Tasted the way they looked.  But the water was good.  Definitely not worth $16 per person.  I wouldn't pay $5 and will not be back.  Chinese buffet they said!!!  What was I thinking?
