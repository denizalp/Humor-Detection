I was interested in their powered double bike rack, but had some questions so sent them an e-mail on 01\/14\/2018.  After a few days I had not received a response, so I called them and the person who answered said the best way to receive one was to send an e-mail.  I told her I already had, and she said they'd look for it and reply.  I sent a second e-mail on 02\/01\/2018 assuming they'd somehow lost the first one.  After hearing nothing yet again, I called on 02\/26\/2018 and spoke with the same woman who took down my info, found my original e-mail and said someone would look into it a call me back.  That called happened today (02\/27) when Randy called, but I was not at home, missing his call by 15 minutes.  I called GOC to speak with Randy, and the same woman's response was \"Randy will call you tomorrow, as he stated in his voicemail message to you.\"  I guess Randy must be very busy.  At this point, I wouldn't use this rack even if it was given to me, as I would just be setting myself up to experience miserable customer service in the future.
