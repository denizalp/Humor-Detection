We have eaten at a lot of pasta places and when we ran into this one we were blown away! Not only by the quality of the food but also by the tremendous service provided by our server Olivia.  The menu was plentiful and provided many options. We enjoyed chicken parmesan and linguine along with spinach fettuccine. The quality of the homemade pasta was fabulous! We also ordered a lemon panna cotta dessert that was out of this world! Will we be back? Absolutely! If you're in Scottsdale stop in sit down relax order favorite adult beverage and start enjoying. :-)
