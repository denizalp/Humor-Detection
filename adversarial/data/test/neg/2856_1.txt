Update: Three more stores have closed! Downgraded to 2 stars :-(\n\nIt's sad to see this mall deteriorate year after year. There are still a decent number of stores left but in the whole it is pretty pathetic. The best thing about this mall is how kid friendly it is. Nice play area. However, it does get super crowded in the summer. Play area is for 42\" and under. Some parents ignore this but security will kick them out. Dillard's does a Storytime on Tuesdays at 10am and if you register they will give you a card that gives you free carousel rides on Tuesday from 11am-1pm.
