Wow!!! Is all I have to say. For fast food this burger was awesome. I love the handmade patties they were so flavorful and juicy. I had the Kinoko burger the mushroom were perfect not too salty I loved the sauce mixed with the crispy pickled ginger. It was such an awesome flavor combination. Staff was friendly and service was quick. The only negative is that I wish they had unflavored plain ice tea.
