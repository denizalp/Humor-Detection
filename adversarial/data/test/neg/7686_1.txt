Really wish I could leave negative stars! Uneducated staff... management included. 5 tables and server couldn't get any thing right. Including handling his apparent mistakes. Own up! Serving ain't easy.... leave it to people who can multitask! All I expected was a \"My bad\"..... Prides a big pill ....If you can't handle 3 tables. ...it's not for you .... Corporate should really monitor this locaton!! My biggest gripe was no one ever said \"we apologize\" including manager.... who took 5 minutes to appear.  I knew I shouldn't have expected any different. Last time.
