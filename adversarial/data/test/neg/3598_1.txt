Didn't love the macarons. I was very excited as I had read some reviews, and the flavors listed were pretty awesome. However they were quite dry and the service had a very \"serve and leave\" attitude. The flavors made me want to try another in case it was just the one I had but I didn't have time and don't feel like coming back when I am in town.
