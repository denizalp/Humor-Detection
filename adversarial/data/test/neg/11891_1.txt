This has always been a 5 star restaurant for us but last night when we brought friends to BJ'S the service was awful. We waited excessively long for everything!  The worst part of the experience  occured when the waitress pouring beer from our pitcher overflowed the glass then raised the glass over the pitcher and let the overflow run off her hand back into our pitcher contaminating our beer! We had to insist on having the pitcher replaced and the manager did come over to talk to us.  He gave us a new waiter and things improved but were still slow.  For example,  we asked for condiments and another drink, and had to ask again 10 minutes later. Food was lukewarm by the time we received condiments.   We were not offered any compensation for our troubles either.  Sadly, this won't be a regular stop for us anymore!
