I ambled in to this bistro for the first time about a week ago.  I was in the middle of moving, and I was hungry!  Because it was around 2 in the afternoon, there were not a lot of people there. I was eating alone, so I sat at the bar, and chatted with one of the owners and the server.  The customer service was outstanding, but the cheeseburger was out of this world, and at a $7 price, very reasonable!  Even though I was leaving town, I will be back for another cheeseburger, and I will bring my appetite because this burger is big!  I was informed by the owner that all the food is made in-house from scratch, and I could tell by the way he discussed the various menu items that a lot of care goes into the food here!
