My wife met someone from here at a chamber of commerce (I think, may have been a WSD meeting) meeting last year, so when I became sick, I thought I would give them a call.  I called 5-7-18 and left a message.  A lady called me back finally this morning and I told her that I had left a message Monday.  She explained that she was out since Monday, (which I guess means if she is out, no one answers the phone or returns phone calls).  When I explained that I was no longer interested, she said \"yeah, well bye\" and hung up.  \n\nYeah, well bye Dr Scott Lamprecht.  I will never know if you are a good doctor or not.  Your staff should recognize that this is a doctors office, not a fast food establishment, and when someone is calling due to being ill, if you cannot answer the phone, a timely return call is, at least, a requirement.\nEdit\nI just talked to a co worker who said the same lady called my office first looking for me.  My co worker said she could provide my cell number and the girl said \"I don't know why he is calling us\" My co worker again offered my cell and the girl said yeah, ok, whatever.  \nI can't even get mad at these people!  Their office is run like a sitcom.
