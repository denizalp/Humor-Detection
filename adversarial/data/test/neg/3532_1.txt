The location is excellent! Lots of big trees and shades. \nThe food is quite good. I tried the Fontina burger and it was both delicious and full-filling. I loved the grilled mushrooms and their green sauce (?). The burger came with a side of fries, too. \nThe service was self-served. You could sit inside or outside. Great view. \nWould definitely recommend it to anyone.
