Excellent sub! I was getting desperate to find a decent sub place after moving to Phoenix a year and a half ago. There are some ok sub places around but nothing that really knocked my socks off until I found Stumpys! \n\nThe guy who took my order and the lady who brought it to me were both very friendly and pleasant  and she made sure that I didn't forget the bag of chips that came with my order.\n\nI got a combo of the  \"The Classic Italian\" sub, chips and a drink for $9.50 and it was fantastic. I ordered it cold but the guy told me I should try it toasted and I'm glad I took his advice. The size of the sub was perfect, big enough for a healthy appetite but not so huge that you end up wasting half of it. And LOADED with meat unlike the crap that Subway sells. The sub roll was really good too, kinda crusty but with good flavor.\n\nMy only possible problem with Stumpys is that they have Coke products and I prefer Pepsi, Mt. Dew etc. but the quality and flavor of the food makes it worth the sacrifice. LOL! \n\nI am going to try their pizza next.
