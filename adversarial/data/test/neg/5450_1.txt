This was an amazing place to visit!! We had so much fun playing a variety of different board games, there was a host who helped us pick out different games based on what we were looking for. The menu is a bit simple but good enough to stay there all day. We had lattes, and snacks (gummy candies, vegetable straws and popcorn). $8 for the day, stay there as long as you want! I dont know what more I could have asked for. Highly recommend this place for a date, family day or to hang out with friends!
