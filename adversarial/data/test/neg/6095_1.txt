Chino Locos makes a wicked burrito. \n\nHave visited the original location at Greenwood & Queen, its tiny so beware that its much better to take out than eat in. Staff are amazing, very nice and welcoming and were more than happy to answer any questions that we had. \n\nChino Locos does an interesting spin in the burrito, there is an asian influence in a sense that you can add chow main noodles instead of rice as well as edamane beans.\n\nI have had to two different options at Chino Locos: the Baja Fish Burrito as well as the Chicken Tinga Burrito. The clear winner was the fish burrito, its now my go-to item on their menu.The fish is battered and then stuffed into either a whole wheat or white shell with guacamole, tomatoes, edamane, rice, red onion, black beans, green pepper, cilantro, shredded cheese, sour cream & your choice of salsa\/sauces. To die for.\n\nTheir ingredients are super fresh and made in house, including their delicious array of salsas and sauces. I love spicy food so always go for the hot sauce.
