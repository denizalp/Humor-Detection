I eat here often. The food is always tasty and fresh. My favorite is their chicken piccata. \nThe bread and the olive oil they give you before your meal is outstanding and flavorful. I love their salads too.You could fill up on bread and salad alone IMO. We come here for all kinds of family occasions and always enjoy our visit.
