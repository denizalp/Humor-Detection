I loved visiting this Cafe. I bought a dozen bagels for around $9 and also sat down to have one bagel for breakfast for around $11 (huh?).  There are two different counters, one for buying bagels by the half dozen or more, and the other counter is to have a bagel dressed to go (BLT, cream cheese, etc). I choose to sit down and enjoy table service.\n\nMy order was taken quickly and my food came soon after that. The BLT I ordered also came with a tea\/coffee and a bowl of fruit. It was soooo yummy. The staff I encountered were all very friendly, the service was excellent here. \n\nThe bagels I bought to-go were all I could smell on the ride home and it was heavenly.
