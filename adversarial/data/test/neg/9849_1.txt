I'm from Florida.  These people make a mint Julip that is to die for. I was immediatly taken back to a front porch in the dirty south minus the seersucker suit. \nUnderstanding how Craig made that tasty beverage at the speed of light is unknown, but appreciated.  The location of this joint is close enough to the light rail where a buzzed person can make it to the light rail with a few stumbled steps. (The drinks are what you pay for in alcohol content....and that is not a bad thing) \n\nPeople in this place are not judgey.....so you can come here, post up by the bar or plop down on a couch and just kick it with out feeling like you are on stage at ANTM.  So all in all, you can just kick it here. \n\nSide bar gets a 4 star....it would be 5......but it needs to be a little larger. Other than that...love this spot\n\nBring your ***  and buy a drink.
