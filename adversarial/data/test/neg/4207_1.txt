I am reviewing the catering services provided by this restaurant.  Recently I worked with the wonderful staff at Pita Jungle to provide catering for 200 people at short notice following a family emergency.  They were compassionate, kind and so helpful in aiding us in selecting choices, worked on a tight deadline and had all the food delivered on time, well presented, and everything was delicious.  Highly recommend.
