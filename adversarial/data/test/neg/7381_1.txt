Yummy! Perfectly cooked mid rare burger with lots of tasty bacon. Fries are good but could have been crispier. I like that there's no salt and pepper on the tables. Says the chefs are confident in their seasoning. As they should be. Everything was seasoned perfectly. Will definitely be back! Oh, and rolls of paper towels on the tables. Good call!
