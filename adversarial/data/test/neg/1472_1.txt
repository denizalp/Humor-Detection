I have been to this Barbershop several times.  The menus of services says $20 for a beard trim, clippers and Straight razor.  The Barber always argues and says it's $30.  I walked out, on principle.  I am always left feeling taken advantage of and worked over for the extra few dollars.  When I order something off the menu I don't like being charged extra, it's shady.  \n\nI will not go back.
