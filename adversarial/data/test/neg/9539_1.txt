horrible. this place is a total joke. i read yelp reviews prior to going and thought there is no way this place could be compared to panda express. now that i've eaten there i can confidently say its actually worse. the atmosphere and crowd doesn't even justify the bad slow service and the super bland food. trust me as a vegas local who eats out all the time at the best restaurants in las vegas... skip this place.
