I'm leaving a 1-star review only because Yelp won't let me go with 0-stars.  I also cannot leave a review for the food due to us picking up & leaving before we could get a food order in due to the lack of organization in this place.  The table of 6 sitting next to us mentioned they had been waiting for close to an hour, and 5 of the six were just about done with their food and one person was still waiting.  We said forget it, and went next door to Cracker Barrel and got seated & our food very quickly.  \n\nIt appears that the other reviews for this location are similar to what we experienced.  Poor management, poor attitudes, and I can only imagine what goes on with the food preparation.  Save your hard earned money and avoid this Steak 'n Shake at all cost.
