Ate lunch here solo on a busy weekday during lunch. There was a pretty good crowd--mostly business people and expensive-looking women lunching with friends. \n\nI wasn't too crazy about the house made ginger ale, but I loved my rawco taco salad. It was so fresh and delicious. I also got a cacao cacao smoothie and it exceeded my expectations. If I lived in Charlotte, I could see myself stopping in for a to-go smoothie on the regular. \n\nThe service was a little bit slow and the waitress was kind of absent...but I chalked it up to either being really busy or the fact that I was eating alone. I don't know! \n\nOverall, the salad and smoothie outweighed anything semi off putting. I also really loved the big windows that let in tons of natural light! The interior is really clean and modern-looking with small vases of fresh flowers on every table. Loved that little touch!\n\nThanks, guys for some delicious food! :)
