AMAZING experience here - both with the food and the service.\n\nFor starters, we came here to eat twice during a 3 day trip. The first time we came, I got a classic sesame bagel with cream cheese -- I was set on comparing this bagel to my NY bagels. It was great! Totally different but in an awesome way. On our last visit, we got some dinner and a half a dozen bagels to bring back to our family in New York because we loved them so much.\n\nThis cafe was our last stop before hitting the road back to the states.... about 3 hours into our drive, we stopped to get gas and I realized I left my small bag with my credit card, license and $200 sunglasses at this cafe. Obviously frantic, I contacted the owner at another location (it was 10PM and this location was closed), he was very kind and directed me to his brother who owns the Mont Royal spot. I spoke to him the next day and surprisingly they had my bag with ALL my stuff in it. \n\nNot only did they ship it to me that same week, they contacted me several times giving me shipping options (shipping from Canada is more expensive than waiting for them to come to the US a few days later to ship, etc.), sending me my tracking code, all for zero cost. \"Just come visit us the next time you're in Montreal,\" the owner said. \n\nOh we definitely will! Great people, great food :)
