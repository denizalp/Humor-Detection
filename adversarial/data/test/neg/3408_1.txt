Amazing fusion food here. Personally had the Punjabi cheeseburger, and chaat fries while my wife had the naan-wich (paneer) and our group had the cauliflower wings, butter chicken mac-n-cheese, dosa burger, and loaded fries. For dessert we all shared the apple pie samosas. Will definitely be coming back for more!
