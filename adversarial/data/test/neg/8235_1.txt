CHEESE! so much cheese.  i loved everything about this place.  Firstly, the place was really decorated so cool.  and the waiter that we had was so awesome and helpful.  This is a really cool idea for a restaurant.  I was looking forward to getting the jalepeno grilled cheese.  it was absolutely delicious and was a monster of a sandwich.  (i added pepper jack cheese to the sanwich as well)  The waiter suggested that I add bacon to the grilled cheese.  I wish i did that because i feel like it needed a little bit more substance for such a huge sandwich.  all in all it was a great meal.  their fries were probably my most favorite fries i have had.  However, the only thing I would have changed about the sandwich besides adding the bacon to it ... after a while the deep fried grilled cheese got to be too much.  Me and my boyfriend wish that before ordering we got one deep fried grilled cheese and one regular grilled cheese.  I would totally go back and try another grilled cheese!
