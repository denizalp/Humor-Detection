Atmosphere is nice.  Made reservations right from the app and we went straight to our table.  We had a new waitress, but she wasn't bad.  We ordered and our sushi was out in probably 10 min!  Very fast for the amount we ordered.  The presentation and taste were both excellent.  All around a good sushi\/hibachi
