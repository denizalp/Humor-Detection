We had a great day on Monday letting our creative juices flow with encouragement from our host. The choice of colours was good and molds on which to paint and we have some ideas to make our own collections. In addition, there is a lovely choice of food and coffees to refresh yourself after a good afternoon of crafting. Fantastic opportunity, and what a great idea, we loved it  !!!!
