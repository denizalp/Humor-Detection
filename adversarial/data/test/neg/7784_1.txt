Despite the less than four stars on yelp, I decided to give this place a try since I wanted seafood. I ordered the below on happy hour.\n\nPinot Grigio: house wine was a good sized pour and crisp, a bit too acidic for me, possibly not opened today? Not sure on this but it was a good wine for the price. \n\nDouble down roll: shrimp tempura and avocado roll topped with shrimp. The wasabi here is great, which surprised me, as a lot of places doing have top quality wasabi. The sushi rice was very soft and delicious though I think it was a little too soft and warm for how a sushi roll normally is -- but i still liked it.\n\nMaine lobster roll: my favorite probably because we don't have much in terms of lobster rolls in Seattle. It came with chips, chips were warm which was nice. Roll had a nice char on it, and the hunks of lobster were a pretty good size though was only down half the roll. Not overly drenched in mayo, which is great. Very flavorful and with hints of dill. I can see from older yelp photos that they changed the bread on the roll and I prefer this new one as it is closer to a brioche. \n\nCharred octopus: good recommendation by sushi chef and bartender! Came with really nicely cooked baby potatoes and a white cream sauce. Little garlic or potato chips on top were a nice touch. Octopus was super tender, though a lot of a paprika and some other mild chili taste. I liked the chili, but the paprika could be toned down a bit.\n\nAll the food sort of came out at once and so I felt a bit rushed about eating it before it all got cold. Then again two of the dishes are supposed to be sort of cold. Everything tasted pretty fresh, though i am from Seattle so it's hard to beat the freshness of the seafood there. Overall very friendly service, and very attentive. Bartender crafts all the drinks herself! Would come back here though it's a bit pricey (about $35 +tax and tip for everything) but it is seafood in Vegas!\n\nSushi chef: make black cap on with longish hair \nBartenders: female with long dark brown hair and male with glasses and a slight beard
