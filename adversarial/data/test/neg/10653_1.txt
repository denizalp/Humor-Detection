Called 3 times this Sat eve 5:30 -5:40  to reserve a lane for Monday 10\/31, and find out about the Halloween special, Web says UNLIMITED bowling but not for how much $$. two times I dialed 0 for the front desk and go the \"your call is important' but then \"the number you dialed is not accepting messages, you are now being disconnected\" !! Then I called and dialed 2 for lane reservations and  Events (Halloween is listed on the website as an event) Got the message \" our event office is open 9-5 pm Mon- Fri\" \nIt is a family tradition to go bowling on 10\/31, and we were going to invite several other friends to joinus. Both bowling alleys in Scottsdale have been bought out by this co \"BowlMor\" so maybe our hopes are dashed, Scary!
