I do really like this location because it's 24 hours, huge, and 1 1\/2 blocks away from where I live. For those reasons this Shoppers location is convenient, especially when I need to get something late at night. They have almost everything I need and the cosmetics department is great.\nThat being said, I dislike the customer service here. I can never find anybody to help me when I need it. Also note that this Shoppers is always busy and the line-ups are insane. They sometimes only have 1-2 cashiers open when there is a line up getting close to the other side of the store (which is where the front entrance is). What they need here are way more employees on the floor and on cash. \nNone of the employees really say much unless you go to cosmetics. There I find the people there are really helpful and more friendly, but that's because they're always helping\/dealing with people needing cosmetics advice.
