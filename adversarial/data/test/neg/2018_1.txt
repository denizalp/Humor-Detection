The emergency care center sent my amox script here, near my home.  Only after i arrived did they realize they were out of stock.  Just like, back before there were computers, the pharmacist starts calling other stores to see if they had stock (unlike Home Depot and other stores that can check storewide inventory online, duh)...nope, not this one, nope not that one, would i be willing to go to 16th and Thomas?  Sure, I need the medicine.  Told it'll take 45 minutes.  45 minutes later, I arrive at 16th and am told, \"Sorry, we have only one filler, it'll take two and a half hours\"!\nOff I go to CVS.  They call the 16th, transfer the script and fill....all within 15 minutes.\nGuess where I'm going in the future.  Guess where I'm not.
