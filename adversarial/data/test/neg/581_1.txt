Okay so after reading a bunch of great reviews online about Vo's i decided to make an appointment for me and my sister to come in and get our nails done. I had a bad experience getting acrylics at a nail shop just up the street and wanted to try out a new place. They were all very nice. And did a great job on our nails. & It was only 20 for acrylics. Nothing more! I Definitely recommend this place :)
