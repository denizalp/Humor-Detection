This place has some of the most delicious fresh fish you can find. It's located on the westside of Charlotte, which isn't the best side of town. So if you came here for excellent customer service, you will be disappointed. This a get your food and leave establishment. The menu is clear and uncomplicated, so no questions really need to be asked, they keep or moving and I can appreciate that, which is why I give them 5 stars. They are what they are and it is what it is. The end.
