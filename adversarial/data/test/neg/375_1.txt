I feel safe and welcome every time I go. The store is always clean and at I noticed energy saving measures too.  Very different experience from a Wal-mrt trip.  I highly recommend it to my peers.  I am a 90% Service Connected Disable Veteran who gives it to you straight, so go there Private!  Thank you
