I have to update my review. Our family decided to dine in on this visit on a Saturday evening. I've been going to Chicago tacos for a while now and we pick up food pretty often. I ordered my usual tacos pastor without onions. Plate came out and the meat is completely different than what they've had EVERY single time I've been there and there's tons of onions and no pineapple (this came automatically with pastor). Lady taking the order doesn't speak good English so she asked a younger guy to help translate. I explained politely that I ordered no onions and he said the mixture already has onions   ?? I asked him if they have a new mixture now for pastor because it never had onions and came with pineapple. he said no it's been the same. Seems odd because the meat was large strips compared to a chopped style meat before. None the less I take the plate and decide to pick out the onions but I couldn't even eat the tacos because it was very spicy !!! Again I bring my plate up and speak to the younger guy and see if they could possibly make a different meat because it's very spicy.  The young guy storms off and pushes the work cart out of frustration.. very very uncalled for as I was polite to him and the other workers.  I then have to wait about 15\/20 min as he purposely takes his time to remake my plate .. great food but this very uncalled for , not sure if I'll be back \n\n\nGreat tacos !!!!! Nachos are soooo good , loaded with a ton of meat. Also ordered the 3 tacos. Pastor, carne asada & chicken. Great prices !!!
