U Swirl had an offer for frozen yogurt with as much yogurt and toppings as you can fit in the bowl only good for Monday and Tuesday. So I take my family there and everyone us excited about loading it up. We get there and the yogurt if all melted and over flavored and a few were bitting the tongue because they were spoiled. It was the first time I ever went to U Swirl and it will be my last. There are just far too many frozen yogurt shops around to deal with crap product. If you don't put the time and effort into your product necessary to be at par with the competition, then don't be surprised when your store is slow as hell and no one will eat there. UR shop SUCKS! Oh by the way we ended up not eating or ordering nothing. Instead we went to cold stones and spend more money on an excellent product. It is not always about the price.
