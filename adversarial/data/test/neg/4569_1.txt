This place is awesome for hippy types! Unfortunately I am not really a health nut. I just like eating healthy for wight control. It's hard for me to shop here because they don't have my basic stuff like Splenda. But if you are vegan or anything like that you will love this place. Ohh and if you are looking to save money this is the wrong place for you.
