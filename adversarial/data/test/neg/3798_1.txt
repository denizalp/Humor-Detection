As a vegetarian, Chinese, Thai and Mexican restaurants are sort of go to places. So I wanted to like this place, but ... \n\nA number of the employees of this place appeared to be Latino, so I t could have some hope. I will say the dish I had fit the (perhaps old) Pittsburgh ideal of large portions. But the food was only so so. Maybe carnivores (no offense) will find something to like, but I doubt it. Could this place be authentic and I don't know it. Sure, but then to me authenticity would be something to avoid. I went a few weeks ago, and the restaurant was still renovating from the previous tenant. I don't know how far they will bother to go, but I will say the TV's were showing Spanish language shows. \n\nOh, and I was there in the middle of a Saturday, and it is a mall, so there was at least one screaming infant (and apparently brain dead parents).
