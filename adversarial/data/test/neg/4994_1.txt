Very poor customer service. They asked for a copy of my driver's licence to confirm credit card authorization which is unusual and unnecessary especially since we had booked there before and paid with the same card! Once authorization had been confirmed, I asked for written confirmation that the information had been destroyed (my legal right), at that point, the manager became sarcastic and unreasonable. Check the recommendations of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada! Never booking here again.
