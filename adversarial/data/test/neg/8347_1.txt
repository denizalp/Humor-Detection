I came here on a Thursday late afternoon for dinner for the first time. The atmosphere and decor was amazingly put together. The staff was great but the food was terrible. I was expecting so much more. If I'm going to pay that much for food I expect it to taste good. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the standards of the decor and environment. I will not be coming back or recommending.
