Worst restaurant experience that I can remember. I ordered one meal and waited 55 mins. I started asking about it 45 mins into the wait. Still nothing was done. I requested to speak to the manager and he only came forward after I demanded to speak to him through 3 different employees. He barely made eye contact as I was voicing my complaints and only just said \"sorry\" without sincere concern or remorse. I demanded my food at that point bc I had to get back to work, and when I got it, the meat was cold. I demanded a refund (which I received) and vowed to never return. Highly disappointed in their customer service all around. I would not recommend this place to anyone.
