Not bad. Not great, but for Phoenix not bad is pretty good for Chinese food. \n\nWe got the \"add on\" egg roll, wonton soup and cheese puffs. \n\nAll were very good. Ordered beef chow fun and the cashew chicken. \n\nI think they use MSG in the meat, because the beef had a bit of a funny texture to it while chewing. \n\nLarge enough portions for leftovers to take out. \n\nNice enough restaurant with white tablecloths. Nice touch. \n\nIn the Valley, this is one of the better Chinese places you're going to get.
