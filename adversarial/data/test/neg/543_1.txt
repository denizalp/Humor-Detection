Kamal Fouad is my Service Manager at Lexus of Las Vegas and he is outstanding! He always takes care of all my car's service needs and keeps in constant communication with me whenever my car is in the shop for a mileage service or minor repair. The customer service is superb, and the Manager Mike is attentive and has even stayed a little after hours to ensure that I could pick-up my vehicle after work and that the service I received was excellent. You must visit this dealership. The customer service is worth its weight in gold.
