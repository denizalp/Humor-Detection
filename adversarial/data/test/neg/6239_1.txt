Ok, why is it that when it comes to writing REALLY good reviews, or REALLY bad reviews, I usually (not always) get it done straight away. But when it comes time to write the less than 5 star but more than 1 star review I procrastinate. In any case, here's my review of il Bosco, finally. \n\nWhere to begin, well, when you price your pizza in the same range as say Pizzeria Bianco, and you model your whole concept on them as well (more on this later), you better be phenomenal. But lamentably Il Bosco isn't phenomenal, theyre ok, the pizza is good, just not great. That said, the owner must have cajones the size of Texas to have priced his pizza in the same range as Chris Bianco's, or maybe its just his ego that's over inflated hence the over inflated price. As I've already said, its not bad, its just not $12-$15 per pizza great, the crust is good, but so delicate it cant handle a trip up the street a few blocks without completely collapsing into sogginess (I tried to take one home to my bro). I deduced that this must be the reason I saw 3 customers come in for take out and all of them had to wait as their pizza was cooked, after their arrival. They simply will not cook it until you are there to pick it up, which means you will always have a bit of a wait. We also had the meatballs al forno, which were not only small, but one of them was burnt, and I mean black spot burnt, but they served it to us anyway. Again, 2 of the 3 small meatballs were ok, they were good, but not, \"hot damn I'm coming back here again soon\" good, and the burnt one was not good at all of course. The caprese salad was probably the best thing we had there, but again, it was good, not great. The wine selection was decent, although I would say the reds are a better selection than the whites. \n\nNow back to the afore mentioned similarities, like Biancos, Il Boscos menu features 2 salad choices, 2 small plate choices, and a variety of pizzas. Again just like Bianco's, they also offer house made mozzarella and bread, though the bread seems suspiciously dense, thick and un-Italian, not to mention nowhere in the vicinity of Bianco's quality either. This is where the menu similarities end though, Il Bosco offers 4 dessert options, but oddly, save for the the gelato, none of them are Italian, no tiramisu or cannoli here. Along with the gelato, a root beer float, brownies, and creme brulee are offered. What is a French dessert doing on the menu of a decidedly Italian restaurant (judging from the name Il Bosco which in Italian means woods or roughly forest)? Again, that suspiciously un-Italian vibe creeps up.\n\nI bring my tome to an end by saying that a google search of Il Bosco filled in some of the blanks for me, and now I understand why my experience was what it was. Il Bosco is not Italian owned or operated, its actually the artistic retirement endeavor of a retired golf pro who isnt even close to being Italian (maybe THAT'S why the meatballs were so close in size to golf balls, lol). Well I'm old school, and for me, when it comes to better dining, you have to be Italian to make Italian food, and Ill pay more for the luxury if need be. That said, this place is ok if you're really hungry, in the area, and don't mind paying Pizzeria Bianco prices for pizza that is lesser in quality than Il Capo, which is right up the street.
