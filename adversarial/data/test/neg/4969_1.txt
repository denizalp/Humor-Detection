The food here is absolutely amazing! Try the haus noodle soup with pork, the haus sticker & xiao long bao (soup dumplings) - you won't be disappointed! In addition to the delicious food the staff is very friendly and service is quick! I will definitely be back & highly recommend that you come & try it out!
