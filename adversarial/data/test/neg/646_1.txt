Looking for a unique place, but not to expensive while visiting Cleveland from Chicago.  Found this place and wish I could replicate it.  The service and staff was impeccable.  Super friendly and accommodating.  The food was amazing.  They serve a warm biscuits with herb butter and home made jam.  Soooo good!  We ordered the Morning Chicken and rosemary waffles.  The chicken was boneless and had a delicious crispy coating.  I would recommend this place to anyone coming to Cleveland.
