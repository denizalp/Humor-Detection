This place was awesome! I'm obsessed with the menu options, wish I lived in Arizona but we just stopped passing through. Fish was very fresh. The teriyaki chicken was nothing special but not at all bad. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The place was busy and I went around 9 on a Tuesday. However, they have lots of seating to accommodate all of their many fans. You will not regret visiting Sushi Ken.
