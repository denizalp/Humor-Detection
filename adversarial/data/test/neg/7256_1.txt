My favourite little chocolate & ice-cream place! We came here initially to buy chocolates a la carte and instead left with ice-cream, chocolates and cakesters. I had a vegan strawberry balsamic ice-cream cone. It was so delicious, smooth, unique and not too sweet. I eat with my eyes and how can you ignore the beautiful artistry of their chocolates, cakes and ice-cream bars? The way they decorate is very different imo. I've never seen ice-cream bars like this before! The chocolates alone are adorable and tasty, smooth & not overly sweet. My handpicked box of chocolates came with little pineapples, a Snoopy, a turtle, a piano, a little coffee cup... I forget the rest but seriously try the chocolates!! We also purchased brownie and birthday cake flavoured cakesters on one occasion but I wasn't a fan, I found them far too sweet. When we drop by it's usually for chocolates or ice-cream. We've brought our toddler and have sat inside before. They seem kid friendly. Their prices are affordable and nothing over the top. Oh, their packaging & boxes for chocolates are pretty too :) We'll be back.
