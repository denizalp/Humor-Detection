I'd rate this a 3+.  Nice suite with two separate baths, lovely soaking tub (would have been much nicer with jets, but take a side trip to the Lush store in the Mandalay shops and get some nice bath bombs!), tvs in living room, bedroom and in the bathroom which was small but nice to watch while in the tub.  No separate pool and quite a haul to the Mandalay pools.  Check in service was really subpar.  Location at the very south end of the strip not particularly convenient (although they do have tram to Luxor and Excalibur).  I did enjoy the Bathhouse spa, which was small but nice and very peaceful and not crowded.  Spotty wifi (but free) and bad cell phone reception (but I'll blame AT&T for that one).  Nice enough hotel overall, but next time I'll be at the Encore.
