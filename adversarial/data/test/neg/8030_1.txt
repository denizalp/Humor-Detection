I have eaten at a lot of the food establishments on McKnight Road but I still keep finding places to try. Stokes Grill was a great pick. It is a bar and restaurant  which are separate. They have a great selection if beers and you can choose some to take home. \nTheir menu had some nice offerings.  I chose the Shrimp Tacos. The tacos had two small flour shells. Two were needed because they were stuffed full!  There were a very nice portion of crispy fried shrimp. Along with the shrimp was a crispy tasty slaw. I don't know what all was in the sale but it complimented the shrimp perfectly. There was lime juice and a salsa too. The tacos came with hand made chips which were light and crispy. I also ordered a cup of their Mac & Cheese. It was made with a white cheese that is melted and poured over small pasta shells. It is creamy and smooth and a bit rich. I can't imagine eating a bowl of it as a meal, but it is offered as such. \nI will definitely go back and try more items on their menu.
