The hype is not worth the price. I love his show so i assumed everything on the menu would be savory but that was not the case. Burger lacked flavor. Nothing special about this place just your average burger and meatless wings with bland \"hot sauce\"  . Our server was a bit dry and looked annoyed\/stressed out until it was time to tip and fill out the servey which I'm not even sure was submitted because when I hit submit it notified me that the device was offline and could not connect to the internet..
