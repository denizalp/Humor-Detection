So i took the short drive from ASU over to Little Miss BBQ during my lunch break and i must say this is absolutely the best BBQ in Phoenix hands down. Plus you know its good if theres a line out the door 10 minutes to 11am, something you only read about happening in TX! The place is small limited seating inside but for the most part if the weather is nice there's a patio everyone gathers at. The place hasn't been opened long i believe late Feb 2014 or early March. I ordered the 2 meat plate w brisket and sausage w beans(WITH BRISKET) and potato salad, the brisket is cut to your liking and you even get a sample while they're cutting and was cooked to perfection, from the taste of it these guys i think nailed it! Holy cow! This could be in my opinion better then some joints in Texas! I spent a few seconds talking to Scott and he said it's cooked in a custom smoker by R&O in Granbury TX. spending time in Austin was the key to successful BBQ here in AZ. Visiting places such as John Mueller, La BBQ, Franklins helped craft his own take on Texas style BBQ. Don't be scared of the surrounding area its a little trashy industrial park \/ strip clubs but trust me its worth the stop, the bbq that is! Five stars all the way & get there early!
