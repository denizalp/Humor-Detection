I've said it before and I'm saying it again- I do love Starbucks. They have a standard formula at every store for their drinks. Now that I've figured out what's what- I can get what I desire. Their mixtures and offering are uniform. Starbucks serves with a smile. And they quick, patient & easy now that I've figured out their extensive menu.  \n\nSince I'm not a daily coffee\/caffeine consumer, it did take me a little bit to figure out what type of coffee & products I actually like from them. I used to say, \"augh I hate burnt tasting coffee.\"  Thank goodness I worked past THAT ignorant belief that all of their coffee tasted the same and found the right fit for me. \n\nA barista helped fit my finicky taste buds with the perfect pairing of menu items. Since Starbuck stones are consistent, I can get my favorite at other stores! \n\nOne thing to know about THIS Starbucks. Tipping in a NO NO. This Starbucks is a UPMC employee worked store since it's in a hospital. UPMC employees can't accept tips. So try to be extra kind to your barista. As a group of baristas they are working with some of the most stressed out individuals in the city and they work at a pace that amazes me. \n\nIt's amazing how much comfort these Barista's bring to families and patients with their craftsmanship & professionalism. I'm always very impressed by how hard this group works to serve the hospital community. \n\nAdditional Tips- This location doesn't accept Starbucks Mobile Free Food or Drink Rewards. Mobile Ordering is not available at this location.   This is due to the location being a UPMC hospital managed location. \n\nHowever if possible, mobile ordering would be a great addition. While I stayed at Presby after Dr. Okonkwo performed cervical surgery, I sent my mom down to this Starbucks each day. I gave her my order and app to pay. Being able to order on the app from my bedside & just having the order picked up by a family member would have made things about 1000x's easier for the barista's, myself, and my mother.  Mobile ordering would help speed up services at this location greatly. It's something that should be highly considered.
