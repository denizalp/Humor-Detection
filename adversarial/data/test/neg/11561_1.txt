I had the cowboy burger and it was AMAZING, and with an unbeatable price! The meat was also perfectly seasoned, so I probably would have been happy with just the simple hamburger. :D\n\nSince I was in Phoenix for a conference and hadn't eaten vegetables for a couple of days, I decided to get the \"fresh garden salad\". Don't do it! It's basically pre-packaged shredded lettuce with a few slices of cucumbers and tomatoes. Could have spent those four bucks on another burger. );\n\nThe decor was super cute, and they were playing old songs like For the Longest Time and Take On Me!
