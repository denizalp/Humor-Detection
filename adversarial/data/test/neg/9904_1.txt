We chose this restaurant for our Chinese New Year dinner. The menu has a wide variety of dishes. The service was par. We order the pre fix menu and some side dishes . The waiter was at first not acoomendating but after a discussion with my dad they agreed on what we asked for. The food was mediocre to good. Most dishes were hot and tasty besides a few that were a bit salty. Overall the experience was good.
