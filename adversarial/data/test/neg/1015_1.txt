Had the best guacamole with pomegranate seeds today. Also had a fabulous salad with the freshest greens, avocado slices and delicious shrimp. The waitress recommended a great cilantro dressing to top it off and was very attentive to our needs. I also enjoyed a tasty Banana Colada that hit the spot!  Excellent to find a wonderful place to relax  and enjoy yourself when you are gone from home working. Actually plan on going back tomorrow night before this trip is over!
