We come every Subday morning with our children and Tarissa does an amazing job taking care of us. She's incredibly attentive and knowledgable as well as keeps us entertained with her sense of humor. She is by far one of the best servers we've had. Thank you Tarissa for everything and for keeping us company Sunday mornings! ;)\n\nStephanie, Anthony, Zoey and Gwen Weinberg
