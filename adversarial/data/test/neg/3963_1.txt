LOVED THIS.\n\nGranted, I'm a huge Beatles fan.  I am also easily amused and generally easily impressed by theatrical performances.\n\nBut Beatles LOVE was amazing!  I loved the mixes\/remixes of classic Beatles songs used in somewhat unexpected ways.  I especially loved the opening act and the Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds act.  The first had so much energy!  And the second was so gorgeous and disorienting, perfect for the song.\n\nI HIGHLY RECOMMEND this show.  It was gorgeous, fun, and a great Beatles tribute.  The interplay between video footage\/silhouettes\/live actors\/recurring characters from Beatles' songs, etc was just amazing.  And the strange-quirky sensibility of the Cirque aesthetic was perfect for a show centered around the Beatles.\n\nI'd love a chance to see it again, whenever we are back in Vegas.  This is a must-see, especially for Beatles fans (but honestly, who isn't a Beatles fan?!)
