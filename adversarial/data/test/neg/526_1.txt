I bought an SUV here from Joe Palmisano , and had a delightful experience. Let me be clear- I hate buying cars, but Joe's handling of my search, test driving, and everything else through to purchase actually made it enjoyable. Great dealership, great service, and everyone goes out of their way to make you feel welcome without adding pressure. I'll be back for my next purchase!
