This is Jacque Wright and I eat at Arcadia Pita Jungle all the time.  I certainly want to commend the staff and the food.  I also want to point out that this location as well as other store locations also offer art to view on the walls from our various artists in the art community.  This work is performed by Jason Savaglio, the art curator for all the Pita Jungles.  He does a great job of artist selections, placement, and displays on a monthly basis for all the stores.  I have met him and he is actually a school art teacher too.  I give kudos to Jason Savaglio for doing such a fine service and adding to our joy of art - you can view it and buy it too!  If you want to talk to Jason, ask for him at the Arcadia Pita Jungle and I'm sure they can get a message to him.  He is the greatest!! GOOD WORK AND JOB WELL DONE Award from me!
