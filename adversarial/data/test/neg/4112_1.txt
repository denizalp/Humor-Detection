Edit: I am adjusting the score of my review. The owner contacted me after the fact and explained in detail what happened and the steps taken to take care of it. The problem was solved and in the end this place has a cool feel and is definitely a spot to have a nice drink in the evening away from the normal bar and club scene.\n\nOriginal Review: \nQuick review. Ordered an Irish Coffee. Charged $7 and had to ask multiple times about if it was an Irish Coffee or not as there was absolutely nothing but coffee in the cup. Attitude here, could be a better place if the staff would be more attentive and less concerned about themselves.
