Love love love!! \nDifficult to find, but glad we did. We were uptown for  concert at the knight theater and did not have a lot of time to grab dinner before the show. This was walking distance of the theater, they were quick, an inexpensive option for uptown, but best of all delicious and unique pizza! They offered a vegan cheese that made my dairy free son very happy! \nWill def come here again when uptown and don't want to do the fine dining.
