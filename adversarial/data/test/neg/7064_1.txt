What a great shopping experience while buying my very first pair of Louboutin's! Not intimidating at all as some of these stores can be. I was in the Christian Louboutin boutique in Paris this past summer where no once made eye contact or offered any help. I came in thinking I knew what I wanted and left with something even better! The saleswoman and the manager were both so helpful in explaining the construction, fit and materials that I left with a lot of info for my next pair :)
