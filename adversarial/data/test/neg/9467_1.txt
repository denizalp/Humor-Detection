I drive from Harrisburg to this salon because of the consistent good work this salon does on my goldendoodle.  It's not easy to find a place that can groom your doodle and leave him looking like a doodle instead of a poodle.  They keep it clean, which is hard to do, and my pet is never held for an entire day, and seems calm when I pick him up. I'm happy.
