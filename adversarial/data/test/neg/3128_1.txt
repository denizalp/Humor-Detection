My disabled mother was finally able to find reprieve through Disability Help Group. They orchestrated the process seamlessly and told her what she would expect during the hearing. Everything they told her ended up coming to fruition. \n\nDave was the person who walked her through it. He took the case seriously and always had all the necessary paperwork that was required. We couldn't of asked for a better experience. Thank you Dave for being there for my mother, whom I'm very close to!
