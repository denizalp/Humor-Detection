Located in the heart of Market Square in downtown Pittsburgh. The Simple Greek is a delicious and quick Greek restaurant. They have the meat rotating and they heat their pitas on a grill. The customer service is outstanding, they so kind and helpful. I was in Pittsburgh on a work trip and went to the restaurant Revel & Roost to try to get a table, that was a recommendation from one of my friends who lived in the area. They told me since I was alone they could not seat me. I thought that was extremely rude. It's hard enough being alone on a work trip and having to dine by yourself and then to get such snobby attitude from a local establishment, was unfortunate. After that, I The Simple Greek and I decided Greek food would be amazing. I ended up getting a bowl. You can choose getting either a bowl or a pita. I decided to get lentils for my base. I got grilled chicken and a lot of different toppings with hummus, all mixed together. I got it to go and I ate half of it in the restaurant and ate the other half later. The portions are very generous and it was a delicious meal and good choice on my part. The price was ridiculously affordable.I highly recommend going here for quick, fantastic Greek bowl or pita.
