I think it's ok but I was hoping for a little more. The overall taste was ok but I really didn't care for the pepperoni or sausage that they used. The sauce and crust were good and the cheese was sufficient. I think if they changed the source of the toppings they could easily be five-star. The prices are a big steep but with the amount of ingredients they are jamming into the pizza I think it's not unreasonable.
