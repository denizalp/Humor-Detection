I do love Rugged Wearhouse, and this one is pretty organized. Why am I giving 3 stars, because I bought a pair of boots for $25, not a bad price, but the tag from the store was still on the shoes and it was marked $20.\n I still bought them, but why keep a tag that clearly states your selling something higher than what they are worth at a department store. Annoyed.
