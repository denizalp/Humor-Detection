Amazing NY bagel shop in Las Vegas. It is always busy and there are always New Yorkers in there. The bagels are amazing, along with their varieties of cream cheese. Their lox, knish, and baked goods are incredible as well. If you have time, stay for the food. I recommend any of the eggs Benedict and the challah French toast. Huge portions and huge personality. Get some ruggulah to go.
