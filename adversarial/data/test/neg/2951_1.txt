I love the turkey burger its my go to but Ive never\nhad the build your own salads.  My suggestion is get the small I didnt realize how big a large salad was lol I had it lunch the next day  :) There is no picture I was so hungry I started eating my salad asap lol I added grilled chicken it was juicy not over cooked. Ill be back for a salad again:)
