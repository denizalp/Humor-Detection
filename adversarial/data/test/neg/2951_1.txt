Found this place after playing golf.. What a gold mind. I was a little thrown off by then line, but it goes fast. I think I changed my mind about 3 times before settling with the meat lovers scramble. So good !!!! The location is clean and cool. The patio out side is dog friendly (great) and non smoking (even better) they offer wifi for all the tech nerds like myself. Check in got me a free cup of coffee. \nOnce we the gentleman took our order in the front he repeated it to make sure it was right. I hate getting the wrong food, especially when I'm starving. It was busy for a Sunday so I excepted to wait a while for the food. No even, food came out quick and hot !! And oh man was it good. Constant check ins with the sounding staff to ensure everything was great. I can definitely say I was impressed with this place. \nBathrooms were modern, needed to be checked on. TV's are positioned in the middle of the restaurant which allows for a good view with any seat in the house. The entire restaurant has a modern look that I wouldn't expect from AZ. I would expect a place like this in OC, but I'm glad I stumbled into it.
