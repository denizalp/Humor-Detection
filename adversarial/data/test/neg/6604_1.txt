I was disappointed. Who said this is the best buffet in Vagas? It's so wrong. First time here, had quite high expectation, cuz it seems a lot of people said it's the best. The buffet has quite a lot of options, but the food taste just ok. Some are bland and some are over salted. The only thing I like about is the king crab\/snow crab, it has been cut in half, so it was easy to eat, but I've heard most of the buffet also cut the king crab leg in half for customers, so that makes it not so special anymore. Maybe I should have gone there for dinner instead of brunch\/lunch, because almost half of their stations are serving the same breakfast items. The service was good.
