will definitely go back to this place. after its name being changed several times, i must say, the ownership now has done it right. service is unbeatable and they kicked it up a notch with their food(sushi rolls). we got the baked scallop roll, sex on the beach, and crazy wild salmon(???). they were so flavorful and delicious! good job 'go wild sushi and grill'!
