This place is tough to review because the pizza can be inconsistent... When it's fresh out of the oven its pretty darn good; but I've had some bad slices from here too... I am really hard on pizza reviews because I feel there are way too many bad joints out there and people just don't know what good pizza is anymore... So, with that in mind, i'll say that this pie is more than passable...
