Food was great, coffee ok, service was horrible. Delayed, brought coffee with no sugar, food took 30mins for breakfast, had to remind the waitress of the sugar (anyways went and got it myself because only diet sugar was brought not even a stirrer) and lemons that was asked. \n\nGreat location and overall look of the place.
