This place was everything and I mean everything! First let's start with the vibe... rustic chic. Loved that! Secondly the service was well organized and great. There is never not a time when they are not attentive to your needs, and there are multiple individuals at all times rotating. Seating is selective so if you want an actual seat make sure to make a reservation. Otherwise if they are not packed .. which generally they always are, you can sit at the couches and eat there or even the bar. If you arrive when they open for brunch.. get there early because there will be a long line.\n\nOk the food... listen... just amazing. I had the waffle with chicken and spiced watermelon. The chicken is cooked for 27 hours and then fried... it was just perfect. The waffle was a cheddar waffle or you can choose just a regular sweet waffle, but trust you will love the savory cheddar waffle. The spiced watermelon ended the meal with a bang. The syrup is made with burbon or whiskey which you can really taste. They have a special hot spice which you have to try!  Overall cost for the fish was 36.00. You get four pieces of chicken I should add, so you will definitely be full. The chicken is cooked in pork lard but you can choose the gluten free option which takes just a tad bit longer to cook but still just as great! ( yes, I tried both)\n\nThe Mac and cheese is a four cheese blend and nothing short of amazing (my friend ordered and I had to try it).\n\nLast but not least... the biscuits.. just trust me.. get some biscuits. So good! \n\n\nOverall ambiance was chill and causal. The restaurant is located in the Venetian on the first floor. You will be sad if you did not try this place.
