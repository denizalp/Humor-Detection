Had a great time here on our last night in Toronto! We came late-ish on a Monday night and were happy to see they were still open AND they have a late night poutine menu! \n\nWe're not from Canada, so the beer selection seemed new and interesting (it was also funny that they were super excited about Stone IPA!) We both got a couple of flights and glasses and the bartenders had great suggestions. They were super nice and funny. \n\nWe got poutine that was mexican-y themed. Chicken, jalapenos, cheese curds, sour cream. SO good. I love most iterations of french fries covered in stuff, but even still these were super good. We also got the beer cheese fondue which was AMAZING. The cheese combo was perfect and I could have eaten two orders by myself. \n\nI was skeptical because it looked like it might be an overpriced stuffy place at the bottom of an office building, but it was really a good time.
