All in all I had a pleasant stay at The Hotel. They were very accommodating with my puppy, even asked me to bring him inside so they can meet him. Check in was easy, they had a lot of service associates at the desks so we virtually had no wait. Don't get confused there are three hotels on the property and if you go into the main entrance you will have to drive around the corner to the parking for The Hotel. It is a very luxurious hotel and every room is a sweet. The \"pet floor\" is the 22nd floor and offered fantastic views of the strip and surroundings. From the outside the windows are gold which adds to the feeling you are about to be pampered. Every room is a suite, upon going into the room I asked where the beds were lol.. It is a two room sweet with very nice furnishings and an amazing bathroom with a big bathtub and separate shower. 1.5 bathrooms. Very nice room. Only thing I noticed is some of the furnishings had very minor chips or scrapes, nothing major whatsoever but I pay attention to detail. There was also some dust in the bathroom. If it wasn't for this I'd have given it 5 stars. The buffet was nice with good food however felt it could have had more of a variety. The tramway running from Mandalay bay to Excalibur comes in handy! All in all a very pleasant stay and I would recommend it. Oh it was also fairly cheap for such a nice hotel.
