Last night I had planned a bachelor party starting the evening off at Top Golf in Scottsdale (Riverwalk). I had all the guests get memberships on TopGolf.com to save some time. Upon arriving there was a line out the door. I expected it to be busy since they opened recently. Fletcher at the membership desk was EXTREMELY helpful getting all my friends their memberships cards. We then were helped by David at the main desk and asked if we could get two spots next to each other to accommodate our party of 8. I had heard that it can take over an hour to get a spot but within 30 minutes David had fit us in and got us started. The whole experience was amazing and we all had a great time. Even my friends that had no golfing experience had a blast. I will be returning very soon and can't wait to try the other games we didn't have time for. I feel like the longer they are open the smoother the whole process will become but will recommend TopGolf to everyone I know. Thank you for making it such a great experience!
