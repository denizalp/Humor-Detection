Good quiet atmosphere and most of them seem to be on dates. Me and my friend had a nice dinner and talked through most couples who had a quick dinner there. \n\nService was good. The tables were very cramped together so I do apologies to our neighbours who might have been forced to listen to girl-talk on their date night. \n\nWe had the Glas Tagliere, Beetroot salad, kale salad and wine. The cheese selection on the Tagliere was delicious. The cures meat was not that too memorable. The kale salad as enjoyable. We wanted dessert but the wine cake and bread pudding wasn't appealing to is that evening.\n\nI was hoping for a more appeal main selection too :(\n\nGood ambience throughout.
