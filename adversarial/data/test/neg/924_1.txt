Ordered just home phone service for my mother in an assisted living facility and they took my order over the phone. They told me $29 a month. and they said they had to transfer me to the installation team. They put me on  hold for 10 minutes before I was disconnected. I called back and they gave me another installation number to call. 877-984-0170, busy signal, I called back again they gave me another number 866-686-3278, busy signal. I called back to sales again, they gave me another number to Installation 855-685-0582. Once again Busy signal, I called all these numbers 3 times for a total of 12 calls. The only one that answered right away was the sales department. The manager there said they weren't Cox just a company they hire to set up new accounts. Seems they set up new accounts but the support is too busy to take any calls. My next call as soon as I post this is to the BBB( Better Business Bureau) Here is the link to file a complaint with the BBB if you have the same trouble. The BBB  may be able to do something about this if enough people take the time to complain about the service and way they charge more then they say. \nhttps:\/\/www.bbb.org\/consumer-complaints\/file-a-complaint\/get-started
