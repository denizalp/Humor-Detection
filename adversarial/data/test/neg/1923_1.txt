The sushi restaurant I frequented several times a month for almost 10 years closed down last year and I have been searching for a replacement. Well I think I have found it. I have been here twice now (first time with my 3 year old & husband and this time by myself) and will come many more times in the future. The fish is very good and fresh which is my main requirement (I eat mostly nigiri). They also have great happy hour pricing (food & drinks) from 5 - 8pm daily. In reading the previous reviews I saw people mention the decor being less than steller and I would agree it is a bit basic and older looking in certain areas but that does not bother me. I have had very prompt service during both visits and excellent food at a great value.
