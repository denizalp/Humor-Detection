Not sure why it took me so long before my 1st visit, considering I have worked on this block of Park Road on-and-off for a long time.  I met up with my chicas after work on St. Patty's Day.  The place is small... but we didn't have to wait.  Thursday is their $2.50 Pint Night, and with some exclusions on the higher priced beer  there are still plenty of choices.  However I am almost beer illiterate, so it was like reading French when I was trying to decide on my beer order.  Ended up with a pilsner (you should be happy I remember that word...), it was still kind of hoppy for my taste.  Sometimes I just want to see the word Bud, or Miller.\n\nI ordered a 1\/4 lb. Carolina Burger.  To my surprise, it is only $5.29 for that and it even comes with 1-side.  Sweet potato fries was delicious.  Their regular fries weren't bad either.  Most of the sandwiches\/salad are around $8.99.  One of the girls ordered a salad and it was huge.  \n\nService overall was decent, even after it got busy.  I give this place a solid approval.
