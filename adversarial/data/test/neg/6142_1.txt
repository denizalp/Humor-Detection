Great food! The salsa is so darn hot it's not enjoyable and I love me some spicy food but that's not humane ;) I just ate the BEST CHILE RELLENO I have ever eaten in my life. The service sucks. The staff are occupied in their own lives and just as the other yelpers have stated the sit you down, take your order and that's that. And pay time comes they expect tips, kinda reminds me of the Asian places you eat at where they seat you and don't attend to you but when it's time to pay they are right there ready to collect.\nThis place is a must try at least once as this is my second time and both trips were delicious! Happy eating.
