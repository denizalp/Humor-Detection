Worst service ever! If you do not want to ruin your day, don't come here.\n\nI was with my girl friend. Her appointment was actually at 5pm, but the sales lady called her to change it to 3 without apologizing. When we were at the store, I was trying to pick dresses for my friend and let her try different styles, but the sales doesn't really want us to do so. She even said to my friend in the changing room things like \"why did you come with your girlfriends? you should come with your parents, your girl friend is too picky, blablabla...\" \n\nUnprofessional, lack of respect, and very rude.\n\nThe designer would be embarrassed about the level of service this location is giving
