First timer at Nandos Resturant. Where to begin, well it took over 2 hours from start to finish to complete the meal, and it only took 15 mins to eat it! We were seated quick enough, but it took over 15 mins to put our chicken order in at the counter cuz no one was there to give it to. They forgot our drinks, they ran out of cups. My chicken was given away to another patron, the veggie wrap was not GRILLED vegetables but a cold salad put into a wrap.  People, go to another location to get the right meal with drinks.
