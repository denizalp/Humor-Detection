This location is HORRIBLE. This should not be considered fast food. We did the drive through and post ordering (2 burgers and 2 fries) it took 15 minutes to get our food. There was only 1 person in front of us. When we finally got our food I asked the lady if it normally takes this long and her response was \"Nope, it's my fault. That's why I brought your food.\" No apology, not a thing. \n\nNot even the food was redeeming - and expensive for 2 burgers and 2 fries! I'll be sticking to in n out from now on. Very disappointed and I will not be returning to this location.
