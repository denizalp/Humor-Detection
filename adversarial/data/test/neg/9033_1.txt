Decent theater- way in the back of the casino, follow the signs to find it.\nBathrooms are right by the box office, and they're modern and clean.\n\nAuditoriums are small, but I prefer it that way. Sound and video were perfect throughout our movie: Gravity 3D. Auditorium, halls, and bathrooms were super clean.\n\nDidn't see much staff aside from box office staff and the guy who took our tickets. This location was close to dead at 7PM on a Friday night, which is a huge plus- I may work with teenagers, but I have zero interest in hanging out with them in a social context when I'm off the clock. This is the perfect theater to avoid them.\n\nAs for other reviews who reference a ton of seniors- senior day, per a sign at the box office, is now moved to Wednesday, as of 1\/1\/2014. I couldn't care less if the people in the auditorium with me are 8 or 80, as long as they're respectful, but you may want to take that into account- I assume they're likely a bit busier those days.
