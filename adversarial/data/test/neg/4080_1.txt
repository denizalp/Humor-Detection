We live in DC Ranch and go there quite often. This visit was exceptional, we had a young lady named Sabrina for our server. We were having an OK day but when Sabrina came over she just lightened up our day. She was so full of energy and just so pleasant to speak with. She would constantly come over to see if we needed anything and timed everything perfect on a busy day from the Anti pasta with extra bread to the desert at the end. She did suggest the white pizza with extra garlic, delicious!
