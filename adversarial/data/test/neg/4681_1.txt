I made an appointment for my daughters at 9am on May 1st 2017. We arrived at 9am and the doors were locked, lights off. I made an appointment at this place because it had good ratings.  We waited for 30 minutes then we left. We called at 10 am and the girl who answered said that she just got there...really?! My daughter asked her why someone wasn't there for our 9 o'clock appointments.  THE GIRL HUNG UP ON HER! Extremely unprofessional. I DO NOT recommend this place to ANYONE!!!!!
