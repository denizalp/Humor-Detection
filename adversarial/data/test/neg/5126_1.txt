Customer Service is at an all time low at this place, they could care less about their customers! If you have to call and place an order..... good luck the guy on the phone can't be bothered and will basically tell you he has no time.\n\nSo order arrived over an hour later, order was wrong and the guy confirmed on the phone that he got it. I actually called him back to make sure. I ordered fried chicken and it as nothing but fat and skin.
