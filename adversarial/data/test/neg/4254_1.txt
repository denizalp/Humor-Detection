I love this place for its white, clean, and chic looking decors. If a penthouse had a modern bar I wouldn't be surprised that it looked like a duplicate of Baldwin Barmacie. The service was decent but it was missing that extra touch of personality to it like a \"can I help you?\" It also, at that time, was missing a certain vibe that's usually present in good bars. You know when the lights are really dim and the laughters are loud? Anyways onto the drinks, I didn't seem to spot a lot of homemade bitters\/ingredients, if any at all. The cocktails were missing that extra oomph conveying the message that this drink belonged to this place and that you can only find it at Barmacie Baldwin. Don't get me wrong, this place isn't bad but it could have been a lot more appealing if some of its charming decor transfered to the drinks.
