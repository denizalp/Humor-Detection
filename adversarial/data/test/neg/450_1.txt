My party of 3 came right at 11AM, the opening time and was seated immediately. Honestly had we came 15 mins later we would've had to wait in line. The line this morning wasn't too bad, maybe because it's Saturday so no brunch menu and the weather was so chilly. Yes, much to my dismay brunch is only offered on Sundays (goodbye egg Benny's and french toast). However, they do offer their excellent mains, i.e. chicken waffles, and breakfast menu every single day.\n\nFood- 3\/5. I think I'm getting pickier with brunch foods. Normally I would've rated the food here at least 4\/5, but after having brunch at Insomnia just a block east and getting into a healthier craze lately, I could only give 3 stars. I'm disappointed with the scarcity of vegetarian and vegan friendly options here. WBK is a cozier, less franchised version of American comfort food, like Denny's. So, lots of meat, waffles, fried potatoes, and grease. Interestingly there's not a lot of egg breakfast options and definitely no seafood. For a pescatarian this was devastating.\n\nI ordered their only vegan main - the vegetable curry, which contained raisins, onion, tomatoes, celery, big almonds, etc and came with loose rice and a papadum. Flavor-wise, it was delicious! Not spicy at all and not super strongly seasoned as ethnic curries can be, but very nourishing and vegetable-heavy, which is amazing inside this establishment of greasy bacon and fries. \n\nMy friends ordered the classic breakfast platter of 4 choices and the chicken and waffles, which comes with one sauce of choice (+$2 for extra sauces), which was gigantic and according to them the chicken was perfectly fried. The fried potato slices in the breakfast platter was such a perfect balance between crispy and chewy - highly recommend! Her fried eggs were really greasy though and the salad greens were really boring, literally just leaves and dressing.\n\nSad, limited dessert options. Come here for the savory and oily, not for sweets.\n\nValue- 3.5\/5. Moderately pricy for breakfast with entrees around $15-20, but big portions.\n\nService- 4\/5. Very nice servers, but food took 20 minutes to come... So slow!\n\nLast tip: reservations for brunch is not accepted, so come early and expect a wait.
