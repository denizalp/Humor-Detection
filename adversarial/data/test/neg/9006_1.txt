Love the food here. It's really nice to be able to have a great gluten free spot that other people who aren't gluten free still think is tasty. In addition to gluten free, I'm also dairy free and the servers are pretty informed about my options\/ways to modify things, and if they don't know for sure they always ask.\n\nOne star off because I don't really like the physical location....very crowded, seats are not very comfortable for someone with back\/neck problems like me unless you luck out and get a half booth, and it does not ever seem very clean to me.
