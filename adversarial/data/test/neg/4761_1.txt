As soon as you enter you are greeted with a friendly receptionist\/ hostess that immediately gets your mind ready for a great experience! But once you step over to the Sushi bar the quality immediately drops. From the dried out rice, to the limited options of sushi selection. Maybe it is a different atmosphere and variety during the weekday but at 4:30pm on a Saturday it was a waste of money. \n\nOn a positive nite a couple next to me order the hot pot and it look nice, wish I had order it!
