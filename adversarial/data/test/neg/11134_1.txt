Service is pretty good and the burgers are simple and delicious. If you're expecting a fast and cheap burger this is not your spot.  It's got a good vibe, but you have to wait.\n\nElk and blue cheese were amazing but so are your simple classic beef, lettuce and tomato cheeseburgers. The best part is there is so much variety in more exotic and gamey meats too.
