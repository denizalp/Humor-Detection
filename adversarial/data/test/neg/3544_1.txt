Our dog was in critical condition when we brought her to the emergency clinic. We believe their fast response and excellent care saved our dogs life.  They were very thoughtful about explaining the options and costs of our dogs care which seemed very fair considering all that our dog needed.  We are recommending first pet emergency to our friends and will take our dog there every time.
