Too bad Yelp doesn't allow you to give no stars, because this garbage of a place should get zero stars. This place is horrible. Not only is the service terrible, but they overcharge for EVERYTHING!!. They even charge you for water....now this isn't like Fiji or Evian or hell even Aquafina type water, they charge you for regular tap water they probably got out of the toilet!! I'm sorry to say but I'm glad this place closed. Serves them right!!
