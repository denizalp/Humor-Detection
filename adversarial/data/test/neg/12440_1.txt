Huge, truly huge portions. The best coleslaw I've ever had. Perfect fries and fish that come straight from the fryer to your table. And the staff are friendly and truly courteous (which is harder to find these days). A nice range of customers: older folk, hipsters and families with little  ones. Highly recommended!
