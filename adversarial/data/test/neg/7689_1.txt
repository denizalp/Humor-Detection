BEST LAUNDRY MAT AROUND. You'll never have to use quarters again. Everything is done with a little swipe card. It's affordable, clean and the best thing is that it has WiFi for your children to keep busy if you have little ones. They have a couple of vending machines which contain soda, snacks and small portions of detergents. There are chairs for seating if you are waiting or tables and carts for folding and moving. This place is pretty awesome if you need to wash a whole months worth of clothes or just a small load.
