I work in Special Events in Las Vegas and go through different vendors all the time. I hired LV Photo party for a Convention after party at one of the nightclubs on the strip and it was the highlight of the party. Their professionalism of the staff was great and the staff that was on site to work the event were so great with our customers. We now have them as our preferred photo booth rental for our company and I would highly recommend them for any corporate, birthday, convention and pretty much anything. The custom theme backdrops and props were great and everyone kept coming up to me and telling me how much fun they were having. Thank you LV Photo party for making the party a success and I will be booking you again soon.
