Cheap beer in a ton of hot dogs I guess you can go wrong with the combination but be ready to hang out with a bunch of hipsters... I like the place cuz I was driving by and I was hungry and decided to pull in and give it a shot overall it's an OK place, would I go back perhaps but will I highly recommend it probably not.. but then of course I'm not into being a hipster myself so that makes a big difference; being more of a clean-cut guy, i might decide to go back if I was in the mood for some cheap PBR and a good dog!
