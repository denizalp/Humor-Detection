This organization gets no stars from me at all.  The order was originally supposed to be delivered on 1\/9\/17 and it is now 1\/17\/17 and it has again been changed to delivery on 1\/18\/17.  I won't hold out hope that this will ever arrive.  Question their honesty and ethics.  \n\nInterestingly,  I have since ordered packages that were delivered through USPS and UPS.  Run these idiots out of town.
