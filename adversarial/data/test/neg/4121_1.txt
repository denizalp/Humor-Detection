This was my first time visiting Cantina since they moved and I enjoyed it. The decor was nice. I had the El Vaquero quesadilla to eat and it was pretty good. I also had a margarita and maybe I should have ordered top shelf (or no ice) because I didn't really feel like I was drinking alcohol. It does seems like they are a little onion heavy because there were onions in the queso (a first for me but kinda good) and I had a great deal of onions in my quesadilla so be mindful of that.
