The Partovis have completely revolutionized my dental experience.  I used to dread going to the dentist after some botched orthodontics and some very \"corporate\"-feeling dental office experiences.  Now, the warm atmosphere and personal touch at Desert Smiles have evaporated my fear.  I actually look forward to going, (imagine that!), and I drive across town to see them as a testament.  I can't recommend them highly enough.  They are truly a credit to the profession.
