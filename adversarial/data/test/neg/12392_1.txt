Arcade games, billiards, babyfoot, 5 and 10 pin bowling. Rose Bowl brings you back to the days of your youth when all you wanted to do was go bowling to celebrate your birthday. Ah, bring on the nostalgia. This place is gigantic and has 72 lanes. Yes, you read that right: 72 freaking lanes (36 for 10 pin and 36 for 5 pin bowling).\n\nPrices are reasonable enough. Depends on how many people you come with. You go to the counter to get your lane set up; service is slow but the guys were nice.\n\nYou can get a lane by the hour (for up to 6 people max). We went with the 3 hour option ($55.00). Shoe rentals also cost $2.17.\n\nOld school pixelated monitors, vintage lanes, what else do you want? We had a great time and were able to whip out 5 games in our allotted time slot. It would be cool if you could switch between 5 and 10 pin, but we stuck with the latter. There were a lot of families and groups of friends when we went.\n\nThere's six other locations around (who knew?) the city so plenty of options to get your bowl on.
