So disappointed. I had been anxiously awaiting the opening of the new Canter's in Tivoli Village like so many of my neighbors. I was craving a bowl of chicken soup and felt so lucky that Canter's had just opened near me. I called to place an order to go and was informed that I needed to go in person to place such an order. So even though I was under the weather I ventured over only to discover that they didn't have any chicken soup. Couldn't the lady on the phone have told me that? \nI looked for something else on the menu that appealed to me that they had available (limited menu apparently) and I selected a chopped salad with chicken for $12.95. The menu listed ingredients including chicken even though under the listing it said \"added chicken $14.95\". I asked the cashier for the chicken on my salad and she informed me that I didn't need to pay the extra $2.00 unless I wanted an extra helping of chicken. I said \"Thanks, but a standard portion would be fine\"\nI paid for it and waited a pretty long time until it was ready. As I was waiting I was asked by the numerous help staff if I needed anything. I said that I was just waiting for my order and one of the ladies went to the kitchen to expedite the process. I got my bag, went home, opened it and Surprise! No chicken. Not only was there not any chicken on my \"salad\" but it consisted of a soggy premixed variety of lettuces and very few other vegetables or goodies added to it. I don't normally do this but I called to complain about my  experience. The staff graciously offered me my money back and asked me for my receipt number. I gave it to them last week and I still do not see a refund posted to my credit card. I don't think I will be back until they get the kinks worked out. I hope that will be soon.
