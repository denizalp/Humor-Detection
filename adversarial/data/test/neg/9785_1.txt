Okay, I'll admit it's a bit overpriced for what it is.  HOWEVER...it's cheaper than a lot of other places you could eat on the strip for pretty damn good noodles.\n\nThe thing to get here is the Szechuan beef noodle soup.  For some unknown stupid reason I decided to try something different and get the Spicy Ying Nan noodles (since the waiter recommended it and I knew I could steal a taste of the beef noodles from my husband's bowl).  The broth for the spicy noodles was tasty, but I much prefer the noodles in the beef noodle soup.  We also had an order of the shrimp shumai which was also excellent.\n\nDefinitely a must-try in Vegas!  Dress casually; it's a casual dining restaurant in the Venetian (over by the sports betting).
