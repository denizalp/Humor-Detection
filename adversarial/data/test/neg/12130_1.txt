I love this buffet & visit very often as a local. One of my favorites. I receive coupons usually every month & it has been much appreciated! They have one of the biggest selections of most of the buffets I've been to & very tasty too. Their prices are very reasonable & their special dinner nights have been really good. I especially enjoyed the Thursday Steak & Scampi night. I just found out their menu has changed & no longer have my favorite Steak & Scampi night.  Though I'm not to happy about it, i know i should enjoy whatever they changed it to. I will be sure to let everyone know the outcome. Well, tonight is BBQ night, used to be T-Bone night & about to go to check it out. Wishing for the best!
