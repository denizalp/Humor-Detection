I'm putting the facts right up front so anyone looking for a breakfast spot for a group of 7 will know exactly what I needed to know when I considered the Dor-Stop for a Friday, 9 a.m. breakfast:  It's small and space is pretty limited, but the staff was very accommodating and pulled a two-top table up to a booth so we could all sit together.  No reservations allowed, but we called ahead to make sure they could accommodate us (i.e.  how long a wait?) and were seated within just a few minutes.  Our server was happy to serve a group, service was quick.  Kids welcome, there's a kid's menu.   No one rushed us out, but we noticed several folks waiting as we were wrapping up so we didn't linger at our table.  (Yelpers are nice that way!)  Parking is street only, at a meter, but no trouble finding a spot.  The food was great:  Raspberry French toast with a whipped cream raspberry topping, pancakes, cinnamon rolls and eggs of all kinds. Basically something to satisfy everyone. It's a well-reviewed restaurant, as their website attests, including being featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.  It's a bright, clean spot located in the metro area of Pittsburgh called Dormont, hence the name:  Dor-Stop (I'm guessing) as opposed to Door Stop (which makes no sense). A visit to this truly local diner has the added bonus of taking you to a nice little area of town with a distinctly different vibe.
