False Advertisement For Gluten Free!!!!!!! When on a trip to Victoria I was incredibly disappointed in my families experience at Cora.   After my family placed their order the server came back and said I should not eat what I ordered if I had an allergy.  They have 3 items on their gluten sensitivity section, but all our cooked on same surfaces and come in contact with flour, per my server.  Which means this is not a gluten free option, unless you eat GF as a lifestyle, don't eat here!!!!!!   Even if you have a sensitivity, this is not acceptable.  I was offered the option to order a bowl of fruit.  No offer to accommodate!  My children were hungry, and so I got to sit an watch my family eat there meal. A manager didn't even come over.  Awful service!!!!!
