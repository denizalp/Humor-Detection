I was pleased to see that Browns has been rethinking their merchandising strategy since my last visit here. There was a brief time period where it seemed that they were starting to phase out certain designers in favour of Browns brand footwear. This was such a bad decision and I'm really glad to see that they've started bringing back better selection. When I think of Browns, I picture it as one of the higher end shoe stores in Southcentre. Browns brand shoes are not high-end. They're just ick.\n\nThe service at this store is attentive, albeit a little pushy. I know you're on commission but you don't have to remind me over and over that I can bring them home to try them out. I've bought shoes before thanks.
