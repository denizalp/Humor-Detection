My review will be titled \"Nobody cares in Chambana.\"\n\nI appreciate the occasional attempts at real Neopolitan wood oven pizza. \n\nBut the owner is never here supervising the staff. \n\nThe salads are sometimes great (tonight, for example), but often NOT. \n\nThe pizza tonight is almost inedible. \n\nEither they changed the dough, or the oven is 400Â° too cold. \n\nAs a result, the doughy mealy crust is unacceptable, not the blistered charred crust real wood oven pizza deserves. \n\nAnd nobody cares or notices. Blank stares responded to my questions as to whether the dough, the flour, or the oven has changed. \n\nPerhaps good enough to continue in Chambana, with its dearth of good food, but not worthy of patronage.\n\nAt least other local places are true to their style.
