This is why I wait to review. The VA dentist told me that he would work with me once my va stuff was approved. The front office who is just fabulous (insert sarcasm) interrupt me while I'm telling them my issue and that the dentist told me he would work with me since I'm moving out of state. I wouldn't believe anything that comes out of their mouth. Thanks for nothing summerhills dental!!! I've spoke with the VA at Pecos and let them know :) Summerhill dental will get irritated if you explain a situation, they interrupt you, and you call the lady by ma'am.. It's quite interesting!
