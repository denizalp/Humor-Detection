Lemme tell you... I've never ever ever had a chicken tender I never liked.  Till now. I'm not sure what was wrong with it, but it just tasted disgusting. I only ate 1. The girl came & asked if I wanted a box, of course I said.. No. She was like \"are you sure??? It's so good??\" Didn't have the heart to tell her it's disgusting. The chicken inside of the breading was like mush. Didn't look like chicken. & its was maybe room temp. \n\nIt got 3 stars because... The rolls were delicious! Fresh baked and yummy. We were seated quickly but it took over 30 min to get our food. That is ridiculous. My boyfriend liked his ribs, he had no complains. But if it were just me, I'd give 1 star... I wasted my money on the chicken. :(
