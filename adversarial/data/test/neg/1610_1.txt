I'm a huge fan of Via Delosantos, and not only because it's about a 5 minute walk from my house. Their house margaritas are only $3. Are they the best margaritas you'll ever have? Probably not. They're a little sweet and made with a mix. But will they get you drunk? You're damn right they will. And for the price, you really can't beat that. They make it easy for you if you want to turn any of their 50+ nicer tequilas into a margarita: just add $2 to the shot price. \n\nAs for the food, I've never been disappointed. Some things are better than others though. Their Pollo Fundido is truly the best in town. I've never had a better tamale, and they have red and green sauces. I believe the red is vegetarian friendly, so when I had my veggie friend visiting, she was happy to have an authentic tamale to try. My husband and I mixed it up last time we went and split the Super Mexican Pizza, which was surprisingly good. It was on a huge tortilla and had machaca beef, tomatoes, green onions and black olives. Ask for a side of sour cream and you'll be in heaven. One mexican pizza, a margartia, a Dos Equis and tip= $25. Not bad for a night out for two, and we even had a few pieces leftover. Personally, I didn't care for their guacamole. It just seemed like mashed up avocado to me, no especially interesting additions, so that's the one thing I'd steer clear of. \n\nI don't personally know what \"real\" Mexican food is...I've never been to Mexico. All I know is my husband and I have been told by several people from Mexico that we're lucky to live by one of the best authentic places in Phoenix. So take that as you will.\n\nThe place is a little run down, but to me that's part of the charm. I love sitting in the little back room, it has a more personal feel. They get pretty busy around dinnertime on the weekends, but the wait never seems to be more than 10-15 minutes. Fair warning: They close at 9:30, even on Saturdays, which is pretty annoying. I thought the hours listed here couldn't possibly be right, but I called and confirmed.
