Went there last night . Gitta and Marget are friendly and talented. I got a wrap (sorry, forgot the name) with chicken , hummus, cucumber, sun-dried tomatoes etc, and it was great. Diane had a ham and cheese on the crusty roll and she loved it. I couldn't pass up the gazpacho, which was fresh and flavorful. I know nothing about wine, but it appears like they have a nice selection.\nI wish the menu was larger but that may come with time. They really cleaned the place up. Avon Lake needs a place like this.
