I am a winter AZ resident and have had Botox and fillers for years.  I was referred to Emily by my hairdresser and could not be happier!!  Emily has a true gift in her ability to enhance in a extremely natural way.  She also performed some procedures for my first time, but certainly not the last.  My only regret is that my expectations cannot be met at my home location, and I must wait until late in the year to return.  My entire experience was wonderful.
