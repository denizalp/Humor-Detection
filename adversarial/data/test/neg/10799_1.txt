Bass Pro Shop is attached to the Silverton Casino in Las Vegas. This shop is amazing! It has multiple wildlife displays. We loved looking at the waterfall with koi and sturgeon. There was another large sturgeon in a tank with large aquatic fish. There was a lovely natural habitat tank with lovely trout. There was also a second waterfall we saw. They also have a shooting range with taxidermy animals. I also loved they had a BIG BUCK HUNTER arcade game which is a favorite for my son and me. \n\nIf you are looking for a free attraction to visit, go to the Bass Pro Shop. It is also right next to the Silverton Aquarium where they have live stingray feedings and Mermaid shows.
