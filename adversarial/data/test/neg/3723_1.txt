I've tried a million AYCE places in the GTA. Sakura is about average. Absolutely nothing stood out. They didn't have any unique dishes. Dinner AYCE selection is standard, with slightly more kitchen items. Their prices are on point. The quality is about the same as other places. No bad incidents on my visit. Service is about what you'd expect from any other AYCE place.\n\nI'd come again if I happen to be in the area and crave AYCE sushi. But I wouldn't go out of my way for this place.
