This place is so cute! Very tiny but very cozy. I got the chicken bowl and everything is prepared right in front of you. The lady and gentleman behind the counter were exceptional! They were so friendly and asked if we needed any samples. The chicken bowl was fantastic minus the meat being a little overcooked. Their spices were to die for and their jalapeno sauce was excellent but very spicy! My dad got the steak bowl and his steak was perfectly cooked.
