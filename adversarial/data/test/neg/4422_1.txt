The food here is delicious!  I had the veggie enchiladas, and they were second to none!  Pasqual's also has a back patio that overlooks a small water area, which is a very nice place to sit.  They also have some great happy hour specials, like $2 Coronas.  My only complaint is that the menu is somewhat limited.  For example, they do not offer chile rellenos, which I happen to love.  Overall, though, I would highly recommend eating here!
