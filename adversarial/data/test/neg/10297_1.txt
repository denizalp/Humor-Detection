This place is huge. I mean ginormous. I mean you can get exercise walking from end-to-end while you wait for your movie to start that is if you came in a little early. We did and put in a couple of thousand steps on the old Fitbit without even blinking. The snack bar it's like a small fast food restaurant so many options so much popcorn so many hot dogs so much candy Lookout it may be more then just an impulse purchase it could be several inches on the waistline. Don't weigh yourself after you eat and have a movie here. The screens were wonderful the sound was excellent the parking was like a sea of asphalt that went on and on and on. All in all a good movie experience. See you there next time I'm in the area
