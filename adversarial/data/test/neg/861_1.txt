I've been going to Nate's for ahem, decades. Now bring my three children along with me. Husband and I get hummus, grape leaves, and shish tawook sandwiches; the same thing EVERY SINGLE TIME. The waitresses know not to bring us menus since we don't need them. Daughter just branched out and ordered the sharwma sandwich, (sp?), and that may be her new favorite. Had the fattoush salad too, and loved the freshness of it, just can't order everything as much as I'd like to do so. A reviewer called Nate's \"average.\" Yelp Readers; it is so beyond average. Beats Aladdins all to heck. I keep a large container of their garlic mayo in my fridge. Most items are made in house; love the homemade yogurt that comes with the grape leaves. Fast service, very fresh food, reasonable prices. Cannot beat Nate's!
