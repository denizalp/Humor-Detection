This really is as good as it gets. The shrimp taco is amazing. Size is perfect so you can have two or three tacos and share some guacamole.  There is a super nice girl that works there and she is great about letting you try some some samples of their Aqua Fresco until you find the one you like the best.  We love this place and haven't found a better place for taco's in Scottsdale yet. Great food, great service, great atmosphere. I would give them 6 stars.
