This place has good Thai food at a good price. I have eaten here several times and the staff is always attentive and friendly. You don't have to wait long for your food either, the kitchen is speedy! My personal favorite is the drunken noodles and I also like the pad thai. I love that you can choose your own spice level on every dish too.
