Hubby and I went there for a late night bottle of wine and possibly a snack. We walked in sat down and despite being close to the waitress station were ignored. There weren't that many people in the restaurant or patio on that night either.\n\nWe got our bottle of wine and asked to keep the menu to look at the appetizers in-case we decided on a snack - we told this to our waitress. When we did decide on a snack we waited to see if anyone would come to our corner of the room to catch their attention or maybe check on us. No one came until we were almost half done with our wine which was at least thirty minutes if not more. \n\nWe frequent the downtown and 7th Street restaurants quite a bit and with all the choices we have for late night snacks and wine we have not been back since.
