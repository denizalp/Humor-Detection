Amazing, cute morning cafe\/ evening bistro. You wouldn't think it was as nice a place from the parking lot, but when you walk into the outdoor sitting area its like entering a new place. I greatly adored the garden type outdoor seating and fountain. It was also nice that they allowed pets, its not often I get to go out to eat with my small dog.\n\nIn the evening I would recommend getting the bruchetta board, I've tried all the types and they're all very tasty.\n\nIt's one of my main places to go in Phoenix. I would definitely recommend going!
