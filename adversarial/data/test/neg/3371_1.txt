I love this place!  The prices are pretty good, especially considering how large the rotis are.  My personal favourite is the mixed vegetable roti in medium spicy.  I usually eat half or three-quarters of it and take the rest home.  The man who works there (possibly the owner) is also lovely and takes great pride in the place.
