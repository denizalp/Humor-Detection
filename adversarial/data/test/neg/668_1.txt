It's about time we get a good nail salon in the Gainey Ranch\/McCormick area!!!! Yesterday was my third time back to this salon for a gel manicure and gel pedicure. The salon itself is gorgeous and very relaxing!! You can tell the owner and management take great pride in their new business. I am extremely particular about my nails like many of us girls are and I was lucky enough to be matched up with Olivia when I let them know. Olivia is very sweet, professional and best of all she has gotten my shape and gel perfect every time (which never happens when I try a new place!)!!
