This place is ALWAYS busy, so I figured the food must be good. It turns out it is! VEGANS are welcome and the staff and chefs were very accommodating to my diet. I had the veggie skillet minus the eggs and cheese that originally comes with the dish as well as sourdough bread instead of the English muffin. Tasty and filling!
