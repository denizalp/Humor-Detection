This place is very nice, I come here once a week for a YouTube meet up and hang out. The staff is super sweet and they have really great recommendations if you don't know what to order which I didn't, i ended up getting a turkey sausage and egg on an Asiago bagel which she recommended which was delicious! Also if you sign up for their rewards program they send amazing coupons for example I had a buy 1 get 1 so I gave a sandwich to a friend that day as well and also got the molten lava cookie which was also good but could be better if warmed up in my personal opinion but it was all under $10 with the coupon! The only reason this doesn't have 5 stars is because it is absolutely freezing in there and it's not just me saying it a lot of people bring jackets and I had to leave early because my service dog was shivering otherwise great place.
