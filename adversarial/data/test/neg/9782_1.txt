My brother went to another location and was absolutely in love with it.  He wanted to take me, so we came to the Chandler location.  While he seemed pleased with his food, I was rather disappointed.\nFirst, it wasn't hot.  At best, mildly warm, which was pathetic because it was ready pretty quickly.  Second, I ordered the egg foo yung vegitarian, but what i received was a sloppy burnt mess loaded with pork (and there's another problem, it was burnt yet not hot).  And lastly, my chile relleno quesadilla was overrun with greasy cheese, almost unbearable.  \nMy first trip here wasn't good, but there are other locations, and this is not that spot that my brother raved about.  There are other items on the menu that i'd like to try, so I might just give it another shot.
