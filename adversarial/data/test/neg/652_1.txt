Top notch service, gorgeous decor and delicious food!\n\nMy husband and I came here on MLK Day for lunch and had the bulgogi lunch special. I had beef and he had chicken. The meat was so tender and flavorful. \n\nWe also ordered fried meat dumplings. The meat was so good. Wow.\n\nWe want to come back and try some of the tang offerings!
