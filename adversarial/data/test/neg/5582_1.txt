Not impressed. I recently moved into the area and I was looking for a good nail salon to frequent for my pedicures. I was there a week ago today and my toes look like I did them myself. When I walked out of the salon I was happy with my service as in the tech was friendly and it seemed he did well. I noticed two days later that on one toe the polish was starting to peel so I put top coat on the polish to hold it down. Well that didn't work. One week later the polish is not shiny whatsoever and I have two toes with missing polish. The pedicure chairs are really cute but that isn't why I get my toes done. Price wise I would say they are comparable to other places in the area. When I get a pedicure I expect it to last more then a week so I was really disappointed when two days in I had polish on one toe peel. I wish this was the nail salon for me but it's not so on to searching the area for something better.
