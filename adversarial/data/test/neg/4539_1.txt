We needed to replace our Living and dining room carpet due to a water leak. We checked ratings on Yelp and a few other places. Larry is great. He was always available and very professional. His installers were also very friendly and professional. They did an excellent job.\nWe are very pleased with our new carpet. When I need carpet or flooring in the future, I will definitely call AZ Floor Company.
