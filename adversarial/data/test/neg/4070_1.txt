Delicious, tucked away place that has super tasty breakfast. I love breakfast sandwiches. Try the monte! It has turkey, bacon, French toast, havarti cheese, and a super tasty spicy marmalade spread. This place is non-pretentious. You can come here in sweats or looking cute and you'll fit in. Don't be afraid of the neighborhood... It's not scary but not upscale. You are also right by downtown Chandler, which is really cute!
