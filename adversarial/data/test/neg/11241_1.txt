Bilateral Mastectomy - February 2018\nDr. Terence Banich of 'General Surgery Associates' was my surgeon and I feel fortunate that he performed this procedure.  Dr. Banich is a brilliant man, very personable, kind and highly skilled with a smooth, laid back style.  He wears many hats ... and he wears each one exceptionally well! ... The surgery was successful with an easy, fast recovery, absolutely no pain and thoughtful aftercare.  His office staff is pleasant, efficient and accommodating. ... And now, all is well. ... I am very grateful to Dr. Banich for guiding me through the overwhelming medical haze of my storm.  He is a true, natural healer on many levels and a genuine medicine man. ... He saves lives.
