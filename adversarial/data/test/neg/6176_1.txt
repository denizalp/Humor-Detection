I was distracted when i made my order, so I wound up getting an andouille sausage sandwich: it was smoked nicely, but I will admit I could have ordered better. When I actually had a chance to read the menu in full I could have identified 20 meals I'd rather have had, all of which looked quite good. So my main advice is: Check out the menu online before you arrive and know what you want. It's a popular place and the menu is long and detailed!
