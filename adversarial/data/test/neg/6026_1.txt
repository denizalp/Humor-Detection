Going to start off by mentioning that I will go to nobody other than Zachary Venezia if I have any questions at all pertaining to healthcare. He is extremely professional and truly cares about his customers. I had specific inquiries when it came to Medicare and healthcare and Zachary was there every step of the way. He even came to my location to meet up with me to discuss any questions I had! Although I am taking more time to decide which route I want to go, I know for a fact I will go through him to sign up. Keep in mind, he makes appointments with his customers and works around their schedules. This is very convenient and I highly recommend him.
