We used Umbrella movers just to pack a truck, that we are driving ourselves out of state.\nThey were the most professional guys.  They wrapped all the furniture in saran wrap before moving it to the truck.  i had no idea that they do that.  They did a wonderful job of packing a 4 bedroom big house into a 26 foot truck.\n\nI would absolutely recommend them for any job you need.\n\nThank you Umbrella Movers.
