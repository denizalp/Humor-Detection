i ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEhotel.\n\nthe staff is amazing.  its tucked away from all the tourists and kids, its a hip grown up hotel.  i believe its all suites so you get a huge flatscreen in the living room area with a sofa, office table and fridge.  i'm surprised all the goodies in the fridge\/snack area were reasonably priced.  \n\nthere's robes in the bedroom!  they were so soft!  i wanted to take them home but the price tag was pretty hefty lol  the bathroom has a flatscreen, hello!  i love the glass doors on the shower, so sexy.\n\ndefinately a place you want to stay if you want to live it up for a day or a few days.  we stayed here when i took a new job and it was so refreshing to hang out with my siblings.  if memory serves correct, there's a shopping area inside mandalay bay that has urban outfitters.  i also believe there's a tram that will take you to other hotels.
