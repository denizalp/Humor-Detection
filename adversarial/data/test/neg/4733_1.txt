Great ambiance and food. Everything we had was delicious and wonderfully presented! The owners made it a deal to stop by and check in on our experience! Thank you for the amazing time! The bruschetta is super delicious. Be sure to try it! The entire experience was something nice for us to take back with us to Los Angeles.
