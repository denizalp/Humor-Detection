I went to Ulta today - I waited for about 15 minutes before a more disgruntled customer called for another cashier to open up. Total time about 20 minutes or more!  Are you kidding me that there were at least 10 people and only one person serving. When we asked for another person to come up - your employee came up with a sassy comment \"Someone didn't show up today\" - what does that mean - that it's ok to keep us all waiting? Get with the program and serve your customers in a timeous manner - there are a whole lot more stores with exactly the same product!!! And train your employees to say the right thing as it's not ok to say what he said!!!! By the way this is not the first time I've had to wait - it seems that what you do at Ulta!!
