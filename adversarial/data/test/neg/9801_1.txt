I would recommend Charlotte Chiropractic Center to everyone I know. I came upon the practice via a Groupon, but will be returning even after using it. I hadn't been to a chiropractor in almost 2 years, and was having some back pain & leg numbness and figured it would be worth a shot to get adjusted. I've never had a doctor be SO thorough and take his time, as Dr. Waltz did. He truly cares about every patient, and takes the time to understand their problems, as well as thoroughly explain each step in his process of the appointment. I could hear the results popping from my first adjustment, and know with each coming visit it will just get better!
