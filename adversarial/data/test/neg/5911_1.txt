Breakdown:\nSuper busy\nGood service\nGood location\n\nThis was my only In-n-Out Burger experience, but thought I'd give it a second go around for the vacation. The service was very friendly, and accommodating. The place is very clean but seating is hard to find. This place gets quite busy because of its great location, so I suggest taking it to go! The food was okay.
