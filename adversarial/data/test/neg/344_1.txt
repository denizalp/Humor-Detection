Howard assisted my husband and I find the perfect home when we moved to Arizona.  He was professional, courteous and was able to help us find exactly what we were looking for in a home.  He  had so much information on the area which made the transition to a new city so easy.   Thank you for all your help!  It was a breeze from start to finish.
