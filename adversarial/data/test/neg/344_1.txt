I worked here one summer in college, so I can be a little bias.  They use all fresh ingredients and don't add any grease.  The food is fantastic because of the fresh delicious ingredients.  \n\nThe previous pizza maker was the best, but he moved on to pursue other dreams.  I've been back since, and it's still solid and delicious! I would call it the second best pizza in town.\n\nTheir Valentino salad w\/ chicken is also amazing.  I still crave it.  They make their own salad dressing, and it's wonderful.
