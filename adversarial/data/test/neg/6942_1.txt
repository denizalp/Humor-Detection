My brand new 2016 Honda was disgustingly filthy when I drove here from the Bay Area. I needed to get all of the bugs and gunk out of the grill and off of the windshield. I looked on Yelp and found this hand car wash with decent reviews and reasonable prices so I decided to check it out. The people were very friendly and directed me to where I needed to be. I just got the basic wash and cleaning of the rims for 13.99 because I will be headed back through the gauntlet of bugs dust and grit in a couple days.  Mind you, it was about 110 degrees outside. The young lady who took our order was pleasant and patient as she answered my Queen's questions regarding the different types of car washes they offered.  Then wel went around to where the car was and a brother asked if it was my first time there and assured me that they would take care of everything.  Ultimately my car was sparkling and me and the Queen were very pleased with the professionalism and friendliness of the whole experience. We highly recommend Alamo and we definitely will be back when in Vegas.\n\nHashim
