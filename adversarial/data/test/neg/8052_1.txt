Came for brunch with my in-laws, happy to see it was a \"true brunch spot\" , and where the locals come to nosh (no drunken bachelorettes here as far as I can tell) our waitress Dominique was very good, offering advice on the menu and a pleasant demeanor. Summerlin is a bit far from home base, but the excellent service and the good food ensured we will return soon.\nI had the monkey bread, and then a shot of insulin after and a root canal (so sweet, soooo good) and the Weekend Fertatta which was a bit bland but palpable nonetheless. The ladies enjoyed the billoxi chicken sandwiches and gramps had the Nutella french toast.
