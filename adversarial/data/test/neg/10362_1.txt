Thank you Air Works for the great service. My AC unit was shot and the vendor my home warranty was out to rip us off. The first person that came out to my house misdiagnosed the problem and was very unprofessional, it took them 3 days to come out to the house in the middle of the summer. They came and looked at my unit and said \"it's old , the compressor is broken you should replace it.\" Charged us 75 bucks without even opening the unit. I didn't have a great feeling about it so I called Air Works and Rey had no problem looking at my unit that same day. He said that it was actually the motor that needs to be changed and that I don't need a new unit. Because of his honesty I decided to just have Rey replace that whole unit and he gave me a great quote. He installed the new unit within a few hours and my house is cool again. They definitely earned my business moving forward and I cancelled my home warranty so I don't have to deal with anyone else. Thank you Rey!
