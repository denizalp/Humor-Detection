I love going to this shop every time I'm in Champaign, which is several times a month, and it's the source of nearly all the dark chocolate I eat.  They have products in all categories that I've never heard of, and I love trying a new tea or soup mix now and then.  The chocolate bars and candies selection is awesome, and if you're lucky, there will be some almost or just expired on the sale table at delicious prices.  If you like gourmet dry mixes, (soup, dip, rubs, scones etc) they have a large selection.  As for coffee - I love their selection, and the fact that you can buy as much or as little as you want with the bag it yourself system, and they will grind it for you to the fineness you request.  There is always some coffee brewed and on hand for samples, tho keep in mind you can't purchase a cup, you have to go to the next block for a real, whole cup of coffee.\n\nIf you like imports, there are quite a few - Italian candies, honey, European goods, dozens of tea and coffee accessories, kitchen items.\n\nMill V left a really bad review which I'd like to partially validate, though I entirely disagree with the 1 star rate.  This shop has fresh tea, and it has stale tea.  ALWAYS check the dates on a box of consumables when shopping anywhere!, and avoid teas and other herbs that are sold in clear glass jars.  This shop does have a sale table for the out of date foods and teas with awesome sale prices which I often take advantage of, but not for the tea which really shouldn't be kept past expiry. Personally, I shop online for truly fresh and awesome green teas, tho I do occasionally get a box or canister of something at Walnut St if I've never heard of it.
