I called this flower shop because its near where I wanted the flowers delivered. The girl helped me decide what to select for my arrangement. We determined the specific delivery instructions and the next day we had some hiccups about delivery but they went above and beyond to get the arrangement delivered. The arrangement was lost the first time but they made a new one the same day free of charge to insure that the person I was sending them to would receive what I paid for :)
