So sorry I did business with this dealership.  But I am stuck with them until I pay off my car which is really ridiculous that I still owe 9000 on a car that is only worth 2000 blue book.  I am paying through the nose on this 2005 chevy uplander.  all in all car is fine with minor dings and could use a major tune up.
