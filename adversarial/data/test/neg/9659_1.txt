The decor is awesome and the service was good, but the place was two or three bucks overpriced on every item and I thought the food was nothing special.  The eggs and hash browns were super buttery, which is not my thing at all, and all the alcoholic drinks were at least $8 (and were pretty small).  Its not a bad place, it just did not live up to my expectations as to price or quality of food.
