I don't know why I waited so long to come here! This place is legit. Great customer service and amazing food. Will definitely be returning to try more on their menu. I had the medium size bowl of menudo.. It was almost as good as my dads home cook menudo. I also had a strawberry margarita mmmmm so good!! My new favorite Mexican restaurant!!
