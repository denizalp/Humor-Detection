I come here for lunch quite a bit since I work nearby, and I've sat in a few times for dinner, as well.\n\nTheir pasta is excellent. I prefer the taste of the food when I dine in, but maybe that's a given. Crummy take-out containers isn't really my thing.\n\nMy favorite pasta is the acritano, by far. Their chef's pasta is usually very good as well, but it costs a few more dollars and comes with a salad that I don't particular care for. It's not their fault, I just don't like salad.\n\nI'm not really a fan of their pizza (though I've only had one). I had the napoli (anchovies and capers) and it left me feeling pretty greasy and uncomfortable. I'm sure their other pizzas are good, but I like their pasta too much to bother trying them.\n\nThe lines at lunchtime are OK as long as you show up before 12:20pm or so. After that, it gets pretty crowded. From walking in through the front door to walking out with the food, expect to wait 5-10 minutes on a good day, up to 20 on a bad one. Relatively empty during dinner time.
