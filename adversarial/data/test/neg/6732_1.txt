We went without really researching the amenities so we were surprised that seats were assigned and we had to choose the second row on either the 4:15 or 5:00 movie in order to sit together. Oh well.  I was ready to sit with my neck laying straight back to see this movie.   Boy was I pleasantly surprised. The rows were so spacious.  I was of course just thinking leg room. But once we sat down and looked down the aisle, we noticed people were reclined.  I don't mean just a little.  They were freaking laying all the way back?   What?!  No neck cramps today?   It was a wonderful surprise and I can honestly say I didn't mind sitting on the second row. The screen was enormous with amazing clarity and colors.  I don't know if the seats vibrated or the sound was so loud the theatre vibrated but when Wonder Woman blew something up, I felt it!   I can't wait to go back!
