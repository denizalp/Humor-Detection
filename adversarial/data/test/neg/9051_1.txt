Very impressive menu of good Italian food.  I loved the stuffed pizza lunch special for $8.99 which included a drink.  Service is good and New York style pizza is the best.  Order before you come pick up or have delivered if you don't like the Commercial Center.  Lots of room and plenty of parking make this good for anytime of day or night when it's open.
