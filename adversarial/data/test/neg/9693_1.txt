Stopped in between flights and had a surprisingly good pizza. It was clearly made on the spot, and had piping hot fresh ingredients, and a nice balance of flavored, and a really good red sauce. (I got the S.O.P. - a sausage, Carmelized onion, and fresh mozzarella).\n\nThe downside is that they're applying the standard airport markup and it's a bit of a ripoff. Two beers (from a small, but quality selection of draughts) and a pizza were $42 with a standard tip. About 20% more than it's worth, but that's life in the terminal.\n\nI'd come here again if stuck in terminal c. Maybe try the burgers next time, which are more reasonably priced.
