Kevin came round to fix a leaking bath faucet. He was very prompt on replying to texts to schedule the service (could have done it the day after i texted him but opted for a week later) and he was punctual, friendly and fixed my tap no issues. also had a look at another leak and made a quick adjustment with his wrench which saved me a lot of hassle or another call out. i took his card and will use him again. 3% credit card charge which isnt an issue
