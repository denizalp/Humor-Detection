More of a 4.5 star. In a great location and drive by often. Decided to stop by for a nice birthday lunch date before running errands. Really clean and welcoming upon entry. Was seated right away in a booth along wall. There is a wide variety of drinks offered and will be back to try a few on a less scheduled day. The lunch menu is moderate in variety but dishes seem thought out and not just every day kind of items. The server was cheerful and friendly. Ordered the corn soup, eggplant dip to start and the grain power salad & mushroom pizza. Complimentary savory crisp basket while we waited. Dishes rolled out quickly. The corn soup was best described as Autumn in a bowl. Perfectly seasoned and smooth. The eggplant dip was delish. Acidic twist and garnished with spicy fried chickpeas and pita. The ratio of pita to dip was off but had crisp leftover from prior.  Pizza was satisfying and cheesy and def better than the ketchup mess I had down the street from here last week. So another plus. The grain salad was very filling and lots of fresh avocado. The touch of mandarin was delightful. Overall, the ambience was relaxing and fresh. The decor was rusticly chic (is that a thing?) yet modern. The food was interesting and yummy. Will be coming back for drinks and the dinner menu at soon.
