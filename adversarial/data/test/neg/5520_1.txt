If you live in the Phoenix area, you must come here and partake of the goodness that comes out of this quaint little Italian kitchen. My wife got the pizza sub and I got the cheese stake. Tender juicy and full of flavor. You will love this place. Not to mention you can buy fresh Italian bread too on the way out.
