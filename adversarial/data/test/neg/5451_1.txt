Just as expensive as 5 guys and not even close to as good. Burgers are Swensons sized but where getting 2 doubles at swensons will run you about 8-10 burger fi would be 17-20. Shoestring Fries are nothing special. Have been there 8-10x bc my parents live close and are big fans but I don't see why except they like small portions
