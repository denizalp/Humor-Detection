I went here for the first time this past weekend and wow.  My eyebrows are on point!  I've been going to a certain threading place and it's always been crowded lately which means once the person gets to my eyebrows, they feel rushed and leads to not the best job.  I contacted Farida and she instantly texted me back with a time and day to come by.  She probably took 5 minutes on me and her price is so reasonable.  My eyebrows look great, she kept my shape because you know how important that is! I will continue to go to her now on. Thank you, Farida!
