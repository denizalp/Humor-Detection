Went because followed them on Instagram and the food looks amazing. There was a line up even on a weekday evening but service was good and fast. Interesting way to eat Korean food I haven't tried before where you put the meat and some of the side dishes onto a lettuce and wrap it to eat. But the BBQ was waaaay too overprice for what we got so although the food was good, I am not going back due to the value alone. The UFO fried rice thing was very tasty though. Try for novelty but perhaps not all the time due to value.
