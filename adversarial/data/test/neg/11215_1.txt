Some of the food was good so for that reason I am giving it two stars. The food is awkwardly spread out, maybe they want you to have a selection when you travel around the buffet. But there is no way I can tell anyone go to this counter for this or that because it's all over the place, i.e. What would cereal be doing at the salad station? Gravy was rushed so it's gritty from the flour. Now the big problem is we paid extra for the alcoholic drinks(it was only six bucks but that's beside the point). One bartender tries to tell me my Bloody Mary already has vodka in the premix sorry but that is bull you just gave me tomato juice. The other bartender was great one of the first things he does is pour the vodka in. So let's just say I wouldn't recommend this buffet nor would I ever come back. By the way desert station is pretty good!
