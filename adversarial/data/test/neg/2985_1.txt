Our first time and it was super fun! The instructor was wonderful and funny, the wait staff was accommodating and the food was actually pretty decent. Painting wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be. Easy to follow due to the wonderful instructor.  Lots of photos taken too! Oh and it was my birthday so I was brought to the front of the class and received a bday pastry with a candle and the class sang Happy Birthday . I definitely recommend taking a class! !\nAmanda
