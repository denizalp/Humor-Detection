Stopped off here to top off my tank when I first moved to the Las Vegas area a few weeks ago. The gas was only a few cents more than the prices of other gas stations I saw that day so I decided it wasn't worth it for me to go to another station since this one is really close to my house. (Yeah, that is a run on sentence...so!)\n\nI only pumped a full tank and everything worked as it should have so no complaints. \n\nI got what I expected.
