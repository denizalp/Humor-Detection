went there for a red color job, 5 hours later my hair was a purple black. The hairdresser makenna said it would fade to the color I wanted in the first place. She also cut my hair.  It is all uneven. I now have to go to a corrective colorist to undue the horrible job she did. You get what you pay for..... don't go here. spend the $40.00 dollars more and get a real professional. We are nothing but live mannequin heads they practice on.
