The mango sesame chicken wasn't crispy enough, I could\nfeel the dough. The sesame seed were raw and there wasn't enough sauce on the dish. The Kung Pao was ok, but nothing special. \nThe mango mango drink is too strong and the mango flavor tastes kinda fake. \nFor sure there are better Asian options in Cle, so skip this one.
