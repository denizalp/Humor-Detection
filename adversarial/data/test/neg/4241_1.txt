Pink Lady Roll, XXX, Spicy Tuna, Tuna hand roll. I gotta say very fresh and super delicious. I ordered the plum wine.. while very strong was uber sweet. Don't think it could have been any sweeter unless I drank maple syrup from a tree. J\/k. I'd def. go back. The chef was awesome, Woody from Hollywood was super cool & I'd def. go back just to hang out with him. He joked w\/ me and my bf the entire night and was just cool w\/ out trying to hard. Someone near me ordered a screaming orgasm, looked declicious... Might order that one nxt time. I highly recommend trying this place.
