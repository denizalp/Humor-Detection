I would actually give Yardbird 4.5 stars and here's why (I'll start with the bad first):\n\nIf you plan on coming here with a group larger than 6, they don't take \"regular\" reservations, you have to go through corporate sales in order to get a reservation. BUT with that reservation you have to pay up front and have a pre-fixed menu (that's why I would knock off a star). \n\nHowever, one way to circumvent this issue is to just find a bunch of seats in the lounge area for your party since it's first come first serve. I ended up doing that for my birthday with a group of 12. We pulled a bunch of little tables and chairs together and were able to make it work for dinner. It was a little awkward but they offer the full menu in the lounge area and service was awesome! They were definitely willing accommodate us and our server was very attentive.  \n\nThe food and drinks are awesome! The fried chicken and waffles with watermelon is so GOOD!!! The chicken is so juicy and moist with the perfect amount of crunch. Even the white meat was super moist! The waffle was pretty good too, but the only problem is the bottom waffle gets soggy once you actually get to it. The shrimp n' grits, mac and cheese and brussel sprouts are also delicious! As for drinks, I'm not a huge fan of bourbon but their blackberry bourbon lemonade is good too, and it seemed like all my friends enjoyed all the drinks they got (not sure what they all ordered though).
