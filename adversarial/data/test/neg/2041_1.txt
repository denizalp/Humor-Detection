I came here on cold Sunday night on my last night in the wonderful city of Montreal, but I must say that this place was a bit of a let down. They had two rooms one for house music and another for hip hop. The good news was that it was ladies night and my pal and I got a few free drinks, but the bad news was that the music was pretty lame in both rooms. Plus, the hip hop room was an icebox! Seriously it was freezing cold. We tried to make the best of it, but in the end, it just wasn't worth it. Ah well, just got to search for a better club on my next trip. :)
