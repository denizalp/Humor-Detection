If you are a board member of an HOA and work with William Douglas, be prepared to do a LOT of work.  You must constantly follow up, double check every move they make and literally beg for return phone calls or emails.  Absolutely the worst management company I've ever worked with, being both a board president and a homeowner.  I have no clue how they are still in business.
