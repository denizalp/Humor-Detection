This place was recommended to us by another family at our school and everything they said about it is true. It's very clean, the staff is very friendly, and Dr. Santucci does a great job of explaining their evaluation and results. We never felt pressured into anything and they could not be easier to work with. I've heard horror stories regarding other orthodontists so do yourself a favor and just check this place out.
