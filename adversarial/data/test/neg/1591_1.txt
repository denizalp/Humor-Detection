Always wanted to try a Dim Sum place here in Vegas and of course do a comparison of Hawaii and Cali. Even though this place didnt have the 4 stars, my husband and I decided to try this place out. Dining area was clean and spacious. The workers seem attentive making sure we got what we needed or if we needed to order more. Our waitress was pushing us to order the snow peas with garlic instead of the broccoli and says it was better, then again it was more expensive.\n\nWe ordered:\npork shumai: base on reviews it was bland and had no flavor..true! \nChinese broccoli: was a tad overcooked but still good\nStuff eggplant: a little bland. Don't care for it.\nBeef tendon: we love tendon so that was good.\nFried taro: the best part of our dim sum lunch.\nPan fried chive dumplings: that was tasty so I enjoyed it.\nEgg fu yung: to fluffy and very bland even with the sauce it didn't matter, still bland. Heard China a go go by far is better.\n\nThe food experience was okay. I don't think we will be back here. Cali and Hawaii still tops my list on Dim sum. We came here to see for ourselves and we did. \n\nPleasant workers and good customer service! Hope in the near future that their food will be  tastier. Until then Happy Eats!
