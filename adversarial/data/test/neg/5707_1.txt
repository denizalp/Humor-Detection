I had seen Pita Jungle around but never got around to trying it until I saw this mall location. I got the Philly Cheesesteak Pita (I know, the unhealthiest one, right haha), and it was just FANTASTIC! It was filled with meat and yummy melted cheese, mushrooms and green peppers. I usually hate green peppers, but these were cooked in a way where they were so soft and sweet, I almost liked them better then the rest of the pita. The pita itself was warm and fresh tasting. I've gone back for this same pita multiple times, and I've noticed that it seems to taste better when the dude with the beard makes it :)
