Don't eat here unless you want a salad because they may not have it. Ordered Mac and cheese for my daughter told they didn't have it after I paid. Apparently they didn't have grilled chicken either. It was awful! Ordered the bison burger medium it was well done and burnt. My mom order grilled chicken ended up with fried chicken tenders that were inedible. Overall not impressed won't be back and it's sad because the ratings say it's good but the farthest thing from the truth.
