I recieved a quote from Window World a couple years ago  however unfortunately something came up and I wasn't able to purchase them at that time. Fast forward to now. I call back and have them come back out. My quote went up 2000 dollars! I was told they just increased prices. The sales representative told me  he would look for my previous quote and call me back.  He never did and I had to continue to reach out to him several times throughout the week.  During this time I was able to gather enough money to cover all but 300 dollars. I am offering several thousand dollars including the $2000 increase that was added from last quote and they refused to work with me with the $300. Their labor was more than other recent quotes and they charge a disposal fee that hasn't been added with other quotes I have received. There refusal to work with me and the fact that my salesman never returned my calls left me feeling like a number and not valued as a potential new customer. Really bad experience.
