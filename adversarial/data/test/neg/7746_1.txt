Diego Pops is super cute on the inside, but very cramped. They were really busy and the line for the bathroom was outside the door. The tacos were good, I wouldn't come back for them specifically. The quest corn dip, however, was amazing. It was a little cottage-cheesey and chunky, but so delicious! Our waitress was super helpful and had great menu recommendations.
