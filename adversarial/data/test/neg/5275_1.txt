This place sucks!!!!!!! The first thing they need to do is REMOVE THE MINUTE CLINIC SIGN!!! There is nothing MINUTE about it!!!!!!\n\n 1 hour and 20 minutes i waited after i had signed in!!!!!They texted me 30 minutes prior to come in for my time slot, so i did and i ended up waiting another 45 minutes. Finally, i just left!!! No live people at the clinic counter, just a computer to sign in. So, you have no idea if your next, or is there someone there, or are you in the twilight zone!!!! AVOID THIS PLACE IN A MINUTE!!!!
