This was my 3rd time visiting Upstream. The first time was awesome. 2nd time was during Restaurant week and it was mediocre. The 3rd time was back to awesome.\n\nI had the Red Snapper and it was crisped to perfection. \n\nWas with my team from work and everyone enjoyed their meal.\n\nMust visit again.
