Listen to the bad reviews. Unfortunately, they are true. Everything that we requested they ran out of. No more pillows?!  Also the bed doesn't even come with a blanket lol. Our complementary breakfast was a fail. They ran out of breakfast food and would not substitute for food they did have available and said coffee wasn't included in complimentary breakfast :\/ One good thing was that someone came to fix our plastic window shade that was broken when we first arrived. Anyways this may have once been a cute hip place. Now it's just run down and sad. The pool is just...no. Everything needs an hgtv renovation. Won't be coming back.
