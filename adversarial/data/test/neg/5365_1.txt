I've been to this salon several times. The first couple visits were fine despite the cost (very expensive). The first time I experienced poor service was a few months ago when I brought my step daughters, 6 and 8, to get a mani\/pedi. I was told we could get right in, but ended up waiting 20 minutes with their feet in the water. We waited so long their toes turned into raisins.  Two \"kids\" simple mani\/pedi and my fill, $96!  My jaw dropped. \n\nThe next time I stopped in was the beginning of December for a fill. I was told it would be a couple minutes and to pick a polish color. After picking a color and waiting approximately 10 minutes, I was told they were very busy and it would be about another half hour and asked if I wanted to come back... after waiting... for 10 minutes. I had plans that evening and other errands to run so I could not wait and I left. Strike two!\n\nI decided to give the salon one more chance. I decided to CALL FIRST in case they were busy for the holiday. I called the salon on my way home from work around 3pm, and asked what their availability was to do a full set and if I needed to make an appointment. The owner said they could do it right now and to come in. I arrived about 2 minutes later and let the owner know I just called about the full set. (I work 5 minutes from the salon.) I picked my color, sat down, and waited. About 5 minutes pass and the tech that does acrylics comes to the front and says she has to leave. Her and the owner go back and forth for a couple minutes. I then overhear the owner talking to another tech on the side. He was trying to \"talk her into\" doing a full set! She was saying she was uncomfortable doing acrylics because she has no training. This goes on for about 5 minutes. Two other customers walk in for regular manicures and get seated right away. The owner finally approaches me and tells me his technician that does acrylics is leaving and asked if I wanted another tech (with no experience) to \"practice\" on me free of charge. It was NYE and I wanted pretty nails, so I said no thank you and told him I would go elsewhere (Spa 7 just around the corner, and had a wonderful experience). He could tell I was frustrated when I mentioned I called in advanced and he said it (the situation) was \"kind of rude\". I agreed and walked out. \n\nThe owner and staff seem to have trouble giving accurate wait times and rather tell a customer they can be seen right away to avoid the customer leaving. Not a great business model, if you ask me. I was also not thrilled that the owner was trying to talk one of the girls into doing a full set when she had no training and was uncomfortable with the idea! Needless to say, I will not be returning to this salon.
