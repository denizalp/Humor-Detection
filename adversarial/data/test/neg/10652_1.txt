Updated review. PDQ is still awesome! I went there the other night because I didn't feel like cooking and was feeling extra hungry haha! So I decided to try some things that are out of my normal order. \n\nI went with the bacon cheese burger and an order of 12 nuggets. Delicious! Honestly their burgers are really tasty. Since they are a chicken themed place I would never order outside the specialty but thought I'd try it and so happy i did! They have some of the best burgers in my neighborhood. Plus they use potato bread buns which are my favorite and elevates the taste. The burger was cooked to perfection and I very much enjoyed it. \n\nThey seriously have the best chicken nuggets. It's like giant deep fried goodness! OMG why have I never ordered those before...?!? The order of 12 fed me,  my mom, plus each of my dogs split one hahah. They are crispy, juicy, and so satisfying. \n\nI also got my usual order of zucchini fries because who can go there and not get those?!? \n\nOnce again you have one satisfied and FULL happy PDQ customer. Also, I would like thank the staff who works there. I hope corporate DOES read this review because you should know the staff is excellent. I've never been to any fast food restaurant that has a staff who actually looks like they are enjoying their job, greet you with a friendly genuine smile, and leave you with a happy experience.
