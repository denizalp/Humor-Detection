Shaun Kennedy is AWESOME!  We needed our POD to be delivered in the trickiest spot.  He spent a long time in the HOT summer sun getting it in the right location without any damage to even a plant.  He took the time to also enter notes in our account so that he would be scheduled to pick it up since it required a lot of time, patience and skill not to cause damage.  He is very professional and courteous and must be a top, valued amployee.  He took the time and care as if this was his own business.  Good Job Shaun and Thanks a Million!
