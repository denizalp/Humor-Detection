I viewed this venue because of the gorgeous photos with the draped linen across the ceiling. The venue is not as grand as you think it is having a price tag still similar to villa Siena. There are lots of small rooms and one grand room. The wedding coordinator recommended leaving the grounds to take family\/bride and groom photos. Very unimpressed. The venue is very impressive for a nice Christmas party with your coworkers but would never recommend it as a wedding venue.
