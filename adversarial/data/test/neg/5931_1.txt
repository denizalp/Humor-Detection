You might think this is just another Ramen spot to hit Sin City, but Ramen Hashi, to me at least, adds their very own twist to our warm Japanese favorites! \n\nFirst thing to stand out was their supposed opponent to the Tonkatsu Shoyo Ramen, which was their Tori Paitan. I was skeptical at first but after having it, I could personally say it does stand toe to toe. The ramen here generally offers a more smooth, mild tasting base. It lets other components stand out! From beautifully charred pork, in house made noodles to its soft boiled egg. \n\nTheir establishment is very spacious, easily accessible with a very simple concept. Another thing that caught my eye was their \"self serving\" mini station for every table. This enables us consumers play around and find our own preferences. It also saves time! Speaking of time, they offer excellent, speedy service! Your order comes out in less than 3-4mins! \n\nOverall, I highly recommend this place!
