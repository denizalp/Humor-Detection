Last stop of the night for the two of us. Man, Thursday nights are absolutely bumping in Toronto. Every bar, club and restaurant that was passed was packed with people enjoying the perfect summer weather. Our last stop ended up being at Hogtown for some good 'ol wine and oysters. Because who can say no to half price oysters?\n\nThe inside is dark, intimate and just gives off good vibes. Everyone inside seemed to know each other and from what Ju told me, it's very friendly, family oriented here. I dig it.\n\nOysters ($18.00 dozen) - That's right, half price oysters on a Thursday! Yes please and thank you. These were fresh and came with a three different sauces to try (can't remember them now) but I think I prefer them in a traditional fashion. Put a bit of horseradish and squeeze some lemon on. Nothing more satisfying than tasting the actual oyster.
