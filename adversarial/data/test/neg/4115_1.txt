i'm updating my review from 3 yrs ago about this place. This use to be my go to for any meal of the day... i loved their food and the service... they ended up having a fire and closed down... they were closed for almost 9 months and re opened in december however the kitchen is still closed. No clue how they can still call themselves Roadrunner Bar and Grill (via facebook page) and not serve food.  I am pretty disappointed.
