Tremendous experience overall. It was my for wife's birthday (and she is 32 weeks pregnant), so it was one of our last date nights before kids. Scott and the other waiters were incredibly attentive all night. Each course was outstanding and flavorful. The ambiance was playful yet romantic. We will be eager to plan our next special occasion dinner here once our little one joins us in a few months.
