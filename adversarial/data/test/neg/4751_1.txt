I found this restaurant a very unwelcoming place. The employees were not at all friendly. They did not care about their customers. It was hot and uncomfortable inside. They advertise three types of ice tea availble, and there was none. The soda machine was not working properly and the employees could care-less about it. The food was relatively good, but nothing special.\n\nI would not come here again due to the rude and aloof attitude of the employees.
