Consistently the best burrito in Toronto. They grill the burrito into a magnificent roll of gooey, flavourful deliciousness. This place blows Chipotle out of the water; I have never understood why people enjoy eating cold burritos. The lines at Burrito Boyz can be long but they are definitely worth the wait. Surprisingly the soy burrito is fantastic as well.
