Great Food in an OK Setting\n\nDecor is a bit odd and it looks dusty but the food was great; good lunch place!  I was invited to the Tavern for a quick business lunch.  The building itself looks a little run down from the outside and the entry way is dusty with a worn carpet and odd nic-naks decorating the area.  The inside shares the \"unique\" interior decorating quirks; a bicycle on the wall, multiple randomly placed signs and some mis matched chairs decorate the large seating area.  Likewise, there's some cleanliness issues on the ceiling fans and light fixtures.\n\nBUT, the reason I go to a restaurant is the food and service.  Both were a hit.  Our waitress served us quickly, had both orders dead on and offered and supplied everything  could ask for.  One quirk that the Tavern may want to keep an eye on is the Tabasco bottle I asked for and received did not have the usual pour spout most standard bottles have; it had been removed.  As a result, my initial dash of Tabasco resulted in a full tablespoon or more.  Fortunately, I like hot food so I soldiered on; however, many diners may ruin their food without first checking the bottle first.\n\nI had a standard fare side salad with the house dressing and blue cheese crumbles.  Fresh, crisp vegetables and enough carrots, tomatoes, and cucumber to be a real salad, not a bed of greens.  The star of my lunch was the Crab cake in my crab cake sandwich.  The aioli and roll were fine but the cake had a great consistency and a good char on the outside.  Great flavor from a grilled crab cake; not something you can get many places in the area.  If there's anything I would change is a touch more \"bite\" or seasoning on the cake or aioli itself.  The taste was good but somewhat bland until the dose of Tabasco.   \n\nOverall no real complaints; I highly recommend it for lunch and would love to try dinner with my family sometime.
