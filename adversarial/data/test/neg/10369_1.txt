My side yard service gate needed the spring reattached and latch repaired. I scheduled the repair for the following week and Alex the repair tech called 30-min prior and arrived just as scheduled. \n\nHe had all the tools and bolts needed to fix the gate and added a latch cord so I could easily open the gate. Repairs cost $100. Very happy to have the gate working.
