Really neat and worth seeing if you are in Vegas.  Seems like from any place you end up standing you can get a good show.  It's amazing to look around and see how many people line up to catch the fountains.  I loved how the fountain show moved with the music so well.  My kid and I enjoyed it a lot and will check it out again when in Vegas.
