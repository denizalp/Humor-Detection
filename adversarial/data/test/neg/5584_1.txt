Before today I had no idea what a Bulgogi (sure is fun to say though!), thankful Bob has photos on the wall to guide novices in their lunch selection. Bob's is not very noticeable but their bulgogi is certainly delicious. I had mine medium spicy, my colleague who asked for the spicy version was sweating! They cook all of the food fresh when you order, and the meat is very good quality and low in fat. My only complaint with Bob's is that they are stingy on the meat and vegetables--all carbs in this meal.\n\nIf you're planning on eating in, there are only four stools, facing out the window. I think mostly do take away.
