I think this is by far the best restaurant in toronto. The presentation, flavour, and service is top notch. I called to make reservations and they make sure to ask if it was for a special occasion.when we were seated the menu was explained in detail and made sure we didn't have any allergies. \n\nThe food was amazing. Almost every dish was a surprise.\n\n4.5 stars. Had to -0.5 because it is on the pricy side. 2 ppl with the 5 course taste test came to $350.00. Not an everyday meal but definitely a must try!
