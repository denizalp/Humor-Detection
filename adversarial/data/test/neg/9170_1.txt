Just got back from watching a fantastic new musical called Come From Away. The theatre has recently undergone renovations (which saw the removal of over 200 seats) which allowed for new seats to be installed, which are wider and have more legroom. \nI still love this theatre...it's a grande old dame worthy of our respect.
