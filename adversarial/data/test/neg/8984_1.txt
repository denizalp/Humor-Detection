Looking for a local staple that also serves up hearty and delicious sandwiches with fries IN the sandwich? Then Primanti's is for you! I went here on a recommendation from my friend who is a local to Pittsburgh while I was in town on business. My group all opted for sandwiches which come with coleslaw and fries piled high on the sandwich itself. I heard rave reviews about the pastrami, but I opted for the bacon and provalone sandwich. Yes, it's a heavy meal, but so so good! The service was speedy and the whole vibe was definitely Pittsburgh proud. You only have to look anywhere in the place to be reminded that this is Steelers country and you should wear your gold and black loud and proud. It's always fun to visit a local landmark and this place will fill that need.
