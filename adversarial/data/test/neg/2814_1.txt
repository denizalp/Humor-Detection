Took a short, brisk walk over from the arena after the Raptors v Celtics game. It was pretty busy so we were pleasantly surprised to find there was no wait. Very warm, welcoming and trendy atmosphere. Although it was late, my fiancé and I tried to have a light mean but ended up going for the gusto! I have the Cesar salad which was good. My fiancé had the wedge salad, he liked it but wished the dressing wasn't as thick. We then moved on to French fries (my go to when I'm unsure) and sliders. My fiancé loved the sliders. Let's talk about these French fries...we decided they were probably the best we have ever tasted! They were crispy but not burned, not oily and the ketchup was just spectacular. We ordered the small brownie dessert which is perfect if you just want something to satisfy your sweet tooth. Very impressed with the atmosphere, decor, service and food.
