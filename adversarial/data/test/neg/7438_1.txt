I am regretful that I have no photos, but this is a place where you just naturally forget you have a phone and fully become present with your dinner mates and the food. \n\nI had polled quite a few friends about restaurants they think are worth showing off to people who used to live in Pittsburgh and are back in town. Morcilla came up on everyone's list. \n\nWe made a reservation for a Saturday night and I'm glad we did as the place was packed all evening. \n\nThe atmosphere is very warm. Our server was a wealth of knowledge and helped us navigate appropriate quantities of food for our group. Her recommendations were on point and she paced the plates we ordered at the perfect pace and combinations of plates that we ordered was also perfect! \n\nWe did a number of small plates. The octopus was phenomenal. Incredibly tender and yet meaty! I couldn't get over it. The fried artichokes were great and the oxtail was one of the most flavorful foods I've ever eaten. The cecina was perhaps the most buttery,melt in your mouth cured meat I've ever tried. \n\nI cannot adequately express what a pleasurable dining experience this was. We finished our meal with the churros and they came out piping hot-crispy and coated in sugar and slightly custardy in the center. Dip them in the not-too-sweet chocolate sauce for perfection. \n\nI have to say, there are other things that impressed me. Our table was close to the kitchen and offered us a unique view. We could not get over how impeccably clean it looked! It was also relatively quiet! No screaming from the kitchen! In addition, despite the fact that the place was full, it didn't feel too noisy or that you're on top of other diners. \n\nI'm still thinking of this meal and can't wait to go back and try the family style course option!
