I ain't going there again. The food was good. Not great. But I don't have much qualms about it. But what really bothered me was the service. We went in a group of 6 where half of us were vegetarians. We asked for the Lentil Soup (which is displayed right on their menu screen) and they started laughing saying \"no, who drinks soup in the summer? \". Hello then why is it on your menu and who are you to judge? Then one of my friends asked for the Shish Tawook (again on their menu) they said no we don't have. Asked for the Marakesh (was not on the menu but is usually available in other Paramount locations). Again a no Then finally just reverted to good old shwarma wraps and bowls. I think this itself started on a wrong note that everything felt disorganized. And they continued to look at us funnily since we asked stuff which they didn't have. This is not how you treat your customers. If you don't have something that's fine but don't make us feel bad for asking. Be humble and just openly say \"sorry we just don't carry it anymore or during the  summer\". I would respect you more for that honesty. I think what is going well for them is the location which is what drives in the large lineups and customer base. But if this attitude continues people will eventually stop coming.
