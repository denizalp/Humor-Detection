I agree with some of the other reviewers regarding the out-of-stock items. I will also add that last Sunday around 5 pm was a most ridiculous wait in line.  I mean there had to have been over 100 people wanting to check out, yet there were 3 lines open and one for debit\/credit. We joked that this place is becoming like Wally World. Not cool, to spend over 20 minutes in line. We  were  happy with the price of our items and this is the ONLY reason we continued to wait. In the near future, will make it  my mission to go really early in the morning!
