Terrible service by Armina  (I believe that's the name of the blonde cashier).  She needs to hide her attitude even if a customer has one.  No response in response to customer's \"thank you\" and complete lack of acknowledgement is just unacceptable.  No enthusiasm, feels like she doesn't want to be here.
