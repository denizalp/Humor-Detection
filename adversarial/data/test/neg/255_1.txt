Super disappointing. The margarita was terrible and we ordered the chicken wings and they were tiny and chewy.  Not good at all. And for sure not a pound! Definitely would not go back.  There are too many good places to go for wings and margaritas. I suggest do it better or do something different! The bartender was nice though and very attentive.
