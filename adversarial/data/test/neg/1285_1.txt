We stumbled across this little gem on a Sunday looking for a nice brunch. It happened to be their first day with Sunday brunch and man did they nail it. Limited options but everything we had was great so it didn't matter. Potato pancake benedict was done to perfection. Will venture back for dinner and drinks soon!
