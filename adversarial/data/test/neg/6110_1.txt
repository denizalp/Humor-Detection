Wonderful experience with very friendly, helpful staff! I came in late at night after having to leave an Airbnb unexpectedly. I was travelling alone and was far from home. I was literally in tears when I approached the front desk. Shane was so kind to me! The room was great, especially for the cost. It was clean, quiet, and in a great area. Would go back for a planned stay next time!! I cannot say enough nice things about my stay, and I am especially grateful for Shane, who came to my rescue!
