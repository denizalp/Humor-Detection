I have been to steakhouses around the world and the only thing this place has going for it is that it's not a chain. \nSeriously, Outback and Longhorn have better beef. The inedible filet I was served tonight is an embarrassment to any steakhouse. I sous vide beef better than than this place. My husband took me here since we are new to Charlotte and I love steakhouses, but he knew and acknowledged the food was below par. I will say the creamed spinach and cheesy potatoes were good, but if the beef is garbage, I am done.\nThey said sorry and to try them again, but I will never come back to this dump. \nWe showed with no reservation, but at 9:30pm, I saw no point. They put us in a room that looked like a trailer with others not dressed to impress.\nOne and done.
