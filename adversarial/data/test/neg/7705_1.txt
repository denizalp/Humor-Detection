I brought my car in last Saturday to install a new set of tires I purchase on Tire Rack. When I got there, they couldn't find them. I wasted about 2 hours of Saturday morning sleep. I had to call UPS and Tire Rack to make sure they were delivered. Dale (one of the managers) wanted to correct the wrong and ordered the same set to be delivered in the week. I would have given them 5 stars if they didn't lose the tires. \n\nSure enough, I got a call from them (Brandon) this past Tuesday and they installed them the same day (took about an hour). They even paid for the installation fee and rebalancing fees. So, thankful for that. Definitely made it right. I still don't know where the original shipped tires went, but the ones I got installed were great for my car. \n\nThey have a pretty small waiting area (5-6 chairs). It has a table of magazines and a small tv with a dvd player. They do play relatively recent movies (Enders Game and Hunger Games). There is also a pretty clean bathroom down the hall. \n\nI do have to say, waiting for my car, you see the interaction between customers and \"front office\" people (Dale, Brandon, Peter). They do a great job in servicing the car and taking care of the customer. They know pretty much all the customer names. That shows you the great service they provide. They provide everything from tires, to PA state inspections, to quick oil changes (they'll even let you know if you don't even need an oil change yet), to new belts and brakes. \n\nIf I had to go back, I definitely would, even if it's 15-20 minutes out of my way to get there. If you're looking for a good basic mechanic\/garage, go here.
