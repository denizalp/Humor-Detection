WOW!  We just got back from one of our best dining experiences ever.  Our two-year-old had his birthday yesterday and his two-year checkup today (including blood draw-yuck).  His mom, his six-month-old brother, and I dropped by for some fun-food.  Server Sierra gave him some apple slices (for free) which he loved.  She even asked us if she could give him a little birthday sundae.  (how do you say no to a kid with a cotton bandage on his arm?)  Anyway, Mom and dad had burgers (excellent) with bottomless, steak fries and steamed broccoli.  The wait staff and their supervisor took very good care of us.  Thanks again, Red Robin.  We all had a great time.
