This Walgreens has everything and is nicely designed and way easier to move through than any other Walgreens I have been to. And if I were reviewing just the store I would say it was fantastic.\nBut my experience focused primarily on the take care clinic and it's inefficiency. I was needing a physical for employment and despite having to pay out of pocket, I thought this would be far more convenient than going to a primary care doctor. \nI checked in and waited about a half hour (which wasn't very long). I was than greeted by someone (I have no idea if he was a doctor, a nurse or the receptionist). This person never introduced himself, walked me into a room with someone else's stuff. He was a young guy in his 20s with clearly very little professional experience. When I told him I wanted a physical, he let out a big sigh as if I was causing him an inconvenience. He asked me why I hasn't filled out paperwork (which were nowhere to be seen) and grabbed the papers I had brought (for the physical). He stared at the papers and  looked at them as if they were written in a foreign language. He let out another sigh. It was at this point that he wanted to start the exam, but it was also at this point that I decided I wasn't comfortable with this person ( who was frazzled, unprofessional and still hadn't introduced himself to me). My five minutes with him felt more like talking to someone from the ghetto than someone supposed to be in the medical profession and I had no intention of this person examining me! Skip this place and make an appointment somewhere  else!
