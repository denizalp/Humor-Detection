It's exciting when a new vegan\/vegetarian place opens in Phoenix, so when I was back home over the holidays I decided to stop in with friends. The good morning sandwich I ordered was really good, the agave mustard was a nice touch. \nOne point of suggestion I brought up to the woman behind the counter was the fact that the coronado up charges for non-dairy milk. I found this to be really off putting from a restaurant that is trying to support the vegan community. I told her I would rather pay more for every single coffee drink (as a flat rate like most vegetarian\/vegan places) on the menu than be charged extra for being vegan. An extra fee for being vegan is something I'd expect from a restaurant or coffee shop that doesn't understand the vegan culture or community. \nAlso, wondered where the cow diary is sourced from, not that I eat it, but as a customer who is supporting this restaurant.\nWith a little tweaking The coronado could be a really awesome spot not only for vegetarians but vegans too :)
