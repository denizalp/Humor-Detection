Horrible. Had a plumber come out for a leak in my main line in the front yard. He had to dig to find the leak. Mind you it had been dug pretty deep already. For the digging alone he charged me $170. He said he found the leak and it was under a pipe we had already had replaced. He then refused to do the one pipe and said it would be $3000 to change all our pipes since the house is old. We said no thanks and paid him for digging. We ended up calling a guy from Craigslist who ended up finding the actual leak by digging even more. He's fixing our pipe right now for only $80 and is not charging for the digging.
