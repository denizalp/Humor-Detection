I cannot say enough good things about this studio. I went there regularly for almost 3 years and loved every class. Every class is different, which keeps it interesting. Each instructor has their own take and perspective, and I always leaving having learned something new. I have never expanded my yoga boundaries so much! The studio is spacious which I like too.
