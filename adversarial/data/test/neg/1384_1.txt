My husband and I have been to this restaurant more than several times, and the food and staff continue to be amazing! The chef at the hibachi table was fun and did new moves that I haven't seen before. The all you can eat sushi had sooooo many varieties of rolls and more! The staff are unbelievably nice and fun. If you become a regular, you get to pick your own chopsticks and a box to keep them at the restaurant. Overall, always a great experience.
