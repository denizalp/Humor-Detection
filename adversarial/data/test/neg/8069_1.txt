This place made car buying as easy as going to the grocery store. If they have what you want, they'll do everything they can to put you in it. We bought two cars in one day. Even though that was far from the plan. Couldnt pass up the deal or upgrade. Everyone we worked with was awesome. Nicolas and Alex made a great team and the sales manager and Lane in finance treated us like VIPs. They watched our kids on one of the test drives and bought us pizza. A+ costimer service for sure.
