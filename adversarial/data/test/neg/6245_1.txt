This place is great when you're craving Korean food & don't have the appetite to eat AYCE or don't want to spend too much (like the ~20-25$ range). Jun's is still on the pricey side tho - I ordered the two meat combo w\/ bulgogi and spicy chicken which comes with rice and salad (salad is only for dine-in, doesn't come w\/ in take-out) & total was around 14$. Not really a shareable portion either. Other places you get unlimited banchan\/side dishes but here you only get two with your meal & an extra side dish is 2$ each ! I have no complaints about quality of the food though & food comes out fast for made to order place. I don't think I have ordered anything I did not like besides the meat jun (way too much egg for me). The service here gotten worse but it's whatever since this is one of few places w\/ Korean food available for us Henderson people.
