Gerald made my boyfriend and I's anniversary trip a great one to remember because of his fantastic customer service and warm welcome! Gerald assisted me on 1\/18 around 2pm. He was very friendly and explained the different types of insurance thoroughly and was very patient. He was so sweet, he even gave us an amazing Infiniti to rent and truly made my boyfriend and I's experience PHENOMENAL! This man deserves recognition for his hard work, and a raise. With years of customer service under my belt and now a current clinician, it is clear when someone is going above and beyond for me and is putting 110% effort. Boyfriend and I will be back because of Gerald!!! YOU ARE THE BEST GERALD! THANK YOU!
