We brought Meisje our dog in for a check up because we just moved to Arizona from Florida. The staff there is very good, knowledgeable and very helpful. The office is super homie and the they have tiles pained of dogs and cats on their floor. This will be our regular vet from now on. Their a great staff there and the doctors are awesome!!
