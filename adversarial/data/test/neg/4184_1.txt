Stayed here during construction in the princess suite after being upgraded bc the room they gave us had a weird smell. It was a one bdr suite with two beds and a pullout sofa. They were under construction at the time. It was fun and a good experience. No casino. Small bar. Plus side is that Ellis island is next door.
