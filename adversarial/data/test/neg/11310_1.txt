It was a pleasure having our bedding and clothes laundered\/dry cleaned at Delia's at 67th Ave. and the Loop 101 in Glendale. I appreciate the member discount, coupons, and monthly specials (especially the 50% off of dry cleaning and the 40% off of household items).  I've used this location for over ten years and in the rare event there is an issue with my order, said issue is addressed immediately and always to my satisfaction. The staff at this location are friendly, personable, and always ask if I need assistance bringing the usually large orders to my vehicle at pick-up.  Thanks for soliciting periodic feedback, and please keep up the great work!
