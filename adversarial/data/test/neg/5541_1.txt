YUM!\n\nI love FroZenYo in Washington, DC.  I have been searching for something just as good in the Cleveland area (I don't like Menchie's Frozen Yogurt because I find it too sweet and artificial tasting).  \n\nI have been to Piccadily once so far and can't wait to go back!  The yogurt is good just by itself and they have many fun and interesting toppings.  I only wish the hot fudge was free like it is at FroZenYo . . . either way I can't wait to go back.
