This place gets five stars because it perfectly fulfilled my expectations. My sandwich could not be improved. Not crazy about sandwiches? Think $11 is too much for a sandwich (even grilled portobello mushrooms with feta, eggplant, olive tapenade, arugula and roasted red pepper on a seedy bun)? Then maybe you should go somewhere else. Look at the menu and if it appeals to you and the prices are acceptable, you won't be disappointed.
