Purchased a steam cleaning for 3 rooms and one hallway for $39 through Groupon for this company. I've done my research on how carpet companies will frequently upsell when you purchase service through sites like Groupon and was prepared to decline the added services offered. Spoke with I'm assuming the owner to make an appointment and after about 10 min of him trying to convince me I should have my carpets treated he said I may want to consider getting a refund from Groupon and refused my business! Keep in mind we have our carpets cleaned a few times a year, we don't wear shoes in our home, and we have no visible stains and I told him all this. Buyer beware!
