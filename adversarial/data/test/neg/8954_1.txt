There are very, very few perfect dining experiences.  This was one.  Immediately, you are transported to a country château in the Loire valley when you walk in this place.  And then...the courtyard.  Candlelit, perfectly rustic and overgrown with vines and palms, and adorned with candles and chandeliers.  You just...forget, and you are truly transported.  And then there's the service.  Absolutely on point.  Professional, never obsequious, and ridiculously prompt.  My husband and I both had the filet and the diver scallops.  I mean, beyond perfect, both.  I can't say enough about how fabulous our experience was.  Vingt sûr vingt.
