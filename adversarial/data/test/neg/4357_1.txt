As a business traveler, i eat out a lot, and this place was a true gem. From the hostess to the waItress and even the busboy were pleasant, attentive, and courteous. There was a great easy going atmosphere. \nNow the food, it was very tastey, the steak was cooked to order and tender, the ribs were delicious, and the cheesetoast was amazing, and the price was well under what I normally pay for a good steakhouse. I will defenitely return. Thank you.
