Good food but poor customer service. I called twice on a Friday to order take out and I was place on hold and then disconnected . When I called back was placed on hold again then nobody came on the line . I finally hung up called back and got voicemail. I could never place an order. Had dinner there as well and service is very long . It is very loud and pricey for quality . Will never go there again .
