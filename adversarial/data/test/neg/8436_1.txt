Over all, everything went OK with the purchase of my new car. Everyone was very nice at the dealership. The only thing that bothered me was the financial aspect, I was told one amount but when I finally got my information from the lender and actually looked at my loan, it was for a completely different and much higher amount. Looking back at my paperwork, it all seems to be correct, but I feel like things were explained to me in a misleading way, and their idea of \"paying off\" the loan for a previous vehicle is tacking it onto your new loan. I was told in the meeting with the finance guy that they would only have to move over a small amount, but it ended up being nearly the entire balance. I felt like the finances were rushed and I should have asked for more clarification, but I feel like, \"I didn't know what I didn't know\" at the time of purchase as this was my first time buying a car by myself, and they definitely took advantage of that. I still love my car, just feel somewhat mislead.
