While visiting Pittsburgh, we stopped at this restaurant while we were looking for a Mexican place nearby. My boyfriend really liked it and I thought it was ok. When we first sat down, our very friendly waiter brought their complimentary basket of what I think were some type of puffed chip and hot sauce and we placed an order for queso and chips. We both really didn't care for the chips and asked for them to be taken away. We also found the queso to be very bland and then ordered salsa so that we could add it to the queso, which then tasted much better. For our entrees, he ordered enchiladas verdas rojos and I ordered pollo asado with fries. He thought his food was full of flavor. I tried it and I agreed that it was good. My meal was absolutely covered in onions and peppers to a crazy level. I honestly really didn't eat very much of the chicken and ate most of the fries. I thought the chicken was dry.  We took my leftovers to go, but we ended up not even eating them because it wasn't great. I don't think will be back when I'm in Pittsburgh again. The food really wasn't anything that stood out. I did think our waiter was incredibly nice and dedicated, and our service was very quick.
