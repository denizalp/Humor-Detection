Whoa. I really love pop-ups but this one left a little to be desired. It was just too crowded. They advertised free bubbly to the first 100 people. The actual execution was pretty terrible. There were people that were in line much longer that didn't get any bubbly because it was so disorganized. We didn't' stay long because it was so crowded. I hope they do a better job of planning it next year!
