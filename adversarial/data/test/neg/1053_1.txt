Binion's is my favorite steak house in all Las Vegas ... I love the old feeling and at the top of the tower the view is terrific and not to mention how well the steak is prepared. It seems nicely aged and has a wonderful tastel The service is always excellent and usually we get a very nicely located table. I have tried many others over the years that are also good but I just love the feel of this place and that's why my wife and i make it a point of every visit to dine there.
