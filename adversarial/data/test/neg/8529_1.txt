I love the feeling of walking into the little house! Just makes me feel like home. The coffee is great! My favorite is the Miklo. Only one minor thing, last time i went i called my order ahead of time because i was on my way to work and in a hurry. I went in and paid for my coffee (i got two) she handed me one then she said they were working on the other so i went outside where they could still see me. And i waited for a while, i kept seeing everyone else get their coffee and I kept waiting. The barista (not the one who took my payment) just looked at me each time she handed coffees out never asked if i was waiting on something. I just think there should be more communication from the staff. Especially on busy days like this one. I wasnt upset at all i will still come back to get their delicious coffee. Please take this as positive feedback :)
