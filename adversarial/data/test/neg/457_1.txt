Last night, I attended UFC 213, Section 18, Terrace Table 1 ($1200). The night prior, I attend The Ultimate Fighter, Section 16, V 1&2 ($450). \n\nI was extremely disappointed with the amenities\/service we received.  We arrived at 330pm (first fight was supposed to begin at 330pm) and waited until 445pm for server staff to arrive.  We were told we could not go into the adjacent lounge that we were in the night prior.  We had to use the hallway services until the server arrived.  \n\nThe table tablet\/tv did not allow for us to order from it and the service was extremely slow.  When I asked to order fries, I was told it would take 45 minutes.  I did not order it from the server, I decided to go order them myself which took less than 10 minutes.  After I ate the fries, I decided to go to guest services and express my dissatisfaction.  I could've purchased less expensive tickets, however; I spent $1200 for the experience.  I was extremely unhappy with the experience.  I left less than half way through the event while my husband stayed.  I asked him if service got any better after I went to guest services and he said no.\n\nOn another note, I would like to speak highly of the medical staff...I injured my knee going to the event and the medical staff wrapped it and brought me ice twice. Thank you.\n\nYour response to this matter is appreciated.
