Went here this last weekend and I have to say I was very excited. We went in knowing for sure we wanted to try Paella as neither one of us had tried it. Went with the Valenciana. YUM. We had some cheese and olives..can't go wrong there. We tried the octopus--it was just ok. We tried a few of the different small plates (one with pears, the other one with charred apples) and they were pretty decent, the Paella just really stuck out here. Was even good the next day warmed up. Also grabbed a piece of cake, to go. It was the dense pound cake and it was phenomenal. When they pressure you to get it, just let it happen and get it. I really just did not like the drinks here. Mine was awful, my partners was awful. The waitress did come through with a perfect wine recommendation when I didn't recognize any of the wines on the menu, though. All in all, I'd go back.
