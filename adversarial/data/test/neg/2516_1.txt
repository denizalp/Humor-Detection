This place used to be perfect but the old guy who works here is horrible he has done my feet and only took 15 minutes and literally cut my toe I've also seen him make several women cry also I have been cut by a woman doing a full set on my nails twice this is the first time that I've had a place cut me while I was doing my nails in 17 years it is unbelievable that they would have somebody so's skilled in at the last minute they brush against your skin and you bleed for a week my nails might be fine but I expect to get my nails done and tip five dollars and still receive no bleeding at the end I am sorely disappointed in this place that used to be perfect and now it is not please stay away and do not get burned by this place and stay away from the old guy he is seriously the worst
