Owner-operated businesses are the way of my life (whenever I have influence over the buying decision), and working with someone like Marcia is the reason why. She has her clients' best interests in priority! Everything about my project happened as she promised and more! \n\nI had a vintage, 1960's beaded dress modified. It required tenacity and patience and the ultimate in care. By the time she was done, the dress looked like it was made for me, and Marcia was giddily excited that she got the chance to work on it, describing the process of taking it apart as a pleasure. It reminded me of an older engineer or car buff, reveling in memories of the old days: \"they don't make 'em like they used to...\" ! She's an artist who appreciates the craft of sewing. \n\nThe other items in her studio reflect her bold taste and design sense. Trust Marcia for more mundane tailoring and major revamps- she's got your back. Literally.
