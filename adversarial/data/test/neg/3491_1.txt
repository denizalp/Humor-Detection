Great place for fresh Italian Sandwich. Rolls are killer. The meat melts in your mouth. Also a great little Italian grocery store. Only place if the valley where I was able to find Stella Doro cookies (for you East Cost people).\n\nNothing fancy, but cut little place. I've always gone at off hours as I've been told it gets packed,... I can see that as they only have around 10 tables.
