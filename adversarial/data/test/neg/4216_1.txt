Have I missed the food trend of charring toast and pizza beyond recognition? I don't know if it was just the pizza oven last night. But our toast came out only partly edible as 3\/4 of it was burned to an absolute blackened crisp. Like not good burnt toast. Same with the pizza - crust totally inedible. Most joints do much better pizza. Caesar salad was decent but the one strip of pork belly is misleading and not very creative. The egg yolk ravioli was more like baby food and veg bland once the egg was slopped up with, you guessed it, burnt bread!Definitely skip the banana cake - stale and pointless. Good ice-cream though. Fior di latte starter was yum! But we weren't able to enjoy it as much due to as above mentioned burnt toast. Another Toronto joint\/menu where the hype overshadows the reality.
