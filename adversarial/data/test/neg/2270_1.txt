I enjoyed my first visit so much, I brought the family with me this time. It was the kids 13th birthday and we ordered pizza which was delivered and had root beer floats for lunch after we did our painting. I wasn't sure if the kids would like it or not. They actually enjoyed it very much.  Each was able to pick their own painting and got personal instruction which was great. They said they would want to do it again.  Success!!!
