The ticket office is rude and very phony with a rah rah mentality with no concern for the customer and always spouting mindless pablum to get a sale. I had a very rough experience with them this year and this is my 7th season.  I had a problem for a bit making the payment schedule and basically was implied I could lose my money or tickets. Yes I blew my stack because I felt minimized by someone who was young enough to be my child. I did apologize but did not get an apology in return until just recently and again felt that minimized again for my frustrations. The only reason I kept my tickets is that this is close to a playoff team and even the world series. I want to take my son as a father son event. Otherwise I would have cancelled in a heart beat. Also some friends of mine their kids asked my opinion and experience with the ticket office and I did tell them my experience and the spouting of mindless rah rah pablum was the norm and was an insult to people who can think. These reps need to realize we are adults and many of us could be their parents.  I feel like we are only statstics on a computer screen for a paycheck and not people. In other words don't work there if you want to be in a intellectually stimulating environment.  I also have heard this from people I know personally as well as rational people in the Online Dbacks fan page and link. It is my hope that the ticket department can elevate it's game to the product it represents.  I will close to Say that I paid the final almost 700 dollars in a little over a month and paid it off a month early.
