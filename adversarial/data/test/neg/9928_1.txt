Stopped after trip to Castle Noel. Simple little pub went on Sunday evening so only about a dozen people dining when we arrived about 5:15.  Ordered the Reuben egg rolls, Guinness French onion Soup and potato leek soup.  The rolls were good and came out very quick do not think they were made in house but had good flavor were a little on the oily side. The Guinness French onion soup was good would not say it was out of the ordinary if you like French onion you won't be disappointed. The potato leek was a little shy on potatoes but good. For dinner we had the corn beef  and cabbage and the meatloaf. I liked the twist from the normal wedges of cabbage and boiled potatoes.  The cabbage was shredded with onions and slightly grilled the garlic potatoes were definitely home made and very generous portion of corned beef sliced thin with very little fat was delicious. The meatloaf was enormous, not lacking in portion size or flavor it was  was also accompanied by the same potatoes. If you are hungry the meatloaf is the way to go we ended taking half home.  Overall the service was quick our waiter was not overly friendly but did recommend the meatloaf so we're good. And the pub was very clean and neat. Oh and by the way they have a good beer selection and bar as any good pub should.
