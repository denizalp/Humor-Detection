I ordered the two meat plate, brisket and pulled pork, the pork was a low average and the two SMALL slices of Dry Brisket really Sucked.\n\nMy wife ordered the smoked turkey, it was a Processed Turkey Roll that was also dry.\n\nThat was my second time at this Dickeys and was Definitely the last.\n\nIf you want Texas barbecue this is NOT it!
