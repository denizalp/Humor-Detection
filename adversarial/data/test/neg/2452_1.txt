So after a not so great experience at another location, the guys at this location took great care of me. My pool was starting to grow algae and the other location gave me some wrong info and I ended up with a swamp. These guys gave me very clear instructions and I'm following them currently. One picture below is this morning and the other is just 4 hours after starting the treatment. What a difference?! We will be swimming in no time all thanks to these guys.
