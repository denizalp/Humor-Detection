This location was recently renovated, it's much more modern and has a clean appeal. Every time we come it's empty never more then five people in. Which can be a good thing for us or a bad thing for business. \nEmployees are all nice and make sure the food comes out in good time. On a side note: having to ask if you need a key to use the restroom and finding out that they have to push a button to unlock the door is a little off putting. I understand sometimes why companies do this but for one it's tacky to have to announce you having to use the rest room and must be annoying for the employees to stop what they are doing to push a button. Even though we laughed, it was a bit uncomfortable for my wife who dresses in boys clothes to indicate which restroom she like to use after being asked would you like to use the boys or girls restroom? ( I know everyone is making restrooms a big issue but she is not trans [we support ] she  is still a girl that just so happens to like to dress in boys clothes). Now on to the food : \n\nI came in to try the new nacho fries, I was sort of excited to try them built up from all the hype from both online and tv commercials. But sadly the tastes and flavor didn't hold up to the hype. I thought the fries would have more season on them and be more crispier. Even the photos of the fries look more appetizing.  If I were to rate the fries I would rate two stars
