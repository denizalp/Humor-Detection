I absolutely love this Cafe!!! My two favorite people are Stacey and Daniel. Their service is impeccable and they always know exactly what I'm going to order. They make me feel like family when I'm there.  For those of you who love salads,Mimis mediteranian is the best!!! I have always loved the atmosphere here as well!! If you're looking for good food, service and comfortable atmosphere, Mimis is the place to go
