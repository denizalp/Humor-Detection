I visited this location about 30 minutes prior to closing. My friend was looking for some new items for her upcoming Vegas trip. About 10 mins till closing we were rushed into the fitting room. As we paid for our items, our clothes were rolled up in the tissue and thrown into a bag (not even half folded). The older lady who was the cashier was less than friendly and should probably retire or work on a personality. I will be returning my purchase as it is super wrinkled and not worth $45 for a plain wrinkly dress. I will make sure to never visit this location again specifically due to customer service being non-existent.
