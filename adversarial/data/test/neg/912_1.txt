While this isn't a casual \"grab a bite to eat\" place, it's certainly an amazing place for date night. Got the Hangar Steak and the Lemon\/Lamb pasta (which is AMAZING) along with the shrimp ceviche. Every bite of food we had was good. I see people complaining about the price, but our food and a bottle of wine plus a beer came in under $120. Again, that's an average date night tab. I'd suggest sitting at the bar and watching the fresh pasta being made in front of you. Definitely heading back soon!
