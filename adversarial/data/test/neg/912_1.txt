For the short period of time I was able to spend at this spa, it was quite enjoyable (I was to meet my husband for golf at 2pm).  I met my aunt and cousin here for a relaxing noon, and it was just that (after I gulped down the $75 credit card swipe to just use the facilities).  \n\nWe had our own lockers complete with robes and sandals (although mine were more comfortable) with a self-created pass code.  The sauna was our first stop followed by the hot tub.  We had the facility to ourselves.  The cold deluge was quite refreshing after working up a sweat with all that relaxing.  \n\nThe best feature of the facilities was definitely the pool.  The spa's private rooftop pool has Camelback mountain as a back-drop, which was stunning.  Our pool-side server was exceptionally nice and served my cousin and I champagne while my aunt enjoyed her massage.  We monched on grilled fruit skewers, a Mediterranean plate, vegetable flat bread, and shrimp wrap all of which were super healthy and fresh tasting.\n\nIt is worthwhile, but you may want to wait until there is a special on the facilities price.  It sounds like they offer deals through Living Social and other sites.
