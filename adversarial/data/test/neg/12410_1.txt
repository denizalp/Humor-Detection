Came to hear Beatles music and see cirque de soleil acrobatics.  INSTEAD? they took the show to almost a darker version of itself.  I had heard it was a \"review\", but the first song was the only more innocent one prior to the Beatles gettig mixed up in their Eastern religioun- drug phase.  I felt preached at.  The dances didn't connect with the music. At All.  The man to my right stared straight ahead like he was counting the minutes till he could leave.  My husband fell asleep as did the kid whose parents had forked over a pretty penny to bring their tot along.  The walk back on the strip and to watch the Bellagio fountain was better than this show.
