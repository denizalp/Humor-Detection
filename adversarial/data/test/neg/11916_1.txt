The BBQ is great at Kyle Fletcher's and the styrofoam cups for your tea (I had a huge X on mine since I went unsweetened) is how I know the south.\n\nThere is a ton of Pittsburg Steelers memorabilia and you should ask the waitress\/waiter why. Pretty interesting story.\n\nMy one beef is they only take cash. It's 2015, you should be able to take cards. It is a little small inside, but I'm use to small restaraunt so it's not a big deal for me.\n\nSide note: they sell t-shirts that on the back say \"GET PORKED.\" Makes a hilarious gift.
