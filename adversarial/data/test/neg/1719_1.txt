when i went in, the vibe of the store felt off. this location was convenient for me so i stopped by before meeting with a friend. the customer service was not that great. they didnt really seem helpful especially since i mentioned that i was new to this. i felt rushed and most of all as if i was an inconvenience for them since a few more started to walk in the door. ill drive the extra distance to the west side store from now on.
