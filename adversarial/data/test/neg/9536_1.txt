The Pad Thai here is truly excellent. The dinner portion of it is also a very good size (the lunch portion of it is smaller but you do get a spring roll+soup with the lunch special).\n\nFriendly staff and very reasonable prices given the state of our economy right now. It is on par with and probably better than a lot of places in the Annex if truth be told. \n\nNo other Asian restaurant in the area can compare to their quality and value in my opinion.
