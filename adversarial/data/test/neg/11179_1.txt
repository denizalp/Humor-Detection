I have been here quite a while. Had the best experience all these time untill the last two.. i have always came here during  the day which i may say it was awesome  the staff kept up with everything(food, drinks, refill) always checking  in on us. Each time  we always  hit the  bar after words. Till i went during  the evening place was pack and had a group  of 9. -.- lets start  by saying the server  didn't  show up to often. We all order food at once  so we wouldn't confuse  him. He had a smile  on his face but knew something  was wrong. Only 3 plates  showed  up when good came and when wr ask him where the rest was he replied  by saying he forgot. An average  drink took about 15 min.  And we had to hunt our server down for our  tab. At the end we still think its a awesome  place but will not go at night, it sucks.!
