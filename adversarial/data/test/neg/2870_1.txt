i've been here many times and I've always had a good time. Me and my peoples we always stay at the same room. they got the electronic dice game here its pretty fun. The suites are pretty nice and are at a good price. I wish they would have more suite options for some non gamblers. unfortunately I dont gamble here enough to get the good rooms. it may be a while before we stay at the venetian again because we are venturing off to try other suites. But I have nothing bad to say about this place at all.. Overall good place to eat, party, swim and sleep.
