Stopped here on the way to get my windows tinted on my new car today and the service was pretty fast but the reason for only 4 stars is the waitress was a bit all over the place with bringing our food but, had to wait on the pancakes instead of bringing them with our order & when asking she said don't worry they're coming SMH we had a good breakfast overall though and will be back
