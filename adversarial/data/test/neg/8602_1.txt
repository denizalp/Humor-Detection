I would've given a 4 stars if not for the horrible green tea mochi ice cream.. It was one of the worst ever! However, the main course was pretty good.  If you like more flavor,  all you need to do is ask for the spicy sauce in oil!  I ordered a Singapore mei fun with vegetables and eggs and it turned out great so I would totally recommend it for vegetarians. My boyfriend ordered chicken and fish fried rice and he really liked it too. Overall, a good place for main courses especially late in the night!!
