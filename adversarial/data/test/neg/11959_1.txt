Recent retirees from Washington state (rainy side) so we don't know many local contractors nor much about awnings. Mike spent about 45 minutes with me doing the original estimate. Answered all my questions thoroughly and provided good suggestions for our situation. We have a golf course view and were a little concerned about the awning blocking view when extended. He was able to represent the eye level and shadow line the awning would provide which helped with our decision.\n   We had a tentative schedule for approx. six weeks out (awning needed to be made to order) and had a little communication hiccup when we hadn't heard anything at seven weeks. Mike responded appropriately right away, and gave us a firm installation date which worked for us. \n   On install, showed up on time. Very polite and professional and came up with a clean installation we just love. He asked questions during the install (height of mounting brackets, height of front bar with awning extended, etc.) to make sure we would b happy with the final result. We asked for some adjustments in level (our patio slopes slightly but the view fence is level so the reference to level was important to my wife and I who are particular about such things. Mike made all these adjustments cheerfully and it was clear he wanted us to be happy with the product. He assured us if we needed further adjustments he would be out promptly to make them without charge. He fully explained how to take care of the awning (almost maintenance free), wind load issues and reassured me BBQ smoke would not be an issue in our situation.\n   Price was exactly as quoted and work was top notch. Square D was at the upper end of price in the research we did, but quality ratings were very high and I believe we absolutely got what we paid for. Ours was a particularly long and heavy awning and I think the house will come down before the awning does. Did a great job and would highly recommend Mike and Square D Awnings
