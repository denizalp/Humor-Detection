This had been on our list of restaurants to visit and decided to take advantage of restaurant week. As expected they were packed but the service was great and didn't feel rushed. \n\nWe ordered the Duck 2 ways and scotch egg for appetizers, salmon and shrimp & scallops for the main course and cheesecake and brulee for desert. The smoked duck breast was delicious and could've had a whole plate of that. The main courses were also really good.
