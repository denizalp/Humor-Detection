Food was pretty standard.. Almost $60 for two of us not including the tip. Our wait to be seated was about an hour. They were missing quite a few items that you would usually find in an outback steakhouse in your neighborhood. As to be expected in the strip the prices are more expensive. I would pass on outback.. might as well hit up something you wouldn't find in your neighborhood if you're going to pay almost as must as some of the other restaurants in the strip.
