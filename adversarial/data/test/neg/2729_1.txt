I've been going to Dr. Ha for over 5 years.  He is extremely knowledgeable and very professional and courteous to deal with.   He remembers me and our children every year.   It is hard to fake caring about your patients and so I see and feel he cares about me and my family.   His front office staff today is very friendly and professional.  His office is always clean and maintained.   If you want healthy eyes, go to Dr. Ha!
