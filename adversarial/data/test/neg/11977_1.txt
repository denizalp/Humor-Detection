Nice relaxing place.  Good sized bar\/lounge that gets very busy on the weekends.  Nice outdoor patio & they have a private dining room for special events.  Been a couple of times for dinner.  Loved the pasta with wild boar bolognese, seafood bouillabaisse.  The service is hit or miss.  I've had a couple of dishes over salted - the crab ravioli & risotto.  Nice beer & wine list.  We loved the cocktails here.  Overall a good west side bistro.
