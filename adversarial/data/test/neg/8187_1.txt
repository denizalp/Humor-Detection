I try to avoid going to this location. However, sometimes they have items that are not available at other locations. Their restrooms are a case of hit and miss. Sometimes they're clean sometimes they aren't so I just avoid going there at all. This current visit we went to buy some liquor and paid at the cigarette department. The cashier they assigned there is under 21 years old so we took forever before we could check out. This is a busy location and getting another associate to ring up items on her behalf can take 10 minutes at least. It's really not a big deal that she's under 21 but doesn't common sense dictate that since that department also displays alcohol, it just makes so much more sense to assign a cashier that can actually ring up alcohol.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE: #4
