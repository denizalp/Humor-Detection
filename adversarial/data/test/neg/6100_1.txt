Enjoyed two fabulous lunches at this beautiful restaurant inside the Golden Nugget with great decor inside or views overlooking the busy pool area with huge shark tanks..  The chicken Marsala wAs one of the best I've ever had, rich and delicious atop of tender risotto.  The side veggies the chef made for us included various squash, which was super fresh and perfectly all dente.  The pizza was good though a little soggy.  The service and the wine list was superb.  Best of all, it doesn't not break your piggy bank.  I look forward to returning.
