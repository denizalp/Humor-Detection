Great restaurant and dining experience. We went at 5:30 on a Sunday and we sat at the counter because we didn't have a reservation. The server asked if we had any food allergies or restrictions. I'm vegetarian and he listed 5-7 things that I could order off the menu. My Paloma was delicious! I highly recommend the nachos, mango salad, and cauliflower tacos. My husband loved his pork tacos.This meal was the perfect way to start our vacation in Montreal! It was one of the best meals I've had in a long time.
