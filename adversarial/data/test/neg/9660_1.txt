\"And in the end\nThe love you take\nIs equal to the love you make.\"\n\n~ Lennon\/McCartney\n\nOf the three Cirque du Soleil extravaganzas I saw in as many days in Vegas last week, \"The Beatles: Love\" was the one that moved me the most.  This was unexpected, because -- although I am very, very familiar with the Beatles music -- I am not an ardent fan. This production cost over $125 million to stage, and every penny was visible on stage -- and audible, with six hand-tuned speakers in every seat-back.  Fantastic choreography, dazzling costumes, incredible sets, and of course, the amazing and thrilling acts that distinguish Cirque du Soleil from any other company performing today. Highly recommended.
