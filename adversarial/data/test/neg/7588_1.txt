We went there as a group of 12. The food was delicious and the sauce was unique, especially the XO sauce.\n\nHowever, the service is terrible there. Sure they pour out the beer in front of us, but that doesn't do anything if the rest of the service is slow and takes several minutes between dishes to come out. It just left most of us hungry and impatient.\n\nThe icing on the cake is that they have the gut to force us to pay 10% in an extremely unfriendly matter. Because the service was slow, I tipped very little, but she kept insisting I have to pay more even though it was apparent I was reluctant.\n\nAnyways, suffice to say, they have good food, but they focus too much on money and not the service itself.
