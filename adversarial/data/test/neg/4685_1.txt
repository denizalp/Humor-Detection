Excellent place to eat!  We were treated with such kindness on our visit! The wonder gave us a  coffee and baklava to eat after our meal.  I ate their combo plate as I couldn't decide what to have as it all looked delectable!\n\nThey make their pita's HOMEMADE along with the hummus!  Don't MISS OUT on passing by this deli!!!\n\nAlso a MUST try is the lemonade!!!  Why???  It is sweetened with honey and rose water!
