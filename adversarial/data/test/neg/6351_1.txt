Not sure why the BAD reviews? I have had 2 iPhone screens replaced. Reasonably priced @$80 and 2 day turn around. Not sure why people think they are going to have a brand new device or console unless they pay for it. My wife and kids have both dropped their phones and shattered the screen. Apple wants to replace for $200 and a simple screen replace has been well worth it. Thx guys!
