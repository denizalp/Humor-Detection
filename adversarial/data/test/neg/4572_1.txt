First let me tell I'm extremely easy to please and also think almost anything is really cool. Now that being said I loved this experience. I thought it was fun and enjoyed the guide we had. They all were very nice in the shop and never tried to make me purchase anything I didn't want to. I loved the exhibits. It was so cool to see them up close. If you are a major marvel fan it's a great time. Probably a little boring for kids as there are only a few interactive things for youngsters. They do have skill challenges but they seem to be better for older ones. All in all I loved it.
