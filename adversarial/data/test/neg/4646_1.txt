Sadly, I just moved out. I absolutely loved living here for the two years I spent here. The price is so reasonable. The grounds are very clean. The manager in the office is so kind and helpful. Whenever I would put in a request, they would almost immediately fix it. It's an awesome area especially if you are a runner, you're only about a mile from Kiwanis park and the canal. The maintenance guy was my absolute favorite. He always said good morning and was so kind! I will miss this place greatly!
