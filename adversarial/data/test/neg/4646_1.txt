Liz is awesome! I dscovered her years ago when she worked at a salon on 24th St.  I was so pleased with what she did with my hair that I sought her out when that salon closed.  I was thrilled when she opened Good Hair Day and have been going there ever since.  I take my 3 kids there too and they all love Liz and her salon.  One of my daughters has been sick lately and Liz offered to do a complimentary color and cut for her to help her feel better.  It worked!  Thanks Liz!
