First time at new place in my neighborhood. Love the decor and 80s theme (was an 80s teenager). We had the scallops, frittes, mushrooms, and skirt steak.  All were well prepared, well presented, great portion size for sharing.   Delicious w lots of flavor.  The apple tart for dessert was huge and delicious.  Love the music and movies.  Good beer and wine selection. Excellent service, Susan (I believe that was her name) was witty and helpful with the menu.   Definitely coming back.
