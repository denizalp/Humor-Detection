First time going here. We ordered different dishes including a plate of chicken noodles which I absolutely loved. The place was busy so we knew it's a good spot to eat some Indian food. The waiter was good. Only complaint was there were no tissues or dryer in the bathroom so after washing my hands I had to air dry lol But definitely a good spot for some good Indian food.
