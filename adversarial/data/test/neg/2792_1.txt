What an experience.  Our table of 9 had two autentic Italian hotties serving us, a wonderful serenading band around us and Rome-inspired delicacies. \n\nThe missing star is due to the outrageous prices of the regular menu items and wines.  However, take into account it is Vegas.\n\nI snacked on the Tenderloin Medalions and drifted off to Italian heaven.  The canoli is also worth noticing, mainly for it's beautiful presentation (sugar glass strands encased it), but also for the taste.\n\nbuona appetito!
