We've made it a weekly thing!  Drinks are strong and if you are a lady on Wednesday night, HALF OFF!  Makes a huge difference.  If you tip, from the beginning, you will get great service.  The place is ALWAYS packed, usually a nice looking crowd.  Love going when the live band is on, but saturday night dj rocks.  Bartenders, especially Mike, are lovely and FUN.  Great place to meet locals and some wandering tourists.
