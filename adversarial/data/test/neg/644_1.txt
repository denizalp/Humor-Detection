The only reason why I gave this place 1 star is because my waiter was decent (barely).  \nIt honestly makes me sad to see locally owned restaurants with exquisite cuisine go out of business, while chains that only care about revenue and nothing about food, thrive. \nMy bf and I were starving so we ordered tons of wings, pizza and pulled pork sliders. \nLet me just say, we waited appx. 40 minutes for our food and it wasn't even busy. Okay , I am an adult so I can wait, I have patience. What I can't handle is waiting 40 minutes for food and have it completely cold! As if it was made 40 minutes ago and was just sitting in the back. \n \nI always take pictures when I go out to eat, but this food wasn't even worth the flash. Both my boyfriend and I were so annoyed that we left without finishing our food. A rarity.\n\nOverall: WILL NEVER RETURN. I only wish this place on my worst enemies :)
