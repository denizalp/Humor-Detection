This place is tiny and its a liitle bit in the cutties...this is another one of them down places. So Foofoo warning in effect. \n\nStart with koolaid but get some water to cut it. This is the sweetest koolaid ever. Its good....i think the ratio is 1 jar of Water, one pack of koolaid, one pound of sugar! Lol!\n\nThe waffle is great. The chicken.....awesome. \n\nDesert was amazing! Banana pudding was off the hook.\n\nIm mobile.so sorry i can't write too much more but this place is worth stopping at if you're ever in phoenix. Comfortable great music great food.
