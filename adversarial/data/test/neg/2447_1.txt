Our experience at LVMS was and is always good.    We have been coming here for many years for NASCAR, DUEL IN THE DESERT and other race events.  We always have very good service at the events.  This September was the 1st race for September.  OMG it was HOT. The evening races were very comfortable as far as the weather, however the day races, were so darn hot. We were able to keep somewhat cool with our cooling rags and various vendors were grasious enough to submerge our cooling rags in ice cold water, which helped alot.  There are a few different car events around the track to partake in.  We always enjoy our time here.
