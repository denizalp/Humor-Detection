The facility itself is nice, as there are no cages and you can watch your dog being groomed.  However, the grooming itself is not up to par.  I asked for \"Top of the head short, cut under the chin, and a couple inches off his body\".   As you can tell from the picture of before and after, the cut was completely dis-proportionate, and there are many parts where his bare skin is showing.   He also had a small cut on his stomach.  The only positive is the cage less aspect.  We will not be returning.\n\nEdit to owner:  You can't correct taking the hair off his body down to the skin and you can't correct a cut on the stomach.  Another point that I forgot to add was that when they asked for payment AND gratuity before the service was completed.   I've never come across a business that asks for a tip before service is completed.
