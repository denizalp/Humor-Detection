Yesterday was my boyfriends birthday and I surprised him with a hot air balloon ride. I hate airplanes and am very afraid of heights so I have no idea why I decided to go along but I am SO GLAD I did! The experience was one of a kind. It felt like floating, there was nothing rough or scary and the ENTIRE staff was so kind. The pilot would tell stories and point out interesting things but it wasn't too much or distracting from the experience. You can tell they go above and beyond in everything they do. It was well worth the money and I plan on going again.
