This is one of my favorite brunch places in vegas.  The food is good, and the place is so pretty and sunlit.  I usually get the pancakes and they are good!  \n\nThis place is worth checking out for breakfast...its just so pretty and perfect to sit here on a nice spring\/summer day in vegas.  I love it.
