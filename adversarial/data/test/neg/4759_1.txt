I've been coming here for years for pedicures and for the past year I've been getting acrylics done by them. The techs who do the pedicures are great. The massages are long and wonderful. But this sad review is about the finger nail techs. The last couple times I've come in my acrylic nails have turned out average. Not great and not exactly what I was looking for but okay. This last time however, was a complete nightmare. I don't have a specific nail tech that I go to because I like a pretty basic nail. Short and square, but apparently these two words were not in my techs vocabulary. To start off, I have very thin nails and so the power tool they use on bare nails before they put the acrylic on is rough for mine so usually the tech will go over my nails lightly. She did not. She let the tool burn me and wear down my nails multiple times after I told her that I was uncomfortable. Because she made my nails thiner than when I came in, the hardening acrylic sent a burning sensation through my finger tips. I'm no expert in the world of nails but I'm sure it's because my nails were too thin. She was too rough with filing my nails into the wrong rectangle shape and to top it all off the paint job is horrendous. Bubbles in the paint and uneven color. I come to get pampered and to be listened to and leave happy. Not with burning nails that I'm not happy with. I will get my acrylics else where.
