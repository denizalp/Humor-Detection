We visit this location at least once a week, and every time the food isn't fresh I usually have to request a fresh batch of chow mein cause it's dry or mushy which my son won't eat, plus the broccoli and beef was brown and mushy, seems like it's been sitting there in the pan for a while, and the string bean chicken breast was that I got old brown string beans with 2 pieces of chicken, seems like every time I visit I have to wait at least 5 min for someone to greet or even acknowledge that your just standing there to get served! And waiting 10 minutes for fresh food! But I visit here cause it's close to where I live!
