Custard is amazing. Burgers are mediocre at best. Staff is not friendly. Last two time I was there: once the lobby was closed at 8:00 huge drive thur line with one person working inside. Second time we went at 9:40 and they decided they would close early on a Friday night? So I am a little irritated with their service.
