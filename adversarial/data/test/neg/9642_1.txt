After seeing a Rowe custom sofa I liked in here for $2,400 two weeks ago, I was excited when I saw the Sale sign in the window for floor model sofas. Well, the sofa in question had been marked up to 2,550 and was now \"on sale\" for 2,400.\n\nWhile the place has decent furniture, these kind of tactics do not inspire confidence in the integrity of this business.
