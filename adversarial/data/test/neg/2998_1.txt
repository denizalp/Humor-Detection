Went here today, second time 8\/12\/26. Please thank all who worked today. Great job!! This place had energy\/ Flavors and draft beer specials. Everything was excellent!!! We really enjoyed our stir fry with shrimp and a draft beer San Tan Mr. Pineapple. They have many sauces at the condiment bar, so you create what your\npalate craves... So yummy! With unbeatable specials we will make this a staple! Thanks again for the great meal and service.
