Recommended to me by a colleague and must say, it was an enjoyable dining experience (3.5 rounded up). \n\nThe good (Chinese dishes loosely translated): cold noodle with chicken is delicious, the baos (while not perfect) are decently sized and juicy with a fairly thin dough, mushroom in a clay pot had an awesome spicy flavour. \n\nThe mediocre: minced pork with braised eggplant (way too sweet), xiao long bao (juicy pork filled dumplings, come in 10s in a bamboo steamer). \n\nThe ambiance is great, one of the better decorated Chinese restaurants and servingware \/ restaurant as a whole is pristinely clean (thumbs up!) \n\nThe pricing is moderately pricy so more of a place to treat friends and family. Will be back!
