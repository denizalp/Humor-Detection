One star off for the \"modernized\" pool they bagged about on their website and hotels.com. It was merely a small pool that wasn't as nice as the pictures. Other than that, the valet service was very fast and it's a short walk to both Notre Dame, Old Town and Chinatown (all three places that my boyfriend and I frequented the three days we stayed there) It was a reasonable price and nice rooms. The wifi didn't work well in our room so I spent most of my time sitting in front of the bathroom to get signal, other than that, the concierege was helpful and I would stay here again for sure.
