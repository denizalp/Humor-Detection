Rob, the owner, greeted me at the door as if we've been lifelong friends. I was in Phoenix for work and wanted a Workout other than the hotel gym. Super stoked I found CrossFit Uru. The drop in rate was super reasonable. The gym was well equipped and clean. The location was convenient and the programming was excellent. I'll be back. Thanks Rob!
