Excellent Japanese take out food.\nI ordered grilled steak,shrimp,veggies with noodles. It was a great alternative to Chinese food. Good size portions & friendly service. Hope restaurant does well. Definitely worth a visit. Menu appears to have some variety, if you enjoy steak, shrimp, scallops, etc...
