Service is okay and food is below average and pricey. Shrimp bowl had very small shrimp and drink came out slowly and incorrectly, server made up for it by bringing the correct item (for free) which was nice. Overall drinks were 7\/10 but food was 2\/10. However, it took 15+ minutes after I was done eating to bring the bill. Try other choices when at CLT.
