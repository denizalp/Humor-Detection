The best experience during our recent trip to Vegas. Located at the Venetian Hotel.\n\nWe went here during happy hour. Definitely worth it! Took advantage of the oysters deal $1.50 (minimum of 6) and the balsamic strawberry drink for $7. LIIITTTTTT!\n\nHighly recommend making a stop here if you are in vegas and down for some oysters (that aphrodisiac before you hit the strip clubs lol)
