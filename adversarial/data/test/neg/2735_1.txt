We visited Little Piggy's recently for a company gathering. Considering the neighbourhood, the prices seemed a bit outrageous initially, but in the end we were quite satisfied. Most items are very shareable and you would probably have the best experience if you come here in a group of 4-6 people. \n\nWe tried the beef BBQ for 3 (~$70) which came with a plethora of sides. Realistically this was more than enough meat for 5 people to share. In addition we ordered the seafood pancake, LA style ribs and bibimbap. As a big bibimbap fan I was left a bit disappointed by the one served here, but most of the other dishes\/ sides were spot on. The LA style short ribs were well seasoned and just saucy enough without making a mess, and the seafood pancake had just the right balance. In addition the service, cleanliness and chic ambiance made for an overall pleasant experience. \n\nOverall, this isn't the typical Bloor St. Korean join you're used to, but that may actually be a good thing for once.
