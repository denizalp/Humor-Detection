This place was great.  Had the octopus salad and got a second order to go.  Had the Sushi hot roll and it was outstanding.   The proprietor, Chai, was a blast and he not only made the Sushi, but kept us entertained with jokes and banter.  If you are in the area give this place a try,  you will not be disappointed.
