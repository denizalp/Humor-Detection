bought a total kitchen package $3000.00 worth for 4 appliances. first delivery fridge door was dented and the microwave was missing a mounting nut in microwave to hang on cabinets. called salesman no problem, he set up for a new fridge and microwave to be delivered great i thought till the idiots from delivery showed up and argued with my wife. they wanted to just change door on fridge she said no we were to get the new fridge they brought out. that is what the salesman said and the new microwave so they get all bent out of shape just threw the old microwave in the old box. you could hear it thud as it hit bottom. then proceeded to remove the fridge, broke parts off the back of it. damaged the door frame on my front door then broke off the corner of my concrete side walk to cut thru the yard. called the delivery dept.manager complained, also called customer service said they started a insurance claim and i would be hearing from them within 48 hours. well it has been now been over a month and no call. i sent another email to them and still no response. i guess once they have your money they are just like every one else, you are on your own tough luck ( forgot to mention they gave me a $200.00 gift card when i purchased the package which is useless to me i will not by anything from them again) so its a buyers gamble one i will never take again.
