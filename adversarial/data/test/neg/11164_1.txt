I like everything about this place.  The menu was full of fresh, seasonal ingredients.  The dishes were interesting without trying to hard to be unusual or edgy.  Portions are reasonable, but not gigantic.  This leaves room for the super fun, house-made deserts (no lava cake!!!!).\n\nService was pleasant, but not pushy.  The atmosphere was relaxed, but elegant.  The space retains some of the features of its former incarnation, yet it feels bright and modern.\n\nThis would be a great place for a date.
