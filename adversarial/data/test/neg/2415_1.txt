I've been to Target about 4 times since moving here 3 weeks ago, because it's the closest huge store to my house. And each and every time that I have been here, the employees are Ruder than shit. They walk right by you, they don't acknowledge you, they don't say hi to you, they don't smile, nothing. And nobody offers to help you out with anything, either. And the checkers, well you might as well fire all of them and start over again because they're either too old, or too dumb to know how to ring people up.
