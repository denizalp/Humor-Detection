Taco love. This place passes all my requirements.  Local, family owned, real ethnic food, and yes divey. Not divey in bad way. \n\nWhen the fork goes in the crunch is audible. Chicken Chimichanga was crunchingly condiment ally perfect.  Yes I make up words. Ample sour cream guac and salsa.  Block building, check, daughter of the owner smilingly serving perfection, check, not in a strip mall? Check check!!  \n\nTry everything, it's a command.
