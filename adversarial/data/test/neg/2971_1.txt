I came here with my best friend to get a manicure and pedicure.  We got in pretty quickly without much wait.  \n\nA middle-aged guy with tattoos was my technician.  I sat next to my best friend but could barely hear her due to his loud talking on his cellphone. He reeked of cigarette smoke and his fingers were dirty. He quickly did my nails without much care.  The polish was uneven and blotchy and looked like a 4-year-old did it.\n\nI told the guy that my toenail was messed up and asked him to fix it.  He attempted to fix it, but it still came out looking badly. \n\nI came with my best friend, and her manicure and pedicure ended up looking pretty nice. I called the next day and spoke with another man, who I believe to be the owner.  I told him about the poor service and he told me to come back and we could have another technician redo my nails free of charge, which was nice of him to do. I never bothered taking him up on his offer.  Due to my experience here, I will likely not return.
