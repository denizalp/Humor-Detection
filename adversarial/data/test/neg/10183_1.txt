Bundled up against a cold night (yup, we have 'em here in Vegas too!), my family and I headed out for a night out in between holidays this past week. After driving past this Applebee's numerous times in the Boca Park shopping center, we decided to give it a try. \n\nA hostess (Sandy? - she may have been a server as well) held the door open as we walked in and welcomed us. She promptly brought us to a great booth and informed us that Scott would be our waiter, provided us menus and  asked us to please enjoy our evening.\n\nThe restaurant, tables and floors were all clean and holiday music was playing just loud enough that if you wanted to listen, you could, but wasn't so overpowering you weren't able to have a conversation. \n\nScott came over and greeted us. He was friendly and engaging, and we were very pleased with him and our conversation throughout the evening. I highly recommend visiting and requesting this knowledgeable and engaging server.\n\nThe food came out in sequential order, fresh, hot and delicious. Our son's meal - which we ordered with the appetizer - actually beat the appetizer out. As any parent will tell you, that was a welcome surprise as know that our little one was occupied with his favorite things, the parent were able to have adult conversations and enjoy our drinks and appetizer.  \n\nAs parents of a toddler, we were in no rush to return home on one of our few nights out. We leisurely ate our appetizer and though he had  our dinner orders, Scott held entering them into the kitchen until we were ready. \n\nI ordered a steak-shrimp combo from the 550-calorie menu and my husband ordered a bacon cheeseburger. We ordered both items medium and the meats were cooked perfectly. Our son's burger was also done properly and served in a basket that was not hot to the touch (unlike some restaurants that forget that they're delivering plates to tiny tender hands).\n\nScott kept the table clean and neat throughout our dining experience and was always right on hand when we needed something like a refill or extra napkins. Not once did we have to look around to find him or deal with an empty glass or dirty plate. He was attentive and thoughtful in all his actions. As veterans of the restaurant biz, my husband and I were impressed and appreciative.\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Applebee's and plan on making this a monthly outing for the family (at minimum). We can't wait to return and look forward to another quality dining experience with a great team of FOH and BOH there.\n\nThanks, Applebee's, for making family night out delicious and delightful.  Every member of our family came home happy and full.  Special thanks to Scott as well. Can't wait to see you next time!\n\n~The Swisher Family.
