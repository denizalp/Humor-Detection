As a race fan of most types of motor sports all roads in Vegas eventually end up at LVMS. I have seen drag racing, road course, Champ car (INDY), Nastruck and drifting here. As far as I can tell most of the facilities are top notch compared to other race courses I've been to across the country. At this latest event (Formula Drift) they had the usual vendors and auto related stuff. Concessions at event like this will generally cost more than normal like $4 for a bottle of water. This place has come a long way when it use to be only a beat down drag strip and a bull ring off of Las Vegas Blvd. when I was in high school.
