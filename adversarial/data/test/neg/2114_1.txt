So pleased now that I have finally tried this place. I am rarely in this area but now I will go out of my way to come eat here for Sunday Brunch. I had vegan French toast and it tasted like the simple and wonderful classic before Veganism. But the buffet did me dirty. The overwhelming joy consumed me as I ate all the different sides. There was some Asian peanut noodle dish kinda thing that really stood out for me. I'm still so full, probably won't eat til next Sunday so I can come back with an even bigger appetite.
