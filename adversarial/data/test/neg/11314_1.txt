Jodi is amazing! The home birth of my son was very beautiful, very intense, very powerful and very long. I was in labor for 75 hours and after all of that work, he was taken from my arms to the ER at just two hours old due to respiratory problems (that could have happened anywhere - home or hospital). I was too weak from blood loss and exhausted from such a long delivery that I could not go. My heart was broken and on top of that I was struggling with baby blues, especially as a first time mom, but my decision to schedule with The Placenta Lady was the best decision I had made for my postpartum recovery! \nWhen Jodi arrived, she brought with her a breath of fresh air and strength! She did some beautiful prints first and then began the encapsulation process. She was a delight to talk to, answered all of our questions and even gave us a placenta tutorial - mainly because we were so intrigued! \nI was thrilled to have all of the health benefits from encapsulating my placenta, but that wasn't even the best part. Jodi was! I realized what I needed most wasn't just the health benefits, it was the conversation, laughter, knowledge, experience, network and now friendship that has transpired from our appointment. \nI am now 6 weeks postpartum, 4 weeks into taking my placenta encapsulation and having met Jodi, and I am feeling so much better physically, mentally and emotionally. I have energy, my strength returned quickly and I am enjoying every precious moment of my son's life. \nI am very grateful for Jodi and The Placenta Lady. I highly recommend her services. The Placenta Lady is so much more than just placenta encapsulation - it is genuine interaction, with a genuine person who genuinely cares about your health and wellbeing!
