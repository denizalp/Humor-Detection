A few tasty dishes. Enjoyed the beef and tuna tataki, and some of the rolls. Would definitely recommend going during Hapa Hour from 5:30-6:30 when a selection of menu items is on for half price. Combine this with the Thursday drink special on martini-type drinks (1oz for $5 and 2oz for $7.50) and you have a great combo!
