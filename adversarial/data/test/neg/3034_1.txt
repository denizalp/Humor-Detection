Just tried this place out this morning for the first time. It may not be the most modern up to date decor but what makes it so special is the fantastic service!! My husband and I both ordered the daily breakfast special and it was delicious- too much food for me which is always nice because you know the value is superb!! The cook is a wonderfully warm woman who took a brief moment to come out and chit chat. She's a doll!! We will definitely be back!!!
