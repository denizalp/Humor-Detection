FANTASTIC Thai food.\n\nChada has a massive menu with some seriously good dishes at incredibly reasonable prices. \n\nOur server recommended four dishes, we ordered them all, I regret nothing.\n\nCrispy beef (Moo Kham Whan) was mouth-wateringly flavorful, super crispy and fresh. Heavily seasoned with cilantro, lime, mint, chili and red onion.\n\nCrab curry--takes like ocean-flavored red curry. And with little nests of vermicelli noodles, it's a must-try. \n\nGrilled pork with spicy chili sauce (Pla Nua Tod) and the sauteed mushrooms with brussels sprouts (Pad Hed) were also very good. \n\nI really can't recommend this place enough.
