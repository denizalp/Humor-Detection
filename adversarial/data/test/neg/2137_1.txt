Great breakfast food all around.  Love the eggs benedict with potato pancakes, and yes, they do give you sour cream and applesauce.  I also love the omletes but they are made with 5 eggs.  You can ask for a smaller portion and it should be less $.  I just love this place for breakfast but it can be a bit pricey.
