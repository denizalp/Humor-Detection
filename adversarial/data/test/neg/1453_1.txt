One word, EXCELLENT!  We were here on vacation and the 6 of us went for dinner and all of us had a fantastic meal.  From the bread to entrees, it was all top notch.  Everyone had a great meal and I would highly recommended this restaurant to ANYONE.  If you are in Montreal please be sure to attend this restaurant, the steaks were some of the best we have ever had!!!
