In reviewing this place I see there was a Costa Verde that was on Oakwood, near Rogers. I don't know if it's still open and this is another store they opened, or if they closed that one up, but either way recently this place opened up on Eglinton near Keele.\n\nNot much choice for good food in that neighbourhood, so while walking by I noticed how nice, clean and inviting it looked. And the smells coming out of it, hot damn.\n\nSo went in one night on a whim, they had tons of meat on the grill, everything smelled great.\n\nI didn't know what to order, size wise, so I ordered a whole chicken + large sized potatoes as a side.\n\nBig mistake. The wife and I couldn't even finish HALF of it, it was huge! But so cheap, only $17 all together, which means next time we go and get half sizes, it'll be less than $10. Insane!\n\nThe potatoes are TO DIE FOR OMG, and the chicken was moist, tender, and tasty. The sauce they put on it was great, they'll ask you medium or spicy, go with spicy as it's flavorful but not really spicy at all. It's not the BEST Portugese Churrasqueira style chicken on the planet but it's REALLY good. \n\nPlace was super clean, staff super friendly, I will be going back for sure. \n\nNote: Take out only, there is no seating.
