The heartbreak! We were so excited to dine here and thought we were lucky that a table on the terrace had just opened up, little did I know we should have kept walking.\n\nThe place was full and bustling, the server was kind, but that was the high point of the meal. We split a beef carpaccio, at $24\/portion for an appetizer. The portion was big enough considering they piled enough salad to help fill the plate, the problem is that the carpaccio had been left to sit on ice or something, resulting in it being watery and flavorless. \n\nOur mains (two types of veal scallopini were meager portions served with minimal vegetables (literally, one piece of potato, one piece of cauliflower, same for broccoli) and a flavorless sauce. We had to ask for another sauce just to try and make it worth eating. The dish was a total rip off with nothing of substance to justify the price or the time we waited for our meals.\n\nIn the end, $150 for a low end bottle of wine and flavorless carpaccio and veal. We both left the restaurant disappointed and STILL HUNGRY. Incredibly disappointing and entirely a waste of money considering the quality of restaurant available a block away.
