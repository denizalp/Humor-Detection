Have been coming here since the store opened.  I was a customer at the Lawrenceville salon but changed to Wexford.  My hair color is perfection and I always get comments on how nice my hair looks.    The staff is absolutely wonderful.  I can say enough good things about Isle of You.  I highly recommend them.
