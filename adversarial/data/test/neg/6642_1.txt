Absolutely horrible!!!!! Walked in seemed like a nice place I asked them if they had time for 2 pedicures sure no problem. Great picked my color went and sat down I sit with my feet in the water for 20 mins my friend is getting ready to be massaged and polished and not one person comes to say be with you soon, nothing. The water is cold by this point I'm impatient and over even getting a pedicure we weren't looking to go one at a time so I opt to not get one since she's in the home stretch of hers. So other people that would have had to wait an hour got to go ahead of me I noticed they never gave them a time frame either. So I'm waiting for her to finish and this woman walks over and rips the lining out of the tub and then pulls the plug on the massage wow that's no way to get someone to ever come back the reviews of awful customer service so true. Won't ever be back so sad beautiful place ugly staff!
