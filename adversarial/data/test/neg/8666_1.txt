I had heard about Sushi Samba for a while and finally got a chance to try it.  It was definitely worth the try for it's unique blend of South American and Japanese flavors.  The meats (Kobe) and grilled fish (sea bass) are spot on.  The unique spices and flavors are really good.  Most of all, the rolls and sashimi (Otoro... drooolllll) were spot on, very fresh and very flavorful.
