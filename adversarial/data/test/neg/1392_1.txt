Some great pizza and beer at this spot! We have been coming here for years and it never disappoints. Great happy hour as well. Their pizza is delicious, but don't forget about the soft pretzels & marinara, make sure to order their friend beer cheese to accompany them....yum. You won't want to miss out on those bad boys....
