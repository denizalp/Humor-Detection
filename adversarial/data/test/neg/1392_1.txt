I just recently moved to las vegas and i was so afraid of leaving my fur baby with anyone. From the moment i placed my first phone call to this business, they have changed my life. My (Max) was so shy to be around other dogs, but now since he attends daycare he is an actual dog now..(lol). Their prices are affordable and they absolutely take great care of my baby. I love the LIVE FEED and just being able to watch his every move from my phone. Thank you to the entire staff for taking great care of my baby and keep up the great work!!!!!!!!!
