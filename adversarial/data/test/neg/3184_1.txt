Our visit to this nail salon today was for my daughter's 10th birthday. I am extremely disappointed with the manner in which they conducted business. \nThey took my daughter to the pedi chair while I had to sit up front. They never offered a seat for me near her so I just walked back & forth to take pictures. Our appointment was made for a basic mani-pedi, we picked out the colors she wanted, and I explained to \"Crystal\" exactly what she wanted. On one of my trips back for photos, I noted that every single toe had a flower painted on. \nI know, from experience, that this is not normally in the basic pricing. So I spoke to a woman at the front desk. I explained the situation and she said to me, \"Oh no, we do that for the little girls, it's included\". I again mentioned that I was concerned because it was every toe. She again stated for me not to worry. I later learned this woman's name was, \"Kim\" and she was the manager. \nAnd then, of course, we got the ticket and I was being charged an extra $5 for the embellishments. I questioned the young girl checking me out and she summoned Kim. In turn, Kim went to the back to speak with Crystal. Kim returns to the desk and states that Crystal says she asked my permission and the employee next to Crystal confirmed that she asked me. \nI was VERY unhappy. I told Kim that was an outright lie. Not only had I not been asked, but nobody spoke a single word to me at all, ever. \nI explained that it wasn't the $5 but the point that this was bad business and myself now being called a liar. Kim then offered to take my daughter to the back and remove the flowers. \nAre you kidding me???\nAfter more words and lies, Kim took the $5 charge off. She was not nice about it nor was she professional or friendly. \nI paid the bill.....and I even still tipped \"Crystal\" after she lied about asking my permission. Why tip? Because I have class. And because I believe she told a blatant lie out of fear of losing her job. And I believe in tipping even when service is bad. \nI then asked to speak with the owner. Guess where \"Tony\" the owner was? Sitting right next to the front desk the entire time, witnessing that entire interaction, never once stepping in. Unbelievable. Completely unprofessional and again, BAD business. \nI told Tony I was disappointed in the fact the he witnessed all of the above & never offered to intervene. He said, \"Well, Kim is my manager\". I said, \"Yes, but you own this establishment and I think you should have stepped in when I was being called a liar\". I also explained that we were here to celebrate my daughter's 10th birthday and this was an awful experience for her now. All we got was, \"I'm sorry\". \nUgh. \nI'm still very upset and hope this review serves to save some of you from a similar experience. Obviously, we will never return to this place of poor business.
