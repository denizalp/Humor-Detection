Stayed here once before clean room, but the window was to small. The second stay the view blew me away. BEAUTIFUL!!! I did not want to leave the hotel. My room was simply amazing, overtop, could not stay anywhere else after my last trip. \nLink below of my youtube review of my recent trip. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3b8RrmJPBso
