Quite possibly the worst CHASE in Vegas. 15ppl in line on a holiday Friday and you have one teller open. I'm standing in line watching the other tellers discuss what their weekend plans are while the rest of us ARE TRYING TO get our banking done. I promise to close my account with chase with suck horrible customer service. Oh yeah tried the drive up and rang the bell 5 times. I looked and made eye contact with a teller but she still refused to answer my call button. Horribly run.
