Meh. The fries were very good. It's supposed to be unlimited but you will be hard pressed to be able to have them come fill up your glass with a second cup of water. So the unlimited fries is basically 1 refill because they take forever to refill, as in 20-30 minutes. The little red blinking light to summon your server is a farce. I turned it off after 15-20 minutes.\n\nBurgers are ok. We all ordered pink in the middle since the waiter asked. No one in our group of 3 received it pink. I got the BBQ burger which was made of bacon, patty, and some other accoutrements I can't think of. Pretty much every burger had bacon in it. Bacon is usually a filler when they cannot make it tasty using other ingredients IMO. I think avocado, or grilled onions would've made this gourmet-ish but bacon is just meh for me. Five guys burger is tastier is the verdict.\n\nI would say the server sucked but he was busy serving others and not standing around so I am going to assume the Galleria Mall RR is understaffed due to personnel shortfalls.
