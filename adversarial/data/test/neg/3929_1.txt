\"It's clean, fun, and everything works. I can't complain\". -The husband  I subtracted a star because of the complicated and expensive sort of pricing. You can't just walk-in and do everything. We were offered the opportunity to walk around and decide what we wanted to do and return to the desk to pick our package. I'm not even sure what we ended up with but we did arcade games, the bumper cars, the trampoline, and ball areas. It is easy enough to add money to your card in a machine which we did multiple times (it's easy to go crazy $$$). \n\nThe tickets load directly onto your card also which is convenient but my kiddo was a little sad when the game didn't spit out her winnings. She seemed fine once we explained they were all on her card and how many she won each time. \n\nA little more of an old school arcade feel and I would have given a 5. It was still a very fun afternoon for us and the 4 year old .
