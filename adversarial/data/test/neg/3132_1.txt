I live right next to this store so I frequent here. More because it is convenient though. The store is beautiful. But the customer service is consistently very disappointing.  The employees are grumpy and curt with customers. The prices are high but that's  Aj's for you.  Recently went to the Aj's in Scottsdale and they had \"over the top\" customer service. That's what you should expect from a store this beautiful with high prices. \nGood management = happy workers = happy customers.  Management check yourselves.
