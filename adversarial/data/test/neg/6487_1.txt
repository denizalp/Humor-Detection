Wow just reading some of the other reviews just now and they seem harsh but hey I guess that;s their experience.  My aunt and I go about once a month when we get a hankering for a waffle (when you are constantly one a diet and trying to lose weight you have to splurge a little:) and the waffles we get are quite good.  We both just go old school and get the classic waffle with some fruit on it and that's about it but the price is reasonable and they always seem done and have a nice crunch to it.  The wait time can be a little long especially for not a busy place but I think they keep just one or two people on as staff and that could make the wait time a bit slow.  Overall I think its a yummy neighborhood spot.
