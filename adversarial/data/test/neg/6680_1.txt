Amazing!! Perfect for the cold weather c: the broth was delicious, you can tell how much time they put into it and the meat was cooked to perfection. Bao were so fluffy and inventive. Staff was so friendly and helpful and everything came out quickly for a weekend dinner. Great sake collection too. Atmosphere was warm and welcoming and the design is spot on. They really put thought into everything you could think of.
