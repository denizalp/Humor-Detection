The decor certainly smacks you in the face when you enter the door. One of the better attributes is their ability to get you in and out during the lunch rush - even with a large group.\n\nTheir menu is comparable to Emiliano's in terms of style and variety but they pale in comparison from a quality standpoint.\n\nChips and salsa are OK. Overall, not a bad choice just far from my go-to in the region.
