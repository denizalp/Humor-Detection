My husband and I tied the knot in Vegas on January 25, 2015. On the 24th, the owner of the shop picked up my mom, husband, and myself and drove us to her shop. She and everyone there were wonderful. Leading up to the big weekend, I was nervous that I hadn't even tried on a wedding dress before in my life. When I got there, I fell in love with the first dress I tried on. Alterations were done on the spot, and it took no time at all. My husband also got his tux there. We didn't see each other in our wedding wear until the altar, which was nice. It's a small shop, but my privacy from my soon-to-be husband was not an issue. He was such a dapper groom! And I got more compliments on my dress than I can count (including ones from strangers in the casinos). They even gave me shoes, a garter, bracelet, and tiara that are mine to keep. I can't say enough good things about them! Try them- you won't be disappointed.
