We ended up here because they offer gluten-free crusts and my bff has celiac disease.\n\nThe atmosphere was fun - neighborhood feel and evidently live music every weekend night.\n\nThere were four of us and we all got pizzas. They were good - but not my favorite, although I blame it on having opted for the gluten-free crust. It was good - don't get me wrong - but nothing like the gluten-saturated stuff I'm accustomed to. \n\nWe gave this place a second try for takeout and my world changed - best veggie sandwich ever! It was huge, on a great roll, wit hall kinds of cooked veggies and a great marinara sauce. I crave it on a consistent basic actually. \n\nGreat options for neighborhood flare with gluten free and vegetarian options.
