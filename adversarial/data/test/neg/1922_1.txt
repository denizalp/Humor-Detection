Fast, friendly service and free suggestions for specific ages. \n\nThere have TONS OF SWEETS in here!!  While shopping, an employee was making the rounds serving samples of candies.  \n\nI found some ginormous jaw breakers, like softball sized, which I knew lil man would get a kick out of, but my good sense helped me choose a smaller one (with a stick attached) along with a bunch of other random candies.  \n\nFun store, convenient location.
