We would give this place 3.5 star cuz it was not bad but it was nothing exceptional either. We got chicken  momos and lamb choyla for appetizers and garlic chicken and chili stir fry with fish as mains.\nEverything was good but it was just not  great. The food came with rice and naan and the thing that stood out the most was the naan. They were nice and tender. \nOverall if you are craving Indian\/Nepalese\/Himalayan food you can surely check this place out just don't expect to be blown away.
