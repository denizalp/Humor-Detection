After eating here I am now on a quest to find a Mexican restaurant that is just as good & authentic in NYC. They give you two different types of salsa with your chips & the salsa is incredibly fresh. I got the a la carte chicken empanada, fish taco & green corn tamale. I really enjoyed the juicy & natural flavors of the chicken... I've never had chicken empanada this good before. The green sauce on top was just enough to add some flavor without overpowering the dish. I got the fish taco on a soft tortilla rather than a hard shell & it was really delicious. The tamale was what I would've expected out of a tamale... nothing too exciting about it but it was still good.\n\nThe place was very packed & since the restaurant is a little ways from the main road in Old Town I suspect that it was mostly locals in there (we were visiting from out of town). The restaurant was much larger on the inside than I expected so we got seated relatively quickly... and the host seemed like he had a blast working there! Service was good & we never felt rushed. I really miss this place.
