I ordered a huarache, it was 10$! Huge, can feed 2 people or even 3. Had to wait for about 20 minutes or so, since they made it from scratch. It was good, it just didn't look the the one from the picture lol The huaraches usually have long piece of meat on top. \nThey also put salsa all over and I thought the meat was too salty for my taste.
