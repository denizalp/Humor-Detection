This Hongkong Style Restaurant is better off operating in Hongkong Style business where they have hidden surprsing charges for the diners. Our bill came with an additional $5 \"COOKING CHARGE\" which our server did not inform us. All throughout the years, we have never been charged for cooking. Cheap Shot. They accepted their mistake of not informing us about it but would not reverse it. Okay so they paid $5 to lose a customer. There are other more honest restaurants. Another surprise charge is the tea charge per person which they also did not inform us. They should take their \"cheating\" ways back to Hongkong where it is a common practice.
