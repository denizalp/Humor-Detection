Stopped here for lunch after a long day of walking the strip. Saw this place on Las Vegas Magazine and it had some good reviews. I also yelped it BEFORE I came and it had my MANDATORY 4 stars! The only weird, \"negative\" thing would be the fake flowers everywhere. I kept hearing Robert Irvine from restaurant impossible in my head \"these fakes flowers gotta go!\". Other than that, no complaints whatsoever.\nService was good. Prices were good, STRIP prices, so it's not cheap, but not over the top strip prices either. Food was pretty damn good too. My cousin got the pastrami sandwich. It looked really good. Large sandwich and lots of fries. He also got the margarita with the corona in it. I'd seen those in SA (wish I got one there). He really enjoyed his meal. I got the tomato, mozzarella and basil on \"toasted\" ciabatta bread. The bread could have been toasted more (but that's my preference). The pesto was tasty. There was a really nice amount of fresh mozzarella. The tomatoes could have been better. They were a little mushy, but when eaten as a sandwich, you didnt notice. I got onion rings (LOVE THEM!!!!) as my side. They were very good. There just wasn't too much to offer vegetarians, but I would recommend and might come back!
