I've been here twice and I enjoyed both times. The first time, there was no line. I went for dinner because a student group was doing a fundraiser. The second time, today, was for lunch. There was a bit of a line and I thought it was going to go slowly but it actually moved along well.\n\nI really like the pizza crust at this place. It's better than MOD Pizza. It's thin crust. Only one size (11\"). They seem like they are pretty skimpy with the red sauce but when you get the pizza, it's actually just right.\n\nThe employees were friendly both times. I got everything I wanted. It only took about 5 minutes from paying the bill to getting both of the pizzas we ordered.\n\nThe atmosphere of the dining room is comfortable. Typical for this kind of place. They have a small patio if you're interested in sitting outside (which isn't very often in Arizona).\n\nPlenty of parking.\n\nIt's about $13 for a pizza and a drink.\n\nI plan on going back!
