The last time I visited her office was when it was located near Decatur & Flamingo. Many years ago. I wasn't impressed.The service was terrible. I had gone in for some eye irritation & all she complained about was people coming in for eye exams with make up on. (I had seen her a few weeks previous for an eye exam @ that time, with no problems.) Not happy with her I proceeded to see another Eye Dr for the same problem . This New Dr took one look @ me & was able to suggest I had a thyroid problem. She was 100% correct. Just Beware if you do decide to see her.
