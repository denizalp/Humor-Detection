disappointing for the third time\nby Kris (1 review)\nThis restaurant has potential. Great location and nicely decorated. I live in the neighbourhood and thought that I would give it another chance, hoping that the quality of food had improved from my previous visits over the past few years. Well, it hasn't. . Portions are small and food is tasteless. I ordered the vegetable and squid dish and a side order of rice noodles. When I asked for hot sauce, it appeared that I was asking too much from the waitstaff. I decided not to ask for water. I eat Vietnamese food on a regular basis but will not return.
