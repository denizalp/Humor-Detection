I wasn't even going to write a review. I actually never do. However..in the 17 minutes I've been waiting for my vodka tonic I decided to let loose. We came in bc it's across the street from our hotel. Margarita tasted like chemicals. Thursday night 9pm..maybe 30 people here. We've had 3 waitresses and it kinda smells like a frat house. I won't be back to this one.
