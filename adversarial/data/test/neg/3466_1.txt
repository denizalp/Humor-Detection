I haven't stopped thinking about this place since I left. It's everything you could ever hope for in a dive-y Mexican joint. FRESH DOUGHY TORTILLAS. I repeat GET THE BUTTERED TORTILLAS.... or 10. I mean they're $1. You can take them home and freeze them... or eat them all in a day. \n\nThe beans are just. SO BEANY AND CREAMY AND GOOD. You can't go wrong with a classic bean and cheese here. It's actually a Must. \n\nThe Machaca is a fave. It's fancy for shredded beef. So moist and flavorful I like the Machaca burrito or carne Asada myself. \n\nChips are salty and good and the guacamole is chunky! Better than expected. Not the fake smooth kind but actual real restaurant style guac.\nNow on to the salsa... a Mexican place is only as good as their salsa, right? Well I've read mixed reviews on the salsa. I will say that I did in fact enjoy it. It was heavy on the garlic but I love garlic. It's a thicker paste salsa not watery which I also prefer. Anyway, this place is a 10\/10 must try. It's fast cheap and DELICIOUS!
