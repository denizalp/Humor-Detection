There was hair in the bathtub, one of the queen size beds had a ripped bedspread and dirty sheets on it, the carpet was torn and there was a bottle cap on the floor from the previous guests. The bathroom light didn't turn on (oops! now it did turn on - no predictability) and each of the lamps (3 of them) and the little fridge was unplugged (first we think they don't work but no, they are just all unplugged). The evening desk person was very helpful and apologetic and called the manager alerting her to the issues. In talking to the manager in the morning, she said they were aware and working on things but not apologetic. Never again, never any Red Roof again.
