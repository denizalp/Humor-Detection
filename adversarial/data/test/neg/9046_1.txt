Three times the charm to line up earlier. Ordered the egg, bacon and cheese sandwiches, honey buttermilk biscuit and salted chocolate chip cookie. All delicious I'm not a fan o salted sweeties but their cookie had a touch of it which is enough to taste the salt without overwhelming the sweet. I recommend this place.
