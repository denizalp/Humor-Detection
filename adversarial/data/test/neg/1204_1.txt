If you like country gravy you will love this place. Great combo with the tenders and gravy. Huge downside if the drive thru! They have a horrible system and never enough people working. I waited 30 mins on a few occasions and had cars who arrived after me getting food first. When I asked why I was waiting so long I was told she was helping someone else and the other people took the tenders for my order before she could grab them. I'm shouldn't they fill orders in order not just who gets there first? They should also take payment when you order rather than delivering food then making another trip. \n\n***update***The tenders were always on the small side and they would get tough but tonight they were huge and super juicy! I hope they stay this way because they were so good.
