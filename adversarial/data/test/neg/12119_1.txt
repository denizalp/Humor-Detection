I really like this place. I thought the tea was very good. I had Black Rose and green tea macchiato with activated charcoal and I enjoyed both drinks. I love to support local businesses that try to offer something different, unique and original. Teaspressa definitely fits in that category. The store's decor is very cute and \"instagramable\". I just wish they would open another location closer to where I live soon.
