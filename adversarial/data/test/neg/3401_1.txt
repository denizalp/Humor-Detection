Yes I will give Amelie's five stars for their fresh delivery of their pastries. Salted caramel brownie is number one. However the sandwiches are pricey for 1 to 2 ounces of meat. Also I remember previously hearing about the employees being mistreated and not paid overtime and I do not like supporting businesses that mistreat employees.
