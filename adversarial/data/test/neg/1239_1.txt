Had Cafe Moulin on my bucket list for a while and finally got the chance to check it out. There was a wait to be seated and the cafe does not take reservations, so make sure you have time if you decide to go. However, you can put your name on the list and take a stroll around Walnut street while waiting.\n\nI ordered their sweet crepe \"Walnut Street\" with has a Brie filling and is topped with walnuts, granola, powdered sugar, and maple syrup and comes with the whipped cream on the side. I also ordered a side of egg whites. \n\nWhile the meal itself was a bit smaller than I would have liked, the crepe was absolutely delicious. The inside was nice and creamy with paired really well with the toppings. The additional egg whites on the side made the meal filling.\n\nEven though this place is a little bit on the pricy side, you can tell the food is made with quality ingredients. Highly recommend Cafe Moulin!
