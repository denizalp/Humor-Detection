Last visit to Ground Control. I'm amazed this place is still in business. I just went up to get a coffee at the coffee shop in Verrado. There were seven people in line with one person taking the orders as well as making the coffee. The manager was outside chatting with someone and straightening tables. After waiting five minutes in line I decided to leave. Any positive reviews you read about this place are most likely written by the staff or owners. The food and service is very poor!\nSomeone please buy this business and get people in there who care about customer service and quality food. This business could be very profitable.
