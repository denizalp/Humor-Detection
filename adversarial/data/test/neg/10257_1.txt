After my initial post, which I fully expected to go unnoticed, the community manager actually reached out for more information about the incident that occurred. \n\nThey ended up rectifying the situation by refunding us for our water that was used by the landscaping company which was unexpected. \n\nOverall I still don't believe there's any excuse for taking over a week to respond to an e-mail. The most important thing anyone can do in a service industry is communicate. I'm glad everything was sorted out in the end though, I'm sure most management companies would have just ignored us or asked for concrete proof before implementing a refund.
