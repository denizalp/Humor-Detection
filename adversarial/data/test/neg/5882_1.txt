Went here for a gel mani\/pedi 3 days before my wedding thinking I would get a nicer and more \"pampered\" experience rather than going to any walk-in place down by me. Like a previous review I read - it was an extremely disappointing experience. I paid for a full gel manicure yet they barely did any grooming or cuticle work, there was a large gap between my cuticle and the start of the polish, and I didn't receive any massage\/moisturizer. I mentioned to the girl that she didn't do anything to my cuticles and she responded that \"she doesn't do that with gels\".. (?not sure why?) So I essentially paid $35 for another person to paint my nails and do nothing else. Afterwards I complained to the manager and they went back and had the girl remove the polish and do it again but with some grooming.. She did a rushed job and the polish was full of bubbles and chipped by the time my wedding occurred 3 days later.. Extremely disappointing service for what I paid- buyer beware!
