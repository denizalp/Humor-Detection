My friends and I came on a Friday evening and the long line moved quite quickly. Their gourmet weekend dinner is wonderful! \n\nMy favorite selections are the savory porcini truffle ravioli and sea bass. The sashimi is average quality and their smoked salmon is great. The swordfish and Kobe beef however are tough and dry. \n\nDefinitely pick this buffet if you love Alaskan king crab legs. Each huge crab leg is conveniently precut in half. Just grab a plateful and pluck the juicy cold strips of meat into your mouth. :p \n\nThe dessert bar has great variety. Creme brulee, caramel flan, cheesecake, strawberry & chocolate mousse, chocolate cake, tiramisu... Whatever floats your banana boat! \n\nI wish I have a bigger stomach.
