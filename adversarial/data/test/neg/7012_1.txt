Really great idea and super fun place to play\/party day or night! The reason I am not giving 5 stars is that the employees appeared to have very little oversight. Groups of employees blocking the front desk and hallways laughing and flirting with each other while there were dirty tables and no toilet paper in the bathrooms.
