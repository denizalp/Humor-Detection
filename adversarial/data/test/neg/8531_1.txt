My vacuum had a significant problem, and it was still under warranty; Larry at the Arboretum location went above and beyond to get me the best replacement. He kept me informed of my options, and I was apprised of all developments, and given prompt attention through phone, email, and in person. I'm now very happy with my new Oreck vacuum, and with the great customer service I've experienced!
