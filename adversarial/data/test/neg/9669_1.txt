They checked our Honda at a very reasonable price.  They did not recommend any unnecessary repairs as so many autoshops do, and the staff was courteous and helpful.  The only drawback in my opinion is that it is not very easy to get to this location as it is rather \"out of the way.\"  Once you get there, of course, it is worth it.
