Came here on a Friday night for dinner. The place was busy but still the staff was great. Very aware of every time we needed water and overall just great service. \n\nOrdered the green curry and it was a little more expensive than usual. The small bowl of rice to accompany it cost an extra $2 which was a little pricey, as rice usually comes included. \n\nAlso ordered the mango shake which was amazing. Well worth the value of $4 and came in a huge fish bowl cup. \n\nOverall great experience and would definitely return.
