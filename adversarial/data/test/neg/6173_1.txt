After my last review, the manager of Olive and Ivy contacted me and asked us to give them another try.  He apologized for the poor service. I am so glad he took an interest in our comments and asked us to return. This latest visit definitely rates 5 stars. We again sat outside on the patio that overlooks the canal. It was perfect. The service was excellent and the waiter was very attentive without hovering. The food was perfect. My husband ordered the rib-eye steak and said it was cooked to perfection and very tender. I ordered two vegetarian appetizers, hummus with vegetables and the flatbread. The margherita flatbread rates among the best I have ever eaten.  I am so glad we were asked to give this establishment a second visit. The outside atmosphere and location makes it a favorite of ours to take out of town guests.
