This place is famous yes. I'm not going you tell you anything new. But the corn tamales, one of only a couple of non meat options, are still some of the best. What is not the best is the vegetarian burrito.  It's cold and few things are less appealing than a cold tortilla.\nSo, stick with the regular greasy stuff...save your veggie fix for somewhere else.
