Thai people doing Thai cooking. They've got it down with authentic flavors and ingredients, and very nice portion sizes. Some of the ingredient proportions are a bit off, but at least I got enough rice unlike some Thai places I've visited. There aren't a lot of drink options either - they have Thai iced tea which is like bubble tea (sweet and likely artificial in many ways), or water, or basic sodas. I asked for the most authentic desserts (of the 4) and they steered me to #1, which was icy on the bottom with sweetened coconut milk, red beans, and some other ingredients on top. I should have trusted my gut and gone with a #2 or #3. I can't say \"next time\" because it is extremely unlikely I'll find myself in this part of this city for a meal again, but I would certainly come back if I happened to live near here.
