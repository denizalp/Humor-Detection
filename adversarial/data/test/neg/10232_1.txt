Stopped by on a whim last night for some flamenco and tapas. It was like a trip back to olde Europe. This place has been around since the 1980's but the owners and employees act like it's a new business.  The service and smiles were welcoming.  We saw a Flamenco show that while not the best ever, was entertaining and enjoyable and added a nice touch to a fun evening of tapas and wine.  I'm happy this place exists - the food was delicious - grilled Octopus and other tapas were authentic, fresh and tasty.  True to Galicia - the menu features lots of great seafood options.  Go and enjoy a trip to old Espana.
