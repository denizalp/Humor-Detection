The food was amazing, really filling and satisfying. I would've giving this place a 5 star but the manager or whatever he is, the guy up front is some what of an ass. Jason is his name, noticed he is rude to his servers. And definitely had an attitude when my group came in. Not cool sir, not cool!! The servers and other staff was great and attentive.
