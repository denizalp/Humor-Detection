I gave The Spoke Easy a call upon suggestion from a buddy who said I should look nowhere else. I pretty much knew what I wanted but wanted to discuss it and make sure. John was extremely helpful and is a good guy. The store is cool and laid back like a place you'd want to hang out. I picked up my Surly Cross Check on Thursday, fully built and ready to ride. Since then I've been making up excuses to take rides and even rode so hard on Saturday that I vomited. I might have been hungover, but I still couldn't resist the fun. I've been riding a cruiser for so long that I'm loving a bike with better performance. I get two free tune-ups, so I look forward to going back and suggest you check them out if you need a bike or bike maintenance.
