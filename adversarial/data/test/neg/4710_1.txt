Maybe it's because it's been a while since I've been to Ten Ren but I am loving the menu and the modern look of this tea shop.\n\nThis newly opened \"restaurant\" seats ample but is relatively small compared to its other locations. I enjoyed looking through the menu having many options I haven't seen before.\n\nI opted for a red bean and coconut hot drink and thoroughly enjoyed it with this lousy cold weather we've been getting! I am not sure if it's the same for all Ten Ren locations but they now also serve macaroons of several flavors for 9.99!
