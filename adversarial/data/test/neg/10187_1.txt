Love this service! The 2 hosts that we worked with for 2 consecutive nights were very professional, punctual, and attentive (Derek and Troy). When I booked this service, I have to admit that I was somewhat skeptical. The Red carpet agent (Jeff) that arranged the nightclub VIP passes was very knowledgeable and informative. He even made himself available via phone after hours...first class service. At the nightclubs, everything went seamlessly. We felt like royalty while we were escorted in by our waiting hosts. No wait, no hassle indeed! Will definitely use their service again for all my Vegas trips.
