Our experience with Twins was terrible. Several years ago we tried hard to engage them to help us find a home in Phoenix. They seem well connected and had good inventory. They never seemed to care about us. We have sterling credit and cash in hand, but to us their motivations were mysterious. We worked with several of their agents, made several offers, and spoke to one of the \"Twins\" and never got their attention. No one took the time and we never felt like we had a partner or a friend. \n\nWe finally bought a fabulous MCM home in Phoenix, but count our attempted engagement with Twins a total waste of time. Now their inventory seems to have fallen off and their profile is much lower. I would guess that treating clients like shit finally paid off.
