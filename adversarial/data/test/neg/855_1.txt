This is a very basic\/mediocre AYCE sushi. Especially compared to all the other ones in Mississauga. This is the first time I've been in a longgggggg time and it's still just \"ok\". It satisfies my sushi craving just enough! I just happened to be in the area and was craving sushi so thought I'd give it another try!\n\nI meaaaan I would still eat here if I had to....for get togethers or something but would prefer somewhere else. I came for lunch so it's natural that options are more limited compared to dinner but still just ok.
