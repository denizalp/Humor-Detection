Stopped in after work on a random weekday and while the bar was empty the selection was extensive and varied. In addition to the great beer, the barkeep was extremely friendly and welcoming. He let me sample a few beers before choosing my poison of choice which I appreciate as an avid beer snob. I will definitely be back to check this place out on a weekend.
