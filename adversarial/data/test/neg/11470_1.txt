First time here. I ordered a burger, fries, chicken sandwich, kids hot dog, 2 drinks and a shake. Total was over $40. One of the drink machines was leaking water from one side of the place to the other side, making a river in front of the register. The 10 ft wide ceiling fan was on warp speed and was very uncomfortable to eat under. Food was eh, fries were pretty bad. Won't be returning.
