This is the only place in town that I trust for a quality car body repair.  Originally found Select listed on Yelp with high reviews.  Got hit with major door damage and needed a repair.  Always look at the places your insurance recommends.  Usually they have poor reviews.  This is because your insurance will recommend subpar shops.  I always want to pick my body shop and Select was outstanding.  They never use aftermarket or used parts.  They always look out for their customers first.  You have a right to pick your shop and make sure yours is Select!  They will to disappoint.  Sam at Select was outstanding to work with.  He got me in for an estimate the same day!  He took photos and was able to get an estimate within a day.  The experience was so good and the reviews so great I got my car fixed here.  They were done on schedule within a week and the finished job was outstanding!  Couldn't even tell there was ever an accident.  Amazing job!  I have used them again for another accident, unfortunately to the same car about a year later.  Again, great service and they worked well with my insurance.  The final result was once again perfect.  Hopefully no more accidents.  I never had a bill for the repairs or the rental car as the insurance worked directly with Select.  I have to say that I am extremely pleased.  I would never go anywhere else.  Thanks again to Sam and to Bud the owner.  They are an outstanding locally owned and family run business.
