TGI Friday's is your normal run-of-the-mill National Food Chain. \n\nThey have a gigantic menu to please groups of people, but everything is just ok. \n\nI got the French onion soup and the pretzels. The soup was very good. I did enjoy it, with all of it's cheesy goodness. The pretzels however were sub par. I mean who deep fries pretzels? The were greasy and the beer cheese that came with it was chunky. I would not recommend. \n\nIf you come to the mall on a Sunday or before a race at the track, they have Sunday Funday. You can get a 32oz beer for $3. They are gigantic mugs with a ridiculous amount of beer inside. Provided laughs for our group.
