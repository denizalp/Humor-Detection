I waited for probably a good 10-15 mins for them to even start cooking my food. They were standing around on their phones before the girl who took my order realized they hadn't started it yet. They never came to tell me I'm sorry or to tell me it will be right now. The customer service was shit and I'm incredibly disappointed in their professionalism. Im in the service industry I know what good customer service is and this place does not have it whatsoever.
