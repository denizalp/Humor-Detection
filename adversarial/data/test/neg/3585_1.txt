I was a little hesitant about seeing another Disney Broadway production. My last experience was Mary Poppins and which was just OK.  I have to say, this was a great great show and I'd highly recommend it.  It follows the movie very closely with the exception of a couple new songs.  \n\nThe costumes were outstanding.  They were so creative and colorful and the venue at Mandalay Bay was very nice too.  The actors were amazing and their voices just blew me away.  Wow.
