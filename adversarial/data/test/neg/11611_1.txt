Best eggs I have ever had and take my word for it, I am very picky with my eggs. This is a straight up farm with the gardens, trees, and chickens. It was absolutely beautiful. You sit outside surrounded by mother nature and your breakfast comes out at record speed nice and hot. I ordered the eggs skillet with the truffle oil. The vegetables were delicious, the eggs were perfect, and I am a new fan of truffle oil. After the delicious breakfast, i walked over to the chicken coop and thanked the chickens for my delicious breakfast as it would not have been possible without them. I will definitely come back here. They have different places for lunch and dinner.
