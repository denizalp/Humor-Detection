Very dated, paint chipping and wallpaper peeling everywhere.  Needs a facelift and makes you worry about how clean everything really is.   Pull out sofa broken and not useable.  Breakfast was good and the attendant, Laura, was very nice.  We usually stay at the HI express chain but this was $40 cheaper.   You get what you pay for.
