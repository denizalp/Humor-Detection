A large bowl of pho on a cold winter day. Perfect comfort food. This is an authentic Vietnamese run pho restaurant. Portions are fair and you do get a lot of meat but still none have reached the standards in terms of portion and quality that I'm use to at Pho 88. I think this place needs to add an extra large category for bottomless eaters like me. I also got a deep fried soft shell crab for $11.99 as an appetizer. The flavor of the batter was pretty good and it was nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside but it didn't have much crab flavor. Even so I would still order it again in a heart beat. Great to have another pho restaurant in the area.\n\n3.5 stars
