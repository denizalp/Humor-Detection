Though a few of my friends complain about a limited menu, I love this place. We went for Sunday Brunch & enjoyed it immensely. The Crab Cake Benedict was inventive as well as delicious & the Corned Beef Hash excellent. I also love the bar menu. If you're a Bourbon fan try the Midnight Rambler. Dinner is also excellent.
