Went here last week with the fam and it surpassed my expectations. We ordered a few apps to start - the calamari was ok but it was the vegetable flat bread that was great!!! I would return again and again just for this item on the menu. \n\nFor our main we ordered the feature dish which was almond crusted mahi mahi infused with lobster cream sauce with a side of green beans and rice. Overall it wasn't too bad. It was filling! But the fish lacked quite a bit of flavour. I asked for sirracha sauce just to give it a kick. This is where they lose a point in the final rating however we did bring it to the manager's attention. I would not order this again. We skipped dessert as we were very full. \n\nAnother plus was the Kronenberg beer they offered. This beer is really good and although they only had the Pilsner (not the stout that I really enjoy) it was still very good. \n\nThe ambiance is great. We went during a Raptors game and although were were seated towards the back of the restaurant we still had a good view of the game on several of the Tvs. I would def recommend this spot and will probably visit again soon. \n\nThe manager invited us this Thursday Nov. 12 back to the restaurant since, they are having their staff party and the public is invited. They have promised to serve a few samples from their new menu as well as drink samples to celebrate I think their 5th year. Not sure I will there for the celebration but I am sure we will be back soon.
