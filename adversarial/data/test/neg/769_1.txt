This place is fantastic. Went with my family and everyone got something different. No one had any complaints about anything. I had the beef cheesesteak and wow. Sooo good! Highly recommend it! \n\nYou have to get a cannoli as well. They are legit awesome! \n\nCan't speak any higher about this place. If you visit Scottsdale and don't go here, you're missing out!
