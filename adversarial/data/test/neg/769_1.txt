Always good for a post sushi dessert or just a late night treat. Large assortment of hot and cold teas, desserts and treats. \n\nI recommend the Brown Sugar milk slush with extra brown sugar (with or without boba). It always cures the fix! \n\nPlus, most of the time I go in now, they already know the majority of my order... ha! Parking is often a pain, but never had a poor experience with the service or quality.
