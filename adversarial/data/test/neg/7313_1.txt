I ordered cupcakes for a baby shower that I was throwing and I could not have been more pleased!! Not only were they beautiful, but the taste was divine! Everyone was asking where they were from and I was happy to share my new find and recommend Sweet Affairs.  With all the cupcakes places popping up on every corner, I've been disappointed over and over again. I'm so happy to have found this wonderful company!
