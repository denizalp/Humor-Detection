I have been a patient of Dr. Brad Sorosky for several years.  I am not exaggerating by stating that he and his practice have allowed me to return to a level of fitness and health that I was told I would never again achieve.  When I initially went to Dr. Brad, I found him to be a partner in my recovery.  He always listened to my concerns, gave me several options to address issues and always made me feel like I was of utmost importance whenever I was in his office.  I also have seen Dr. Susan Sorosky and can't say enough about her talent in quickly identifying the root cause of an issue.  I went to three doctors who were uncertain of diagnosis and at my first visit, she identified the cause which was later confirmed by MRI.   Additionally both doctors and their office have actively fought to ensure I received insurance approval for appropriate diagnostic testing and treatment.   And Kristy at the East Valley office has always been incredibly kind when I have had a bad flare up and called when in pain.  The epidural injections have been a lifesaver for me.   I have referred numerous friends and family members and they have all thanked me for the referral. Hands down the best physicians and office in their field.
