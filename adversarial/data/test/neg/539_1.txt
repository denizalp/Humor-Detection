Hidden gem! You gotta try it. I eat here 2-3 times a month. \n\nBoyfriend and I really love the somen appetizer. Temperature of the somen soup is not consistent as they keep the soup base in the hot water dispenser and just pour over the noodles when they're ready to serve you. I really love the soup especially when I'm so hungry and need something before the main dish actually comes out so I don't mind cold warm or hot somen . \n\nBest gamjatang I've ever tried, never disappoints me. Just the right amount of flavour and spice to it. Every bowl I got only had 1 piece of potatoe though which is fine not a big deal. \n\nOwner and servers are extremely friendly.
