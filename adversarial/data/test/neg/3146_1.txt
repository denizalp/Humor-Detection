I came across Highline Import Auto several years ago when I was looking to get my wife's Prius serviced. Wow! What a great group of guys providing affordable,reliable service.\n\nSince then they are now servicing my Lexus and Corvette. I tell everyone about Highline and I wouldn't trust anyone else with my vehicles. Check them out for yourself. You won't be disappointed.
