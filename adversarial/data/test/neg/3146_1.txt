Bar: The brandy Alexander was ultra tasty, but once I got my drink, I was totally ignored. The bartender who made my drink was presumably on break so I don't blame him, but the other guy just kept walking past for an hour without bothering to ask if I wanted more water or anything. Would like to try the restaurant but the bar has only half the required elements of a decent haunt.
