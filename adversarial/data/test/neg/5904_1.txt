My friend was looking for a relaxing massage while I was looking for a therapeutic one. We both got exactly what we asked for. We were able to relax in the spa facilities prior to, and after our massage. My therapist, Emma was exceptional! She used multiple techniques to work out the numerous problem areas on my back, neck, and shoulders. I like firm pressure and she was able to accommodate that. Overall, it was the best massage I've ever had.  We were so relaxed, we stayed an 2 extra hours enjoying a steam and chatting in the relaxation room.  We highly recommend spending some time at WELL spa and salon.
