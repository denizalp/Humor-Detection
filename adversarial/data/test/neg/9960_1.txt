I don't get out to In-N-Out country too often, but when I do, I always make a stop.   This as my first visit to this location and it did not disappoint.   The servers were awesome, professional and super quick.   I used to work in fast food, and there is no better attitude in fast food service than In-N-Out Burger.   \n\nI had a double double animal style, animal style fries and a neopolitan shake.   Not the healthiest meal out there, but it was delicious.   \n\nAs always the food was great, but the service here was just top notch.  Kudos to the folks that operate the business and take pride in their service.   Thank You.
