This is my favorite pizza. I think it's the crust and sauce. It's the real deal! No sagging pizza. I also like having a variety of salads to choose from, yummy cheese sticks and their bbq wings. Whenever the kids ask about pizza for dinner, they are referring to Barro's. Nothing else!\nThere are delivery options too!
