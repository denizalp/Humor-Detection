The review goes for the wait time and not for food. I went to the place for take out dinner on two consecutive days. The first time: delicious food prepared in 10 mins. Next time wait time was about an hour without any prior information. If it is going to take so long you need to inform customers beforehand so that they can make a decision to eat at your place or not. Making people wait for 1 hr for a takeout is not professional at all.
