Probably the best poutine in La Petite Patrie\n\nThough I am a devout La Banquise disciple when it comes to my favourite poutine, there are times when I just don't want to venture in that area of the city, nor put up with the crowd that's there. I have tried a great many poutine places in La Petite Patrie and Jojo's is by far the best one. \n\nAt first glance, this joint (I'm not trying to sound hip by calling it a \"joint\", but if you've seen this place, you know it's not worthy of being called a diner, it's strictly a joint) is not your kind of place that you'll willingly chose to go to. It's hot in there and though passable, I wouldn't say it's a clean restaurant. And they change waitresses more often than they change their deep-frying oil. But for some reason the food turns out amazing and the cooks are always nice and amicable. There are a slew of hipster poutine restaurants in La Petite Patrie where you get rude, pretentious service and a fat bill at the end of your meal and Jojo's just the complete opposite. Down to earth, unpretentious and understated. And the prices are most reasonable. I urge everyone who reads this not to judge this restaurant by its cover and give it a chance.
