This show was so much fun! I laughed so hard my sides actually HURT! I took some visiting friends to the show and boy was I happy I did, they loved it!  Plus, they had kids with them who loved the show as well. An EXCELLENT choice if you are looking for something to do with the whole family. I will definitely be taking friends to this show again!  I reccomend it for date night as well, it's just delightful. And don't be shy, volunteer to go on stage! It's so fun and you get a prize for doing so! \nTruly, a real gem. Go see the show while it's still in a small theater. It's just a matter of time before this show is huge!
