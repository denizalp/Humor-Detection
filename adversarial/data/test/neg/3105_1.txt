Friendly, non-judgemental staff and a cool, crisp atmosphere. You can tell the dudes are very passionate about music, and from the various pieces I've read online lately, supporting local independent bands and artists. I currently have a record on order there and they've been very attentive at keeping me updated on the status. Well-chosen selection and sometimes the prices will pleasantly surprise you!
