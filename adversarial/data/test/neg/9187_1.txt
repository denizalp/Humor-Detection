After hearing that Apple has screwed it's battery and would replace it, I went to the Apple store ( not a third party facility) to get the battery replaced. Was told they had would have to order it an it would be in about a week after 2 weeks we went back and now they say it's going to be another 2 week before it would be in. Boy the androids are looking better every day.
