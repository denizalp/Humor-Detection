Helpful, non condescending, fulfilled their Yelp deal commitment no problem.\n\nWent in for my first mod and juice about a month ago. Dude listened to what I wanted (size\/aesthetic, ease of use, price range, etc.) and provided appropriate product solutions from which I picked. Walked me through the juices, speaking to different tastes and nicotine levels. \n\nReturned today for replacement coils. Helped me install\/walked me through the process. I hope to be completely of the \"smoking\"\/vaping wagon in the next 6 months but until then, this will be my go to place!
