We stopped here after dinner nearby for a sweet treat. My roommate is a self-proclaimed boba addict and I haven't had it in years so I was excited to try out his favorite place. The menu is vast I was overwhelmed by all of the options and flavors. The lady at the counter could probably sense this and she let me try a few samples. I ended up getting the taro boba which was really good.
