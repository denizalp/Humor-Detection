I love the services provided here.  My favorite is a beyond fabulous brightening facial with a brightening fleece or alginate mask.  I am outdoors alot and suffer from hyper pigmentation which is embarrassing when your getting your hair done and they think its dye and try scrubbing it off. Lol.  Thankfully between the brightening facials and the chemical peels im able to keep it under control.
