This place gets a 1-star just because i have been here since 1:02pm, it's now 2:02pm and they are just starting to wipe down my car! I've literally seen 10 cars get done and my car is barely getting wiped down. There are 2 guys working on each car and the lane where my car is, there's just one guy who is as slow as a turtle.
