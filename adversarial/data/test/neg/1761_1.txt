Laura was very helpful every time I called to try and schedule an appointment, due to my busy and inconsistent schedule, I had to call a few times. At last, she was able to book a next day couples massage when that's all my schedule could fit in. Once we got there, the woman at the counter was very nice and guided the way. The lounges (at  least the women's) were nice, clean, and cozy with lockers, showers, hair supplies, and a sauna; though, the magazines could have been better placed so you don't have to bend over and risk exposing breast or genitals to obtain one while sitting and waiting for the therapist. When we got to the room, the ambiance was relaxing and what you would expect for a massage. My boyfriend and I both agree, the massages were great, and much better than a different resort spa we had gone to that I won't mention. That being said, one of the therapists's stomach was gurgling throughout the whole hour; I could even hear it on my end even though it was my boyfriend's therapist. He stated it got to the point where he would try to predict when it would happen again; because, at the end of the gastric rhapsody, a large belch would erupt. This occurred 4-5 times. Nice woman, nice massage, but we were left wondering if she had forgotten to take her GERD medication that morning or if we were both at risk for getting gastro. In addition, my therapist was coughing throughout the massage. There was no nose sniffling, which reassured me it was likely allergies or a post-infectious cough that lingered. Since we are both pretty low-key, we just laughed about it and joked how we may have created a super bug being in a small room complete with upper respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms (though I'm sure many others would be perturbed). The only real thing that perturbed me is when I went to pay for the massage afterwards. The bill was right, but I received a thank you card for \"Matthew & Sandy.\" That would be fine, except for my name isn't Sandy. I had just spent a couple hundred dollars, if you want to go to the effort of giving a card, at least get the name right. I would have preferred not getting one at all. It's pretty impersonal to have your boyfriend's name with another woman's name on a card after I just paid for it (the reservation name was right, however, and so was the credit card name). Afterwards, we went and relaxed by the pool which was nice. But keep in mind you might have to get food and drinks from the indoor bar because by the time we arrived, they were already doing last call at the pool side bar. P.S. I purposefully left out employee names (except for Laura, since she was so kind), but do have them as references if need be. \n\ntl;dr good massage with some nuances. Likely will not be back due to nuances described above.
