Great little lake at this park. I've caught many a fish here. The Catfish, stocked this time of year, are hauled in from Arkansas by a company called Mr. Fish and are a nice size. My whole family enjoy catching these tasty Channel Cats. Hate the turtles that steal your bate, though - but all part of the adventure. The waterfowl usually visit you after a catch hoping for a free meal. looking forward to Trout season - those come from a hatchery here in AZ.
