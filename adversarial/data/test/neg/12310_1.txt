They over charge. For everything: \nAtmosphere was nice but I didn't receive the nail I made an appointment with\nI came in with a painful broken new set that I wanted to fix and change \nShe decide after she cut my acrylic tips and skin underneath my nail causing them to bleed that we would then just soak them off in acetone \nSo my fingers were antagonizing and stinging for 20+ mins \nWhy wouldn't you originally soak them after obtaining the knowledge of them being new? \nShe then aggressively filled my thin sensitive nails \nI didn't want to pay extra for coffin (after an $85 total) so I asked for square round \nShe gave me THICK square nails with horribly done gel polos with acrylic all over my cuticles. \nI understand paying for quality, but that was one of the worst experiences I've had \nSome lady was just standing over me and my tech talking in their language most of the time \nAnd if they were speaking English it was to talk themselves up about how good they are and how it will be so much better than they were before.. \nI would've posted a pic, but this has wasted my time already and I had to immediately get them fixed. Now my total is $115 \nfor short almost coffin set that I hate & my nails hurt so bad
