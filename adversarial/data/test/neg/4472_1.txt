Was seeing my boy Bo Burham in concert and needed some place at Hard Rock to eat, decided to stop by the Fu Asian Kitchen. The waiters here are very helpful, I tried to order the dry scallops and the waiter saw how white I was and advised against it. Ended up feasting on the cashew chicken, also their cocktails come in hella awesome mugs.
