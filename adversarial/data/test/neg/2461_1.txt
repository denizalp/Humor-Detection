If you haven't tried this place yet let me tell you, you are missing out. The menu has a great variety to please any palate. Our favorites are the Surf & Turf Nachos, Duck Fries and the chipotle wings! This has become our go to place when we want to meet up with friends and now they're hooked as well.  Great job Doug & Jackson!
