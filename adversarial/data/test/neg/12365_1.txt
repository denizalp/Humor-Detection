I am not a yelp newbie. Been to hundreds of  places  but too lazy to write anything normally.  Millie seems to change my mind about this. I won't go as far as she cured me (let's fAce it no one can not with this many injuries I had) but she sure did help  me feeling pretty good. Neck pain is gone calves are loose shoulders no longer tight. Very knowledgable. Will definite see her again when I come back to Vegas
