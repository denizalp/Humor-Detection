I wish there was 10 stars I could give to Doctor Day! He is a new face at the clinic but has the knowledge and confidence of someone that has practiced 20 years. He took such great care of my roommates  dog that was attacked by my dog. He was professional, caring and I could tell that his number one priority was my dog and not how much he was going to be able to bill me. Tropicana Animal Hospital made the right call by hiring this guy, it's rare to find someone with such a genuine heart in this day and age. Everyone request Dr.Day you won't regret it!
