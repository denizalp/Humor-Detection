I wonder if these guys are from Chicago, because I am, and if they are representing Chicago for downtown Madison they are doing a pretty bad job. The composition of the ingredients is poor and the prices are the same. Also, if you're going to try to be a Chicago place and do an Italian Beef, figure it out. One more thing, $3.59 for a Chicago dog? Absurd. Give me a break. $3.50 for a dog and hand cut fries, maybe. If you're going to do something do it right.
