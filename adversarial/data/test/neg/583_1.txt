This place is Dive bar with cheap beer and that's it. The service is terrible, all bathrooms feels like you can buy drugs or get mugged in them. I could forget all that because there are places that make up all their negatives with their food but the worst part about this place is the Food. All the burgers and fries  ordered Bland and Burnt, appetizer ordered chicken quesadilla still had uncooked cheese. Don't go here there is Hooters next store go there instead.
