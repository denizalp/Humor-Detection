Unfortunately I had to call them again to assist with the passing of my cat. It's never a call anyone wants to make but they make the process the best they can for owners. \nThey got my appt. set for the next day, they emailed me the forms to fill out in advance. When the veterinarian arrived she had an assistant with her and she greeting me with a smile, they were both very nice and understanding of my slobbering tears. They checked on my cat to evaluate her and agreed it was indeed her time. We handled the payment and she walked me through the process before we started. She asked if I had any questions and then we began, again, she walked me through everything. After my cat passed on, they picked up and before leaving she gave me a hug with her condolences. \nI can not imagine a job where you see people in their saddest moments yet these professionals held it together and helped me. I strongly agree in the in-home passing of our beloved pets; it's so much better for them. Thanks so much for your service and caring.
