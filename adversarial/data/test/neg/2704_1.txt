If you are a huge Avengers fan, you will like this place.\n\nThey did a good job with the costumes, info on the characters...\n\nAnd they were particularly creative with the display.\n\nThey are not getting 5 stars because they failed when it came to the details.  Throughout the rooms, they have really obvious misspellings and grammatical errors that detract from the experience.\n\nYou can also get the app, which gives you some of the same experiences, and you can use it as you go through the exhibit.  Don't do too much of the app before you go because it could lessen your enjoyment of the actual experience.
