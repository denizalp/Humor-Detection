Amanda always does an amazing job on my makeup, and last night my makeup for my unicorn Halloween costume was no exception! Whether she's creating a colorful, glittery unicorn look or subtle everyday makeup, she always does it better than I could have imagined. She always takes the time to consult with me prior to doing the makeup and really listens carefully. However, the real reason I go to Amanda is because I don't even think about looking at myself in the mirror until she's finished applying the makeup because I always have confidence that it's going to look fabulous!
