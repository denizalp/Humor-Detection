We have an Italian market in Lake Norman! I am thrilled. Staff is friendly and available for questions. Lots of different Italian options here -- frozen pasta, meats, San Marzano tomatoes, and sandwiches. Worth a visit for a delicious lunch or if you have a hankering for something Italian for dinner.
