Used to eat here when it was called The Great Wall. Ownership changed and this was our first time eating here at Khoo's Garden. I must say my wife and I were very happy! The food we ordered was better than we remembered. The waitresses told us it was her first day and she was excellent! Everything from the fried dumplings to my MooShoo Pork was delicious. My wife had cashew shrimp and she loved it as well. The won ton soup was ten times better than I remembered (their soup was always a disappointment before) and the dinner entrees were huge. Clean, friendly service + great food. We're definitely coming back!
