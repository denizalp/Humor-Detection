Don't waste your money. It's so trashy. The room wasn't even cleaned. I'm shocked that a hotel in Scottsdale could be like this.\nIt looks like the room has never been vacuumed or dusted. They do not clean daily. It smells. I'm really disappointed with this place.\nGot woken up at 6am by various people walking around. You can hear others around you and people are making noise all night. I think there may be construction next door too. So we didn't get any rest.
