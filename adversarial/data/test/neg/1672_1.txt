I travel from Pittsburgh to LA every six weeks, so I have travel down to a routine. I recently used ACE Car Rental out of LAX. The best rate I could get from Thrifty for a two week rental was $960. Ace was $313 for the same car! ACE keeps their costs low by minimizing overhead. If you're indignant about taking the airport transit rather than a company owned bus or if you have trouble finalizing your rental contract via Skype, then ACE may not be for you. If you don't like wasting your hard earned money and you like trying unconventional business models, then I highly recommend ACE. My car was new, very clean and well-optioned. I plan to use ACE from now on.
