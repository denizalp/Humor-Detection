A fun place for wine and bruchetta. The hummus is DELISH! We actually ended up ordering a couple rounds of bruchetta, it was that good. My husband's favorite was the procuitto with figs and mascarpone cheese. I also had the roasted peppers with goat cheese, which was good, just a little bit too sweet. We also ordered turkey sliders.....we were a bit confused when they came out, when I think of slider I think of a mini burger; these were mini turkey sandwhiches, as in, they used deli meat turkey instead of a ground turkey meat patty. It was good, just not what I expected. \n\nLoved the fact that they had several wines for $5 before 6pm. Even on Sunday! I had a Pinot Noir from Mt. Pellier. sooooooooo good! Ever so slightly sweet and 'oaky', mild bodied and perfectly balanced. Went great with my goat cheese. \n\nService was a little.....casual? Our server looked like she was on spring break or something....and not very knowledgeable of the wines (kinda sad, considering this is a WINE BAR) I can see what people mean about it being overly crowded....We happend to come on a slow day, but I could see potential for claustrophobia.
