I recently visited Las vegas BJ's hoping to share a good time with friends.  Unfortunately,  our experience  was less than great. Our Mojitos tasted more like lemonade. The chicken was pink inside. The pasta was undercooked and they had no mashed potatoes as offered in the menu. The broccoli was dry, dehydrated,  chewy. Our overall experience was very unpleasant.  Worst of all, the manager did not take the time to  speak with us. I would definitely not recommended this restaurant.
