We had an unfortunate experience tonight. We have driven past a few of these restaurants. We finally decided to try it after seeing a movie. We were sat down right away by the hostess(who was very nice). We then looked over the menu and waited. Then we waited some more. I'm not sure how long we sat there but it was certainly more than enough time to take a drink order. After seeing others being tended to that had sat down after we did, I told the hostess we haven't been helped. By that time we had decided to just leave. As we were leaving the owner or manager tried stopping us and said that it was on him. Unfortunately by that time we had lost interest in dining there for the night. I hate leaving negative reviews, but I work in the service Industry and first impressions are quite important to me. We may or may not attempt another time.
