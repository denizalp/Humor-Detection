Very fun shop for my needs. Sewing, quilting, learning. The fabric selection is amazing. And they have a variety of sewing, quilting, and embroidery machines.  I like to see the new models in person. Overall, this is a fun, inspiring shop. And there are discounts and coupon specials to help keep it affordable.
