Joe's Midnight Run has been an evolution of perfection from day one.  Joe's is a weekly stop for me and my 9yr old twin daughters.  Yes, that's right 9 years old!  And, no, they aren't ordering off the kids menu.  \nSo why 5 stars? \n1.The menu has changed from when they first opened.  But all changes for the better.  I didn't know that was even possible.  They have something for everyone's taste.  So even if you aren't into sweet breads or foie gras, that's ok, because you can have a Biggie burger, frittes, skirt steak, pork chop, mussels, etc.  ALL made deliciously and with much care and attention.   Not just anyone can cook on a wood fire grill.  It is an art form.   \n2.Not only is Joe's great for dinner, it is ALSO open for lunch AND for BRUNCH!!!  Yes, that's right, BRUNCH!!!  From classic like Egg Benedict and Chilaquiles to signature dishes like their banana French toast and shakshuka.  Again, something for everyone! \n3.And last but definitely not least, is the music, the vibe.  It always puts me in a good mood.  The music makes me dance in my seat and sing along every time.\n\nThose are just 3 reasons why I know Joe's is worth my 5 stars.  I look forward to the continued evolution of an already phenomenal restaurant!
