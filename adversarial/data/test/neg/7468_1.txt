I am not sure if the two previous posters know anything about vehicles.  A \"brake job\" can be 4 new rotors, 4 calipers, and brake lining all around the car.  On top of that, you can go with OEM or after-market which are also different prices.  So I would like to hear specifically what the $350 quote included.  In any event, Andy has done work on my 1996 Mazda Miata R, 2005 Honda S2000, 2009 Mercedes C300 and he just inspected my 2006 Mercedes SLK 55 AMG.  I have nothing bad to say about this place so 4 stars.
