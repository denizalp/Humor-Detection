First time. Went for lunch. Very clean. Friendly host. Friendly server, Brook. I had the grape & Gorgonzola salad. It was delish! Fresh. Huge. Rich in flavor and texture. It comes w bread that was AMAZING. I only had a couple bites because I wanted to try the pizza. The crust was chewy in the best way possible. The pie itself could have used a pop of garlic or basil flavor to make it stand out. The service was awesome. Bathrooms very clean. Cool atmosphere. I bought a gift certificate for a friend. I'll definitely go back.
