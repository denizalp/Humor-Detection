If you're looking to get yourself a new Mercedes Benz in your car collection, this is the place for you! I would also like to add, DO look for Arnold Lim! \n\nOur lease was almost over and since both my husband and I super busy in our daily lives, taking a visit to the MB dealer was one of those tasks we've been putting off for weeks. One sunny (HOT) day, we decided to stop in to a local dealer just to see how much we'd have to pay for all the little repairs prior to returning the car or possibly another lease. We were literally in our workout gears straight from the gym. \n\nArnold happened to open the door for us on the way in and asked a simple question, \"Is there anything I can help you folks with?\"\n\nFrom that moment to driving out with a brand new Mercedes Benz lease... Arnold took it over and made it easy! \n\nI can't wait for our next purchase or lease with Arnold! Maybe this time, it'll be on my way to work? Lol!!!
