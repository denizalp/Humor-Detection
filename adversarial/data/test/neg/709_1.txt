I had to explain to the manager to put paper in the Styrofoam to go boxes because the hot wings melt them and make the wings taste like plastic.\n\nHe didn't argue and was quick to drop new strips for me but they use paper on the orders when people eat in so I don't know why they think they don't need them on to go orders. \n\nIt happened two visits in a row otherwise I would just say it was an honest mistake. Really disappointing having to wait 30 minutes for order for something that should be basic knowledge.
