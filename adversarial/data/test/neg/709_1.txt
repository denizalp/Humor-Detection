We actually found The Beach Cafe right here on Yelp. We love trying new places in the neighborhood and with great reviews already we knew that we had to make this a destination. \n\nMy wife and I are breakfast people. In fact, though I don't eat much we would often get two entrees when it comes to breakfast so we can try a couple options before raking the rest home in a to-go container.\n\nWe kept my simple though. She ordered French Toast with a side of bacon and I had the breakfast croissant which featured eggs, cheese, and bacon and served alongside a choice of breakfast potatoes or hash browns. I had the hash browns. \n\nThe food quality was really good. The croissant was flaky and the overall plate was filling. The French Toast was great even without adding syrup to them, so when we poured a little on top anyway it was like a bonus. The Caramel Macchiato my wife had was pretty epic as well.\n\nPricing was nice and affordable and the guest service was outstanding. Our server maintained a warm smile and was very knowledgeable about the food choices. \n\nI loved the decor in the shop. Made me think about how much I enjoyed my time on the beaches of Waikiki, even if it was just for breakfast. We'll definitely be taking a breakfast vacation with the Beach Cafe again soon.
