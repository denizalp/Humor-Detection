This place was bustling when we arrived around noon, I was worried there would be a long wait, but it was only about 10 minutes (2 people).  Unfortunately they were out of the first thing I tried to order \"Egg in your face\".  The menu looked very good and our food was delicious - we had the Cuban sandwich and the trout sandwich.
