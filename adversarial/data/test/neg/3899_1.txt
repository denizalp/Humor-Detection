If I could give this place no stars I would. This is the most unprofessional bullshit office ever! \n\nThe office does not answer the phone calls from the Pharmacy, they don't answer your phone calls as a patient, but they sure as hell want their money. \n\nI went in for my annual exam last year (which are free once a year by the way) but since my Doctor brought up something that I had previously discussed, I am being charged my co-pay. \n\nAlso, I have a prescription that is needed filled once a month. In December, my Doctor switched my prescription. Now, I can't get a refill because I need to be seen by the doctor again to make sure I liked it. I called and they wouldn't even speak with the Doctor about it because \"That's not our policy.\" \n\nSeems like this office is all about the money. Between scheduling too many patients and having to sit and wait in the waiting room for an hour+ just to be seen, re-coding things in the computer to get that co-pay. Making patients come in for a two minute visit for prescription refills. Too many patients, very little customer service. We are just another number in their books.
