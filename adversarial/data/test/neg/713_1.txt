This is the 8th time we came to eat breakfast here. But today was very not the best experience we had. Food today was warm but not hot as normal. And we got here at 816am. Everything was ok. But their so called CONGEE was totally so so thick that it was like warm rice pudding. I hope they'd check what they put out before any of us get to it. Don't get me wrong. Service is always great and our server Benji today was awesome as always. But the food today was lack luster.
