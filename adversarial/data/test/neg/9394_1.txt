We came to visit Montreal for the day and stumbled upon BreWskey before we headed to the fireworks. We were starving and we're ready to have a quick bite before the fireworks. We were seated at about 8:15. Server came over, took our orders, brought or drink, great. We sat there for awhile until about 40 minutes has gone by, still no food. I politely asked the server when he thought our food might be up because he had consistently ignored us up until me stopping him. His answer: \"Sorry, I'm just not sure honestly. We're really busy and I'm not sure who came first and who's orders went in first so I can't really give you an estimate.\" Ummm okay?? I understand when a server is busy, but the fact that he literally ignored us for 40 minutes and gave us no updates on our food was ridiculous. Finally got the food about 9:10. My wrap was small and when I asked for hot sauce he seemed irritated. He finally came to the table and was so apologetic. Thanks, but couldn't you have said this 30 minutes ago? Wouldn't waste my money here. Try somewhere else.
