I really like this Harkins. The location is great and because you can grab dinner before or after a meal or even get some shopping done. The parking lot is a bit of a mess when it's busy, but you can park at Sears and then walk over (at least Sears is good for something).\n\nNaturally, concessions are overpriced but that's the case at any movie theater. The place is kept very clean and the employees are always super friendly. Always a positive experience!
