Our group was incredibly excited about this, but ended up having a much less than satisfactory experience. Reading one of the other reviews below, we had a similar experience. We were using a tool the way it was supposed to be used, but it wouldn't work. We got a hint telling us how to use the tool and we kept trying, but it still wouldn't work. Finally, about 10 minutes later, an employee came in and switched it with another tool and got us to the next stage because the first tool was 'broken'. That cost us a lot of time and they only gave us a minute back for it.\nOverall, most of the puzzles are cool, but some don't have much logic or flow to them. It would be a fun night if everything had worked correctly, but in the end, we spent $216 ($27 per person) on it and felt like we could have used the money in better ways.
