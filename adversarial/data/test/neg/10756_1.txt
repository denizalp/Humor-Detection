I had a new garage door opener put in by Neighborhood Garage Door Service of Charlotte and they did a fantastic job. While we had some confusion initially about the pricing, they eventually gave me a $300 discount on the job they did.  They installed a new motor and coils and now things are working great.  If you need a garage door fixed, these are your guys.
