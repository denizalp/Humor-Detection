This is an amazing space - the longest I have ever stuck with a physical fitness kind of thing!\nI can't speak highly enough of Megan's Zumba classes and Cate's Group Personal Training classes. The yoga that precedes the Zumba is the perfect low-intensity warm-up too. I've been coming here for about two months (with a 2 1\/12 week break in between because of travel), and i don't see myself stopping any time soon - I've lost 10 pounds already (combined with diet, of course). I feel more energetic, and I actually look forward to the classes (something I've NEVER done - I've always hated going to the gym and having a personal trainer). The fact that classes are a group of women (and a few men), all of whom are just trying to better themselves rather than compete with and judge each other, is fantastic. The classes all have 'levels' so workouts are about pushing yourself, but not about feeling like shit because your body just can't do certain things. In fact, I enjoy the way my body feels so much in these classes that I've started to work out at the gym in my condo on my own time - something I never thought I'd do! I highly, highly, highly recommend this place. It really has given me a new appreciation for my body and the things it can do :) Thanks Suzanne, and everyone at Fitzone Plus!\n\nIt's a 3-4 minute walk from the Chester subway station, so it's super easy to get to as well!
