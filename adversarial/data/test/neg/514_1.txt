I called to make a same day appointment and was serviced by Lisa. She was fantastic and gave great recommendations. I booked a mani pedi with The Retreat. I couldn't decide on bail colours and she showed me four different colours on my nails to help me decide. Very professional and very clean. \n\nGreat service and great addition to the area!\n\nWill definitely be back.
