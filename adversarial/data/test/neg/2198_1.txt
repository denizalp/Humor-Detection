I'm slowly arriving at the conclusion that the Venetian has no good places to eat (note - at the time of this posting I still had not eaten at Bouchon). \n\nWith regards to Noodle Asia - Maybe I'm jaded by living in SF where you get great dim sum (Hung Tu Seafood restaurant is my favorite dim sum joint in the bay area if anyone cares) and chinese food in general. This place was nothing to write home about. Standard fare that you can get in any run down Chinese take out place in the U.S. \n\nDon't think i need to waste my time on this place anymore.
