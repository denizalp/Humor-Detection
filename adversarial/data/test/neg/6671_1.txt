Disappointed would be an understatement. Went last night prior to rock hall of fame induction.  Service was excellent and attentive and decor trendy.  Food was generally bland and uninspired. Expected a top shelf food experience based on reviews and was really let down.  Good news is that it wasn't overly expensive
