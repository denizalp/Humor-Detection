The services was good I sat at the bar. I ordered the Chicken 'N' Watermelon 'N' Waffles because the bartender's recommended. Everything, was good except the chicken was lukewarm. I didn't want a new plate, but I was told that if I wanted hot fryed chicken, I need to ask for it......I'm not sure if it's just me that like my chicken somewhat fresh hot, but note if you want your fryed chicken hot make sure you ask for it.
