I went into my visit to Corkbuzz with high expectations and I was not disappointed! Although the restaurant is located a bit far from where I live, a few friends and I made the trip for a pre-Valentine's day dinner celebration on Saturday night. I had made a reservation in advance and we were seated immediately, despite arriving a few minutes late. The ambiance is great...the restaurant is smaller than I expected, but it feels cozy and inviting. It was perfect for a fun girls night out. The one thing that caught me off guard, and the reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5, is that they were only offering a pre fixed menu, so I wasn't able to sample a bunch of the things I had wanted to try from the normal menu. Normally, this wouldn't have bothered me as I know it was a \"holiday\" weekend with Valentine's day, but I checked the website in advance of my visit and saw no mention of the special menu. \n\nMy friend and I ended up splitting our food, and they were nice enough to separate everything out for us onto separate plates and didn't charge us anything extra. We started with the salad, which was great, but nothing too special. The nuts were a nice addition but there nothing else standout about it. Next, we had the crab cakes, which were excellent. Our main course was the sea bass, which was cooked to perfection and was actually quite a large portion, despite the fact my friend and I were splitting! My other friends had the wagyu beef, which also looked great and the portions were surprisingly large. The highlight of the meal was the dessert - and I am not a dessert person, which I think says a lot about how great it was. We had the chocolate cake and the ricotta donuts. The donuts are a MUST TRY! I was hesitant to take a bite at first, but once I did, I couldn't stop. They were served warm and there were more than enough to share with our whole table. Amazing! Our server even gave us each a complimentary taste of a dessert wine to go with our treats (it was a much larger pour than just a sip, but not quite a whole glass).\n\nOverally, I had a great experience, just was a bit disappointed about not being able to try more things on the menu. I'll definitely be back!
