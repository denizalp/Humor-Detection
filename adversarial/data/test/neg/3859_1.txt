Being very particular about my coffee, I can share with you that this is the best place to have a cappuccino or any kind of cup of coffee in Las Vegas. The baristas are very well trained in delivering the best coffee possible, not to mention extremely friendly. A must visit if you are in Las Vegas or you reside in the west side of town.
