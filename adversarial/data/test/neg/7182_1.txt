On our way to see the plants and butterflies at the Phipps Arboretum we came upon an interesting bridge in a park. Cool Europeanish love locks in Pitt brought back nice memories of our lovely tour of Europe but we didn't know what the locks there were all about at that time :)   Hope they keep it going .. theres still plenty of space for more locks ...
