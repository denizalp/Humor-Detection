well have been to this client a few times in past .. adopted a kitty from petsmart on sat.. he has skin issue on ear and runny eye with looks like blood not sure if he got swiped by other kitty or just from scratching. normal to a point.. so i go and see the dr and right off the bat she is rude and argumentive till the end then like a switch oh send me videos. i asked were and no info given.. so my complaint is she belittled my knowledge of takeing care of pets i foster alot and volenteer alot .. so if i have been doing so bad with all the other aniamls then i would be in troulbe i would think. you can clearly see a rash of somesort on his ear.. could be several things no test or anything she suggested at the end blood work at 150  for interal for my well being but thats has nothing to do with his ear i said.. i asked her also if he has an ok to be out of isolation from my dog ,she basically lechured me about this and that  good greif it a rash on his ear.. its eather fungal or allergys give me a break.and said it only look that the out side of the animal  really i called and have to with till tomarrow to talk to a manager.. not one on sight.
