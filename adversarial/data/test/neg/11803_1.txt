Why I'm done with Crepe Bar:\n\nComing here in general, I expect a wait.  A wait for tables, a wait to order, and at least an hour wait for my food.  Which should say, either how popular this place is, or how unprepared they are to handle demand.\n\nPrior to today, I would have said the former (which is why we've waited outside for them to open before just to get faster service, etc.).  After today's experience, I am going with the latter.  \n\nI understand that a crepe is not a quick prepare meal.  And we were briefly warned that they were running \"a bit behind today\".  And finally, in their defense, we came in an hour before they close.  So, I shouldn't have been upset that they were out of basic items like mushrooms.  But, it was disappointing.\n\nAfter waiting the standard hour for food, I did start becoming a bit antsy.  And the blood sugar started dropping as we watched table after table receive their food, including a couple that came in after us (this despite the fact that we had been assured our food was next).\n\nSo, finally, our crepes started seeping in, one to two at a time.  I had ordered a turkey with gouda and vegetables.  That's what the waiter said he had, so I took my crepe, announced to my friends that selfishly I would be eating because I did have somewhere to be afterwards and would need to take off shortly.  As I was eating, I noticed that it was actually a crepe of eggs and ham.  Nothing at all like I had ordered, but it was the order of one of the other girls.  I drew the server's attention to the mislabel and that I had already eaten 1\/4 of it.  Ironically he was serving the table with a ham and egg crepe, which was her order again.  So, we received 2 of her orders, but none of my.  I told him that I was in a hurry and needed mine to go because of the EXCESSIVE wait.  And we were still missing one girl's food.  \n\nHe told me that he was embarrassed and that the wait was excessive, mostly due to a lack of preparedness in the kitchen area and that they would get my meal to go.\nFinally, the last girl received her food, that was, SHOCKINGLY, missing some of the ingredients, especially guacamole, that it was supposed to have.\nAnother mis-made crepe from our order, that would have to be a correction after she had was almost done with her meal.\n\nAs my To-Go crepe was arriving (which I have to give some credit for the speed that they showed crepes COULD come out, although apparently no one offered to refund anyone for slow speed, mis-orders, or general poor service, or to bring us a granola sample like we've had in the past) they were bringing little \"brownie bites\" that at this point, felt like a small bribe for the awful service, prolonged wait, and mis-made crepes.  \n\nI took my To-Go bag and as I was driving away, I noticed, that although all meals come with the standard salad, mine did not have this in the bag, just a crepe to go, so, once again, I was \"jipped' on my meal.  \nAnd as I finish eating it while I type my complaints, it was a turkey with vegetable crepe, but without gouda, the third ingredient I asked for.  Once again, a mis-done crepe from a HORRIBLE experience.\n\nLet's hope Crepe Bar remembers what made them this popular (from food truck to restaurant) and can channel this again.\n\nBut, I , for one, will be finding my crepes in a less stressful, more efficient environment (and one that actually makes the food I paid for).
