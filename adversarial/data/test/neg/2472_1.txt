What a selection!  What an atmosphere!  How Amazing!!!!\nBiddle's is a great little find with lots of personality.  A HUGE selection of loose leaf teas and coffee! Beads and pinball and great tables. \nThey are super welcoming to groups and have a wonderful outside space for when the weather is warm!
