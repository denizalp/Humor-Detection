I feel like I need to update my review, as I just had some work done on my bike at the shop.  I got back into riding last summer and found this little gem of a shop.  Since last summer, school has kept me insanely busy, and I have not had much time to ride.  But as the spring semester wound down, I wanted to get my bike back in good shape so I could enjoy the summer off.  I was a bit nervous as I brought my bike in, as it's nothing impressive at all (an old 2012 Scott Speedster w\/ Tiagra\/Sora components).  Most bike shops and bike snobs make remarks about how cheap it is, but it works for me.  Nobody said a word and treated me and my bike with respect. \nIt only took a couple of days for the major tuneup. Cable replacement, cleaning, the whole nine.  I was impressed with the quality of work and the short turn-around time. \nNow that I've had it back for about 2 weeks and I've gotten to put some mileage in, I must say that I am impressed with the quality of work. My bike feels better than ever.  Since my components are cheap, my bike has always missed a gear or two, but it's been that way since I bought it years ago. It still misses after the tuneup at Southwest, but I've learned to live with it and it doesn't bother me.  Regardless, they did great work at a very, very, reasonable cost and I'm quite impressed. The mechanic even took the time to call me and ask me what kind and color of bar tape I wanted.  Little things like that go a long way for me. \nThe guys at Southwest are always courteous and respectful, and I can't imagine bringing my bike or my business to any other shop in town. \n\nBottom line: If you're a newbie or experienced, Southwest is a great place to bring your business for all of your cycling needs.
