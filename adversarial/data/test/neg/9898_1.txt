Before my dog Finn got sick with Lymphoma, I was very iffy on the VEC.  I had heard so many horror stories about the price and the whole experience.  Well, I can tell you - that's not the case with this location.\n\nThe reception staff are wonderful!  They are kind, friendly and fun.  I know that's an odd thing to say when you're talking about emergency medicine, but they try to keep owners calm and focused on their pets.  They know my dog by name and are very loving.  This could be due to the fact that we have to visit the clinic on a weekly basis.\n\nSince I'm here weekly, I see a lot of different interactions with the staff and clients and they are always helpful, efficient and kind.  I once saw a front desk staff member cry with the family when they had to put their doggie down.\n\nNow, that being said, the services can be expensive, but it's equal to if you were to go to a different province or the USA with out health insurance.  Pet parents know that they would do anything to help their furchild.  I don't think the VEC exploits this, but remember it is a business.\n\nMy experiences are with the oncologist here, Dr. Kevin Finora and his amazing team of Vet Techs - Laura and Kendal.  They are wonderful!  Dr. Finora is very through, very kind and very smart.  He's been working with Finn since August and although it looks like Finn's Lymphoma might have gotten the best of us, we are still trying and he's working on doing everything possible to find a treatment.  Please note that Finn is NOT in pain during this, and I am not prolonging his life for my benefit.  He's been and still is a happy energetic dog who has not had any side effects to the medicine or treatment.\n\nLaura and Dr. Finora are very upfront with the costs, and will try and save you money when they can.  They don't push extra services on you and treat Finn like he's their dog.  Laura even made him cookies.  When he was getting his IV treatment, they would bandage his legs with cute little I love you stickers and hearts.  Kendal who sits with your dog during the treatments has a heart of gold and is so cute when speaking about him.  \n\nAside from working with your dog or cat, they are also very comforting when it comes to your feelings and how you are doing with the treatments and whole situation.  I'm a crazy pet parent, and they have been nothing but soothing, kind and informative.\n\nAside from being an emergency clinic, they have a lot of specialists in this location and they are all very informed in regards to new treatment, the most effective and helpful drugs. \n\nOver all I've had nothing but positive experiences here, despite the reason why I'm visiting.
