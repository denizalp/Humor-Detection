They have really improved since my last review.  I never have trouble reaching them anymore.  The techs are very polite and informative.  There is never a delay with delivery.  I still have to call once a year if I want someone to check out the oxygen concentrator.  When I asked why it wasn't automatically scheduled I was told that Medicare has the yearly rule and since I was not on Medicare it is only when I request or think it's necessary.  Before the merger it was yearly.  Also, when I need new tubing, cannulas or whatever, I would call and they would send them.  Payment was according to my insurance plan.  It was only after getting on a support group for my respiratory illness did I learn there was a large variety of styles and materials for these accessories! I was referred to an online company which shows pictures and describes everything.  I was able to get very comfortable rubber-like(not stiff) cannulas for home use and  clear micro tubing (that is much less noticeable) for my mobile oxygen. Tubing is extremely cheap so I just purchase my tubing online from someone else.  So I have to give them props on improving their business to the extent that they did.
