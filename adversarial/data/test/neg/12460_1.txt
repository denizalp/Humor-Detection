As a Las Vegas local and big fan of the buffet, I say this is easily the best buffet in town.  Have eaten here about a dozen times and will say it's consistently fantastic.   \n\nSo much variety cooked to perfection and the taste is amazing across the board.  The service staff must be well taken care of because they are always attentive, polite, and efficient.\n\nI seriously question the objectivity of anyone who offers up less than 4 stars for this magnificent wonderland of gluttony.
