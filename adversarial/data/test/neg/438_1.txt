This is a review of the service department, specifically in regard to Drive Clean testing. There are several Drive Clean testing facilities in the area and I have been to a few over the years -- Canadian Tire and Mr Lube. This is by far the nicest and fastest facility that I've visited, mainly because it's also a dealership. I came in at 10am for a Drive Clean test without an appointment and left within the hour. While waiting for service, I helped myself to free coffee, free chocolate chip cookies, and free wifi. There are also charging adapters for your devices. It has all of the Apple-specific adapters as well as some of the older Android adapters, but does not have USB-C.\n\nIn terms of convenience and cleanliness, this is my recommended place to go for your Drive Clean testing needs.
