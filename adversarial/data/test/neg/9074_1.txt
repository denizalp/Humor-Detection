What has happened here? It used to be friendly, reliable and offer a fresh panini.\n\nToday I went in and the place was quiet (there was one customer seated). The cashier seemed as though she could care less whether I was there or not. She just stared at me waiting for my order. I ordered a breaded chicken panini, with cheese and hot peppers, to go.  2 items...not hard to mess up......whoa......maybe they can.\nWhen I got to where I was going and bit into the panini expecting some mild heat from the peppers. Nada. Thinking that they may not be throughout the panini, I bit again, then again, then again. No hot peppers. Took the panini apart and nada....not a hot pepper in sight. Guess the 2 additional items was a bit much for either the cook or the cashier.\nOn a plus side, the bun was fresh.\nTotal, including a Fresca, came to $10.05.
