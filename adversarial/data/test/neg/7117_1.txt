This vet center was most impressive.  I arrived at 5:30pm and was taken immediately.  I had just rescued a stray dog and nothing was known about Sam.  I was greeted by 2 assistants that obviously love animals, Sam was given a treat that he enjoyed and the Dr  was THE nicest and warmest one that I've ever encountered!!  We left at 6:45 and Sammy was given a clean bill of health, some tests were done to make sure he was fine and all my questions were answered.  There was no rush to get us out, and I will definitely go there again.  Very professional and definitely worth going to.  A true diamond!
