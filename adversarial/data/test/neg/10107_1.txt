If you order the right thing, you will love this place. \nThe atmosphere is great here. It is like a bar, but not too loud like GUU. So you can actually have a conversation with frds here.\nFoods is good if you order the right thing. Personally,  I recommend below:\n--butter squid \n--Ebi Mayo: Their Ebi Mayo is a bit spicy \n--Oden: this is a awesome dish for winter time. Portion is big and soup base is awesome \n--Skewers: I like the pork one and the bacon one\nHowever, if you go on weekends, it will be very pack. Thus, make sure you go early. Also the food comes very slow during weekends. We waited for at least 30mins for our first dish (Even sashimi came very slow). \nOther than that, it is a great place to go at north York.
