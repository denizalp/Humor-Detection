Went back in on 4\/12 to lighten my hair back up for the summer and get a trim. \n\nAfter reading through some of these reviews, I have to say this: It's a SCHOOL, people. A learning environment! It's going to take a little while. This isn't a mill where they plop you down, cut your hair, and send you on your way. So be prepared. \n\nWith that said, once again, they did an amazing job. I have curly hair, and lots of it. They colored it right so it looks good whether I wear it curly or straight, the cut is amazing, and my hair looks great. \n\nThanks again, PMTS-LV.
