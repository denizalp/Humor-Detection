Hands down the worst pizza I have ever wasted my money on. The crust may as well have been a saltine cracker. Too thin, too dry no flavor. The cheese wasn't totally cooked in the center slices. And worst of all the pepperoni was under the cheese. Not sure what planet these people learned to make pizza on but it wasn't earth.
