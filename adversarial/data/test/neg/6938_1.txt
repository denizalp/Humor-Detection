Decided to try a new sushi restaurant for Mother's Day. Ordered the calamari that the menu states is a restaurant \"fave\". Cooked well but the sauce was to not for me. My mom and I always have bigger eyes than stomachs when it comes to sushi and this day was no different. Three rolls were ordered the sunset, platinum, and the macadamia. Sunset was by far the best, I actually wished I would have ordered two of them! I had one their icetini, presentation was pretty and it was very tasty. \nService was below average (it was not super busy when we were there) and that was the main reason for the 3 stars.  Took about 5 minutes to even get someone to say hello to us once we were seated, once water was delivered it took two different request to get my glass refilled. \nI will go back to try a few more items that came out if the kitchen and looked great and hope for better service.
