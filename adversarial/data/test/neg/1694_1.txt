I hate this place, BUT when company from out of town come by they always want to go because they saw it on TV. I usually warn them, but what your guests want, one must provide. \nA tip if you have to go there, eat before you go. \nThe food is sloppy and more often than not soggy or prepared incorrectly. Your server will always have a bad attitude. If you ask for it to be replaced, be prepared to wait. Don't bother replacing as your new meal will be just as nasty. \nI've been to every location always hoping for the best, but now I just fill up before I go. I usually end up saying \"I told you so\" to our guests. \nMaybe they were good at one time, but that time has been long passed. The very worst part is the service, or lack there of. I'm not a tip machine. If I get bad service,  you aren't getting a tip or at best, a dollar. I actually had a server follow me out and say \"hey, you forgot your dollar.\" When I told her that it was for her, she made a face and said \"if you don't like the service, why do you come here. This is how I pay my bills.\"\nI followed her in and talked to her manager who was \"SO shocked that she was rude to us.\" Didn't apologize. He just kept saying that's not like her.....*sigh*\nI really wish that they would pull it together. Clevelanders take pride in their city. Having visitors come to this place expecting greatness.....and getting the worst of the city, is heartbreaking.  \nIs it that hard? If so, maybe close or sell it to someone who can make it great again. \nGotta go fill up on chips now......
