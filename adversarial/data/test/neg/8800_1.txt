What a delightful little place Bertha's Cafe turned out to be.  I stumbled upon  it, not at all familiar with all of the great ratings here on Yelp.\n\nI had the breakfast sandwich, which was terrific.  The bread was grilled, like a panini.  After I got there, they were just switching over to lunch.  I had neighbor envy when I saw all of these incredible lunch sandwiches and salads coming out of the kitchen.  \n\nI got a blueberry scone for a snack later.  However, while I was just sitting and finishing my coffee, and watching the crowd come in, I took a little nibble of the scone.  Well, so much for my afternoon snack!  I ate the scone right then and there.  I should have bought another scone, but I was really stuffed.\n\nGreat little place.  Nice people, outdoor seating.  Terrific food.
