It's few times you meet such nice individuals and make you feel at home in a nail salon. I get my nails done all over the US as I travel for work and this by far was one of the best I have been to. Scott did an incredible job on my gel manicure Ali g with a little bling and Lee made by pedicure shine. I will now get my nails done here every time and will bring my sisters and friends.
