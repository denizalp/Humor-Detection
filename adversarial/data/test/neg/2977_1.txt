Went to check out this spot with some friends. I ordered a black and bleu burger, and cajun fries. Definitely was one of the best burgers ive had. Customer service was excellent, I really like how as soon as you walk in the place you are immediately greeted by wonderful hosts. I really appreciate the service that was provided by a hostess by the name of Amari. Very nice, enthusiastic, and cute . Overall I had a great experience at Lazy Dog.
