I have to say that Clinton the clerk I rented from was very pleasant and personable,  he of course urged me to purchase the rental insurance but I declined, (I always carry proof of insurance when renting a vehicle) he knew from our conversation that he was barking up the wrong tree so he dropped the subject. The car it's self was adequate but decidedly filthy.... I haul pets in my vehicle all day long.... I KNOW from a filthy car .... but even that was not a deal breaker. The trouble started when I returned the car and inadvertently left a case with all my phone\/camera\/Fitbit chargers under the seat. I phoned them immediately when I got to the airport, the phone rang incessantly finally had to board the flight. I called my family in Vegas and they went to the Ace office to retrieve the case,  they were told the car had already been rented and the would check it as soon as it was returned and mail the case back to me. Already long story short I called the office THEY DON'T ANSWER THE PHONE!!! On Thursday 3\/15 I called 4 times in a row on hold for about 15minutes each time before kicking me to voice mail. This went on all week until I finally reached a human on Sunday that was very pleasant and told me the car was due back on Monday,  they would call me and let me know if they found the case. Again days go by no response. Started calling again still no answer and no response to my voice mails... finally reached someone who said the car needed to have a hold to be checked out,  she would call me when the car was returned yet again. This all began 3\/14 finally got through today 3\/26 after 2 attempts just today to be told they looked in the car and the case was gone..... REALLY, SHOCKING!?!  At any point they could have called and told me it wasn't found. Completely over the whole thing.  It's not even about the lost case, it's about the complete lack of integrity of this company and all the wasted time trying to get through. Here's a Pro Tip for a successful business.... practice a little follow through, clean your filthy cars and answer your damned phones.
