I stopped in overnight to see some relatives. I was happy with this Sheraton. The staff was nice, and the rooms were clean, the internet worked ($10 per 24 hour period), plenty of pillows, enough parking in structure and easy to get to the freeway. One thing that I had a problem with was that the room and bathroom seemed smaller than I would have thought for a Sheraton. The room had two double beds, flat screen TV, desk with a chair and a padded chair. I felt that the room needed a small couch. But it was fine for the time I stayed. \n\nThe best part of the stay was the water slide. You have to be a certain height to go on. If you are tall enough it will keep you occupied for a few minutes or all day. It is nice because it is away from the large pool. I would stay just for the water slide.
