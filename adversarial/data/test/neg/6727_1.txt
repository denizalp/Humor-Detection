I've been to the OG Pizzeria Bianco and I have no idea what's wrong with this location. The other one was great! The food was pretty good but the service was horrid. Our waitress was mediocre at best and it was problem after problem with this place. I'll give Pizzeria Bianco one more try but never at this location.
