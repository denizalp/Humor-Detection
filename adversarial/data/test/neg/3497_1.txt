Do not rent from this advantage car rental. The front desk clerks are rude, condescending and push extras at every opportunity. \n\nOn top of the horrific service, I was told \"it's ok that the low tire pressure light is on\". After I left I had to air up the right rear tire 3 times (at my expense) in the next 18 hours before I returned to have the tire repaired. When I got there the intake agent accused me of re-painting the trunk lid - remember, only 18 hours into possession. Now I am having to fight with PURCO fleet services for previous damage to the car. \n\nThe company did exchange the rental, but tried to charge me $8.99 per gallon for fuel I used, that was a fight to prevent that ludicrous idea. \n\nThey get one star because I can't give them 0. Never again will my shadow darken Advantage car rental in Las Vegas
