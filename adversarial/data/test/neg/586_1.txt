We sampled a few different types of sushi namely the green dragon roll, rainbow roll and the spicy tuna.  The sushi was okay, tasted fresh.  The fried food was very bland.  The price for the all you can eat was affordable.  The service, however, was atrocious.  The wait staff were rude and miserable.  I would not return or recommend this restaurant to anyone.  Save your money and head to the Annex for better sushi and definitely superior service.
