In the neighborhood after work looking around I saw a sign furniture superstore. The signs got me to turn in right away... I entered the building and I was greeted right away. The gentleman asked if he can help me... The top of my list is a new refrigerator and I was just asking if they carry them... The gentleman said no... I just asked him do you know a place that does... Thinking he would refer a individually owned place similar.... He said I don't know the area too well... He went out of his way to ask another sales person.... The sales guys didn't give his co worker respect and like a smartass told me to go to Wal-Mart in a rude disrespectful arrogant way... Although the salesman stayed professional with a poker face.... I felt so disrespected.... Huge store and totally would have looked around.... I wanted to look around ... I instead asked for the bathroom... The gentleman gestured me to the restrooms... I started getting pissed inside my head about how rude that guy talked to us.... After I got out of the restroom... I saw the salesman as he was going to help someone else... I said that guy was so rude... I asked him who was the manager... He guided me too the man with the glasses... I told him that I was asking a question and I pointed to the sales guy with NO MANNERS AND STRAITE SMART ASS RUDE WITH NO RESPECT FOR CO WORKERS OR CUSTOMERS THAT AREN'T HIS.... I told the manager I can't even look around because he was so rude... I had to repeat the story a few times I dont know if he understood English too well but he was trying and he was nice.... So I guess I'm just going to put it in writing..... Wouldn't look around if someone paid me with shady rude guy there...
