As the name suggests, the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth is definitely one of the city's Grande Dame hotels (in terms of age and reputation).  Conveniently located above the central train station and close to major banks and offices, this hotel offers travelers and visitors convenient, compact luxury.  Budget conscious travelers should steer clear, but those seeking modern amenities should probably look elsewhere.\n\nPros:\n-Convenient location with direct access to the RES network, central train station, and within walking distance of the Bonaventure and McGill Metro\n-Super comfortable bed\n-Great shower with terrific, lightly scented amenities (they are pretty neutral and not overpowering)\n-Big LCD Flatscreen Television\n-Complementary WiFi (at least for our room; may vary for other visitors)\n-Spacious gym\n-Helpful staff\n-Free water in the lobby\n\nCons:\n-Very tiny rooms\n-Bathroom fixtures seemed a little dated and broken; there was a large crack in the sink, one of the handles was broken, and the toilet was installed askew.\n-$19 for room service continental breakfast (coffee, juice, pastry)???\n-Gym equipment would not look out of place in a 1980s Jane Fonda workout video (except for the cardio equipment, which looked fairly new)\n\nEven though this hotel advertises itself as a five-star, it's really a four star.  Definitely upscale, but also showing its age a little bit.  Still, it's a classic Canadian hotel and a comfortable way to stay in the city.
