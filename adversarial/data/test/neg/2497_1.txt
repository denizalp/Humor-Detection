Owner very nice and extremely friendly. My husband's Venezuelan coffee was delicious. I ate some of his plantains that were very good.   I tried the chicken salad with avocado in their arepa. I am not a fan of the arepas. I ended up eating the chicken salad and avocado and leaving the arepa.  It was doughy and didn't appear done enough. My husband got the typical Venezuelan lunch which was beans, rice some shredded meat and plantains. I'm jot a coffee drinker but that was the delight of the meal.   Very friendly folks and most people have liked the arepa meals.  I wish the folks the best.
