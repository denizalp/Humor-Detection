Hands down still the best Thai food in the Valley. A staple in the east valley since the early 1980's. The Mint Thai Cafe Menu is extensive, with all the traditional Thai fare. Several specials are offered. Tonight Pumpkin Curry. Over thirty years in business and still the best place for great Thai food..
