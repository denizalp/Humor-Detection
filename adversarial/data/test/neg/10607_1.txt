I stayed here on my last night in Scottsdale.  The room was nice.  The beds were clean and comfortable.  The bathroom was nice.  I did have a problem turning on the shower.  It really took some elbow grease to get it to turn on.  Another complaint that I would have is that in the middle of the night there was some very loud noise that woke me up.  I can't really say what it was, but I got out of bed to investigate because it sounded like a plane landed right outside my window.  I did not see one though.  I was impressed that they had enough towels for four people so I did not have to call to request more.  I also enjoyed the hot breakfast i had in the morning.  I had a western omelet, sausage patty and seasoned potatoes.  Overall I felt that the room was very clean and well worth the money.
