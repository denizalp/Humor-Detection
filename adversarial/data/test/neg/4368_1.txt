We stopped at the Las Vegas KOA at the end of a 4 week trip. Red Rock was very accommodating in working around our schedule. The Detailer's name was Nick and he did an excellent job in washing our very dirty RV. He was very friendly and worked hard in 100+ degree heat. I would definitely recommend using their service.
