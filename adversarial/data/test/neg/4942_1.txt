I've heard great things about this restaurants fish sandwich so I came here on a Friday around 6:00 during Lent with my husband. There was not a parking space anywhere, we actually had to drive around behind the building and park in a tight spot next to a dumpster. Walked in the door and we weren't even greeted, the hostess didn't ask how many were in our party or tell us how long of a wait it would be or say two words to us. I couldn't tell you what the fish tastes like because we turned around and walked out after 15 minutes of standing in the entrance next to the \"please wait to be seated\" sign while at least 3 staff members walked past us. I understand we came at a busy time but they could have at least acknowledge someone waiting to be seated. Maybe if we came at a different time we would have received better service, but after reading other reviews it doesn't sound like there's better service at any time.
