Very nice d√©cor and friendly staff, especially the owner who repeatedly came by the table to make sure all was well.\n\nVietnamese food was very well done. (Bun, and combination plate)\n\nA bit pricey for the serving size ($14\/each)\nAug 2015 update \n   Food still good BUT no lunch menu so pricey for lunch
