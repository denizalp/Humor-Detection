Went there for ice cream with my sister in law and thought it was a bit pricey for two ice cream treats called tornados (ice cream blended with a topping and eaten with a spoon).  However when we actually got our ice cream they were huge.  So the price was worth the amount of ice cream you received.  They also do sno  cones and frozen yogurt.  Not a bad place to go for ice cream.
