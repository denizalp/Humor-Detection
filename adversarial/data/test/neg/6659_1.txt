I'm in love. The brisket is to die for!!! I came on a Tuesday around 12:30 and the line was under 20 minutes, which worked well for me. I got the 2 meat plate with the brisket (tempted to get double...), Ribs, beans, and grits. I had also gotta and Arizona tea all for $20ish and definitely worth it. Wish I had space for the pecan pie because it looked really good. This was probably the best brisket I've had and I love me some brisket. I've tried several 'famous' bbq joints and this one just melts in your mouth. They offer a fatty or lean cut but they had me at fatty . \n\nThe ribs fell off the bones as they should and had a great smoky flavor. The beans had what looked like rib meat in them and the grits were good. I thought they would be spicier since they're jalapeno grits but still tasty nonetheless. They also give you the option of bread, onions, pickles, and pickled jalapenos. Yes. \n\nThe inside is pretty small but it's nice that they have misters outside as you're waiting in the relentless heat. They also offer water outside, which is really nice. \n\nDefinitely coming back and probably end up ordering a pound of brisket next time...
