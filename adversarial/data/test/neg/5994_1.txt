Long lines, great sandwiches. We waited about 45 minutes at 10am on a Saturday and ordered a bunch of different sandwiches.\n\nThe eggslut which is a soft boiled egg on top of pureed potatoes is delicious! The potatoes are really good and with the runny yolk it's a great combo.\n\nTheir actual sandwiches are made on fresh bread and the egg itself is perfectly cooked! The one with bacon (they give you a lot of bacon) is pretty good, and their hamburger is just OK.
