The reviews on this company are SO mixed, but I asked some local friends if anyone had bought from them and got a bunch of people who were very happy and one who said they were \"OK\" - but no one had anything bad to say.  \n\nI needed 2 sets of mattresses for my twin girls who had just moved to big girl beds.  We ended up getting the most basic of the basic stuff and I thought the price was good and the quality was fantastic.  (I like a firmer surface myself and the next step up seemed too soft to me - you can always add padding but you can't take it away.)  \n\nI've spent many a night sleeping with my girls when they were sick or otherwise in need of snuggling and I find their mattresses to be super comfortable.  Again these were the MOST basic ones they sell!  With the box spring...  my own bed is a platform bed which might be why my girls' beds feel so comfortable, it might be the box spring.  \n\nMy husband and I are getting a new bed soon and we will definitely use the mattress factory again.  Yes there is a delivery charge but I just brought everything home in my minivan to avoid that.  Everything was in stock and they threw it all in the van for me.  \n\nIt seems like the negative reviews are the fancier mattresses, maybe they don't do as well with those - but I prefer a less plush mattress and we're very happy with what we got.  \n\nVERY low pressure sales, very happy with the mattresses.  Totally recommend.\n\nAs a bonus - whatever wood they use to make the box springs smells amazing so for the first week or two you will have a wonderful cedary smelling bedroom - if that is your thing.  I liked it a lot.
