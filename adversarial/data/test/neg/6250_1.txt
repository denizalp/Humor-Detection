While my lunches, snacks and beverages are always delicious...I LOATHE dealing with their bakery staff. They are always rude and impatient. I work in the same complex and come in often, I smile and greet them comfortably because I see them about 3x a week...they never smile back and always look like I'm bothering them. I literally just had someone slam my straw on the counter, it's just an iced tea, sorry I asked! Last time I checked, you work at the bakery counter and have to deal with people on a daily basis. If you don't want to deal with customers don't work at a grocery store. Smile, just smile?! Sheesh!
