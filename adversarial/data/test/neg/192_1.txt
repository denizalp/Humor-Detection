well folks we moved to Tucson a year ago and we really miss Bertha's. They have been in business 8 years ! The owner has a few employees that have been there for 4 and 5 years, for a small operation I think this is a great plus. now to the food, I almost always have the Chicken Pesto sandwich, always good. My friend had a salad which she also said was very good, nice fresh lettuce(her comment). over the years I have liked eating at Bertha's, now that I live in Tucson my visits are not as often, but I work my trip aroun going there for lunch. Good, clean and tasty food.
