My mom and I came here on a hot summer day. We wanted to eat inside, but found out that it wouldn't be cooler in there because the doors and windows were open. So we sat in the shade on the patio.\nI ordered the garlic pizza and it was to die for. One of the best pizza's I've had. I could have eaten the whole thing myself, but stopped myself because I knew in 10 minutes I would regret it.  My mom ordered a pasta dish, but couldn't get further than a few bites because she wasn't feeling the great. The server was so sweet and was trying to help my mom. She brought her some ginger ale and kept coming over to see if everything was ok. \n\nI keep meaning to go back here, and now that I'm writing this, I'm craving the pizza so bad!
