Was looking online for some Mexican food and stumbled upon this restaurant. Went in on a Tuesday night at 6:45pm and seated immediately. The complimentary chips and salsa were brought to the table shortly after. The salsas were so-so. The red salsa was served warmed, and the cilantro creamy salsa was served cold. We asked if they had some other salsa's, which they did. A habanero green salsa, which was pretty spicy with a kick, and another red salsa. These ones had a little more flavor, in my opinion, so definitely ask for those to try them! They were offering happy hour all Tuesday for drinks (margaritas and draft beers). \n\nOn to the food....talk about generous portions! It was so much food for 2 people. My friend got the Shrimp Poblano and I got the Beef fajitas a La Cucos. We ordered flour tortillas, and each got 2 fresh tortillas. Both dishes came with rice, beans, lettuce and guacamole. The beans and rice were flavorful. We both agreed we would order them again. The shrimp poblano wasn't what we were expecting, as the creamy sauce was in the middle and shrimp all around. The shrimp was fresh but a little overcooked (but it was still tasty!) The beef fajitas were O.M.G. good!! Probably some of the best beef fajitas I've ever had. The beef was so tender and yummy! The onions were sauteed to perfection. If you don't eat that much, I'd say an appetizer with a one person fajitas would be plenty for two. Prices were a little on the higher end. \n\n\nThe ambiance was cute and cozy. Interior was clean and they were playing good Spanish music in the background that wasn't too loud and aloud for conversation. \n\nOverall, food and service were great!! I definitely recommend this place and plan on coming back to try other menu items!
