2\/5\/17\nLoved this place would return if I was in Scottsdale again!  The chips and salsa, short braised rib nachos all to die for.\nWe were there for a late lunch on a Sunday, we sat outside great weather \nThe only thing we didn't like was the flan dessert.\nService was good, servers were friendly and the food was GREAT.  \nWould recommend this place!
