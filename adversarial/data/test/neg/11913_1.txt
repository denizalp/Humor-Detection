First time chase user and it was a good experience to say the least.\n\nComing from bank of America most things were very similar. Boa goes above and beyond, though, in that I get free use of many atms (they waive fees) and free checks delivered to me. Neither of these things was offered at chase. \n\nDespite that, chase was a solid option since boa isn't in Cleveland. Its in a great location.\n\nIn addition the lady my wife and I met with, Melissa, was a pleasure to speak to and a consummate professional. She helped us get our checking and savings accounts started, credit cards added, and even gave us advice about new things here in Cleveland and different things we could do or try. \n\nAll said and done, I would definitely recommend chase. They have a ton of good services they're just a step behind boa.
