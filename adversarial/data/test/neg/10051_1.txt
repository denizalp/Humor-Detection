OVERPRICED. \nGiven that at the Crystals mall, don't be surprised when you see your bill. Great ambiance for a date night. Dimmed lights, upbeat music and perky girls in high heels greeting you as you walk in. Typical in a swanky Vegas restaurant. \nThey have a Social Hour daily from 5-8. However, the menu is limited and the cocktails are weak. I ordered the pinot grigio which was on the sweeter side. Their rolls are decent, but you can't mess up a classic salmon avocado or tuna roll. Our waitress was sweet, until she interrupted our conversation after we were finishing up on our drinks. Basically she wanted us to GTFO.\nNot worth the money, unless you're looking for ambiance on the strip and don't mind paying the price. Otherwise, try hitting up off-strip sushi places like Raku.
