I stopped by a few weeks ago to get my nails done for New Years. I usually go to any nail salon I can when i need my nails done, but after going here I don't think I will go anywhere else. They are so friendly, talented, and clean here. The guy who did my nails (unfortunately I dont remeber his name) paid so much attention to detail with shaping my acrylic set and making sure eachone was even. They look great. Very appreciated!
