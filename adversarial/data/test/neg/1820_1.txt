I've lived in Champaign for about 8 years and always had to go back to Chicago for real hair products. I'm so glad that Urban Beauty is around now. They upgraded their shop a few years ago so now they have basic products (pink oil, natural hair conditioners, the occasional boot, cheap earrings in every color, and wave caps) AND a large selection of wigs and extensions. My sister (a Remy fan from way back) prefers DJ's for their hair and pricing, but I think Urban has better assistance if you are starting out and wig selection. Most wigs that you can put heat on will run you about $30-60 dollars, with some of the longer ones being closer to $100. Overall, prices are fair and the staff is really helpful.
