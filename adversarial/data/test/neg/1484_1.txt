Wow. What an experience! The beginning was a tad bit difficult bc I couldn't find the host desk but it was smooth sailing afterwards. Food and drinks were top drawer! The service from our waiter, Matt, was Excellent! A very good job. Inhad the chiliqules and Damn! They put my mims cooking to shame! Great job! My favorite part was the music amd ambience
