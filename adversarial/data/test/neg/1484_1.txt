My daughter and I were in Whitby Wednesday afternoon and decided to do sushi for lunch. So we decided on Sushi Today after checking the reviews and was recommended by my son who ate there quite often.\nWe were seated right away and it was not busy maybe a dozen tables were occupied. We were quickly served and got our drinks right away. We placed our order and the food arrived pretty quickly compared to most sushi AYCE (all you can eat) I've been too.\nThe sushi was alright some fell apart when picking them up. The orders kept coming and they were constantly rearranging our table as they placed our orders down. The servers were constantly removing our dishes as they were completed and to a point where our conversation was always being interrupted that we felt we were being rushed.\nI'm giving three stars for the food but zero for the service which was rushed and rude. The price was good but the service was bad and they rushed you to pay your bill.\nI'll probably never return because I've been to better sushi places around Durham region.
