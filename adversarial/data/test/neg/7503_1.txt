for fast food, they're pretty good. but I will say, the older gentleman with glasses should really find a job that suits him better. He cannot hear the best & I felt like i was repeating my order more to him than he was to me. The way he speaks isn't always clear either. My daughter nor I could understand him at some points in the conversation. \nLove it here, but it's frustrating to come in when he's working the drive thru & the front counter.
