Wow!! These guys are AMAZING!! \n\nAt first when my oven broke, I had called a different appliance repair company to my residence. After the broken part was misdiagnosed and two additional trips with other parts had been made, my oven was still not fixed and working. I was then told that they could not find the part. :-( \n\nAfter asking around my office for referrals, I had TWO different people recommend Elite Pro Appliance Repair and I am so happy that they did! Ronald came out to my residence and not only diagnosed my bad control board, he also took the time to try to manually fix the circuits himself. After not getting it to work, he told me I would unfortunately have to order a new one. Long story short, he ordered the part and called me a week later to say it had came in and schedule my appointment. He came out and had my oven working FAST. I highly recommend this company to anyone and I will be spreading the word to family and friends!!
