I went here to have my iPhone 6 screen replaced. The guy said he price matches competitors but after he fixed my phone and I showed him the price $79.99 he said that was below his cost. Just because of the whole principle of saying he price matched but refused to in this case I had him put on my old screen again and went with a competitor which I'm glad I did! I got the $79.99 price plus a free tempered glass protector as stated at the competitor too! I would rather take my business to honest local companies.
