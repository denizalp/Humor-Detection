Stopped at this location since I was in the area. & wow, they have super cute clothes, but their customer service is what changed my mind. I was greeted by a girl with long hair as soon as I walked in. She said hello from the back of the store & stayed at the front area, where I was shopping. I picked up a pair of jeans and automatically, she asked if she could get a dressing room started. Didn't have a problem with that, until after every item I picked up she kept bugging to take them from me... I mean, it's kinda nice since I was pushing my baby around in her stroller, but I felt an awkward, uncomfortable vibe.  Almost as if she was following me around. I know what it's like working retail, been there & done that, but even on a slow day, you shouldn't chase your customers around the store. Let them be! \n\nWhen I went to try on my clothes, another lady put me in the handicapped stall, but told me I couldn't bring my stroller. MY CHILD WAS SLEEPING. They expected me to change with the door wide open & my baby waiting in the doorway... I mean, I'm comfortable & I understand people aren't kid friendly & worry about shoplifters, but I didn't expect this to be taken to such a stupid extreme. \n\nMy baby was sleeping & I wanted to shop in peace, but they ruined it for me.
