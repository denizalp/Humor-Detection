Ever since we've moved in, we have had problems with this management company - ENDLESS PROBLEMS. The owner called to resolve all the complaints, but the customer service is still inadequate. One of the windows they said they'd fix is still broken and both don't even lock! I cannot believe they would think this is acceptable after our apartment has already been broken into. This is after they did not allow us to change the locks. I do not feel safe at all! \n\nA new washer and dryer was FINALLY delivered after weeks of complaining and instead of taking the old one and installing the new one, they just leave the new one in the hallway of our condo! It blocks the entire hallway! Do they really expect us to carry two washer and dryers by ourselves, let alone figure out how to install it?! We had to call them again to complain and have them send a technician over.\n\nI don't think they understand the concept behind customer service and I cannot be anymore disappointed with this company. If I could give zero stars, I would. It has been the most stressful 2 months of my life trying to work with these people. What a nightmare.
