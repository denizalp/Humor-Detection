I'm kind of surprised at all of the lackluster reviews on here.  Maybe coming from Wheeling, my bar standards are low or something, but I had a great time here before the game last night.  The beers were cold and cheap, the pierogies were hot and crispy, and I had some of the best nachos I've had in a looong time.  The waitresses weren't wearing burqas or anything, but I definitely wasn't offended by their outfits.  I would definitely go back before the next home game.
