The guy at the counter was decent I wouldn't call it professional but definitely not rude. I waited a while for a full size car then I was told they would upgrade me for free into an suv because they were out of full size cars I said I didn't want that because it was a gas hogger and  both guys said it was really great on gas so I took it and when I got to my destination 11 miles away it had wasted 1\/4 tank so I took it back and they gave me my car with no hesitation which made me very happy but I shouldn't had to worry about that if I had prepaid for my car they should have had it there and ready.
