Came for Friday night out with wife and children. This is not the first time I have been to this location. The staff is always very available and friendly and keep you satisfied. The food is good, but I would go more for the sports and service! My order came out with incorrect taco shells, and even though I still ate it, the manager came out and took care of my meal and even gave me my correct order! Always great service! Lots of tv's and music can be loud at times, but overall not bad for a weeknight out, or if you want a place to catch the game with friends!
