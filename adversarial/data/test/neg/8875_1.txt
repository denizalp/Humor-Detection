Carpeted- YUCK! Carpet is dirty and probably full of drool..food... Boogers and who knows what else. Seems a little behind times to put carpet in an area with such a high traffic of kids. Play area for toddlers\/babies needs to be updated. Some old exersaucers and over used books, toys. Big jungle gym is pretty nice. A bit small compared to the other josos in the South. The staff are useless, always on their cellphones, zero personality (odd for a kids place with a preschool as well don't you think?!) and never paying attention to what's going on. They are not very inviting at all and seem like they hate their jobs. Not very much space for parents to sit. Quite a crowded area that is outdated.
