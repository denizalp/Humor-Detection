It was a rainy Sunday in boonieville and the day's planned activity was a long drive through the country here to East Gwillimbury to check out CrepeStar. It was a bit difficult to locate as it's inside a big retail complex and trying to just follow the addresses as you drive along didn't work. It's tucked in a nicely pavered laneway with a few designated parking spaces, one of which we luckily were able to use. The storefront is attractively decorated and I was gung ho to go.\n\nThe staff generously allowed us to use the big comfy circular booth, even though it was just the two of us.  I'd never had a Vietnamese coffee before, so I had to try it.  I guess I'm not as smart as I looked to the server - when he brought it to the table, he didn't presume to have to explain to my noobness that you really have to wait for the espresso to drip slowly through the filter sitting atop the condensed milk waiting inside the cup, and that the little pot of hot water is for you to dilute it to your taste once the coffee is in the cup.  I have espresso for blood so I drank it straight with only the condensed milk, and it was pretty good.  I only wish that I had waited to have it served after the meal to enjoy it as a dessert digestif!\n\nBoth of us had savoury crepes.  I had the Ham and Cheese crepe, with mushrooms added as an extra item.  BF had the Cajun Chicken Crepe.  They were OK but that's about it.  The crepe itself is nicely made but the filling ingredients only taste so-so, basically just like pulling average stuff out of the fridge at home and whipping it up together, and with less cheese than I'd use at home.  \n\nI wish I had ordered a dessert.  I suspect I would have a better overall liking of the place if my experience here had included one.  BF did order the Bailey's Mudslide Sundae, but it turned out to be a disappointment because of the way it's presented on the menu - it is listed as a Coffee Sundae, but it doesn't come with any.  Arf!\n\nThe staff did presume that we wanted a very leisurely stay, which I suppose was an attempt to be nice and leave us alone to discuss some plans we had mentioned, but I couldn't even make eye contact when we did want to get going.  We sat so long just sitting and waiting for a check on us that I finally had to get up and pay the bill at the cash register.\n\nI actually want to like this place better than 3 stars, but I can't based on this visit.  I don't even know yet whether I'd make it the destination of another rainy day afternoon drive, but if I do, I hope it turns out to be at least 4 stars since I think it has the potential.
