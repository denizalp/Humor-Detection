I recently attended a matinee performance of \"Seussical\" here with my fiance and his 5-year-old son.  It was the first time any of us had been to this venue, and I was fairly impressed.  The theater itself is clean and large, and all tables have excellent views of the stage.  The staff were friendly and very accommodating.\n\nWhen we arrived, we were escorted to our table, which was right up front.  We went to the buffet area to get our food, which was just average.  I'm not sure if the dinner buffet is any better, but this one had a lot of choices for kids, which was good for our little guy (mac & cheese, chicken nuggets, etc.), but left something to be desired for the adults.  The desserts were OK - the ice cream bar was the best part.  Soft drinks and alcoholic drinks are available for purchase, and tipping is highly encouraged (there's a placard on the table suggesting how much to tip, which I found to be helpful information but slightly tacky).\n\nWhile we ate, the cast members walked around, stopping to pose for photos and sign autographs.  That was a really nice touch, and it was fun for the kids to see the characters before the show.  \n\nThe musical itself was really good for a small local theater.  I was impressed with the talent of the cast and it definitely held our little guy's attention the entire time (an intermission helped break up the show).  \n\nOverall, I was very impressed with our experience, and I would definitely go again, either as a family event or maybe a \"date night\".  The only thing preventing me from giving this place 5 stars is the food - it was average.
