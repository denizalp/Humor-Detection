I managed to find a Groupon deal for flavors. Before the Groupon, I was told to go to try places like the Wicked Spoon, The Buffet at the Wynn, and Bacchanal Buffet. Even though they had great ratings and reviews, I was still in Vegas on a budget and dinner buffet prices are steep. Flavors is pricey as well but buying the Groupon, we still made out better than the regular price because AYCD alcoholic beverages were included.\n\nThe Groupon allowed us to jump in the reward member line and get special seating. It was great because the line to be seated was shorter. The service was very slow but the servers are very friendly. Maybe they were understaffed that night but we only were able to get 2 drinks a piece because the drink server pretty much had to serve our whole area alone. I guess it's good that we got two drinks a piece versus zero so the Groupon wasn't a total waste but I'm still not happy that I couldn't have more drinks.\n\nThe food was really good!!! There were so many options to choose from: Asian, Mexican, Italian, seafood, soul food. It was all delicious. I was so stuffed that I couldn't indulge in the desserts but my boyfriend let me try some of his ice cream and the strawberry ice cream was bomb!!\n\nIt would be great if they had a Groupon like this the next visit to Vegas because I would definitely come back. I would try to come to dinner early so I would have more time to indulge in food and drinks. Hopefully service speeds up as well.
