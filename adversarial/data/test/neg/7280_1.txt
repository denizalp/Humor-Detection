My 2 and 3 year old have been taking swim lessons at Charlotte Aquatics for over a year. We have had experience with several instructors and loved every one. My children really look forward to going to their swim lessons and have learned so much. I feel so much more comfortable with them around any body of water now that they have each learned basic water safety skills. I would recommend this facility to anyone looking to teach skills to their children and have wonderful bonding time with babies under the age of 2.
