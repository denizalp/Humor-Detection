The meatballs are exceptional,  and the pizza with pear and gorgonzola was so delicious.  Was with a large party and the service was great.  Spaghetti sauce is slightly sweet,  so if that's not your bag,  consider requesting an arrabiata sauce.  Dessert is worth it, the chocolate cake is fantastic,  as is the wedding cake and tiramisu. It's pricey so come prepared.
