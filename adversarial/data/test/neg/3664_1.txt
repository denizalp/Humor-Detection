Tried this spot last weekend for lunch with my boyfriend and his sister. I ordered Hummus with Chicken, my boyfriend got the Lamb Gyro and his sister ordered the Feta, tabouli and vegie gyro and we ordered a Hummus appetizer.\n\nOk, so the appetizer reminds me of a 'happy hour' appetizer. Ya know the one where you feel a lil jipped except here you're paying full price, so I was a lil disappointed. It was really good but, it was ity bity. \n\nAs for his lamb gyro, he ate it up and said it was delish, the vegie gyro apparently was not up to par and she couldn't get through it. She said it seemed like some of the ingredients were still raw\/undercooked as far as the veggies went.\n\nAs for my hummus. It was good not great. It was exactly the same size as the appetizer hummus with a lil chicken in it. Flavor was good but the chicken was dry. \n\nI'm a huge fan of middle eastern food, but can't say I'm a huge fan of this place unfortunately.
