I've only been to Cien Agaves once, and it was Cinco de Mayo, so I understandably don't have a good grasp on their day-to-day operations.\n\nHowever, in a city that is filled to the gills with rip-off, overcrowded, overpriced cantinas on Cinco, Cien Agaves was a breath of fresh air.\n\nWe were there in the afternoon with a large group of 20.  We received good service the entire time, cheap and tasty cocktails, and very good tacos.  In my book, that's 3 for 3.
