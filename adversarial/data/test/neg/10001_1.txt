Help!! Our fav neighborhood place to ride bikes to for Sat morning breakfast is staring to feel a little worn out. Patio and tables were dirty- monsoon perhaps? Nothing a good scrub and replacements couldn't fix. Also consider a few kid friendly items- plain pancake or eggs would help. Otherwise my New Mexico Burrito and Nutella mocha and were awesome! Your presence is part of what makes the  North 32  enclave of the best places to live in town.
