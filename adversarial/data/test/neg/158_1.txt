Cannot go wrong here. Outstanding steaks, wine and wait staff. The lobster mashed potatoes and mac n cheese are a must have. Portio.n size makes it great for sharing for those like me who cannot decide. \n\nBeautiful view of north side of Camelback. Mtn from outside dining. Cool bar. \n\nOnly regrets are we have not made it for Sunday brunch yet but will and they are not 30 minutes closer.
