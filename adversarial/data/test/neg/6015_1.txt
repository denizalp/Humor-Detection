Proud to call 12 West my new local bar\/brewery! A bike ride away, is my new favorite day drinking spot. A new(ish) addition to Agritopia, 12 West provides the beer option to compliment all of the good food and coffee already on the grounds. I have been there about a dozen times so far, and tried just about all of the brews. The stand outs for me are the Mijo (Triple IPA), the Frontside (West Coast IPA), and the Insomniac (Double IPA). OK, yes, I am partial to IPA's. The seating arrangement both inside and out promotes a very social atmosphere where you can strike up conversation or take some new friends on in a board game. One of 12 West's biggest strengths is the staff. Each member is friendly, knowledgeable, and provides outstanding customer service. It is also a small staff, so you start to get to know them pretty quickly! The GM and head Brewer are almost always on site taking care of business and helping show people a good time. Bonus- the music\/playlist works for me. The only 2 things keeping it from 5 stars: 1) Closing time! I know it is East Gilbert, but last call at 10:45pm on the weekend can be a drag, especially when there are not many options for a place to go after! I believe it is even earlier on the weeknights. But again, for day drinking, this is the spot! 2) Some of the other beers (non IPA) need work. They are not bad by any means, but just average. I do love that they continue to release new brews and I am confident the overall quality will only get better! So glad you set up shop here 12 West!
