Restaurant was really good, I see a lot of complaints about the servers on here. We had two ladies assisting us at our table, both were very nice, helping, and even made recommendations that were excellent. The only issue I thought of was the pricing. I've been to Korean restaurants in Vegas and Los Angeles who charged less and gave you more choices, shrimp and more chicken variations for example. All in all a good experience and will be back, may have to drop down to a lower tier meat selection as almost $40 for the C plan seemed high, especially if you only enjoy a few of the items in that plan.
