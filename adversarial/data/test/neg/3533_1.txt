Great location if you are waiting for a show (Ka to be exact)....  We had about an hour to spare and sat at the bar...ordered a couple martinis and decided to get a few apps.\n\n- The Ahi Tuna and the to 'DIE FOR' Blue Cheese truffle chops.... (I had read about them both on Yelp!)   Wolfgang is a genius for dreaming up those chips... I wished i want sharing them.  I gave it a 4.... but the chips get a 5!
