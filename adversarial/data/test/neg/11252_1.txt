Overrated and overpriced. Valid for a one time experience but that's about it. The whole experience took over 2,5 hours. We were most of the time thirsty (wine and water are not served as often), hungry (there was a break of 40 min between appetizer and entree) or annoyed. The food was okay but the dessert was gross: it tasted like frozen dessert and a bad quality tasteless ice cream. \nI expected way more paying a total bill of +150 for 2 people (we had wine).
