I moved here from Houston and Pep boys there was my go-to for repairs. This is my fourth visit to this shop and every time I get turned around for a simple tire repair. Honestly,  just a plug! In Houston they did those in 10 minutes. Here I get \"this will need 4 hours\" and \"we're done taking work for the day \".  They also wouldnt schedule an appointment so i can't just bring out in to plug the thing and leave. Well, I'm looking for a different shop in this city.
