Absolutely horrible. The guy brings a portable machine, which I am sure circulates the dirt and puts it right back down on the carpet again. It's a great way to just redistribute the dirt. They have great advertisement and did a run on Groupon, so you think you are getting a professional company, but THINK AGAIN. Not really knowing that they were that bad, and being a real estate professional, I scheduled 3 houses. Not one of them was cleaned properly or professionally. It's all about doing it as quickly as possible so they can take your money and run. I called the guy Keith and he promissed to go back to one of them because it was done poorly, and he never went back. He just kept saying he would go back, but never did. But his hand was sure out fast to collect the money. Then, there were some stains which he said he could not remove, but my wife went to the house and simply removed them with some oxyclean. He could have spent an extra 5 minutes, but no, that was too much. I ended up simply replacing half the carpet in one of the houses, he did such a bad job. I didn't realize until afterward, that it could have been cleaned, but it loos like the guy just runs water with no carpet cleaning detergent.
