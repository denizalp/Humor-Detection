My wife and I wanted to try something out of the ordinary so we chose to eat indian food, we came to origin india restaurant and we had the buffet style and it was the end of their Ramadan. It was interesting and very different from any curry I ever tasted. Over all, this place is clean, servers were kind and welcoming.
