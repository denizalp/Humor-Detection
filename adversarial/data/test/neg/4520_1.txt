Loved it! Played games and had a great fresh berry smoothie. When asking someone who seemed to be owner or manager (very familiar and interested to help) he was great!!! When ordering the smoothie though, I asked if it was an option that many choose and the employee at the register replied with \"I mean I work here, I'm not going to say anything is bad...\" I feel that it's normal to ask what is commonly ordered. I would order another drink if the smoothie wasn't popular. Maybe let them know that advice on orders is helpful.
