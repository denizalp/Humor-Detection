We had a concern with our furnace and wanted a second opinion.  We called A-1 and appointment was easy to schedule.  The technician showed up ahead of schedule!  The communication and reminders prior to appointment were nice so we didn't feel stuck in the house waiting all day.  He explained the issues with furnace throughly and offered ways to remedy the problem.  He cleaned up after himself and we couldn't tell he was in our home.
