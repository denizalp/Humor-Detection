For affordable, no-frills sushi, we always choose Sushi Ken.\nMy husband works for a Japanese company and when the Japanese come to town, that's where they go for lunch; they say it's the most authentic for them.\nNow I know all you Hipster Foodies on this site (especially those who have expense accounts and don't mind paying $100 a person for \"Trendy Sushi\") will look down on the lack of ambience and menus with photos (\"the horror\"; so kitsch!) but I'm saying the Shashimi Combo (lunch or dinner) hits the spot every time.
