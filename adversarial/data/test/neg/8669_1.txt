I love The Grape!  The first time I tried The Grape was when I was in Estero, Florida a few years back.  We liked it so much, we went there 3 times in a week.  Now, for the record- I never tried their food- Just loved the wine!\n\nWhen I found out they were opening one in Las Vegas, I was really excited!\n\nFrom the first time I went to The Grape until today, they have changed their wine menu-slightly.  But you will still find all of your favorites! (wines of course)\n\nThey usually have some sort of jazz playing, which gives it a great place to relax.  The staff is great and never rushes you out the door.  I've been there for like 3-4 hours with some friends and had a great time.\n\nI will have to try their food next time. (gosh- I sound like a lush! :))\n\nI believe that one night a week is 1\/2 half bottles of wine!\n\nEnjoy!
