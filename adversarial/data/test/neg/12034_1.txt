Hmmm... yes, this place is nice and cozy inside.\n\nBut it has weird hours for a diner - kicked out at 10 pm?? Don't expect to settle in here with your friends for a night of milkshakes and hangouts.\n\nService was kind of spotty. I had to get up to ask questions\/get water, at least a couple of times.\n\nWorst thing of all: they fry everything in peanut oil!! BEWARE. If you have any friends who are allergic to peanuts, like one of mine, do not go here or s\/he won't be able to eat! Most restaurants don't do this anymore. What's the deal?
