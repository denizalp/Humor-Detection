worst 60 dollars ever spent. Only got a beer sampler, a glass of chard, and two entres. Only good thing about this place is the beer sampler...food proportions are small. My bf got half fillet and shrimp and it came with 2 shrimp and the fillet meat was the size of a 1st graders palm. I ordered lobster Mac n cheese. It was OK, I could've made it at home, not much flavor. I also got a piece of she'll in my lobster meat.. . I wouldn't come back for the food.
