I was surprised at the large menu selection. When you hear \"diner\" it's easy to associate that with late night or early morning breakfast food. \n\nService was very prompt, and friendly! The food was very fresh, and came in large portions. \n\nI would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to grab a bite to eat.
