You can get more than portugese rotisserie chicken here: There is a bakery, patisserie, deli...\n\nMy sister and i shared a 1\/2 chicken  combo\nAnd got an extra helping of fries!\nSeasoning in general was heavy handed. We needed more than one drink.\nSome pieces were extra salty while other pieces were fine.\nThe chicken was moist and flavourful with some charring.\nSpicy oil was poured on chicken. It gave the chicken a subtle spicy flavour that was like a slow burn, not very hot though.\nThe Salad wass small and drenched with dressing.\nThe food was made ready and Warmed up.\nThe salt and pepper fries were naturally cut.
