How disappointing!!\nThe restaurant was not busy but took 20 minutes to get acknowledged at the table. We sat outside and inside was empty. Our server said it's so busy as everyone came at once. She said 'hey I'm doing good though'. \nThey were out of three cocktails on the list. When we found one they had it was warm. \nThe manager never came outside. He was leaning on the bar drinking diet Red Bull's. The bartender was yawning and watching tv. \nSpare Rib came out ice cold. Table next to us got their entrees before their salads and were told they could keep them warm if they liked. \nThe English style chicken curry was good and Philippine busses was excellent. \nWine list was dull and red wine was warm. \nWe were very disappointed. This place is very poorly managed when one server is outside alone with seven tables and no management present to help her
