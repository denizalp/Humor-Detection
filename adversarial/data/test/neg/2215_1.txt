I've been a frequent visitor at this cinema ever since it got relocated from First Markham Place. Located on the second floor of this building on Enterprise Boulevard, it definitely gives you a similar feeling of visiting a theatre in Asia. It's a great cinema that gives you many options of how you want to watch your movies, regular, 3D, AVX, D-box, IMAX, or VIP, you name it. Pretty much every possible way you can think of. The only downside to this location is that there are never enough parking spots for people. The theatre shares the parking lot with many other restaurants and stores in the plaza, so when you're visiting during prime times like lunch time or dinner, be prepared to be hunting for a spot for a while. There are two characteristic that set this particular cinema apart from the other theatres. It offers the VIP experience and offers a few Chinese movies once in a while. With a higher price tag you're able to watch a movie with fewer people sharing the auditorium, better service, more comfortable chairs (subjective) and food and beverage options brought to your seat. Even with the parking issue, I still think this cinema will continue to be a popular spot for many and especially when Downtown Markham is fully developed.
