This was a delicious breakfast sandwich. There was a line, but it moved very fast.  Easy to find in the Cosmopolitan, which isnt true of all restaurants inside casinos in LV.  I had the bacon sandwich and loved it.  My sister enjoyed the sausage one. She did not care for the meat used. I think it was flavored with sage, which was over powering, but otherwise, yummy.  Did not try the slut itself, but it looked odd and I dont know if i could eat it.  But, next time I am in Vegas, I will definitely be back here.
