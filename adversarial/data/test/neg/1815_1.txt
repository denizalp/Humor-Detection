My mom and I stopped by here on a road trip. Had the hot chai latte with almond milk! Very delicious, had just the right amount of sweetness for me. We also got the ham and cheese omelette with potatoes. My mom loved the potatoes, thought they were the best potatoes she's ever eaten. The ladies at the cafe were all very sweet. Great place to have a meal!
