OK, my lunch on the run was super tasty!  Actually, it was stupid good.   Their bowls come in 2 sizes -- regular and large.   I ordered the regular size (ahi tuna and kimchi shrimp on greens) and I was taken aback by all of the toppings included.  Wished I would have  remembered to take a photo of my delicious bowl.   The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because the music playing in the background made me feel like I was at a rave or something and I think it made me eat faster.  And this is coming from someone who likes EDM.  Maybe slow down the tempo a little to Calvin Harris or Avicii during lunch time?   Anyways, can't wait to go back and if the same rave music is playing,  I'll just take my food to go.
