These guys are amazing, was recommended to me through a friend and I took my 1998 Honda Civic with 237,000 miles to them and they took great care of it. I recently blew my head gasket and the quote to fix it was $874. I had the same problem a little over a year ago and when I first had the problem fixed I payed $2,000!!! They are so honest, affordable, and do great work.
