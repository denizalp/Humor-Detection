Awesome place for food and drinks. Menu had lots of options that I liked. Started off with a meat and cheese board and added a few extra options. Got the stew as my main course and it was delicious. Will definitely come back again.  Only negative thing I would say is there was a 35 minute wait, with about 15 open tables outside open but \"Reserved\". A few tables were occupied in the 2 hour window we were there. Quicker table turnover means hungry customers get to eat and drink quicker.
