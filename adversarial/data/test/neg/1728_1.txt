Disclaimer: I have not purchased from here. I was looking for a class pet for my husband, who is a teacher, possibly a gecko. \n\nThe associate was really nice and informative. The cages were clean and the animals looked healthy. They breed their own feeder rats which is great for quality control and consistency which can be good for picky snakes and other herps. \n\nA really good shop overall I would purchase from here. The only reason we did not purchase is because my husband decided on fish for his classroom.
