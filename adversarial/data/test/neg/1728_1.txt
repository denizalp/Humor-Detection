Overall we were not very happy. The food was over-priced and way too salty. I ordered the same thing I would at Zin Burger, a glass of wine and the ahi tuna sandwich, their wine was $3 more per glass and the sandwich was $2 more and not even close to what Zin Burger can do. Waited a really long time to be waited on and the waitress couldn't explain the menu. Menu was difficult to understand, font was super small, and had a ton of typos (znfandel instead of Zinfandel, and port instead of pork).
