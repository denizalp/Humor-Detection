East Lincoln Animal Hospital is wonderful!  I have taken my dog there for regular medical visits, grooming, boarding and emergency surgery.  In all cases, we were both treated very professionally.  The doctors take their time with you and explain everything in great detail.  \n\nThis is the only vet for me!
