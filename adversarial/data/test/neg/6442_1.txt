My new regular spot! Food is DELISH! Absolutely! Delightful menu selections. I've enjoyed everything I've tried and so far my fave is the Spanish Hash. The 2 brothers\/owners Ali and Tolga, know their stuff both from the cooking standpoint and the service standpoint. Food is served quickly and aesthetically. Wait staff are attentive and friendly. \n\nGo there. Eat. Enjoy.
