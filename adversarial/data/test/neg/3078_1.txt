So many varieties of food to choose from!! All beautifully presented. The food didn't taste all that great but what can you expect from a buffet?\n\nI did like the lobster ravioli. There were big chucks of lobster meat with a delish creme sauce to top it off. Don't eat too many because they can be pretty filling. The pesto pizza was also very good. I'm craving for some right now! All the other dishes were just so-so. Not as great as I expected it to be. \n\nTheir dessert area has got to be the prettiest. All beautifully made with assorted chocolate cake, cheesecake, creme brulee, chocolate dipped strawberries (my fav.), assorted creme puffs, and more. They looked very good and appealing but didn't taste the same way. Chocolate cake didn't taste like chocolate cake. The creme brulee didn't have enough flavor. The desserts were just great to look at. \n\nOverall, I think i'm done with buffets here. They do have a lot of food but its just not that good for me to come back.
