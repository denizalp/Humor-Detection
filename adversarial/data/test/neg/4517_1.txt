It's the only decent Viet place within the area...or perhaps all of Brampton.  The service is good & the staff is always nice. It could be because we're regulars here. If the service was bad they'd get 3 stars because the food is alright but we've had better in the hood.  It's not terrible, but it is pretty busy during lunch hours so the food is okay.\n\n3 stars for food, 4 stars for service, 2 stars for smelly washrooms (they need an air freshener in there.)
