My friend and I use to chase after the food truck back in the day but I finally had the opportunity to grab some burgers with a group of 8 and that was a problem. The food is still great but this is one of those establishments where a group will sit down to eat their food and never leave.  Every time I go there with a group we can never sit together. So for me, I no longer suggest going there for a group setting due to limited seating.
