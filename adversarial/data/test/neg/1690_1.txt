This is a great local independent market. We live down the street, and use this as our go-to market. \n\nWe do supplement the shopping with \"big shops\" at Costco and\/or Giant Eagle once a week or so. There are some items that they don't carry, but there are a lot of items I've found here, that I haven't seen at other markets.\n\nThe meat department doesn't have a counter, but there is usually someone available if you need help finding something, need a special cut, or need a larger piece cut up. There is a nice fish counter, deli counter, and freshly made food items. A full selection of wine, and a state liquor store are both available as well. \n\nThe prices can be a bit more than at the larger chain stores, but the convenience of the location (less than a mile away) make up for the slight price difference.
