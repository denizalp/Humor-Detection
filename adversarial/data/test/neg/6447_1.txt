I live in an area that doesn't have First Watch. I used to live in Florida and eat First Watch all the time 16 years ago. What happened to the Turkey Dill?\nLol. Maybe you got rid of it 13 years ago? \nAnyway... Service was great, place was clean, and my breakfast dish was fresh and tasty. My only disappointment was the pancake. It's pretty bad. \nIt didn't taste good. \nBut! Good news! You don't have to order the pancakes. Get the French Toast!\nI will be back the next time I'm in Phoenix!
