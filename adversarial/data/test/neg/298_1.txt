Nice local Canadian made childrens clothing.  I love the hats they have.  The summer hats are not only cute by are practical for children and provide UV protection. The winter hats are cute too especially the ones that are animals.  They have a beaver, moose, frog, cat, bunny, pig and others. The service is great I have always been greeted with a smile and offered help.  They also have a cute chunky cat in the store, the kids love going in there to see him too!
