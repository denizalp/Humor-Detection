I stumbled across this joint last year. \n\nThere is poor energy within these walls. \n\nThe owner is as low as they come of the wiesel variety.  If he was Alpha I would of wrapped my chain wallet around my right and taught him how to respect women and enthusiasm for a good time.\n\nGo up the block and shoot in a high end joint. Leave this dump alone.\n\nFyi...there are no doors in the bathroom stalls, for there are drug problems here and they treat the place like a prison in order to deter the cocksucking going on behind closed doors. \n\nWhen I think of this place, I cringe.
