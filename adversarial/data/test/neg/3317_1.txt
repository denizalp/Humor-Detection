I can see how this salon can be a bit uncomfortable for people regarding the gossipy atmosphere.  I am often just not in the mood to talk.  I'm quiet by nature and even when I do talk, I'm more of a literary, world events person than a entertainment, fashion person.  \nBut it is a nail bar, so the atmosphere is pretty much what it should be.  I find 98% of the aestheticians warm and friendly.  And I think it must be impossible to change the atmosphere per client when the place is full.\nFor legally blonde types it's the place to go for fun.\nFor the rest of us, it's the place to go for the best nail service in town.  I've tried various different places in Toronto, a lot in Yorkville and the Bay and Bloor area where I work, but not matter how much I pay I can't get the quality I get a tips.  I'm actually very curious where others are going when they say they get nail service just as good as at Tips.  \nI really believe there is just no reason to pay money anywhere else, I might as well just do my nails at home.  Often when I go, I'm tired, it's my day off, I have a ton of stuff to do and I'm not in the mood for a chatty, eighties music, upbeat place.  But I go because the bottom line is I want a great manicure.  \nAnd most likely, the majority of other customers enjoy the atmosphere. The hour or two, (if I get a pedicure) I spend there is more about having fantastic nails for the next two to three weeks, than participating in the fashion\/entertainment culture which these places are supposed to be like, and gossip is a part of that world. \n\nBut for the reviewer who went before her wedding and there was the mix-up over the shellac or reg manicure, if I experienced what you had, I would never go back either.  I'm surprised they couldn't do anything at all to make it right, if it were their mistake or not.  I'm really sorry that happened too you.  What a stressful time.
