This restaurant is one of my husband and my local favorites. The atmosphere is comfortable and the owners very gracious. Their food is always carefully prepared and delicious. It is Italian comfort food at it's best. My favorite dish is artichoke\/mushroom ravioli. Excellent Italian wine list, too. \nIt is small and in a strip mall so easy to miss. Take the extra effort to drive into the parking area near the Safeway's on Via Linda to find it. You won't be disappointed!
