When I went for dinner tonight with two others we all had a good experience. I will start by saying that our server was great, very personable and informative. \nWe ordered the garlic shrimp, fresh rolls and soup to start. All delicious and fresh tasting!! To share as entre we had the Pad Thai and another dish I forgot the name of. We ordered medium heat because she recommended but quickly asked for hot sauce seeing as it wasn't spicy enough.\n\nOverall a great experience,  and my next visit will sure be at the original location on Parliament.
