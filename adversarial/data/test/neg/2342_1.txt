The Keg might not have that \"boutique\" feel, but that's not why we eat there! I can't say enough good things about this location. They are so customer service focused and I had the most delightful time. \nMy girlfriend and I went there last night for dinner to celebrate me getting a new job. The ambience was great, servers were on the ball and the food\/drinks were delicious!\nClimax of the night? They surprised me with a piece of cake and a candle and a card congratulating me! My server Tricia had told them why we were there and they brought me CAKE! It was so yummy. \nIt doesn't end there....in my excitement from getting free cake I accidentally whacked my glass of port off the table while telling a story to my friend. Spilled all over the floor. Drama? Nope! They were all smiles and Madison brought me a new glass. \nI will definitely be going back there. Especially because of Tricia and Madison.
