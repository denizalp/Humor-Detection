For being one of the most expensive buffets on the strip, we were disappointed.  Although our table person was very attentive, the food was mediocre.  They had cooked and peeled shrimp, but it was tasteless.  The prime rib crust did not have any salt\/pepper or other seasonings.  It was bland.  You had to ask for caesar salad at the salad bar.  The desert bar was the worst I've ever seen:  no pies, small pieces of carrot cake or chocolate mousse.  No gellato.  No ice cream.
