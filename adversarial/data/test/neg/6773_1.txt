My husband and I are locals in Las Vegas, and have visited many restaurants on the strip. Sushi Samba is one that we had been waiting to try, and it lived up to all of our expectations. From the minute we were seated by the hostess to the end of our dinner, the experience was wonderful. The ambiance of the restaurant is very modern and fun. Our waiter was very knowledgable about all the food and beverages. Throughout our dinner he took the time to explain all the dishes to us as they came out. My husband had a Sake, and I tried their signature Samba juice, both drinks were very good. We tried a little bit of everything from appetizers to entrees. The food was delicious! The sushi would rate among the best that we ever had. Their menu is a fusion of Brazilian and Japanese, so they had some very different items to choose from that you don't see at other Japanese restaurants. We also had a chance to meet Chef Joel as he walked around the restaurant. He was very personable, and took the time to talk with my husband and I. He explained to us about some of the dishes that were on the menu, and you could see the passion he had for the food. It makes us really excited to go back and try more! The excellent serve we received, the exciting environment, and the delicious food makes for a wonderful experience. This is one restaurant I think should be tried by all that come to Las Vegas!
