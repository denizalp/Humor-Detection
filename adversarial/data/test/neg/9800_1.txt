Good, but over hyped in my opinion. They didn't have the salad option due to being out of Arugula, which, I get it that happens. My sandwhich was meh, coffee sizes are small for what you pay. Husband's sandwhich was much better than mine. Customer service kind of had the attitude of we know we're hot right now and don't need to go above and beyond. Not rude, just nothing special. There is a line to order and a wait for food, but we weren't in a hurry so that wasn't a big deal.
