This is the first real golf course I ever played on.  I have played it several times.  While carts are available the course can be easily walked.  \n\nI have heard other players complain about the cost of greens fees.  Even thought Charlotte Golf Links was only a mile from my house I often went to other courses since they often offered better deals.\n\nThis is part of a group that runs at least four other courses such as the Divide.\n\nI was a regular on the driving range.  I have since given up the game.  Too much work to be simply mediocre.
