I've been coming here for Sunday breakfast for a few weeks. The food is good but inconsistent and the servers should step up in quality control. Food comes out burnt sometimes and cold others and the orders aren't always correct. And kids eat free but they never do that automatically so make sure you check the check!  All that said it has potential, if they can get their act together
