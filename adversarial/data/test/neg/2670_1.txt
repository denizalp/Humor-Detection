Came here for a friends birthday with a group of 8 during happy hour a couple of weeks ago. It was an alright experience overall. There were some things I really loved and others that were not so great. \n\nThe good:\n-The decor is awesome - they have one wall that we were sitting near that had an incredible painting of animated characters all fitting into one epic scene. Our whole group got a kick out of all the small details in it and spent a lot of time just searching it. It was a fun touch. \n-They use an app called Rockbot that lets guests choose songs to play in the restaurant. It was like a jukebox operated through your phone and our group had so much fun with it. \n-The scallion and chicken skewers were so yummy! We asked for one order of these, then had to ask for a few more because they were so good. \n-In the restrooms, they have this awesome salt scrub that makes your hands feel so soft!\n\nThe \"eh\": \n-Our server was great at first, but seemed like she stopped caring about our table by the end of our dinner. She took our order pretty quickly and the food came out at a decent speed, but many of us had waters that needed refilling throughout the night and had to ask several times for more. Also, after we finished our dessert, it took about 20 minutes for her to finally come by and ask if we wanted the check. Then another 5 minutes for her to bring our check....which she then realized she had made a mistake on so she had to fix that which took about another 10 minutes. By the time we were able to pay, the table was already cleared off and we were all ready to walk out. \n-Something that wasn't a huge deal but just kind of annoying was that during happy hour, they don't let you order off of the regular menu. We were really there specifically for happy hour so this didn't bother us too much but it would've been nice to have the option in case someone in our group was really hungry and wanted something bigger. \n\nThe bad:\n-Some of the sushi rolls we tried (specifically the philadelphia and the eel) were very fishy tasting and not fresh at all. In fact, we had to send one of the rolls back because it did not taste like good fish. This was a huge turn-off for the whole place and probably the biggest reason I'm giving them only 3 stars. The rest of the food was good, but fishy tasting sushi is a no-no and just plain gross.
