First time here. Parking was fairly easy. Place was full but not crazy busy for a Saturday night. Had an 8:15 reservation. Asked for a booth which they gave us. The booth request seemed to throw hostess a little. Menu was pretty straight forward for steakhouse. The prices lead me to think they are wanting to grab some of Del Fiscos and RC customers. I had the pork chop which was very tasty and the risotto was great. The mixed vegetables that came with it were terrible. I would suggest some steamed broccoli for a choice. Wife had the filet and I did taste it and it was ok. We also got the whipped potatoes and the sautéed vegetables. The potatoes tasted like they were from a box and were very dry. The sautéed vegetables were just ok. We also started the meal with the cheese board and while a few of the items were pretty good (meats mainly), the 2, yes 2 cheeses were just ok. There also should have been some cranberries. The main reason I said the cheeses were just ok was because the center portion of both cheeses were softer, by the time we started making it to the outer portion, it was to hard to cut. I had the Caesar salad which was very good. I will always give a place a second shot to redeem a mediocre first time but we dropped over $200 here without buying a bottle of wine and if I'm going to do that, the entire meal better be more than just ok. I leave these reviews for 2 reasons. One that they management reads them and makes some changes and 2 so that others have something to compare when they do take the time to review.
