Just wanted to give these people props for opening a bad ass coffee shop in Central North Phoenix! We met business partners here for a meeting recently and they were just as impressed as we were with the layout of the shop and the coolness of the design! Not only is it a cool place to hang, but they had some wonderful drink mixes and small bites to eat! It was the first time I have ever tried Nutella with coffee \"Mocha w\/Nutella\". It was SO good I had 2! The staff was very friendly as well! I will definitely be back to visit soon!
