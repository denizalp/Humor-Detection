I'm reluctant to give any place less then 3 stars, but that just shows that something is quite lacking at this Cora's location. We stopped by on a sunday late morning being in the neighbourhood, thinking we would be in and out within 30-40mins. Unfortunately for us, we were quite mistaken.\n\nWalking into the restaurant you could see several empty tables, however the line up was so long that people were queued outside. The waitress was moving at a pace you would expect at a slow, empty restaurant, not a bustling, noisy one like this place! \n\nWhen we finally were seated, nobody came by our table for 15 minutes. Finally, after seeing our quite obvious discomfort, a busy waiter came by and told us that it would be another 5 minutes. We eventually did order, but any enjoyment of the food was ruined by the sluggishly slow experience. \n\nI will not be returning to this location again, unless forced.
