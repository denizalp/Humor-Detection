Out of the 3 locations in mississauga. This is second best. The best one is Erin Mills.\n\nIf you are trying to impress someone and dont mind paying extra this is the place. Otherwise, go to Erin Mills. Best tasting food. Great service. No extra charges. \n\nThese guys charge through the nose if you make alterations to your meal. And the service i received the last time was TERRIBLE. (Also... they have the smallest to go tea cups out of all locations). \n\nIve been going to these locations for over 15 years now. \n\nDO NOT go to Dundas location. It was so bad I couldnt even complain. I just paid to get out of there.
