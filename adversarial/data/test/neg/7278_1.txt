Went there for a company picnic and was highly disappointed. They had no problem taking my company's money for the gocart upgrade then they would not let our boys on. I understand it is a safety issue, but the way they arbitrarily enforce their rules just caused my boys to melt down. Even the bumper boats were too restrictive. They allowed smaller kids on before us but when it was our turn we were turned away. Not sure how they can consider the boats dangerous, they are powered by a trolling motor and the water cannot be more than a 20 inches deep. Even their website says lasertag is for any age, yet when we get there there is a sign saying they do not meet the height requirements. We may come back in a couple years. All my boys could do was play miniature golf and spend my money in the arcade.
