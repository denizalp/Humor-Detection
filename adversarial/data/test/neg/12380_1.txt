The best vanilla latte I have ever had! The coffee can be a bit different at times and depending on the night your in here it can be a little overwhelming with the live band or open mic. I wish it was more chill... But for coffee shops in the area I think it's great! The people that work there are usually always really nice and helpful. \n\nThe food is actually pretty good! I usually stray away from \"vegan this and vegan that\" but I manned up have tried multiple things here and have loved just about everything. My favorite is the cheddar bake sandwich! I gotta be honest when I eat here I feel healthier... Its most likely all in my head but who cares! :)
