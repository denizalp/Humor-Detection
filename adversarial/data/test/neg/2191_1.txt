I was in the mall yesterday during lunch and noticed this place. There was no line - yet Subway, chik filet, Villa pizza etc were packed. So I was wary. \n\nI noticed on the menu that they have a kale hummus wrap so I tried it.  It was awesome!!  It had the right portions of everything, and I felt great after eating it.  This was a total surprise to me, especially for a mall food court. I hope they open more locations!
