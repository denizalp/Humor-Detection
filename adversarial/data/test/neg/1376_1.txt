This was the first Uncle Tetsu location I visited when it was still quite new. This is like an express location, meaning it only has the signature cheesecake and tarts. \nThe staff were very friendly and greeted us when we came in. We ordered the cheesecake and got the order immediately. Very fast and efficient service, granted there was no line at the time and it was raining a bit (which might have driven people away).\nFor the cheesecake itself, it was sort of...lackluster? It really didn't live up to the hype for me, as it tasted more like cake than cheesecake. The texture was quite fluffy and wasn't too sweet, but it didn't have enough of a cheese taste for it to really feel like a cheesecake. I tried a similar Japanese style cheesecake in a random small bakery in Waterloo, called O'My Bakery, a few weeks later that I would say is actually a bit better than Uncle Tetsu's.
