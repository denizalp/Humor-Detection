My family and I really enjoyed our stay at the Sheraton Eau Claire. Though its location is not in the heart of downtown, it's also what makes it attractive .. Close enough of center of downtown minus its craziness. \n\nThe hotel staff were all extremely friendly and eager to please ... from the valet to the front desk staff. Front office offered me an upgrade to a super luxe suite and it was beautifully appointed. It was clean, modern and very spacious. The club room access was an added bonus to get refreshments and breakfast. Though a little small in scale, it had enough offerings to be satisfying and enjoyable.\n\nThe Sheraton Eau Claire has a great mix of attentive staff and well-maintained and well-appointed amenities for me to want to definitively return for my next visit.  Well done!!
