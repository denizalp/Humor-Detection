3 out of the 3 times I've been to this location they've forgotten something out of the order. How hard is it to put what the customer PAID FOR in the bag???? It's ridiculous! And they never seem phased by the fact that they forget items. It's like they expect it when you walk in from going through the drive through. So frustrating!!! I'm sending in a corporate complaint after this.
