This place was great.  Our table ordered five different dishes and they were all really good - Dolsot Bibimbap, ailes de poulet, sundubu, kimchijjigae and the mango tart.  Prices were also more than reasonable and the inside well decorated and clean.  Very much recommended if you are looking for good authentic Korean food at a reasonable price and in a good setting.
