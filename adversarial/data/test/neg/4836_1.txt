The hotel itself is a very nice property.  Clean, large rooms, comfortable beds, nicely decorated.  If I had not tried to order a drink at the bar and order dinner in the dining room I would have given this place 4 stars.\n\nMy experience in the bar\/restaurant was extremely odd.  The female bartender\/waitress who was on duty both Friday and Saturday evening-was overall awful! I am convinced that she was on some sort of mood altering substance.  She was rude, lazy, dismissive, not interested in being a server at all. My group actually laughed as we kept looking for the \"punked\" camera team.  Getting service from this gal took perseverance- I was with a large group -one of our group members finally got his beer- only to be brought the wrong beer.   The bartender took the incorrect beer back to the service area- replaced the cap and put the beer back into the refrigerated area!  Not sure where the health department stands on this issue- but the next person who orders that beer will get a flat beer! \n\nThis gal also drug a huge trash can into the bar area while the bar was open and people were eating- she proceeded to clean off tables while dragging this outdoor trashcan behind her.  The entire time she bumped into tables, patrons and small children.  Not concerned about service or hygiene at all!  Never did get to order food- and as far as drinks- it was best to BYOB.  I was stunned to see this employee return on Saturday evening.  Luckily, we dined out for most of our meals- I would have been concerned to ingest anything served by this employee.  There are many choices in Vegas- I would probably not return to this Hilton Garden Inn based on this ridiculous experience.  Who is the hiring manager at this property??
