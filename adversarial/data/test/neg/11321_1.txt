Unfortunately half the \"deliciousness\" of the food can come from the customer experience when ordering.  If they suck, food seems to suck.  I've visited 3 times since moving to this side of town and I can't seem to figure out why I didn't enjoy my meal.  After reading reviews I agree that the workers are hurried, make plenty mistakes, and are just miserable.  Except for maybe the girl at check out.  \n\nI ordered a salad, kids meal quesadilla, and the free nino quesadilla (for kids under 6).  At checkout I was confirming the order with the cashier and the veggie lady was obviously listening in.  When I said kids meal she jumped in, all defensive and told the cashier \"no she ordered THE BIG quesadilla.\" I shrugged her and her attitude off and just told them I wanted the kids one.  She went to remake it, made us pay, then wait for the kids meal, with a one year old in tow.  Geez, calm down lady.  I wonder if they recycled the perfectly good BIG quesadilla that was customized to my liking.  Either they threw it away or they mess up on purpose so they can save it for lunch :P:P:P:P
