They get one star just for having a building that hasn't burned down yet. I've been coming here for about a year and my little one loves it but to a kid it's all fun. For me I get to deal with the real portion of this group. First off,  the front desk staff.  They do not communicate with each other and if you had a conversation with someone over the phone you better make sure that you get the same person when you show up or you are SOL. Second, the building was not made to handle this many people at one time. You get ONE bathroom each (male\/female) but the signs don't make a difference. I've watched grown men come out of each bathroom and the horror I got to see when I walked in after them.......it looked as if they had thrown a water ballon filled with urine at the toilet.  And of course the staff don't clean that up. Third, the viewing area is a joke. I love showing up to watch my kid and I get to stand behind 30 people sitting against the viewing window and not one of them is watching their kids. I guess that Facebook post is more important.   In short they need to do one of the following. Expand to another building or cut down on class sizes.
