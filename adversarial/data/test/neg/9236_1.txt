The line was pretty long for a Monday night but I waited it out. The food was better than most buffets in Vegas. Guess I should have came an hour earlier. I didn't expect the line to be that long on a Monday.\n\nI would rate it 5 stars but they ran out of King crab at 9:20 when the buffet was open till 10. I waited in line over an hour+, I lost track of time. \n\nI really wanted to ask the manager what was the deal with running out of you #1 food attraction in your buffet but I was put of time myself and had to be elsewhere.\n\nMaybe next ti.e they will not run out..
