What a great find! The hot dogs had that crisp casing that snaps when you bite in. The coney sauce was delicious and the cheese sauce we got on our fries was down-right addictive. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The only negative thing I could find was the floor & tables seemed a little dirty, but I think they were just worn down.
