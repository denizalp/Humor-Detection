We just left a great Penn and Teller magic show and wanted dinner in celebration of our wedding anniversary.  This was a great choice.  We had the Salmon and Filet Mignon. You can't go wrong with either one.\n\nOur server Teddy was the best. He was in timely, moved us to another booth per our request, had great conversation, and brought us all the unique requests if my wife without hesitation.  He made our experience all the better.\n\nIf you are at the Rio and looking for a good surf and\/or turf meal, consider AABG and try to sit at Teddy's Table.
