Absolutely terrible service !!! \nThe only reason why this is getting two stars is because the food was decent. This place is usually such a cute place to go on a date night! Last night my boyfriend and I decided to go on a date night here ! We didn't get noticed for like 5-10 mins after we got there, and we finally got seated. Our server forgot about our drinks, so we waited for like 20 mins just to get a drink. The food came out sorta quick but the service was absolute trash. Our server barley came to our table to even ask how everything was but went to the table across 3-5 times within 5 mins.
