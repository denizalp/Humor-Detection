My dog looks great!  Here are my comments:\n\n-I learned that when you schedule, you should allow up to 1 hour for drive time. I scheduled for 11AM and Paul arrived at 1130AM.\n\n-Paul did a great job with my dog. I was able to watch the entire time. He does a dry cut, bath, then a touch up cut. \n\n-Paul informed me that the groomers affiliated with Pampered Pets on Wheels all went to grooming school back when licensing was required in Nevada. Now that there is no grooming school left in Nevada, anyone (including myself) can be a \"groomer\". This explains why my dog's previous haircut was uneven.\n\n-$60 for a full groom: cut, wash, cleaned ears, anal glands expressed (which I declined because she just had it done) and nail clipping, all done right outside my apartment. Cash only.\n\n-Easy online appointments. If you're a new customer, email them your address.\n\n-Be sure to have 4-5 car parking spaces or a sizeable curb-space available for the truck and trailer!  The trailer was clean and impressive...especially after learning that Paul put it together!\n\nOverall, very impressed.  Paul was detailed, kind to my pup, and quick.  The whole appointment took an hour and a half and I was able to watch the whole time. My dog never had an issue with other big chain groomers, but I gave this a shot because of other dog owner's bad experiences. In comparison, I really enjoyed this grooming experience much more.  I think my puppy did too!\n\nThanks!!!
