WOAH! BEWARE!! I saw this doctor as a patient for a quite a few years, over 5 years. She was my my primary physician. I felt comfortable there, she knew everything about me, she was my doctor. Any time I mentioned anything, I was thoroughly tested for it. At first I thought it was a good thing, until I realized she was taking advantage of my good insurance. I am a healthy 20 something year old female with no real health problems except a shoulder injury from being an athlete, that flared up time to time. I was a patient of hers while she was building a brand as a \"famous tv and radio dr\" and boy did I notice the change Dustin that time. Let me get to the point and not bore you with the details, I had the worst experience there and a very humiliating one. Perhaps I am so upset with her because we had a patient \/ dr \/ personal relationships since she was my personal doctor for many years.  I was truly blindsided by her lack of professional and demeanor on my last visit to her office. One day I came into the office in excruciating pain, my shoulder was \"stuck\" out of place and pinching a nerve, frozen shoulder unable to move. This happened only a few times before over the years and I would get shots to relax the surrounding muscles and it and take away the pain and make me mobile again. She would do these shots for me and knew my history. So when I came in to her office, in total pain and tears, her front desk teenagers (staff) were insisting I come back with an appointment in a few days (although they take walk ins and I had been coming there for years as a walk in)   Long story short, I was in dire, crying pain, and left the office that way because they refused to treat me - as I was leaving Dr D was in the hallway and asked me \"what happened\" why I was leaving, as I was explaining the situation to her husband interjected, came flying down the hall, he physically interjected, tried to say I couldn't talk to her in the hallway and actually tried to bully me out the doors.... like belly bump me with his big, fat belly out the door. To note, the husband is a chiropractor and shares office space with her, as I was having a conversation with Dr D and he interjected himself, It actually turned into a scene in front of everyone in the office, including the staff and patients waiting in the waiting room. It was completely humiliating for me. It was an unprofessional escalation of circumstances once the husband felt like he should get involved. I left the office and a few weeks later received a letter stating they would not treat me anymore. Big LOL. I  was PISSED - they didn't need to send me a letter, I wasn't planning on coming back after that fiasco. I was humiliated in front of the office and full waiting room and treated like a derelict.  Then I received that $700 bill in the mail. FOR WHAT? She's a DR, she should have more compassion for people in pain, but she's all about the money, so she could care less. Besides being treated CRAPPY, her billing was always wrong. Always being over billed and double billed. \nAll the things in all the other reviews are true. She is all about the money and prestige and fame, all EGO. She is also CHEAP, too cheap to pay for quality staff, or a staff that not still in high school that doesn't have the maturity for that profession yet. She will bill, and double bill, take your co-pay then bill you for your copay. She will  unnecessarily test you  to make that insurance money. She is a control freak that has to do every part of the business, instead of just doing the dr part,  what she could be good at, if she wasn't micromanaging her office. I'm not mad about her trying to be a famous dr personality, but it's been a sad demise of her practice. It's sad because she is knowledgeable and likable and if she actually spent the money for a good support staff and dumped the chump husband that has ZERO patients, yet shares her office space, perhaps she would be that STAR she so wants to be.
