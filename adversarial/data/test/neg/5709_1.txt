I first messaged them on yelp and made an appointment for a couples massage all through yelp. The owner made booking the appointment super easy. We arrived and was greeted by a women who gave us a questionnaire to fill out. It asked basic question like allergies and such needed for them to give you a personalized massage. Next she asked us if there was anywhere we wanted them to focus on. Finally we were let into this nice little clean couples room. They had us put our feet in hot water while laying down and put cucumbers over our eyes. The massage was really good and very relaxing. Relaxing music played the entire time which I enjoyed. First time customers pay $27.99 for 1 hour. They do prefer you tip in cash. Overall everything was amazing and definitely worth the price. Also the bathroom was very clean! I would recommend to everybody!
