After an afternoon of Target, Kohl's and Sears my husband was ready for his well deserved margarita. We headed to Frank & Fina's Cocina which we had stumbled upon during our previous shopping extravaganza. \n\nWe were seated right away, despite the fact it was a hoppin Saturday night! Drink and chips were served very promptly by a friendly server. The margaritas were excellent and perfect ratio of alcohol to mixers.\n\nWe ordered a few plates and ate them \"family style\" We had a Relleno, Mole Enchiladas and Carnitas Tacos. Yum, yum and yum. 100% satisfaction with all dishes. This has quickly moved up to my #1 \"everyday\" Mexican restaurant. I can't wait to come back and try more menu items. \n\nFresh ingredients, full of flavor, reasonable prices. SOLD!
