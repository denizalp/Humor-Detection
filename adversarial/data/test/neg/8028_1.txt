I've brought my two pups here twice and both times have been good experiences.  Very nice staff and they did work late to get my boys all clean and shiny.  It was quite a wait which personally I don't mind as much as other owners because I prefer that they do take the time and care needed for our dogs to get the proper grooming.  We are headed back to San Diego but will be back when we are in town, which is often :)
