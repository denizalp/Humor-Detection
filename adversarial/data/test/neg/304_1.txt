I love hawaiian food. I used to work at a hawaiian BBQ. Nothing beats Island Flavor here in Vegas! I am so happy I live close to this place. First of all, the portions are HUGE for what you pay. I always have to box up my meal because I can't finish it in one sitting. I usually get the katsu moco and the gravy is incredible - bar none. It isn't the fanciest place, but the staff is always hospitable and the food is always amazing. That's enough to keep me coming back!
