Thought this would be a good time but between the lines lines and more lines it's safe to say I'll never ever think about going to this event again!  The token system was an absolute disaster. Walked about 2 miles from where we parked to wait 45mins to pay and get in than Waited about 30mins plus in the line for tacos.  The tacos were slop, not impressed at all.  Margaritas were all syrup didn't even taste any tequila at all.  More or less we just blew our tokens just to get out of this lame excuse of entertainment.  Save your money and just make tacos at home.
