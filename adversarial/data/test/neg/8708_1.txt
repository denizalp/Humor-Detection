Had a Super experience... Went in for lunch to order to go for the office today 9\/9... The bartender was fantastic, she took my order quickly.. I had a coupon that she told me couldn't be used for to go orders and I was screwed... But she is an out of the box thinker and said well we could order for here and bring to go boxes... Sounded fine to me... Played a game of pool while I was waiting.... and surprise she had it boxed up for me... I ordered the chicken parm sliders with tater tots.... yummy
