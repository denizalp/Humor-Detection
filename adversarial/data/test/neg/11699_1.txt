First let me say that in today's world customer service is usually lacking, but here they are very friendly and helpful. The food is tasty, especially the Cuban, which is so big you can split it with a friend, and each combo comes with chips or potato salad and a drink. Try the cheesesteak or the pulled pork sandwiches, both are very good. Kids eat free on Saturdays with each adult combo purchased and with 3 children this is a nice touch.  The kids meal includes a scoop of ice cream or a large chocolate chip cookie, always a treat for the little ones. There is always a game on the television inside the cafe and outdoor seating when the weather is nice. When I am in NC this is one of my favorite lunch places.
