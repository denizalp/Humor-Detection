Just got into Vegas and needed a pedi! Found A Harmony Nail Spa and am so glad I did. Serene, professional, clean, kind, beautiful service! Great firm massage, lovely colors to choose from....environment like a lovely elfin forest with soothing sound of music and water....oh, and reasonable! I love supporting local independents, too, good for the community! Short cab trip from the strip.
