5 Stars for Yaya's! I walked in an was greeted by the very friendly staff. The wait time was not too long and we were seated right away. The menu was nice and simple with Gluten free & Vegetarian options. Chips & Salsa were very tasty, The Shredded Beef Burrito was excellent, my wife kept picking at my plate. Then I picked at her plate and tried the Chimis, great....The taquitos, great....and the quesadillas, great! The Restaurant was clean, had great service, and overall a great experience!
