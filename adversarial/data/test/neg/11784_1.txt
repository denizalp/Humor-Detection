Very clean brand new location. My wife booked us for he same\nday and for a 90 minute massage (Never had more than 60 min before but now I think 90 is much more relaxing) My therapist Wendy knew exactly where to push and rub on my back, neck and shoulders and I left there feeling 100% better! I liked having the extra 30 minutes for arms, hands and especially feet - We will be back!
