Ok. So I have rented from Enterprise before but this recent experience was absolutely awful. So I went to the enterprise and realized they have changed their address from one address to across the street. So to start small talk with the rep I was like didn't you guys used to be at ___address the rep didn't even look at me he just said mmhmm. Which was really rude to begin. Than once we got to the renting the car part I had told he gentlemen that I was going to pay with a debit card. The gentlemen immediately told me he can only take credit card. I told him we just booked over the phone with a lady she said  I can pay with debit card.. his response was \"no just credit card\" now to reiterate what they lady over the phone told me. She said I would just need my license, debit card, and two proofs of being at the address on my license which I had. So despite confusing I pulled out my credit card and I explained ok so how much will I be paying today. The gentlemen gave me the total Amt and I told him ok run the card. Than right before running the card the gentlemen gave me a totally different amt. I knew there was a deposit required plus the amt for the rental which I had total on my debit card but rep didn't care he just wanted to get us out of the store considering they were about to close. Well Just due to the urgency of leaving to San Diego for my brothers Marine graduation. I just told him to cancel and we won't rent from them. The rep said ok bye. So as I hassled to figure out how I was going to get to San Diego for the graduation my cousin who was also attending the graduation let me know she was on her way. I asked if she had rented a car like we had talked about doing. She said she did. I than asked her if she hD any trouble with renting from enterprise she said no.. I literally paid with my debit card and two proofs of address. At that point I was upset all over again. Now I don't normally write bad reviews on places but due to the urgency, the inconvenience this renting experience had on my travels. I felt emotional enough to express how unhelpful the rep was and how I personally at the end of all this felt a little racially profiled. I just wish the experience would've been better and not have affected my arrival to my brothers graduation from the Marines. Bad experience.
