For a buffet this place is passable. There are certainly better buffet places out there. The MGM's grand buffet is ok. For 29.99$ (weekday buffet) you can get prime ribs, bbq ribs, turkey, various sausages, crab legs and shrimp. This is what i cared about and were my bang for the bucks.\n\nThe crab legs were great and easy to eat. The shrimp was tasty. The carving station stuff were mediocre. There are a plethora of other items like a whole aisle of chinese, a whole aisle of italian along with the pizza station and few mexican. The orange chicken and noodles were good. The desert station was a bit dis-appointing. The only item that i enjoyed there was the lychee flavored italian ice. If you wanna upgrade for drinks that option is available as well for a few extra bucks!!
