While driving home from Las Vegas, my minivan's battery indicator light came on just as we crossed the border into California. We drove back to Primm at the border looking for a mechanic. Finding none, we called AAA and they told us we'd have to be towed back to Las Vegas and gave me a choice of 3 garages. I chose Tony's and I'm so thankful I did. We pulled into the shop just before 3:30 and, since they close at 5pm, I thought for sure we'd have to spend the night. Jennifer assured us they'd get us back on the road and after replacing the alternator and battery, we were on our way again a few minutes after 5:00. I can't believe they were so fast and reasonably priced. I just wished they were located near my home so I could use them for all my repairs.
