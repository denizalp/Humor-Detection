Amanda was one of the best waitresses we have ever had..She was through and extremely polite. She suggested that we try the cheese dip with carne asada and it was extremely good and we also had the flaming fajitas. Chicken and beef and both were absolutely amazing. To top it off we had some amazing margaritas. We would return there anytime. thank you so much we enjoyed ourselves and our waitress was a huge part of that
