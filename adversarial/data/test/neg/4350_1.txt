I walked in and saw the biggest smile on a beautiful face and he was sweet and explained all the choices with enthusiasm. It's family owned and you can tell they are passionate about the product. I ordered a \"Guave Father\" smoothie an it was delicious. Not too sweet and very refreshing. Can't wait to try the bowls.
