Man is this place nice!\n\nHowever, understand this is not a hotel. It is a condo\/hotel with MOST rooms being condos.\nThis is not a bad thing as you will find hardly anyone in there. This is generally the case for all of Lake Las Vegas - \n- hence the flood of negative reviews made by people that failed to educate themselves on what they are getting into.\n\nUnfortunately this includes very little staff. This is not a problem for me and I liked this vibe.\nThis is the place where I've seen one of the nicest and reasonably priced 2bed suites with full kitchen and conference room table - all for a great price.\n\nQuite, low density, great views, modern everything and low-key atmosphere.
