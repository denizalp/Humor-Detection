We biked from Robinson to this place along the montour trail for lunch. Was delicious and worth the trip!  Had the hot salsa which was flavorful and delicious.  Would classify it more as Med than hot but there are always options to give it more of a kick if wanted.  Got the Cod fish tacos with were outstanding with the mango salsa and cabadge slaw. I will be back, probably in a car.
