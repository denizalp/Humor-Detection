This is the hair salon in the Warden Steeles T&T plaza.\n\nIf you are a female looking to colour your hair, don't come here.\n\nGot my hair done here last year and it was a horrible experience. I thought that $80-$100 was too good to be true for dying long hair. And it was.\n\nThe older male hairstylist was beyond rude. I asked mostly for a root touch up but dye overall so it would match the top. He made the top of my head much lighter\/orange-y then the rest of my hair. When I told him this, he said it was too difficult and there was nothing he can do.\n\nWhen he saw I looked unhappy, he offered me a free \"oil treatment\" when I come back, which I will never. He didnt care to fix his mistake. I just dyed my hair using box dye after since I didnt feel like spending another few hundreds. Also he must have used a super cheap hair dye as i had flyaway \"baby hairs\" aka breakages for months on the crown of my head.
