I haven't been here for a while now since finding other better places in the neighbourhood.  Been here several times but last time was over a year ago so I can't speak for a more current experience but a friend of mine still goes occasionally and says not much has changed.\n\nThis is a Korean (family) owned Japanese restaurant which is different from the usual Chinese operated ones in the city.  The place is a bit small but ok for lunch and the patio is nice in the summer and more of a neighbourhood restaurant catering to the Church-Bloor St. crowds.  They offer a nice udon seafood noodle and their sashimi was good until one evening my order came with ice chips when they didn't defrost it properly.  Prices were on the higher side but not as high as Ichi Riki nearby but the quality is reasonable.  3 star rating for this place.
