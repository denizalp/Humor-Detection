Couldn't recommend it more! Had purchased a bike from a big-box store, and after its first flat brought it here for repair.  Aside from the tube repair, he pointed out various issues that the bike had, and performed an end-to-end check and repair.  The following week on its second flat, he repaired it in-store promptly.  If you want an honest local bike store this is the place.
