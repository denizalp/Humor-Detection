I cannot say enough good things about Halo. This is absolutely the most professional and cleanest shop I've been to in Arizona. They have a great selection of jewelry a little on the pricey side but that's what you pay for retail. Jeremiah was our piercer and not only was he super professional and awesome at what he does, he was a great guy to work with--hilariously funny and very personable. If you are looking to get another piercing or perhaps take your child in to get her first, this is the place to go. The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable and it's not one of those weird trendy places where you go in and feel uncomfortable. Everyone and anyone is made to feel welcome here. And for the teenage crowd remember at Halo you get 3 free piercings on your 18th birthday.
