Like others, I wish I would have read the reviews first. Made the reservation through Expedia. Waited in line for 45 minutes (about 5 people in front of me). Then, I say that I do not want the collision coverage. What do I get charged for? Yep, collision coverage. Then, they charge me for fuel. A whole TANK of fuel when I literally drove about 25 miles over 4 days. So, what was supposed to be $124 total rental is now $350. Then, I returned the vehicle at 4:30am. Was told the computers weren't working and they needed to keep my contract. I open my bank account today to see an additional $26 charge. I call the customer service number and my car was never returned so they are charging me for an extra day. It can't get any worse than this. The customer service rep (who speaks minimal english I might add) opened a \"complaint ticket\" and told me I should keep my telephone line open for the next 24 hours so they can call me back. Ummmm...ok. I guess they don't have call waiting. WORST PLACE EVER!!! Stay away. Stay far, far away.
