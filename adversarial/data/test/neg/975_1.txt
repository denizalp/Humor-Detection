If you want to go somewhere with amazing service, good food & owners who scream at their employees, this is the spot for you. I've given this place more than a couple chances & although I actually enjoy the food, I couldn't in good conscious continue to give my money to owners who feel like they can scream at their employees in front of customers. The owners seem to be a couple, I've seen the male owner completely berate a female bartender to the point of tears once and actually heard (!) the couple screaming at each other on a separate occasion when I was seated near the kitchen. It's sad because the rest of the staff are always so kind & helpful, I don't know how they put up with their bosses. I can't give my money to bad people no matter how good the food is.
