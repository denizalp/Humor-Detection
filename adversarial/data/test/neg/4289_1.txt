Came here for dinner with my daughter on Father's Day. It was a beautiful evening so we sat outside on the patio. Noise is sometimes an issue here, as the patio is situated at the front of the building on a busy street. However, they do have thick shrubbery to block the rather unattractive view and buffer traffic noise. Service was very good; we had an obviously young waiter who appeared to be a complete novice. Despite his lack of experience and knowledge, he was attentive, found answers to our numerous questions and brought everything out in a reasonable timeframe. My salad was enormous and flavorful. I would have liked almonds or something crunchy on top, but was otherwise very satisfied. My daughter had fish and a couple sides and was happy with it as well. We redeemed a $10 off coupon which was a nice bonus. That, combined with the lovely weather and good food made for a great night.
