My husband and I decided to dine at the Bellagio Buffet based on a recommendation of a local resident. Our experience was underwhelming (which is an understatement). It was over priced and offered a selection similar to that of any typical buffet. I would have rather taken the money we spent on the dining experience and spent it in a slot machine.
