I have a good long time friend that told me getting pee smell odor was out of the question. These guys brought in Joe (the miracle worker) and made my kids room clean. My little girl peed in that room so much for months and I tried a lot of different methods. Before changing out the whole padding as my friend had advised me to do, Carpet Monkey made it not even a quarter of what I was going to spend on reinstallation. Saved a small family a lot and I thank you!!
