Coming from Chicago, I'm always afraid to order pizza while traveling. Delivery was fast, food was hot. Ordered the deep dish pizza and everyone loved it. Great cheese, pepperoni, and Italian sausage. My youngest who is really fussy ate an entire order of fettuccine Alfredo. My family is already talking about ordering again tomorrow.
