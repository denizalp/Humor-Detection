Hands down, this is my favorite place to visit when I am in the Phoenix area.  I've been to Lon's several times now, and I have loved it every time.\n\nI have only been for dinner; I see many of the lesser reviews are from people who visited for brunch.  I will stick to dinner so my five-star bubble remains in tact.  \n\nMy visits have included stops by the bar for dinner after flying into Phoenix, New Year's Eve dinner, and several romantic dinners with my boyfriend.   \n\nFirst, let's talk about the location and atmosphere.  While you can do your own accurate research, Lon's is basically a ranch house-turned restaurant.  It is in Paradise Valley, so your trek to Lon's will be through dark unlit streets and neighborhoods.  You may pass it up if you don't know what to look for, so be sure to map it out in advance.  I am not from Phoenix, so I leave the driving to my bf.  Valet is complimentary.  \n\nI have never been seated outside, but I imagine it would be dreamy if the weather and company were right.  They have fires and heat lamps.  I have eaten in the bar, and I have been seated in the indoor dining area.  I was content with both.\n\nThe servers have always been outstanding and knowledgeable, offering advice and suggestions and explanations when asked.  \n\nThe food, in my opinion, has always been perfect.  Yes, it is somewhat pricey, but you get what you pay for at Lon's!  Two weeks ago, I had the seared salmon.  It was cooked to perfection, and the flavor was divine.  I also finally ordered the truffle-scented mac and cheese.  It is extremely rich, and I overate, but that's what Lon's is all about, I guess.  I only do it a couple of times a year.  I am comfortable in suggesting that if it looks good in the menu description, it will go above your expectations.  \n\nLon's may not be for everyone, but if you've never been, you must visit at least once!  I can almost promise you'll want to return.
