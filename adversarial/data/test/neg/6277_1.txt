fun!  southpoint has a lot of lanes and a lot going on all the time.   it's crackin' here daily, but easy to get a lane.  i've been coming here for a couple years now and they keep this place looking tip top and really has no sign of deteriorating at all.  the staff is cool and busy, quick to  get you where you need to be amongst all the people that are just hanging around, people bowling, people in tournaments, eating on one of the tables lining the area above the bowling area,  kickin' it in the bar.... buying snacks at the snack bar, kids in and out of the arcades... \n\narcade btw has a lot of games, both video and ticket redeeming ones.   the arcade is also kept clean, is inviting, large,  and not at all dingy. \n\nbathrooms are clean and spacious... \n\nthis place is well taken care of and a great family spot!!!
