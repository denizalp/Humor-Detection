This is one of my favorite spots in Vegas!   It's a little bit of a trek off-strip and was recently moved into this old office-stylse building which is somewhat off-putting but inside is so awesome!  Whenever we're in Vegas we always stop in and play a few games.  It is lots of fun and I 100% recommend checking this place out if you have a few spare hours.
