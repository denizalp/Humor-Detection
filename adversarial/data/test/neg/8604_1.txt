Good mexican food seems to be a challenge to find here in Las Vegas. I recently moved in to the neighborhood and saw all the good reviews for Jefe's so the wife and I tried it out. When I arrived I was a bit surprised (shows how well I read things on Yelp) that they were in a gas station and while I was a bit taken back by that I do remember some of the best food I've had in cities like Austin come from the backs of random gas stations.\n\nMy wife ordered a couple tacos and I ordered the Jefe burrito. All I can say is WOW, this is probably the greatest thing I have ever put in my mouth.\n\nFood was delicious and the service was friendly. Definitely a place you do take out from unless you want to sit in a gas station and eat but they also have convenient online ordering. I will definately return to Jefe's.
