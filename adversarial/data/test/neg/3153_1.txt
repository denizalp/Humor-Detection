Sorry I just don't get some of the hype here. The burgers are meh. I like a meaty juicy burger and not these well done drier patties. Fries especially suck. I get that they are all about freshness but taste and texture is important to me too. For a fresh concept fast food burger, I would rather go for Shake Shack or Five Guys, which is much juicier and flavorful.\n\nStill, my preference for an awesome burger is one that uses some fattier cuts of well seasoned meat and can be cooked to a juicy medium rare.
