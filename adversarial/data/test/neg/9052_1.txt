Quick service and food smelled amazing as soon as we entered. The atmosphere is super chill and there is plenty of seating. The prices are definitely fair considering the quality of the food. I can see myself coming back for sure. \n\nI started with a few street tacos with different meats just to get a taste. I instantly ordered fries with 2 meats after tasting the carne asada and el pastor... The meat was super soft and flavorful.\n\n\n** Here's a little YELP tip...try the horchata, you will not be disappointed**
