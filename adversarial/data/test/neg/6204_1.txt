I didn't think we'd get to try this place out since Yelp stated that it closed at 2am. However, when we walked by at 3am, we noticed the sign that said \"always open.\" Apparently, it is only the candy section that closes at 2am. Dining part is always open. Score! They get 4 stars instead of 5 because we were a bit confused when we walked in (as to whether or not we should wait to be seated) as well as the difficulty of getting the check afterwards.\n\nWe ordered the White Gummy goblet. It was gigantic! $36 split amongst 5 people made it okay, but I wouldn't order the gigantic goblet on my own. It was nice that the server waited for us to have our cameras ready in order to capture the cool effects! The goblet is served with only candy and dry ice, and then they pour the alcohol at your table so you can see the effects! It was super cool, and extremely delicious! I couldn't really taste the alcohol, though this may not be a good thing as I can see myself getting drunk off of this since it's so delicious! Gummy worms were yummy, though rock-hard from the dry ice and alcohol. Great photo op, though it didn't do anything for me (in terms of getting buzzed) since we shared amongst so many. Their goblet with the watermelon looked promising. I want to go back to try that flavor!
