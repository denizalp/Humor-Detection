Another case of big corporate quasi govt too big to care and \"too big to fail\" place. The service here is slow. Only one teller working. The guy walking around the lobby glad handing and making excuses told me they had a call out, but didn't replace the shift either. \n\nFunny - the last time I was in. There was ONE teller and a long line.  Hmmmmm...\n\nLots and lots of NOT busy Chase blue shirt payroll walking and\/or sitting around handling nothing. Step in and handle the line of customers? Oh heck no. Not a chance. Lots of heavy supervision. \n\nYou never see this in a thriving small business.
