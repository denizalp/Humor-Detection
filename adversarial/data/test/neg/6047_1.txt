The place was packed you had to wait for a table or bar stool to get a drink or food. Restaurant was closed, an hour and a half wait, not to mention you need a $5.00 card just to get on the list, keep in mind it's good forever, don't know if I will go back to much of a headache\nParking was a huge problem, not to mention a bus was taking up 10 spots when they could have parked along the entrance road.\nStaff was not very accomodating.
