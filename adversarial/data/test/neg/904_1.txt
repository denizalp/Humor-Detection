Allegiant airlines is horrible. My flight has been delayed for 6 hours and their excuses make no sense, when they actually give you one. Every time I have flown with them they have landed their planes so hard i have has neck\/back pains. I would suggest paying more money and getting a better experience. If I could rate negative, I would.
