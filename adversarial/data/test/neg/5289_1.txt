The ramen noodles are to die for and it is family friendly and the service is very good. I would suggest the edamame to start because to me it's a delicious and light snack. For your main dish you should go for some ramen it's very filling and you can add however many topping you would like. If you are planning to go for dinner I would suggest getting there a little early because it gets packed very quickly.
