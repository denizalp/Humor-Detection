This is a nice friendly local pub with good food and drinks deals.\nThey also have an amazing quiz night on Wednesdays it is so much fun.\nWith Muggs you get what you pay for they are not trying to be a fancier bar.\nIt does look a bit dated inside but the food is hot the beer is cold and people are friendly.\nI have been many times great place to just have a beer and chat.
