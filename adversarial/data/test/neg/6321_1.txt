Nice place, close from my house!!\nUpdate review\n- Slow day no  to much people sitting, slow service; 4 people in the kitchen they talk to much don't work, using the cellphone. Bad service today!! \nI ordered breakfast Sandwich 'cause they're out of avocado, It came first my waffle and then my coffee . I returned the waffle the egg was overcook tasting like plastic with a lot of black pepper.\nThe waffle machiatto was really good.\nThen I received My waffle, honestly didn't like it to much, the turkey sausage very dry I believe the used the same that came at the first time. \nMaybe bad day, but the service is the same slow when is not even busy .. 3stars
