I love this place.  The food is awesome and the portions are huge. It's mostly a sandwich place when it comes to food,  but there are many to pick from. It's a brew pub with an outstanding selection of beers which they are always changing so there is usually something new every time you go.   I couldn't ask for much more out of a brew pub.  It's hard to point out where they could improve except for more parking.
