I just received some incredible customer service from Foot Solutions on Bell Road. I want to give a shout out to Matt and Kim who really went above and beyond for helping fix my inserts that I got from a different location (Scottsdale Road)  Matt did a great job and modifying my inserts, and now I can already feel the difference. If you want to go to a foot solutions location that really cares about your well being try out the Bell Road location, you won't be disappointed ,thanks again- Ron
