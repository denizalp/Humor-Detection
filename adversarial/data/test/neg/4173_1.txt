My parents took me here for my birthday dinner and the food was okay. We started off with the seafood salad for the table and the calamari was over cooked and tasted too burnt for my liking.  The other dishes order were the Seared day boat sea scallops, risotto, saba which 2 of the 3 scallops were lightly frozen on the inside and a bit too cooked on the outside. Hence that was sent back only to be recooked after we finish the meal. My mother order Pan seared salmon, brussel sprouts, baby carrot, chili marmalade and the the veggies were finely sliced unlike what you expected (full size veggies) with the fish being a bit heavy on the butter and mediocre. The last dish was the best and least expensive; the Pappardelle, pork and veal bolognese sauce. The pasta was fresh and ample serving.  I gave the restaurant a 3 star because the limoncello margarita and tiramisu was excellent yet for the dinner pricing, I suggest dining elsewhere for seafood.
