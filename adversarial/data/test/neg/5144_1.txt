Sushisamba would be very good if there weren't so many other better options for sushi on the Strip.\n\nMy wife and I dined at Sushisamba before catching Rock of Ages.  The ambiance is fun but a little busy.  It can be difficult to hold a conversation.\n\nI started out with the red miso soup with mushrooms.  It was way to salty even for miso.  I ordered some sashimi and a sushi roll with foie gras.  It was good but not great.  My wife ordered a bunch of sides (she's pregnant and was craving rice, beans, and plantains all at the same time!).  She complained that the food was a bit too spicy.\n\nWe ordered mochi for dessert.  They were pretty good but standard without anything standing out.\n\nOverall, there are better options for sushi.  The Latin infusion was kind of gimmicky and did not always pair well with the Japanese dishes.
