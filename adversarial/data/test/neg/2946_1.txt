I would recommend Las Vegas Mobility Store to everyone. I am soo happy with their services, skills and great customer services. Hovhannes and his staff helped my grandmother with all her questions and needs and put her to ease. They have great prices and great quality wheelchair. Thank you, you guys are amazing.
