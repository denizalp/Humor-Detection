This is a 3.5, the drinks were great, awesome wines by the glass and of course a large beer selection.  However the appetizers were nothing to write home about.  The cheese platter was full of bland boring cheeses that were not worth the price . The pastrami was nearly all fat and dry.  The best thing tried was the duck confit fries and that was slightly above average. Very nice atmosphere, would go back JUST for drinks.
