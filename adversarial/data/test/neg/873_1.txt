Myron was the photographer at our wedding at Bears Best in June. His work really stood out to me, so he was the photographer I had to have. I love our wedding photos so much. He has a great eye for catching beautiful moments in time. The lighting and angles are my favorite. Plus, he's a pretty cool guy to have around on a busy day like your wedding, very easygoing.
