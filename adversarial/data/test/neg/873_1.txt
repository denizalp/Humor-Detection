Love this place!!! They open at 9am. This is great for my husband and I since we work the Graveyard shift and want \"lunch\" food and not \"breakfast\" food :)\nLove the sayings such as the sauce is kickin etc..\nWe always get the Caniac which includes 6-7 chicken strips, texas toast, fries, coleslaw and two dipping sauces.\nOne of our cats Pumpkin wont leave us alone until we give him a nibble of the chicken!\nWe will always return
