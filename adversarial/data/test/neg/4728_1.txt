I was looking at the classifieds online for a car. I came across an ad for a fairly inexpensive car. I stopped in over the weekend to check it out. I met with a sales girl that showed me that car and a few other cars. They had a large selection. I actually ended up getting a different car from express. Clean car. The down payment was low, which is why went there to begin with. The rate was kinda high, but they told me in a year after good pay history, I could bring it back for a different car, or refinance the car. They finance the cars so that wasn't' a hard step.  Overall I had a good experience.
