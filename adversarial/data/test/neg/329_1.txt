I'd just like to say that I love Apple products and will continue to prefer them over any phone, computer etc., but the customer service is subpar and you should try and go to ANY other Apple store at all costs. My battery had been giving me issues for weeks and I finally decided to do something about it so I waited 5 days for my appointment only to be waited on 40 minutes after my scheduled time of 11. I had already tried the restoring the phone, etc. so the customer service person from Apple I spoke with the week earlier ON THE PHONE determined it must be the battery so thats what I told them. Easy fix right? Was quoted 40 minutes and was told even that was a generous time to allow for ample time, but I arrive after 40 minutes and continued to wait another 30 minutes for my phone only to have someone tell me they are replacing my phone altogether since my battery passed diagnostics. Okay fine, but I waited almost 2 flippin hours just to get a new phone? I'm sorry but this Apple store is awful. The people are rude and don't seem to really care about providing good service. I even overheard one of the employees say to a customer that they get paid to stand. Classy right? The Biltmore location is so much better! Will not be going back.
