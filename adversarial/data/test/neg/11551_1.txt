First time to this place. I came based on Yelp reviews! I loved my gyro plate. Very flavorful and a generous portion. I requested the half salad, half rice side. I personally did not care for the rice..I would rather have a double Greek salad for my side. The dressing is unbelievable. Overall, all of the food is so fresh. \nWe got a hummus app. The pita is so fresh. My only complaint would be the hummus. It thought it lacked flavor. I would not get it again. \nGreat job with the atmosphere and customer service!
