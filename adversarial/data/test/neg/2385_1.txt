OK food but we will not be back.\nMy brother and I went here for lunch, and we understood AYCE places would be busy and that is fine. A table with three guys beside ours was served about three times as often as ours.  I had to ask 3 different servers to get a new set of chopsticks. The waitress didn't come by to pick up any new orders so my brother ended up walking our second order to the chef's area.  And the worst part?  We were served half the number of sushi rolls that we ordered!  Was the writing that bad?  Was there a sushi void somewhere?  I don't know, but it happened 3 TIMES!  10 pieces of salmon became 5, 20 became 10 and then 10 became 7?  I may not understand 'new math' but we wanted to eat and go and, instead we had to wait and reorder because the correct number of items that we wrote down NEVER ARRIVED! Gastronomically, the sushi and white tuna rolls were delicious that day, the spicy salmon was good and the strawberry ice cream was very nice at the end. I would stay away from the chicken wings wonton\/gyoza and spring rolls. That being said, the service was bad and making someone doubt their math skills is just cruel. 10% cash discount mentioned elsewhere was not offered.
