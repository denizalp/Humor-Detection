Do not come here if you are only \"a little hungry\". They make 7 egg omelets folks. The fruit salads are worthy enough to fit on Carmen Meranda's hat. The sugar dispenser have colored sugar. there is just the right amount of neon and fake trees. Most of the servers seem to be from the former eastern block countries and I am very happy that the wall came down. Hubba Hubba.\nIf you are over 21, I highly recommend the lounge. dimly lit. benches surrounded by fountains with gas fire in the middle of the water and classy swank cocktail waitresses, dressed in long black dresses, sits down next to you in to take your order. It is a nod to the old Vegas. If you are on the town, this is a great place to wind down an evening with good friends.
