This is the best place (IMO) that delivers to Troy Hill.  Please allow an hour at least for delivery.  It is worth it.\n\nIn the past I've had the regular pizzas (sausage, pepperoni, etc) from there.  Always delicious.  Today I decided to try some of their other selections:\n\nMoroccan Spiced Chicken and Dry Plum Pizza (SOO GOOD)\nPide with Pastirma (WONDERFUL)\nBeets (I had a craving.  Really really good!)\n\nDelivery was only 5 minutes past the GrubHub estimate.  Driver polite and friendly as has always been my experience with them.\n\nI'm usually stingy with the stars, but as it is so hard to find good food delivered to Troy Hill (not counting using Meals Delivered), I'm going for it.  Five stars!
