I recently stayed at this hotel for a work meeting.\nI loved the large rooms (suites) at this place!\nPlus the room was very clean.\nNice large bathroom with tub and separate shower.\nThe small bar inside the hotel was a nice place to grab a drink and chat. Plus outdoor seating during the right time of year.\n\nGreat location within walking distance to many restaurants. \nRoom service was good for breakfast...... price wasn't too crazy like in some hotels.\nI would definitely stay here again.
