This was my first experience eating Ethiopian. Had the lunch buffet and tried everything I had room for and some. Couldn't really tell you exactly what any of it was called but there was a beef dish with berebere that I will be back for. The spicy lentils were especially delicious as well. If there are vegetarians or those gluten free'ers in your crew, they won't be disappointed with this place. There are options for everyone.\n\nThe staff was awesome and very helpful to us first timers. I think they got a good laugh watching me try to eat with my hands. I think I wore as much as I ate. Both service and food were excellent. Looking forward to trying the dinner menu.
