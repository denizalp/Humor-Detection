The Alfred Angelo staff are incredible!! Warren, Ashley & Anna went above and beyond to help make our wedding day perfect. After a erroneous ordered bride's maid dress (incorrect size). Warren, Ashley & Anna did all they could to replace the dress in the VERY short window we had before the wedding. Not only did they accomplish getting a new sized custom order bride's maid dress, but they were exceptionally professional and apologetic. Highly recommended! I'd give them 6 stars for customer service if I could!
