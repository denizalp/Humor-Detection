Let me start by saying any place that had highland beer on special for 2 bucks is a winner in my book! Then we ate and my opinion improved even more. I had the veal Kansa strip with mashed potatoes and green beans and it was really good! The pork belly sliders are also good. Rooftop is a nice way to enjoy the evening, so check it out!
