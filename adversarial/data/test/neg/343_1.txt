Great little diner for breakfast fare. The prices aren't dirt cheap but not expensive either. The staff is always lovely. And the food prep is fast. They even have gluten free bread. I enjoy the omelettes and the bacon egg plates. The food is scrumptious and plentiful. I've been back a few times and I've never had a bad plate. The location has tons of parking. If you love breakfast than you'll love this place
