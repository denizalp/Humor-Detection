Love this place! My favourite pasta place in Calgary! \nThe owner of this restaurant works as a waiter and always has a smooth running waiting staff. The food is great and at a very good price. The free bread is always warm and delicious. I moved within the city of Calgary and incredibly sad I moved so far away from this location. I always forget which day is pasta day but you can get a huge plate of food for 8$! Pasta lovers you cannot go wrong here!
