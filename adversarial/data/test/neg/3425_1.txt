I would consider this place a classic Vegas must-do. It can get pretty crowded, so reservations are a good idea. The ambiance and decor are just totally awesome. The walls are packed with all kinds of pictures and autographs and other things to look at. It's got exactly the kind of character that I love. There's even an elderly man with a accordion thing that walks around and serenades the tables. (Tips are encouraged.) I just absolutely loved it.\n\nThe menu is posted up on the wall and is pretty straightforward. You get unlimited red or white wine. You get a house salad or minestrone soup. You get garlic bread. You choose your entree (there are about 5 different price levels ranging from $22 to $40), everything from spaghetti and meatballs to ribeye. If your entree doesn't already involve pasta, you get a side of penne with marinara sauce. You get a cappuccino. For the amount of food and drink involved and the quality, it's a pretty good deal for your money.\n\nThe wine was pretty good for being house wine. (We went with the red.) The salad was tasty - I liked the dressing. The minestrone soup was some of the best we've had. Our entrees were large and filling and yum. I opted for the steak caruso. It was a perfectly cooked steak on top of pasta with mushrooms and other veggies and just a little bit of a kick. The cappuccino was good. And we even got a free dessert, complete with a candle, since we mentioned it was our anniversary when we made our reservation. And that was tasty too. It wasn't the best pasta ever or anything, but it was good. And the ambiance made it awesome.\n\nThe service was great. Friendly and attentive. Never rushed. Checked on just the right amount. Good pace to all the food. All in all, we had a wonderful meal and experience here. I look forward to coming back.
