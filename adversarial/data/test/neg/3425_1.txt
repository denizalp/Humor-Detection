This was my first time here since they took over. My family and I really loved Las Fuentes and we were hesitant to try Yaya's because we thought no one could top the previous buffet. Well....I'm glad we did!! The service was amazing and the food was delicious, it was their Fathers Day brunch when we went.The menudo was my favorite and the beans. My dad, mom, grandma and daughter enjoyed everything they had as well. We will definitely be returning!
