Came here for lunch after finishing up some shopping at the mall. Waited only 5 minutes before we were seated and ordered the 2 most popular dishes: shrimp linguine and sausage pappardelle pasta which did not disappoint. The pasta is all made fresh every morning and I was pleasantly surprised to see that small and large portions are available for all pastas. We will definitely be returning, likely with a large group of friends.
