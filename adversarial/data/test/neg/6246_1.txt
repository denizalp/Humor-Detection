Today my husband and I visited Fern for the second time. The first time was Mothers Day, so we had brunch on Sunday. I really enjoyed the food. I also enjoyed the customer service. The servers were welcoming and pleasant. Today I had the Sweet Potato Reuben and the fingerling potatoes with a root beer. I thoroughly enjoyed all three. My husband had the OM Burger which he stated was equally enjoyable. I have eaten at several vegan\/vegetarian restaurants in several states and I must say, I give Fern fairly high scores. I hope Charlotte continues to expand its vegan restaurant community like what is happening out west and in the northeast.
