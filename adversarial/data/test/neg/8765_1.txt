3.5 *s.  Had west lake beef soup (pretty good), beef chow fun (#1 daughter rated it pretty low.  Beef was cut too big and irregular and pretty bland.  Lacked seasoning.  By comparison, my daughter said jade palace's Americanized-bastion-of-north-Scottsdale-Chinese beef chow fun was better), rock codfish in black bean sauce.  Pretty tasty sauce and fish wasn't bad but it didn't seem like cod to me.  Not sure what it was.  Small portion of rice to accompany.  Pricing not bad.  +\\- on returning.
