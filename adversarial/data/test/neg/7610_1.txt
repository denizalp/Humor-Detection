Frustrating experience.  I've been back 3 times because of rude, uncaring employee encounters.  Made an appointment and still had other people served before me (who had arrived after).  Bill waited on me, and transaction was like working with a robot.  No information, no receipt, no sign of caring.  \nI won't go back.  If I didn't already have service here, I'd switch today.  Strongly recommend you manage your account and orders online.  Working with a REAL computer may actually provide you with a better experience than working with the humans in this location.
