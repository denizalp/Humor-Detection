Phil and Sebastian's has done the impossible and created a liquid orgasm in a cup. Their cuppa is better than in some places in Italy, and that is saying something! \n\nThe Cappuccino is to die for. I really love the setup of the store, because you watch the flourishes of the baristas at work. It is like art.\n\nAnd the liquid orgasm is the chocolately-caramely drink whose name I can't remember as my mind immediately went blank with ecstacy. It had the perfect balance of flavor and was not very sweet. The foam was perfect. I just checked out while I drank it, and when I came to I was on the other end of the farmer's market!
