The promised land of furniture stores....IKEA is one of those places that you REALLY have to go to at least once in your life! It is huge and a bit overwhelming if you aren't used to the set up, but once you figure it out you will have a blast wandering around getting home ideas and buying all sorts of random things. \n\nAlso be sure to visit the resturant (usually located on the top floor) where you can get a really good lunch for about $5! It's cafeteria style, but the Sweedish Meatballs are definately worth the lines, and if you like them enough you can even buy them downstairs in the grocery section!\n\nFurniture, groceries and lunch. We REALLY need an IKEA here in Raleigh.
