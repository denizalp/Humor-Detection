I'm surprised people say this is the best buffet. I came here on a Monday night, ready to chow down, but found that very little of the food was that good. I mean it was okay, the unlimited crab legs were greatly enjoyed, but other than that, I found most of the meats to be salty or chewy, the veggies were bland, the ceasar salad was AWFUL, and then.. everything else was just meh. There was impressive quantity and if you're a lover of shrimp, crab legs, and desserts, you can get your fill, but I've definitely had better buffets in my time.
