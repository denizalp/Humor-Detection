I was pleasantly surprised at the customer service offered at this location. I am currently in the process of moving and while boxing things up misplaced my credit card. Not knowing my future address I wanted to speak with someone in person to figure out what my options were -- please don't tell me I have to wade through all my boxes to find it! :O\n\nI'll admit when I walked in I felt unsure what to do, no one to greet me. I looked to my left and there were people sitting, I looked to my right and people were in line. I hopped in line and waited. Moving closer to the front I could tell this line was to deposit or withdraw money. Pretty much, useless to me. Nevertheless I get to the front of the line and ask my question. The teller was able to answer it as well as give me the credit card department's number so they could assist better. I left feeling satisfied. Great service!
