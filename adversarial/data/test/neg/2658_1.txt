Classic and reliable breakfast food provided by friendly and responsive staff. The pot of bread is a fun diversion from the usual-usual. The Country Skillet was delicious and well balanced. There was a good amount of meat\/egg\/potato mixed together (some skillets at other places are 70% potato and few ingredients). The scrambled eggs were fresh and fluffy. Their omelets are also hefty. The Sandy Omelet packs in a lot of flavor and should satisfy your hunger.\n\nAll in all, an easy and pleasant experience.
