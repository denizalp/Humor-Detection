Absolutely the best diner in Charlotte. I'm never disappointed. The service is always excellent, food is great, and breakfast is always spot on made to my instructions. The dessert display is absolutely mouth watering and they taste darn good too.\n\nBE CAREFUL what time of day you go, for example 11am on Sunday it is very busy.
