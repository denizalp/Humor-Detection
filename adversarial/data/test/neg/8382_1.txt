We went at about 11:30 on a Friday and stood in line for 1 1\/2 hours, and IT WAS WORTH IT! That should tell you all you need to know. This is the only place in Phoenix where I know the barbecue is done right! We got the pulled pork, brisket, sausage links, mac n cheese, grits and a lot of extra sauce. It is perfect barbecue.\n\nIf you don't want to wait in line, then check out their pick-up and pre-order options, but please do not let the long line keep you from trying this place. It's family-owned, and you can tell the people working there love what they do.
