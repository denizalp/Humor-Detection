I just came back from my Sunday brunch at The White Brick Kitchen with my boyfriend.\nWe were promptly seated with no line ups at all, which was pretty sweet. We ordered:\n\nMushroom Melt Sandwich:\n The thick cut grilled pieces of bread, with cheese and thick chunks of mushroom was superb! You get a nice mouthful of juicy mushrooms in each bite. On the side it comes with well seasoned potatoes that are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.\n\nThe Benny:\nThe sage sausage in this Benny has great texture and flavour that is not overly salted - just right! The hollandaise sauce and the poached eggs just melt in your mouth. Also comes with the same delicious potatoes as the melt. \n\nOverall, the service was great, the staff was fast and friendly. The food was awesome and we'll definitely be back to try the chicken n waffles sometime!
