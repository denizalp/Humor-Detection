Came again to try more items:\n\nTianjin smoked meat with pancakes - Very good, meat was sliced thin with a variety of condiments and pancake to eat. Flavourful and great texture.\n\nBeef pancake- came in 3 prices with beef and lettuce inside. Crispy outside, good.\n\nGuotie pan fried meat dumpling- 4 pieces, tasted good but nothing special \n\nNoodles in tomato and egg sauce- was very good, noodles are handmade so very yummy and chewy.\n\nMixed vegetables - Just salad with a vinegar sauce. \n\nRed bean cake- Generous amount of red bean paste but the outside is very dry.\n\nGlutinous balls in sweet fermented rice soup- Good rice ball texture in soup but not enough wine flavour, could add more of the alcohol to enhance the flavor. \n\nService:\nSame as last visit, attentive and came to ask what we thought of the dishes.
