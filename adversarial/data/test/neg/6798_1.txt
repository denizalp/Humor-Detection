This is a pretty decent spot for bfast. It'll be my go to bfast place when I'm in town. \n\nI usually order the omelette (low carb). It's got a lot of stuff in it... and comes out pretty huge. I actually struggle to finish it, which is saying something. It costs around $6. \n\nMinus 1 star because it does take quite a while for them to make the omelette... not convenient when you're in a rush. \n\nAlso minus 1 star because their smoothie is pretty bad (and it's not cheap). It tasted like juice from a can actually.
