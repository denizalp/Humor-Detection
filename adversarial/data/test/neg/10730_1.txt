Had lunch and dinner at this location how disappointed . How can all you rave about there food where I can even thing of going back. Food is so tasteless chilli chicken In a sticking glue sauce pakora undercooked . Fried rice swimming in oil and most recommend manchurian noodle spicy but how can you call them noodles when they all look like all crushed not even a full strand . Sorry man can't think of going back had better in other restaurant in the area .
