I found Trini on Groupon and my appointment with her was today. She is a sweetheart, and her technique is just amazing!!! I used to have acrylic nails, and I hated how fake they looked, but today after my appointment I was impressed with the results as they look natural and beautiful. No more stinky products or fake looking nails. Her place is located in Summerlin, a long drive for me that live in Henderson but I will definitely be coming back.
