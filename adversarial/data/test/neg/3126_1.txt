For my wife and I the bill usually comes to 30 dollars or so before tip. This allows for leftovers to take to work for lunch.  Always pleased. They usually deliver much faster than quoted time but we are also only 1 mile away.  Have not oredered anything we did not like. Delivery guy is nice but they are not too welcoming when you go in for pickup.
