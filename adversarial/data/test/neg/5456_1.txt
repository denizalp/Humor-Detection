Ahhh, a breath of fresh air! Being from MA, a highly populated Italian state, I grew up going to Italian groceries like this, and it made me a bit home sick.  A tiny little establishment inundated with products and heck they were even able to squeeze a couple of table in there for dining. The shelves are lined with numerous imported products from Italy, and not just pasta was a relief to see. Canned tomatoes, pasta, gnocchi, candy, cookies, etc.  Although I have not tried too many items on their menu, I have not had a single complaint about anything I have tasted.  The only thing that is missing is the smell.  I used to go to a place in Franklin, MA called \"Ferraras\".  Their original place was there for generations, and for generations it has had meats hanging, fresh meat being butchered, and the women in the back cooking up a storm.  You just walked in and were immediately hit with the aroma of 100 years of delicious treats.  Although Defalco's does not have that yet, I'm sure over time it will get to that level.
