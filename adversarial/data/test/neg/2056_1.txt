Came for karaoke on a Friday night for a friend's birthday. She has a couple other friends with birthdays close to hers so they all teamed up and brought their friends here. This made for a somewhat full bar. It would have been pretty sparse otherwise. I had fun, but it was because of the group I was with. If we had been with a smaller group I'm not sure this is the place I would want to hang out at for karaoke.\n\nThe drink prices are average. $4-7.50 for your standard beers and highballs. Tequila shots were $6. For such a dive-y place the drinks weren't cheap enough.\n\nSome guys at the table next to us ordered some wings which looked and smelled really good. They highly suggested we try them. Unfortunately we did not.\n\nTo sum this place up: If you have a good sized group of people then this is a great spot for karaoke because you'll have no trouble finding a seat and having everyone get a turn at the mic. If you're just looking for a cheap place to hang out with your buddies, skip this one.\n\nOh yeah, they have a patio too.\n\nApril challenge 8\/30
