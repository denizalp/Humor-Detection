I don't usually go for fish and chips in Toronto since most places have thick batters but this place is amazing. Fish were amazing, fresh, cooked perfectly and batter was perfect! My friend and I had halibut and haddock and I highly recommend them both. Also, service there were very good, waitresses there were very friendly. I would say their fish and chips are the best in canada! Would absolutely go there again and recommend to friends and family.  Lastly, the fries were extordinary and store is very spacious\/clean!!
