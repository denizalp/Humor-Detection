Buffets are great if someone else is paying, but when you're paying you're usually left with this feeling that you just got ripped off. After a full week of eating at mediocre buffets it was time for a real one. I was originally planning on eating at the Wynn Buffet our last night in Vegas, but we were staying at the MGM Grand had their Prima card. The Prima card is a debit card that you can use at all the MGM properties (which included the Bellagio). It gave us access to the VIP line so we didn't have to wait in that dreadful regular line (@ 5pm on a tuesday the wait was already an hour long). So as far as this buffet goes, its the best one I've been to in Vegas (thus far) and the only one I would want to go back to. I can honestly say that everything that I had (and I had a lot) was great. Yes you can get better food at a regular sit down restaurant but as far as buffets goes it doesn't get much better (I don't think anyways) in this price range. \nBottom line this is the first buffet I've been satisfied with and didn't feel ripped of at.
