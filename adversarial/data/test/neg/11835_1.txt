Don't let the name fool you.We order to go\/delivery off their Chinese food items all the time.There aren't any really  good Chinese places on the west side. I've been looking for 14 years. This place delivers. Big portions and reasonable prices Their Chop Suey has fresh vegetables nicely cooked Chicken. Pork Fried rice is on point.\nBeef and Broccoli are very good. Won Ton soup is a real broth soup not canned. My favorite is the Singapore noodles! Best I've had in a long time. Only negative are the egg rolls. They aren't big but small and too doughy. This is a small enough of a negative to  overlook. We've had enough failed restaurants on the west side. It would be a shame to lose this one because of their name. Give them a try.
