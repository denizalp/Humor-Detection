This place is amazing! It is a small quite little restaurant with amazing food.  We always get the bistro boxes when we go which includes 4 pieces of sushi and we usually get Kalbi ribs. It also comes with miss soup, a salad and rice.  All the food is SO GOOD! I recommend this Japanese Hawaii fusion food for anyone looking for some delicious fusion food. I would not recommend this place for large groups as it is pretty small but, for small groups it's great.  You will also be able to hold a conversation with no issues. The service is also great you get a bottom on your table to call your waiter whenever you need them which is really convient. This place so delicious!
