Been here a few times and it's decent enough variety .  Certainly can do better or worse, but it's acceptable.  Good for breakfast and they have a HUGE dessert section.  Typical carving station, italian dishes, and an asian section.\n\nIf you're doing the 24 hour pass, might skip on this unless you were just looking to try them all or just for convenience.  Better than Flamingo and Bally's, not as good as Rio, PH, Paris.
