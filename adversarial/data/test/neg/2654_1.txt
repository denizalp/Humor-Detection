What a fantastic meal!  the menu was short and brilliant.  The desserts were crazy awesome.  The staff was great.....with one hiccup.  Not so funny when asked for wifi password to be told \"get a better data plan\".  I'm sure he meant no malice, but maybe check your comedy before dropping something like that.  I later thanked him for saving us international data roaming charges.  Make sure you get here while in Toronto.
