Great food! Came with some friends while we were in Vegas. I had Brisket Biscuits and a side order of grits, shared the gluten-free Pumpkin Parfait with my girlfriend. The Brisket was to die for with that sauce and the biscuits were perfect. Girlfriend was fawning over the Cauliflower Mashed Potatoes and also had a order of Deviled Eggs. Not to mention the absolutely superb and awesome service from Andy. Took care of us and with a  smile the entire time and took great care with my girlfriend's allergies! They can handle both soy and wheat allergies quite well too! \n\nUpdate: Came back again tonight with the girlfriend because she enjoyed the food and service so much, and they didn't disappoint. We got the Catch of the Day which was the Trout over Seafood Jambalaya and Collared Greens and some Mac and Cheese. And I'm dying to come back. And thank you so much for the always awesome service from Andy again and our server Carrie! :)
