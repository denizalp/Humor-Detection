I had had a car in my drive way for a couple of years. Though cosmetically it was in great condition, it needed a new engine. It was my first car so it was sentimental- hence keeping it for so long. But I finally put a for sale sign on it and an ad on Craigslist. Within an hr. 888junkcars called and offered what I thought was a decent cash deal (plus, it was so tacky to have it sit there for so long) and was at my house within 20 mins was at my house, towing on the spot and paid all within mins. It was BEYOND convenient!!! Thank you 888junkcars! I didn't know what else to do besides donate it, and I doubt I would have received nearly as much as I did from this tax return t\nCompared to this company. Since then, I've told multiple ppl about them and would recommend them to anyone! - Kylee W.
