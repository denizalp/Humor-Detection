Carl Dwyer was my tech, and he told me that bulwark is the best company he's worked for. He was fast, friendly, and thorough.  I called and talked to them on the phone and they walked me through everything, and were very clear on pricing.  I used the Yelp deal to save $35.  They tip the techs $15 if you leave a review online for them, which is probably why they have so many reviews, but all the reviews are also great because they are great
