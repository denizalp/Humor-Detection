I've only eaten Here once.  I love prime rib but this was the Worse prime rib ever.  Not just bloody but cold on the inside. Customer service bad,  although they, lack lu sterly, offered to take it back and cook it longer but I had lost my appetite, I did eat part of my husband's dinner which tasted okay,  we paid and left,  haven't been back since. ........ i guess could've been an isolated incident. ......Not impressed.  No complaints at the Flagstaff location however.
