Best pizza in The Phoenix area. The location in Surprise has the nicest people working there too! It's always very busy, but when I call in my order, they don't sound rushed or rude, like you can expect at other take out places. They make THE BEST gluten free pizza. But ask them to bake the GF pizza twice, and thank me
