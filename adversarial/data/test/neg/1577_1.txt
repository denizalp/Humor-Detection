No joke the BEST BBQ I've ever had! First time here and would definitely go back again. Keep in mind the line and wait can get long but it is so worth it. Everyone has raves about the fatty brisket and unfortunately they were out by the time it was our turn; however their lean brisket is delicious. Pork ribs? Amazing! I usually tend to turn away from grits but when the staff heard it was our first time they wouldn't let us turn away without it. Let say I am now a fan of grits. So good! Has a little taste of the jalape√±o without being spicy. If you ever in the mood for some good BBQ this is the place to go!
