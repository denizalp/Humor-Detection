We used the services of Bill Olmstead and his team to sell our house in Gilbert last spring. Bill knows exactly how to prepare a home so it appears more desirable than the other comps. His is a proven, meticulous method that will not only get you a sale fast, but also at the best possible price. Our house was not on the market for long, despite having to deal with particularly contrary and uncooperative buyers - twice! Bill got the job done!
