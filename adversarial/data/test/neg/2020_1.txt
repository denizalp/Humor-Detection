Although not the best pizza I've ever had, it is the best I've had in Canada in a long time. I ordered a couple of pizzas for delivery at 11pm (1 hour before closing), dealt with a very nice person on the other line, and received the pizzas within 20 minutes of ordering. The pizzas themselves had a decent sauce, ample amount of toppings, and a thick crust however it was grease-free which is something almost impossible to find north of the border. The grease-free aspect REALLY made this pizza great as you can then actually taste the toppings.
