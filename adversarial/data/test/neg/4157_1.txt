My husband and I are moving from Seattle to Scottsdale and were looking for foot reflexology and Chinese massage to replace our favorites in Seattle.  We found this spa on yelp and tried it tonight.  We each did a 90 minute treatment, I had a male masseuse, my husband a female.  Both of our services were incredible, we each walked out saying it was the best we have ever had and that includes similar treatments in China and Korea.  \n\nWe can't wait to visit again and highly recommend them!!
