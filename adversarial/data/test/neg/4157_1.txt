Asked for simple leaf removal and hauling for our backyard (approx 2500 sq ft.). Was quoted $30 to drive 5 miles from Champaign to Tolono, $75 ($25\/man hour) to remove leaves, and $33 to haul the waste to the recycling plant. $30 to drive from Champaign to Tolono? With gas at ~$2.50\/gallon, $30 seems quite a bit steep. 3 man hours to clear leaves from a backyard with an industrial vacuum? Sigh. Forget it. I cannot comment on their work as I was unable to justify their ridiculous prices and we didn't get that far.
