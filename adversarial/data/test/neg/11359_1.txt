Called in and lady said they were busy it was an hour wait just to order.... I did not want that at all so I ended the call and was called back shortly after with her telling me that they could process my order right away and it would arrive in 45-60 mins (Typical for Chinese food delivery unfortunately). After waiting over and Hour I called back and they assured me it would be no longer than twenty minutes. Nearly another 40mins later I finally cancelled my order. I understand you are busy but this is such a terrible representation of your business and it's customer service capabilities. If you are too busy to fulfill the demands of your clientele, simply admit it up front and certainly don't try to backpedal to make a few extra dollars. I will never try and order from here again....delivery orders BEWARE! If I could've given no stars...I would've...
