I stumbled upon H&H when I first moved to Etobicoke. I was coming off a wild night, and my typical \"go-to\" hangover cure (GATORADE) just wasn't doing the trick. Since I had NO desire to cook, I thought i would try my other remedy, PHO! \nI was pleasantly surprised by this place; Food is very good, and the service is quick\/courteous! I'll admit, like others have said, it's not the best PHO, but, it does the trick! Someone touched on the decor in another review; it's not great, but, c'mon, you don't go to these places for the interior design, you go for quick\/tasty food!\nI'm giving it a 4 - The PHO may not be as good as the spots on Ossington, but, for the area, i would say it hits the mark!\nCheck it out if you're in the Royal York\/Queensway area, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed!
