A fun addition to the Henderson Booze District. Find the winery in the Henderson industrial area on Eastgate. Vegas Valley Winery has the same owners as Grape Expectations so find it next door. \n\nIt might be a little tricky to find if you've never been to the area before, but there is plenty of parking once you arrive. Inside the winery is clean and nicely decorated. There are about half a dozen tables and a bar area as well. The inside is much cuter than you'd expect for a winery in an industrial park.\n\nThere are five wines available, two reds and three white or rose style wines. The wines can be ordered by the glass or as part of a tasting of all five. I had low expectations for Nevada wine, but the grapes for the wine come from California. My husband and I actually liked all of the wines we tried. We had a hard time deciding on only one wine to order for our glass of wine. \n\nOne of the draws for me was that they offer food. I don't mind that the menu is limited because they have made an effort to have something to offer. Food includes an 8\"or 12\" cheese pizza and a meat and cheese platter. We tried the pizza and thought it was pretty good. The meat and cheese platter had a nice variety of goodies that we enjoyed. It made for a nice light meal with our wine tasting.\n\nThe employees that served us were friendly and helpful. They gave us information about the wines and the winery as we worked through our tasting. Once we were finished with food and wine one of the employees offered us a tour of the back. She showed us the area where wines are made and explained the wine making process at Grape Expectations. We definitely left with some interest in making our own barrel of wine at some point.\n\nWines aren't available for purchase yet. The winery is still making sure they have enough to offer for tasting before selling bottles. We were told that a Muscato will be added to the menu soon too. They are newer, but it sounds like there is more to come.
