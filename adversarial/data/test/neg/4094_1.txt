My family and I have been coming to Orchard for over 20 years. The portions are big, the service is fast and the food consistently good. Love coming here for breakfast, I'm not a huge fan of eggs, but I crave their eggs! Buttery and never over cooked. Their twisted chicken sandwich, souvlaki dinner and anniversary special are always a good choice. If you have room and it's available, get the coconut cream pie, you won't regret it!
