After reading favorable reviews of the restaurant, this was my first time dining there.  The glitch in the meal occurred when my wife and I were seated.  As parties which arrived after us were greeted and beverages delivered to them, we were ignored for over ten minutes, this despite being seated at the first booth and personnel passing by regularly.  Eventually, Nicole came to take care of us and from that point, everything went right.  The restaurant is attractive and comfortable, the tables and booths nicely spaced.  The place is quiet enough for parties to converse without having to raise their voices.  The prices are standard: no bargains here save for the Internet coupon which offers half off one Italian speciality entree when two are purchased Monday through Thursday. The coupon can provide two nice, complete dinners for about $24. My wife and I ordered a large vegetable calzone and large pizza with meatballs.  Both were delicious and unique, and the calzone was packed with vegetables and cheese. With a glass of wine and a Guinness blond draft beer, the tab was $43+, not including gratuity. One takes the check to the front desk to pay.  There, a gentleman whom I suspect is a co-owner, asked me how the meal was, and was pleasant and gracious. I want to try some of the specialty entrees and fried zucchini on future visits, one of my favorite dishes.  We shall return to Carbonaras, which thankfully for us, is within fifteen minutes of our home!
