Always come here for the spicy salmon rolls and they are absolutely amazing. To start off, the decor is nice and casual. The food itself is amazing and although i've only had the spicy salmon roll, the texture and quality of the fish is definitely worth the price. The staff are friendly and well trained. If you come and try this place out, you've got to try the spicy salmon roll.
