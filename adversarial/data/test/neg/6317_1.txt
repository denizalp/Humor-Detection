Went here during the Taste of Tremont this weekend and it was delicious! I was disappointed that the tent in front of the restaurant had run out of ice cream and we had to stand in a very long line though! I assume this was just because of the 25,000 people at Taste of Tremont, but am not sure as this was my first time at Scoops. There were 5 people working in the tent and by working I mean sitting around doing nothing since there wasn't any ice cream to sell. There were about 4 workers inside though and they were very quick and attentive to the customers in line. I got the salty caramel truffle in a pretzel cone (loooove pretzel cones!) and my husband got something chocolatey in a waffle cone (even though he asked for a pretzel cone and they messed up, he just didn't say anything). Prices were reasonable and I liked the simplicity of the decorations inside, including the chalkboard with flavors.
