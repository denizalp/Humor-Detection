I love how clean and cozy it is at Allure. \n\nThe results of my shellac and pedicure were amazing! I forgot the name of the technician who assisted me but she was really sweet and detail oriented. I did not feel rushed at all like I would at other nail salons. It's also a huge plus that the tools and pedicure sinks are thoroughly sterilized after each use. This is the reason why I will continue to visit Allure over other salons:)
