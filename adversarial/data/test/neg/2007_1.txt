I bought an RV last year from these guys, and I had to post a review because of the outstanding service. I shopped different dealers before purchasing, and not only were the prices better, but I truly appreciate the way I was treated from the moment I walked in to the time I left the lot in my 2015 Gulfstream Track and Trail toy hauler. I went back last month for some custom upgrades and it turned out better than I expected. Thank you Lifestyle RV!
