I cannot say enough good things about this store and Breanna. I had a horrid experience at Davids Bridal where I was not asked anything about the dresses I tried on and my consultant was handling 3-4 other brides as well. Needless to say I was dreading this appointment. I was convinced I wouldn't find anything I liked. I scheduled a 4pm Wednesday appointment - I was the only one there was given undivided attention, although I am convinced that would have been the case even if I wasn't the only one there.. I was given 4 clips and told to pin them on 4 dresses I wanted to try on. After trying on each dress Breanna would ask me what I did or did not like about the dress, what I wanted more or less of, if the fabric and lace amount was okay, etc. She was extremely detailed. After I tried on the four dresses I picked out, Breanna took what she learned from me and picked out four more dresses for me to try on. She picked out such perfect dresses that I had a hard time deciding. She was very patient as I tried on two dresses several times to make up my mind.  I didn't go in having a \"dress of my dreams\" but I definitely left with one - and under my budget, too! Thanks Breanna!
