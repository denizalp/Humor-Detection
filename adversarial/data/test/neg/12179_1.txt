We've been to both locations and both are awesome! Each unique to their location in PHX, the decor in The DTPHX LOCATION is modern but welcoming, and someplace I'd bring friends for a refreshing treat. We both tried the milk tea, I had the Thai milk tea and my husband had the house blend. So tasty ! We loved the boba, great texture. The kids working are always so helpful and friendly!! \n\nCheck out the bathroom when you're there but preferably sober, because you might get a little dizzy.\nWe love SNOH
