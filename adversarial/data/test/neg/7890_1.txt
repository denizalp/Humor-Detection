Well this is my second trip to Ararat 17 and although it is a darling little restaurant, I don't think I will be back. We were seated and had a charming waiter. He brought us delicious, House Made, Armenian bread. We ordered the Mashed Eggplant to go with it. It was  good and smoky.  My husband ordered the Pork Schnitzel, which is a German dish, not quite sure why it was on the menu, but due to a allergy issue for Oregano, this was a suitable dish for him. It came with two nice pieces of Pork that were fried, a side of Hummus and Rice. He rated it pretty good in the taste box. My sister who is a Vegetarian had the Veggie Skewer, Big pieces of vegetables that looked grilled.  I ordered the Potato dumplings which seemed like they were Polish, Not Armenian. They were plain and I do mean plain, white boiled dumplings, filled with Mashed Potatoes, totally unseasoned! Sitting in a bowl with some water in the bottom. Not good, not flavorful, not anything. All the dishes lacked seasoning, and I am talking even the slightest bit of salt and pepper were missing. Just not what I expected in this cute little Strip Mall restaurant. So I would suggest stopping in for some  Armenian bread and perhaps the Eggplant, but my recommendations stop there...
