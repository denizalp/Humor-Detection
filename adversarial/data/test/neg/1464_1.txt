I lived here for a year and recently moved out. \n\nPros\n\n- Free cable\/internet. I never had an issue with my internet. \n- Some of the other complex's in arysley do not include both cable\/internet with the rent which was a big reason why I chose Gramercy Square over the other complex's. \n- Reasonable rent at $1100 a month for a two bedroom unit. \n- Its nice to be able to walk to anywhere in Arysley. \n- Upon leaving they did not try to nickle or dime me on a cleaning fee or anything. \n- Friendly neighbors. I made friends the first weekend, I moved in. \n- Gus and the other maintenance staff are great. Gus threw a MLB playoff party in the lounge and invited basically any reside in. Free pizza. It was a nice touch. \n- The staff is great. I have no complaints. They try to keep things nice while trying to uphold the rules of the complex. If I left the empty trash bucket out overnight in the hallway, they would leave a note and waive the fine. Obviously if they did nothing some people might try to take advantage. So I appreciate what they were trying to do. \n- I paid the AUM though my checking account without any issues. I paid via electronic banking. \n- The building are well constructed and planned out. I liked how the stairs are a single flight per floor. Its not a half and half like most other complex's. \n\n\nCons\n\n- Only one elevator per building. I know some guys on the fourth floor, who routinely complained about missing the elevator and having to climb four flights of stairs. There is roughly a 100 units per building. Most people near the stairs do not take the elevators. \n- Aircraft noise would sometimes wake me up. Its loud and at times makes your balcony unusable. Your right on Charlotte International Airport Flight path. Some residents get used to it. I never did get used to it. \n- Your a good distance from Uptown. Nights on the town ranged from $20-$25 each way via uber. I considered it a trade off to Southend rental prices. \n- Your nowhere near a light rail station. \n- The management company routinely raises rent on long-time residents. I got the impression that the raises were $20-30 a month per year. They base it on algorithm. Charlotte does have high rents. \n- The traffic can be a bit of a hassle. I found that sometimes, I was part of the flow to South Carolina as I-77, Tryon were all jammed up between 4-7pm. The complex is only a mile or two from the state line. \n- The Grills almost never worked. It was the one shortcoming of the maintenance staff. They left lighters attached to the grills but they never worked. There was always an issue. Good intentions, poor execution.\n\nOverall not a bad experience. I enjoyed living there. I hope that the management company will look to fix some of the issues, I mentioned on this review.
