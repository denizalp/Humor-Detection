This is comment to the owner of 'Jewel of the Crown'.\n\nThe food was really good.  Customer service was really good.\nHowever, we had a '1' star experience at your restaurant.  \n\nThree of us with a Groupon certificate for $50 visited your restaurant.  Before-hand we called and explicitly asked about any 'catches' we should be aware of.  Being the day of the expiration, or the fact that 3 people are sharing the same coupon would not be a problem, etc.\n\nWe were told everything is good and that our coupon will be accepted.\n\nWhen the bill arrives and the coupon is presented, we are told that we had ordered an 'non-Groupon' menu item and therefore the Groupon cannot be accepted.  We were also told that had we presented our Groupon at the beginning of our meal the server would have told us about the 'non-Groupon' item.\n\nI pointed out that perhaps we should have been told about this 'catch' when we had called earlier and asked about any 'catches'.\n\nThis went on for several minutes with our server at which point I asked to talk with the manager.\n\nThe manager apologized and took the 'non-Groupon' item to be paid for separately.\n\nThe server then came back and said we 'had' to keep ordering food until the $50 limit was reached.  Another set of discussion happened to make it clear that we did not care about 'credit'...simply let us pay the bill and we can let 'burn' whatever credit remained on the coupon. \n\nHowever before we had a chance to order, the server came back saying that we were over our $50 coupon anyway, so there was no need to order any extra food.\n\nWe were just besides ourselves.  A perfectly good meal and 3 new fans that you had found that would have no doubt been repeat customers and would have brought friends in, are no more.\n\nHere are some suggestions for future situations like this:\n1) When a customer calls about any catches regarding Groupon, please tell them about the non-Groupon items on the menu.\n\n2) Apology in words means very little.  We appreciate that finally the Groupon was accepted, however, we were insulted that the order of our friend was taken out to be charged separately.  The 'apology' would have been not to separate out the checks.\n\n3) Have the server do the math before bringing up non-issues with the customer.  Why were we put through the miserable experience of being explained to order more to fit the $50 quota when we were already $12 over!?\n\n4) When customers present a Groupon, it's very unnerving having the server stand there for 30 awkward seconds - reading it like you are at a border crossing out of a communist country.  Just take the coupon along with the credit card and examine it out of sight of the customer.\n\nAgain, I appreciate the verbal apology and final acceptance of Groupon.  However we were not there to simply fill our bellies.  Our lunch experience at your wonderfully atmospheric restaurant was shattered.\n\nRegards,\nI will gladly remove this review if asked by the owner of Jewel of the Crown
