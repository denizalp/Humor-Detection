A year ago, we left Cleveland for the sunshine and warmth of South Carolina.  No regrets, but we miss our friends and certain Cleveland restaurants.  When we knew we were going up to Cleveland for a wedding, Melt was the #1 place we knew we had to go while in town.  My husband dreams about their tofu buffalo wings.\nWe met family for lunch on a Saturday and had no problem getting a table.  Our server was great and patient with us--we were so busy talking and catching up that it took us a while to decide what to order.  My husband and I split the tofu wings (this vegetarian DOES NOT like tofu; these \"wings\" are delicious!).  Whether you eat meat or not, I recommend these.  They are perfectly crusted and fried and the barbecue sauce is right on point.  We also shared a cup of tomato soup  (dammit, Cleveland, it was cold out in September!), which is always good.  For our meal, we split the vegan burger.  This was the first time we'd tried this sandwich and it was great--I'm not sure what all was involved in the patty, but it seemed to have a lot more going on that a standard veggie burger and it was nice and thick.  As always, we left completely stuffed and happy.  \nI think the thing that I love best about Melt is that what is basically a grilled cheese restaurant is one of the best places for a vegan or vegetarian to eat.  There are so many choices and it's easy to customize your meal.  Other restaurants could learn a lot from Melt in this area.
