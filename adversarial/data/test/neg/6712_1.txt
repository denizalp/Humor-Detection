coming out of kbbq, I was looking for something sweet to end the night.  headed down south on Yonge st  and made a pit stop here at this cafe.  didn't really get a chance to read any reviews on this place but decided to make my way up to the second floor to give this a try.  pictures in the menu looked pretty good but it was actually very deceiving.  \n\nlet's start with the hot drinks.  I always wanted to go to a place where they will make a little image in my cup of coffee\/latte and was a bit excited that pictures in the menu had this here.  I saw a tree, leaf, happy face etc.  in a nice big cup.  as you can see in my picture I took, not only did it not come with a little image in it, it came in a small to go type of cup.  taste wise, like a vending machine but I actually didn't mind, I liked it.  \n\nto the cake, don't let my picture fool you.  the size of the cake was the size of my middle and index fingers put together.  taste wise, straight out of a grocery store type of cake.  and not the higher end grocery stores, more like price chopper style.  but again, I actually didn't mind.  what I did mind was the price tag that was attached to it.  it was $12.99 for the drink and cake combo.  \n\nto recap,  to go type of cup drink with vending machine taste like quality and 2 fingers size low end grocery store quality piece of cake with high end cafe prices.  and I forgot to mention the table we had.  we were sandwiched between 2 other tables against a half wall and had a fake plant over hang us with its fake branch half way on to our table.  too bad I'm bad a describing the actual setting we were in, should've taken a picture (it is worth a thousand words).\n\nso based on the above description, this place should get no more than 2 stars.  but you know what,  the waitress had a nice smile and was friendly.  this made all the difference in the world.\n\nwill I come back... probably not.  maybe it was just tonight or my luck with the food\/beverage.  but hard to come back here when there are so many other options in area.
