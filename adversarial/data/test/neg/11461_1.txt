I took my iPhone 6 here & it came out horrible. The whole corner was coming off & I took it back to get it refixed. The gentlemen was very unprofessional & even the second time it ruined my phone. I paid almost 150 to just have my phone be completely useless. I had to just go get another one. I would not recommend this place.
