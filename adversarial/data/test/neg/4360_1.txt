We go here a lot because its our local and the guacamole is awesome... We also hired their taco cart for our daughter's birthday because our original taco cart cancelled two days before the event (seriously). The cart was AMAZING, people at the party who hated the restaurant thought the food the guys made at the party was exceptional. The two guys running the cart were so friendly, the whole thing made the party! In short, the restaurant is good, getting these guys for a party is even better!
