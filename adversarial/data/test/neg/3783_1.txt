We had some really really great plates and then some that were 'eh...\nWe ordered 9 plates for the 4 of us- and that was plenty. This tapas bar definitely had larger 'small plate' portions than most other tapas restaurants that we've tried out. \nSome of the plates were definitely fabulous!  The aioli that came with the calamari was delicious and the prosciutto crostini was a table favorite.  The Lamb lollipops were super yummy, as was the salad that they were served with.  The asparagus with the six minute egg were super and the pork belly was melt in your mouth delicious! \nSome of the plates were duds- the queso fundido was passed on by one of the kids, and the potato dish, I can't even remember the name of it, was just yuck. The Brussels sprouts had a very nice flavor, but needed some caramelization or something.  \n\nOverall, a nice meal, definitely some pluses and some minuses, but good eats for sure.
