This place is wonderful and the food is even better. Joe and his family love food and the people here make it with love. You can taste it. I especially enjoy the shawarma and souvlaki meals which fill me up for about two days. I should also add that the owners of this little place care deeply about the people in their local community and donate their time, energy and even resources to hosting community groups. There is alot of good karma going on here and you can feel that too. If you want a down home meal in Richmond Hill that is consistently tasty and filling, I recommend you check it out. Tell Joe that Mike sent you. He'll know what you mean!
