Unfortunately I had to replace my windshield today and I opted for Klassy Auto Glass located in an industrial park near Broadway and 32nd ave. in Tempe. Some of our more, ahem, white bread readers, may want to steer clear of this place. It's not as classy as the name implies. The lobby is completely exposed to the elements and was freezing cold. The dude who was putting in my glass kept having to be pulled off of my car to answer the phone too which was frustrating for me. Having said that, they still got me out of the place in about an hour with a new windshield  for pretty dang cheap. All in all, the place doesn't look like much but its got it where it counts.
