I love this place for shaved ice! I have never gotten anything else, but it looks good. There is something about their shaved ice that I just crave during a hot summer day- especially here in Vegas during the HOT summer heat. My usual order is the Fresh Cup shaved Ice. It is so simple, yet so good. Simplicity really is better! They serve you in a huge tear shaped bowl with fluffy shaved ice and in the middle, they give you a scoop of sweet red beans. Around it, they put there daily fresh fruits. Some days they have kiwis, bananas, watermelons, etc. What I like about it is that it's different every time. They use fresh fruits every time. Then they drizzle condensed milk on top of the fruits. It is so refreshing and very cooling. \n\nI definitely want to try their boba slushies! I saw them use fresh fruits and I guess you can say I'm sold on fresh fruits! One of my favorite places for shaved ice... must try!
