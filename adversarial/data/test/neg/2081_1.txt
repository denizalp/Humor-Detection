I really love this place! Awesome food and fun atmosphere. We have tried the pretzels & cheese, hummus appetizer, guacamole appetizer, and a few pizzas. All the pizzas tasty. My favorite was the bacon, spinach, & ricotta pizza. \n\nThey always have an awesome selection of local & Fate beer which fun to try. My only suggestion is that they need to get more than one set of bean bags for corn hole. There was a wait because they only had one set on hand.
