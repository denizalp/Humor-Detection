Good sushi restaurant in the Palazzo. The restaurant is extravagantly decorated and will give you a taste of Vegas. Sambasushi is expensive so be prepared to 'ball-out' on some fancy presentations. I tried 4 different dishes and hands-down will say that the best one was the El Topo Sushi. I wanted to make a second order once my friend and I swallowed the first one but stopped myself.
