We came here based on a suggestion from friends who come here quite a bit. She's one of those Italian-Americans and claims that this has some of the best Italian food you can find (probably outside of NY). So we decided to come by and give it a go.\n\nUnfortunately, we were still a bit worse for wear from the day before, so dinner had to be a bit lighter than we probably would have done otherwise. We were amazed at the number of free nibbles they hand out: three types of bread, a hunk of aged parmesan, bruschetta, a mussel and fried zucchini. They were all really well done, but it does fill you up a bit at the beginning. They also don't do corkage, so the bottle of wine we brought from Santa Cruz had to be held on to to have when we got back to the hotel.\n\nTo start, I had the fresh buffalo mozzarella with red and yellow tomatoes and the other half ordered the langoustine starter. For mains, we both ordered a porcini and truffle ravioli that was on special. The starters were great. The cheese was really fresh (I assume it's made in house) and the tomatoes and asparagus it was served with just went great. The langoustines were perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth. The mains were also really tasty, but the other half couldn't finish his. We skipped dessert as we were both really full, and nothing really jumped out at us (they have very traditional Italian desserts).\n\nAll in all the food was great and the service was outstanding. The ravioli ended up being incredibly expensive, so if I could do 4.5 stars I would. Although it's not more than we've paid for meals at other places and the delicious pre-starters really made up for it. They also have a decent wine list and decant the wines into pitchers which made for interesting conversation. It's a pretty solid place for a great Italian meal in Vegas (although it definitely seemed more like Italian food I've had in the US than Italian food in Italy).
