I bought a banana blueberry slice by Tammie Coe. It was at the Phoenix Airport in a tiny shop next to the terminal. It was like 3.50 and it was delicious. Girl at the register was really nice. That's my whole experience and if I have to judge by that cake, then I have to give this place 5 stars. It was surprised how delicious that thing was, considering it was at the airport.
