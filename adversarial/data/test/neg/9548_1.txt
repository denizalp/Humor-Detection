Love it. Fires at night really add to the ambiance. People are nice. One of the Runners\/busboys? (sorry don't know the terminology...I don't believe he was a server...saw him clearing tables and attending to the fire places) anyway...he took the time to show my son some of the fish in the fish tank. Our server Danielle was very attentive as well last night.\nI enjoy going there for dinner or a drink with friends. Service has continued to improve. Look forward to more fall and winter evenings sitting Fireside.
