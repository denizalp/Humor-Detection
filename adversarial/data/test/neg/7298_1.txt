I'd like to preface this review by pointing out that it is A LOT harder to get married \"on a whim\" in Las Vegas than they make it seem in the movies. I don't understand how anyone can go through the process completely drunk.\n\nMy husband and I thought we would be one of those couples who simply never got married. After 5 years together, we decided to tie the knot, but wanted to keep the wedding as quick, simple, and fun as possible.\n\nWe went to Sin City this past weekend, and while we had reserved restaurants and booked our hotel far in advance, we figured we would wing it when it came to the actual wedding.\n\nWe started our Saturday with breakfast at eat. (get the beignets!) and then walked a mile or so down Las Vegas Blvd. to all of the endearingly trashy chapels. We found ourselves in A Little White Chapel, and did not have a pleasant experience. We didn't have a marriage license ahead of time and the gal at the desk was very rude as she explained how to get married in Las Vegas. She also explained that in addition to paying for the Drive-Thru, there was an additional fee that we paid the minister (cash tip).\n\nSo we walked a mile back in the direction from where we just came and registered for marriage license. As we walked out of the court house, there were about 5 different people waiting and advertising their chapel. \n\nFor $45 and no hidden fees, A Special Memory drove us (our driver was so genuine and friendly and had the best red shoes and matching fedora)  from the courthouse to the chapel where we quickly said \"I do\" and then dropped us off at a bar on Fremont Street after.\n\nPlus it was actually nice inside and out! And while Elvis did not do our ceremony, we got to chat with him. Our minster was an awesome, business-like woman and we were so pleased.\n\nWe went from walking for what seemed like an eternity and thinking we weren't actually going to get married, to having the best quick wedding we could have hoped for!
