This is my home resort with RCI Timeshares and I have stayed here a couple of times.   I usually stay on the strip at Mandalay Bay, but during one of my trips to Vegas I attended one of the timeshare presentations and was sold into the Grandview.\n\nThe new Daisy building is great and the rooms are comfortable and well equipped.   The kitchen is stocked with dishes, utensils, and cookware.  If you have a family or are 4 or more people, I strongly recommend getting the 2 suite unit (which are identical mirrors of each other) with a common entrance.\n\nOk so the pros of this place are: exclusivity from the strip, South Point casino next door, great swimming pool and rec center, you can bbq in the special grill sections by the pool\/rec area, frequent shuttles to and from the strip.\n\nThe cons..  the stupid timeshare re-sell that they try to pull, people constantly walking around getting the timeshare presentation.  Try and avoid the presentation if you are pressed for time... and if you do go.. make sure you press for as much free stuff and money that you can!\n\nOtherwise the Grandview is a great resort if you want to be able to enjoy Vegas and cool down after time at the strip.
