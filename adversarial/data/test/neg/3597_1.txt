2009.\n\nRode up here with my boyfriend & two of his guy friends. Met up with some more of his friends when we got there. One guy was like \"what?! you just met him & you came down here with him?!\" Haha.. cause at the time, my boyfriend & i just know each other for like a couple of months; practically like strangers.  We went both days, but the first day, we got there it was like 10pm-ish? It was fun and we got to ride the bumper cars & just dance. Then the next day, we got there at like afternoon time about 6pm-ish or even earlier. It was bright & sunny. Not much excitement yet. Then as it progressed later, started to dance. By the time it was dark, it was cold. Brrr... It's always fun to see people get all dressed up in their raver gear\/costumes. Cute. The one thing I wish that I\/we could have done was ride more rides, but the only ride that we got to ride on was the bumper cars. :(\n\nWe got to see ATB, Kaskade, David Guetta, and I don't remember who else.
