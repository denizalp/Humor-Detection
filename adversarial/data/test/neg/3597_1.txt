Unexpectedly needed a mobility device for a local concert. Went to Las Vegas Mobility where they have a great selection. Nick helped us choose a device, correctly fitted it, patiently explained how to break it down and store it in a vehicle and answered our questions in a friendly, professional manner. Our experience could not have been more pleasant. Thanks Nick. Five Stars.
