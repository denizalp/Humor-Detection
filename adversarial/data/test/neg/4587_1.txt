Went in last night (around 6:30 pm) to try their new deep dish stuffed crust pizza. My DH doesn't care for deep dish normally, but for the stuffed crust he was willing to give it a try. It's supposed to be hot and ready, which it wasn't, but the guy to took my order said they were coming out of the oven shortly, so no big deal, I like my pizza hot as I live a few miles away. When he handed me my pizza, he specifically said \"stuffed crust\" of course when I got it home it was just the regular deep dish, no cheese in the crust at all. I didn't have time to drive back, besides, we were hungry, so we ate it, just the toppings for DH. \n\nWhen I called today, the manager said he could give me a $2 refund, but to get another pizza I would have had to bring the original one back...it was \"policy.\" I've had many restaurants mess up my order (hello...McD's anyone!!) and they at least replace what they got wrong. \n\nI understand mistakes, they were busy and things happen...but make it right when they do.
