We have been eating here monthly for over ten years, but no more. We arrived Friday night at 7:40 PM (they close at 9 PM), and they were totally out of BBQ ribs and sushi. Their price has increased from $15.95 to $19.95, and they are not worth the increase. In my opinion, this buffet is no longer a good buffet. Sam's Town is $9 cheaper and the food quality is just as good.
