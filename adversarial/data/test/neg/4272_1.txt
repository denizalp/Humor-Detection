We got quotes from several pool companies in regards to cleaning our DE filter. His was by far the most reasonable. Rick showed up on time and cleaned our filter which hadn't been cleaned in over 1 year.  We were impressed enough with his work to use them as our regular weekly maintenance. Rick was extremely polite, immaculate and professional.  Every time I needed to contact Rick by phone, text or email, he was very quick at getting back to me and I know that our business relationship has started off to a good beginning.
