This review is long overdue, I should have made this review so long ago! This place has been the best place I've been to for my eyebrows in such a long time. She was friendly and gentle when it came to threading my eyebrows. She always asks how I want my eyebrows and if I want them trimmed. I never had to make appointments for my eyebrows and the service is pretty quick. I would recommend this place to anyone getting their eyebrows done and I cannot wait until I come back to Toronto just to get them done by her!
