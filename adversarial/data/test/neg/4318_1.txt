I was desperate. My nails were so grown out because I had been ill and hadn't been able to get in for a fill. I work until 5:30pm. I had social engagements that weekend. I googled and ended up here, knowing they probably wouldn't be able to fit me in at the last minute. They asked me to come back at 7pm. I did. They still weren't ready for me. But this was my last chance to get them done before next week. I wish I knew the name of the gentleman that did my fill. He was charming, patient and very funny. In fact, I noticed everyone, staff and customers alike, were chatting and laughing. How refreshing. The customer next to me said she had been coming there for years, and loved it there. I and another customer were there 45 minutes after closing, but staff stayed on and took their time to be sure we were happy. The icing on the cake? Not only did he just remove the loose acrylics and painted acrylic over the top of my real nails and made them look so much more natural than the thick acrylics, they charged me less than any other place I have ever been. I will be making appointments from now on. Three minutes from my house, I have found my new nail salon home. Thank you, Vien!!!
