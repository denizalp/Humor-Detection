Was not expecting such a great experience! While the food is expensive it's worth it! $30 for steak and potatoes, $7 for the tomato soup with mini grilled cheese. $16 for veggie and hummus platter. All are shown in pic. There was only one chicken option that was not the breast, so vegetarian was the way for me. My man on the other hand said that steak was the best he'd ever had. Our waiter was very attentive, and suggested the cheesecake over the creme brûlée, which ended up being very good. I asked when coming back how much the little grilled cheeses were since they were AMAZING and they are $3 each. Paired with the tomato soup they're so good. Excited to go back!
