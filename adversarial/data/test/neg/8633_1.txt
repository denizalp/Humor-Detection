While the store is quite amazing and the sales staff super friendly, the couch I bought was absolutely disappointing. It was nothing like the floor model I sat on. It was hard as a rock- to the point my body actually hurt sitting on it. I bought Saturday evening and called first thing Sunday to make a return. I was charged a restocking fee- which I would have been completely fine with if the furniture was anything like what I expected. I don't think anyone purchases a couch thinking \"great! I can't wait to get it home and feel more comfortable laying on the floor than on my new couch!\" But, that is what I got from here. So, I guess I will stick with decor and tables from living spaces, but pass on the sectionals as they are not true to what you test out on the showroom floor.
