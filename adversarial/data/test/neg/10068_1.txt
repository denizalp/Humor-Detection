My family loves Los.  We have been coming here for years.  The food is good and affordable.  In all the years we have been ordering from them, they have never gotten our order wrong.  It is always exactly the way we order it.  You can't say that about many places these days.  My only gripe with then is that when they are busy, they never answer their phones.  Not only is that not great service, they are giving money away by not being able to take orders.  Not a great business model if you ask me.  Other than that, we are definitely fans.
