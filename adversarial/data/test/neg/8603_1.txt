We saw Jim Gaffigan's Noble Ape tour Friday night (HE IS HYSTERICAL!) at the Wolstein Center. As much as we loved Jim's show (he had us roaring with laughter to the point of tears!), this venue left much to be desired. Firstly, the entry into the venue left hundreds of us waiting outside until almost 20 minutes after the listed start time of the show. Their ticket processing was incredibly slow, and it was quite understaffed. Once we got inside, my husband stopped at the first concession stand to buy a beer: sold out. But they told us a new keg would be coming soon, so we waited with many other people. The more people lined up waiting for the keg, we heard stories of how the entire venue was sold out of beer already, and everyone was waiting for the guy to arrive with the keg. I'm glad I was drinking water! Eventually the keg did arrive, but we missed almost all of the opening act by this time (now 50 minutes after the stated start time). When we found our section, the complete absence of stair lighting and aisle marking made it extremely difficult to find our seats. We hope Jim returns to Cleveland soon, but not at the Wolstein Center -- unless they address these issues. \nHot pockets...
