Fairly empty on weekdays (except Tuesdays). Underground parking is a bonus. \n\nVenue: 4\/5 Well spaced seats.\nService: 5\/5 Never had a problem\nEnvironment: 5\/5 Like any Cineplex. New everything.\nWashrooms: 4\/5 Clean and rarely a wait.\nWorth it?: 5\/5 Great time. \n\nI like this theatre. There is usually plenty of parking and underground is great for hot summer days, winter storms and raining days. The place is still very new so the seats are all in working order.\n\nThe thing I have noticed is that it stops showing movies faster than Fairview and Yorkdale. \n\nA few places to eat outside for a before or after snack. For sure my favorite theatre. Location is great.
