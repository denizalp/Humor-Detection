This St. Louis is really close to the Dave and Busters and IMAX Cineplex which makes it a great location. I've been here once before on a Wednesday and we couldn't get seats (I assume it was due to the half-price game Wednesday deal at Dave and Busters). I came again on a Sunday before watching a movie at Cineplex and thought their service was really fast. \n\nOur wings and appetizers came out within 15 minutes and we were done eating in 30 mins. Super satisfied with the timing because that left us with more than enough time to head to our movie. I also find that this location gives a decent amount of wings (unlike some locations which give you only very little wings).
