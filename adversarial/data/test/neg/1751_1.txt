We went with Rhino's maid based on a referral from a friend and we were very pleased. We had Geo and Angelica come for a 4.5 hour deep clean. They were running late but the office called in advance to inform us. When the ladies arrived they asked us what we wanted them to focus on then they got right to work. They worked diligently and we were amazed at just how much they did - kitchen, bathrooms, floors, dusting, blinds, windows, and more! No small feat in a 3500 sq ft house! They made our kitchen sparkle, our appliances look brand new. They even cleaned out the microwave and toaster! We were so impressed we have scheduled them to come once a month.
