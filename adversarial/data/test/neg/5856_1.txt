I was recommended by a close friend to go to Ron: an older, good humored, friendly man who made doing our taxes incredibly easy! Went into the office and was immediately greeted by Peggy at the front desk (who was even extremely nice on the telephone prior) showed us to free coffee and drinks before she paged Ron who came up in and led us to his \"cube\" as he calls it and makes you comfortable, he is quick proficient and explains it so it's fool-proof. Got me a great refund and made taxes actually painless and somewhat enjoyable. As long as I'm in Las Vegas I will be coming back every year! \n\nUpdate: Ron actually called a few days after to thank me again for coming in and to have a good day! Now THAT is great customer service!
