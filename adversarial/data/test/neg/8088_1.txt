My friend and I ate here Saturday (during the Art Festival) and the food was ok, not bad but not OH MY GOD good either. When we got there we were seated immediately and waited, and waited. Then other people started to be seated and waited on before us, needless to say, that wasn't making points. Finally our server came and took our order and we finally got something to drink!
