This is my new favourite dessert spot! I absolutely love their mango bingsu. I love that they use shaved milk versus shaved ice. Every time I come here I usually split one with my husband. Then one day we decided to get our own, and it was the only time we got super sour mangoes...totally ruined it for us...but I guess the mangoes they had that week weren't ripe. I can only go when they first open. If I try to come in the evening, it is way too packed. The decor is absolutely beautiful and the cashiers have always been friendly.
