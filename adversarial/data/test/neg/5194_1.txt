Spilled water on my MacBook Air so I found All About Mac and decided to give them a try. My suspicion was that only my battery needed to replaced since it worked when plugged into a power source, so they opened up my laptop, installed a test battery and verified that my suspicion was correct. They offered to replace the battery, but they suggested waiting 2-3 weeks before replacing the battery in case anything else goes wrong due to water damage. I thought that's a good idea so I waited. \n\nSo far so good. \n\nAfter 3 weeks when I was ready to replace my battery, they just refused to return my calls. I got through to them once and they said they'd order the battery, but never ended up calling to say it arrived. I kept trying to call them (I desperately needed a functional laptop again), but I never heard from them again. \n\nI'm torn in this review because they were super friendly and helpful in-store, but had absolutely zero follow through after initially meeting them.
