Good beer, good food, good service.  I always believe those are the pillars to a good restaurant experience and Brews Brothers hits the mark on all three.  I've been there several times over the last six months and each visit was a pleasant time.\n\nThey have an excellent selection of tap beers, with a good 5-10 of each variety and they change them often.  I recommend getting one of their flights; they're only $10 for four reasonably sized beers.  From chocolate porters, to dogfish ipas, to belgian ales, you'll find your favorites and probably enjoy sampling stuff outside of your comfort zone.  They have a brews brothers loyalty program too so you can get points towards freebies down the road.\n\nThe food choices desperately need to be expanded and improved upon, but I will give them credit in a few areas.  The potato chips are freshly skinned and seasoned, giving them a nice mixture of chewiness and crunchiness as you work your way through the basket.  The burgers are delicious, they use fresh meat from Knoche's which is a local butcher shop that has been in Madison since I was a kid and is well known for their quality.  I like that Brews Brothers gets creative here, with offerings such as jalapenos and cream cheese, cajun seasonings, slaw and bbq, and various forms of scrumptious bacon.  I think if you're getting some food, I'd recommend the burgers most of all.  Besides that, there isn't much else you even can get, aside from the pub grub which is popular but not my favorite.  It's chips with a ton of extras thrown haphazardly in the mix, almost like a loaded nachos plate.  But don't take my qualms into it if that's usually your jam, as I seem to be alone in that opinion.\n\nOur service has routinely been friendly, welcoming us as we walk in and all happy smiles.  We've had several long conversations with staff and bartenders and they made us feel right at home with a nice down to earth attitude.  That's huge to me, I don't think you can get that kind of service at many places and it's one of the reasons Brews Brothers has quickly grown to be one of my frequent kick-back spots in Madison.  Just a great place to have a few beers, TVs to watch sports or shows, etc.  Prices are incredibly reasonable too for just about anything on the menu, usually $10 or less.\n\nMy only gripes are the menu selections I mentioned, the atmosphere, and the newer servers.  We went once or twice where the person serving didn't seem to be too aware of what was available or attentative, but it was very busy with a big sports game going on and I think the server was both new and overwhelmed.  Easily something that will improve over time and far from the norm.  The atmosphere is just a big room with TVs and tables, not a lot of decor or things to look at.  Almost feels like a spruced up room in a house somewhere.  But, where they lack in that area they make up for it everywhere else and I imagine as they get on their feet this will also improve.\n\nHighly recommend a visit.  Just think of that long work day where you need a cold one after and some relaxation time and Brews Brothers (Mr. Brews) has got you covered
