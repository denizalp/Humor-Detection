This place is great! No frills, no wacky stuff, just tables and chairs and good sushi. I am a huge supporter of family owned and operated small businesses. The family that runs JK is awesome, they are very sweet and want nothing but for you to enjoy your food and visit. This is a perfect example of what we need more of in Phoenix. Go check them out, small intimate dinning area and great sushi!\n\nI did take one star off because of the menu, it is put together very awkwardly(literally) and confusing.
