Since I live near the Danforth I love supporting businesses around the area and I'm so glad I found this gem. They don't have the old uncomfortable massage chairs that you may be used to at a nail salon but the salon is SOO clean. The stainless steel tubs to soak your feet in are a great modern and clean touch! \n\nI go for manicures and lash extensions and always leave happy! (The free shoulder massages are a big plus!) \n\nI recently discovered that they have \"happy hours\" a special for each day of the week and will be back often!
