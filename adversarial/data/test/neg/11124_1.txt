These apartments are wonderful! The owners are quick to respond to any issue and always helpful with repairs when needed. The grounds are always beautiful and well-kept. They are also some of the most affordable apartments in the area, which is always a plus. My husband and I have been here for six months now and plan to stay for much longer. \n\nOur neighbors here are quiet and everyone we run into as we walk around are really nice and fun to talk to. They are also very pet friendly here and have a little  enclosed dog park for dogs to run around.   You get one covered parking space per apartment and we have two cars but there have always been enough visitor spots for our other one. \n\nWhen we moved in we had a few repairs with a door that wouldn't always shut and a microwave handle that needed replacing, along with some minor cracks on the oven's control panel, and each issue was addressed immediately and repaired. \n\nWhen we were looking at reviews of this place we had mixed feelings but everything we have experienced here has been perfect. I would definitely recommend this place.
