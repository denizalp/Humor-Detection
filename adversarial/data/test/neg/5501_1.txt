Dishonest beyond belief. I went here after getting a coupon in the mail for a cheap oil change and I am in awe at how I was lied to. I was told there were problems that just arent there and went to an honest shop looking to have the problem repaired and was told the problem didnt exist at all and I was lied to by these people. I was suspicious when they told me the parts were $500+ and I googled the parts and they cost $100 which is why I sought out a second opinion. I wouldnt go to a Meineke ever again after this and will warn anyone I can to avoid this one in particular.
