For what you get for the money its worth it. they take you on a party bus which is nice and you club hop, you skip the lines (all the lines were long), the free drinks are coolers and cheap champange, if you really know how to party, you should pregame before hand and skip this. Also find out which clubs they are going to. you dont have to do the full tour you can get off and stay where you like. the only thing i didnt care for was how the guide pressured you to tip. so if you go have change otherwise you will be dropping a 20 spot. it was worth it and i would do it again and have a smaller bill other than a 20, because per person that adds up!
