I went there on a Friday evening and there was no line. I was in and out of there in a matter of 15 minutes. I was a new customer and they processed me instantly. They drew three viles and it was clean and painless.\n\nGreat service! No line, fast processing. Clean & painless shots.\n\nHighly recommended. Five stars.
