Drive through is atrociously bad and inaccurate.\n\nI always order a combo without a bun, small chili (I take out the beans) and a coke zero. I cannot have sugar or a high number of carbs so I stick to this. \n\nUnfortunately, whenever I order the burger without the bun, the restaurant refuses to put mayo and ketchup that the burger is supposed to come with on the burger without the bun. Even if you specifically ask for it, they refuse to do it. \nToday I ordered the same thing, asking for the sauces on the burger, but again nothing. No sauces at all.\n\nNot only did this happen, but they gave me a regular coke instead of coke zero. Now I can't have any carbs at all for the rest of the day because of this. Not only was my meal for the day ruined, but my meals for the rest of the day as well. \n\nAll the drive through has to do is take a breath and listen to what the customer has to say instead of constantly rushing the customer. \n\nIf you're allergic to large amount of sugar, diabetic or have any kind of dietary restrictions, DO NOT go to this location. They WILL add whatever you cannot have into the meal.
