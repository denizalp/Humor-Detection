Came here on a Saturday night and it was crackin!! Design was great and filled with gorgeous women. \n\nCame here during a time when the pool wasnt open but the scene was awesome none the less. Bottles are a bit expensive but for a group of 10 guys, it was expected. We just didnt expect to buy 4 more bottles AFTER we destroyed 2 already! hey what can we say, nothing to complain about when there's gorgeous women and tons of alcohol? Perfect night. \n\nMusic was all house so not really my cup of tea but I heard they play hiphop on some nights? Blah just my luck.\n\nONLY negative thing about it is that one of our party member got a bit drunk and started dozing off in OUR section but security asked\/escorted him to leave. Protocol but damn seriously? We just spent almost 6K here. But totally understandable and overall the night was a success. \n\nOh if you are to ever get a table, Andrei hooked it up and got a couple of our girls in for free with no wait when they came late.
