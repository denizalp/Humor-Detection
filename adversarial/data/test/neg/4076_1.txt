I can't sing the praises of this staff enough. They know all the regulars by name and drink. They are always friendly even when people are demanding and cranky towards them. I've had the occasional mishap with my drink, but nothing that wasn't fixed without a smile.. I love this place. I love these people. I could name names.. but they're all wonderful- which is why people choose Starbucks- the baristas!! \nThe new blonde espresso is yummy! \nMy preferred drink: blonde doppio with steamed cream- for here please !!
