This branch is a joke. I made an order and put a deposit to get a wedding band here. But I did with a sales that's on his last day. I waited for a few months and there were no calls to pick up the ring. So i went there to check the status. Apparently no one follow up with the order. This was after a few months!! They later found out they got the ring but it was wrong style. No one knows what's going on. No one knew what my order is nor the style of my ring. My receipt has printed the exact number and exact style. We asked to talk to the manager to figure this out. All the manager said was she didn't know what's going on, she then blames her employees, threw them under the bus, said she will yell at them after work. As a client, I do not want to know what you want to do with them. All I want is my ring. She did not do anything to compensate my lost time. After, all they wanted to do is to give me the refund and be done with. If you are doing a professional business you are supposed to help the client not brush them away. If I didn't plan to get this ahead of time, I would be screwed on my wedding. They later made promises to follow up with my order and call me back. Nope. I didn't hear back from them. So STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.
