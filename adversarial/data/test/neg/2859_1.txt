I highly recommend this place. They have the upmost integrity and are great at their craft. I brought in 2 bridesmaid dresses to be altered and paid in advance. I called 2 day to ask if they could only do one dress. They not only refunded me for the dress I didn't have altered, but did an amazing job on the other. I will recommend them any day of the week. Great job Gemme and thank you. #Chandler #seamstress #fashion #sewing
