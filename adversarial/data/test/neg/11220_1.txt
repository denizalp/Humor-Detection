I am so pleased that I followed the Yelp reviews and tried this gem of Asian Culinary Delights!  Large portions (which I didn't need) and good taste.  Prices just right too.  The Dry Rub Beef Chow Fun was very tasty and had wide flat noodles with just the right amount of sauce and beef strips with onions and peppers.  The Won Ton soup was also tasty with all kinds of meat and noodles swimming around in a light broth.  The restaurant itself was very clean and neatly setup.  I carried out but did wait a few minutes for my order so I was able to observe others eating.  The server was attentive and friendly to the customers and also me.  All my food tasted fresh and very hot.  I'll go back again next week when I return to Glendale!!  \nAnd they accept all major credit cards definitely a plus for me since my employer uses AMEX and many Asian restaurants don't take it.\nThanks Yelp!
