The three star rating is quite fair as service is very sweet and warm, and cupcakes are okay\/good. Having gone to a few famed cupcake establishments at the prime of the great cupcake craze, if i must be honest, I'll have to say that baby cake's selection today was rather limited and uninspired. Where were the pretty little cupcakes pictured in previous yelp posts? Where's the whimsy? I picked out a red velvet today which was moist and good, not bad, but not all that special in cake or icing. For two dollars a pop, the icing could have used a bit more effort in piping. Looking forward to give them another try if other reviews show that this was just a weird day.
