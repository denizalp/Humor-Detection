After a night of bar hopping, we finally arrived at Baldwin Barmacie where they actually had legit drinks. Everywhere else in MTL was watered down or syrupy crap, but here they were actually really well made drinks with a great balance of alcohol and great depth of flavor. The service was great as well and we were able to get a comfortable seat easy enough after waiting for a few minutes, even though it was the \"busy\" part of the night. Definitely try the Bourbon Punch and their Old Fashioned since both are superbly made.
