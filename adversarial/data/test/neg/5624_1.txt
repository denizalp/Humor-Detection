Quick and Friendly service!  \n\nI work near here and whenever I need a quick Thai fix, I come to King & I.  If you dine in, you would see that they have a lot of regulars here.  I always try to squeeze in a quick lunch with my main squeeze here.  As a matter of fact, this time around I ordered ahead of time, to have more QT with him over lunch.  When we got in, it looked a little busy, but our table was already set up with our food and drinks...WOW!! Soon as we sat down, they came by to ask if we would like anything else to drink other than our water that was already there.  \n\nWe shared a papaya salad at its spiciest level, they gave me spice levels of 1-4.  I said 3 and it had just enough kick to it.  Papaya salad was very fresh and it was also served with lettuce on the side too.  \n\nJesse N and I both had lunch specials.  I had Shrimp Pad Thai, he had Beef Panang Curry.  Lunch specials are about $7.95-$9.95 a plate.  Served with Won Ton Strips, Eggroll, Salad, Rice and your choice of entree.  Great deal for the price, I'm stuffed writing this review!  My Pad Thai was great tasting, not as spicy as I would like it, but then again, I was so hungry that I didn't even ask for my spices to make it spicier to my liking.  LOL, so yes, spicy wasn't there but that is an easy fix.  I had about 3 big sized shrimps in my Pad Thai, that may sound like a few pieces, but it was the whole shrimp, not shrimp that is all chopped up to say you had shrimp on your plate, and I like to portion out my meat with my fork full of carbs, and it matched up decently.  Tasted the Panang and that was actually flavorful.  I usually don't like panang, but King and I's version is yum!!\n\nThey also give UNLV students a discount, College Students, that's a score...its conveniently located near campus.
