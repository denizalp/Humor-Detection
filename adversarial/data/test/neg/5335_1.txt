Comparing to Chipotle?  Sure, similar atmosphere.  Food?  Waaay better and truly delicious - after I had the enchiladas, I had to try the rib taco, which was awesome.  Value?  Some reviews say it's pricey, but these same people ought to call Chipotle pricey as well, since they are in the same ballpark.  Personally, I thought it was a good value, especially considering how tasty it was and some of the options available.  As far as service goes, I think they must have kicked into gear, because the counter people were friendly and helpful.  Every new business has its growing pains and maybe that is what a few reviewers experienced a few months ago, but I was personally very satisfied with this place, and glad I tried it.  Definitely will be returning soon.\n\nSide note - to the person that said $1 for guacamole was too much - I hope you realize it's $1.80 extra at Chipotle, and try to make your own guac for cheaper...people do have to make some kind of profit, whatever measly amount they get from your $1.
