I liked this little drive thru....I used to go to it when it was Saxby's and hadn't been there in awhile.  My husband and I stopped thru on a Sunday morning.  The drive thru was fast and easy, as to be expected.  Our drinks were good...my husband loved his white chocolate mocha.  I liked my chai tea latte...it was a little spicy for my normal liking.  The prices are very comparable to Starbucks or Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf.\n\nMy favorite Mad House Coffee location is near Desert Breeze Park on Durango...the owner has a French Bulldog that looks just like mine and the seating outside is really nice.
