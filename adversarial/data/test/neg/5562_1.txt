Location is good. they have interesting sushi combinations. It's enjoyable for its flavors, but not good for a meal to fill up. Good place to bring a date, ambiance is well lit. But menu is definitely on the pricy side. The dollar menu is just one sampler sushi (which I feel is still overpriced for the amount). Overall not your traditional sushi place. They have very creative items, so that's a plus, but a lot of it contains fried portions. Guess that's why the call it \"asian fusion\" food.
