I first stayed at the Rumor Hotel for my birthday celebration in September of 2012. Lets just say three years later, this place is not the same. The decor is trendy, but very worn down. The whole place could really profit from a can of paint! Let me first start my list of complaints by saying the door jams to the entrance to my room and bathroom where both busted! I had to literally slightly lift both doors in order to completely shut them. The AC was slightly out of commission and would only blow air on the LOW setting... I was accommodated with a portable fan and told to keep the curtains drawn. Anybody whom has ever visited Vegas in July is aware temperatures can easily reach 110. Probably the most annoying thing was my room key refused to work longer then 20 minutes. Every time I left the hotel and attempted to get into the room, I couldn't. It became routine for me to visit the front desk before hand. The only reason this establishment is deserving of even one star, is the staff. They where always kind and attempted to work around these \"known\" issues. All in all saving a few bucks isn't always worth it, and no I will not be staying ast the rumor ever again.
