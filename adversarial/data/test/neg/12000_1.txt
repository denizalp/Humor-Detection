Bought a groupon for this place. LOVED the atmosphere and food was fresh and delicious. All locally grown thrown together in a delicious sandwich. The only reason why I gave 4 stars is the price. Sandwiches range from 10-15.00 and everything is ala carte so it could cost over 20.00 for lunch. It is however very tasty and worth a treat every now and then. Beautiful pecan tree groves shops and local artists are on display here. Great place to bring the family and picnic.
