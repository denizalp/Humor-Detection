So I am the maid of honor, not the bride, but from the experience we had here I would highly recommend finding a dress here and then getting it altered elsewhere. \n\nThey have a great selection of dresses, you need an appointment. The service is just OK, and from other experiences in boutique shops I'm afraid to say this was the worst. Usually you are pampered and treated with interest and care (isn't this one of the reasons of not using a huge bridal store?) but here I would say we were treated more like a number than a customer.\n\nOur alteration service was subpar at best and management didn't quite seem to care. We came in for multiple appointments feeling nothing had been done since the last one, (and they admitted that was the case) so why did we even come in? Then a week before the wedding when we were promised certain things would be done, we show up and nothing was ready or done! They make us come in AGAIN and the things that should have been done are now done, but it needs to be pressed. We come in for the final fitting and the bustle is still up and there are creases in the front, but are assured it was pressed. Really? On top of EVERYTHING the seamstress loudly pointed out during a fitting that weight had been gained and we would need to take the dress out and went on to ask \"Just how much weight had she gained\" ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Obviously we are aware but it is not to you to point this out or make her feel bad for it. We left half of the fittings crying and the bride is a VERY reasonable bride, and hasn't been emotional at any other point of the wedding planning. \n\nTwo stars for the dress and dress selection.
