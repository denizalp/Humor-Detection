Yay!\n\nThis is a gorgeous garden. I could've spent hours and hours here; unfortunately, it started raining heavily while I was here and I had to cut my visit short.\n\nI love the ponds with the countless lilypads and the lovely walking paths. I do wish there was some better signage in the gardens, but maybe I'm just an idiot that can't follow directions.\n\nThere were three Patrick Dougherty installations while I was there, which was a lot of fun for me because I've only seen his work in urban environments and to me it looked oddly out of place surrounded by greenery even though it's nature-inspired.\n\nI highly enjoyed myself and would willingly go again. I wish I'd been there for the crazy topiaries (because it reminds me of Te Fiti from Moana).
