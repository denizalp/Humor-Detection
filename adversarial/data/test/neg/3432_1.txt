My little piggies and fingers were in for a treat! And so was the rest of my body - no, I didn't get a massage, but this place... the ambiance was upscale, relaxing and trendy (fruit-infused water, anyone? Iced tea? Hot tea? Keurig coffee?). My expectations were high the moment I stepped in the salon.\n\n1.5hrs later, it turned out to be only an okay experience. \n\nThe salon is very time-oriented, as opposed to task-oriented, i.e., they'll do the best that they can to prettify your nails within your appointment time, which in my case was 1.5hrs (45min each for mani\/pedi). This could work for people who are on a tight schedule, but I'm not sure if I really like that...\n\nAlso this is a $$$ salon. Little piggies and fingers did come out nice and pretty, but I couldn't really tell it apart from my $ task-oriented Asian nail salon -- which might not have all the fufu, but at least I get to keep the extra $$ for the same quality! Or buy my own refreshments? \n\nI probably won't be coming back here unless I get bribed, but I will definitely recommend this place to friend$$$.
