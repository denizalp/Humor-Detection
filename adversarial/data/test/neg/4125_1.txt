So far we are in the lobby and it's clean has lots of toys and reading material. Only one other family is here in the waiting room. \nThe doctor was awesome very informative. The waiting room was filling up when we left. What a great first dentist experience for our 19 month daughter! Walk into the room and it's got the fish theme throughout nice friendly staff. Bubbles and they don't rush you out. They take the time to answer you questions give you good information. \n\nSo highly recommended for a small child and infant ! Our pediatrician suggested we have our daughters teeth looked at before she turned two ! \nWe are glade we did. clean bill of health from the dentist all her teeth are coming in great! \nWe will recommend this place to everyone! \n\nJust a heads up our daughter screamed while they looked at her teeth but they make it fast and as painless as possible !!! Lol poor girl she got over it right away!\n\nFacility is clean, fun, and enjoyable.
