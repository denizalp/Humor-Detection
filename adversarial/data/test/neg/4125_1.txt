Excellent work by Sam's team on our bathroom remodel. His showroom made our choice of finishes easy. He was always available for questions and to provide practice updates. He recommended additional work (recessed lighting and minor upgrades to 2nd bath) for very minimal fees. I'm extremely pleased with the result and would highly recommend Pelleco!
