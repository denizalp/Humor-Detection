It's been awhile since going to a Chiropractor.  In going to Mt. Island last week I've realized how important it is to always have your spine in an alignment for optimal health.  My lower back pain has lessen greatly and I'm looking forward to my next appointment.  Professional and educational! If you want to be in your best health start with getting your nervous system talking clearly it does make a difference. Thank you very much Dr. Knutson! He also has an Massage Therapist Scott Heath LMBT-very convenient. I highly recommend going!
