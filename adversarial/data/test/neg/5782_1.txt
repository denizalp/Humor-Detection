Yum Yum and more Yum!\n\nGosh...219 reviews? What more can I add?? All I can say is this is a MUST if you visit Vegas. The food is delish...especially the crab legs and kobe beef. Their dessert buffet is huge too. Sucks they ran out of chocolate covered strawberries. =(\n\nTip: The line on a weekend can get very long. I suggest you go there early or ask someone to wait in line for you. You can't be seated until you pay for everyone in your party.
