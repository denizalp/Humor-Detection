Jun's was a surprise to me. I had not known of any decent Korean places that would serve bbq for a good price. It was a breath of fresh air to know that there is one nearby my place (although, they are going to open one off of Eastern called Tiger Grill very soon near Richmar\/Eastern). Jun's is more of a fast food Korean place. My friend and I knew that it should be good, since there were local Koreans (elder ones especially!) eating there. I ordered June's Special which included Kal-bi (BBQ Beef Rib), BBQ Chicken, BBQ Beef (Bulgogi), Meat Jun (Battered Beef), and the Man doo (fried dumpling). Generous portions! It was a lot for $10.95. You can even request the meal with brown rice for no extra charge, and it even comes with a salad to balance all that meat! In addition to the meal, if you eat in, you can get a few sides like kimchi, spicy cucumbers, bean sprouts, and even that cold potato stuff. I have yet to try their Spicy Tofu soup, the Bi Bim Bob, and the Jap Che! They even make sushi there, but I don't know if I would recommend it...\n\nIf you're craving for fast Korean bbq, you have to try Jun's! You will not be disappointed! (Btw, June's special is the highest price thing on the menu (next to Jun's Special Roll)! You can get combo plates with 2 meats like BBQ beef or Kal-bi for $8.95 or 3 meats for $9.95).
