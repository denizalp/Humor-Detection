I set aside my lifelomg hatred for the Packers (being from MN, go Vikes!!!) to write this fair and honest review. Packer Nation aside this place has a pretty good vibe. The bartenders are all attentive, competent, and attentive. The food is pretty much standard bar fare but its good and even better after youve had a few. I will say the younger waitresses can be pretty rude and unprofessional but thats pretty standard i suppose. They have a happy hour and reverse happy hour m-f, reverse happy hour saturdays, and all day happy hour sundays, half priced apps, pizzas, and wells are usually fair game and reverse happy hour offers shots and premiums for reduced price as well as some of the menu items. I frequest this establishment both as a pregame go-to before my inevitable Charlies appearance, and sometimes have so much fun I end up staying till close. Definitely recommemd, theres a mixed crowd here in every way possible and thats what makes it so fun.
