Knowing what I know, I should Know better. It has been a while since I have been to a restaurant like this. Logan's Roadhouse, Roadhouse Grill and Texas Roadhouse are all one in the same. There actually is some kind of extended founding member split apart and competed with one another type relationship. Anyway we went for lunch and I remembered pretty quickly \"Oh yeah I do not like these places\". Ribs were actually DRY. Yes Dry. They were tender just DRY. Baked potato was old. The texture was dry as if it was a re-heated potato..maybe it wasn't but it tasted and appeared as if it was. Ribs were not heated through. I know thy just grill them to finish them to order but they needed another few minutes on the grill. Caesar dressing tasted like ranch dressing. All in all..yeah yeah yeah the schtick of peanuts on the floor and meh food. If you think it is so great I am sure Olive garden and Red Lobster also appreciate your business. That does not make any of them good !
