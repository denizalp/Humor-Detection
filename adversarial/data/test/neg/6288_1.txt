Dined here last month as they were highly recommended. We arrived at 5:58pm and they had us wait for two minutes to open the restaurant. That was a little awkward but I guess they were not ready.\n\nAfter being seated the waitress seemed in a hurry to explain how to order. We had to ask her again when she came back. We ordered mushrooms, lamb kefta, lamb kabobs, shrimp kabobs, spinach & ricotta dumplings and scallops. We didn't order chicken kabobs but they comped us an order  because they were a little burnt.  My favorites were the mushrooms, spinach & ricotta dumplings and lamb kefta. The lamb kabob was dry and the scallops were undercooked. \n\nGreat ambience - lighting, music & decor.\n\nI would go back & try them again because the mushrooms, dumplings and lamb kefta were absolutely delicious!
