This was my first time going to this location of starbucks. I decided to go through drive-thru(since its supposed to be fast and convenient). I regret doing that. \nThe guy did not greet me, and asked straight up, \"what can i get for you today?\" I told him, \"2 tall Caramel Ribbon Crunch\" \nHe asked me \"what? Can u repeat please?\"\nI said \"sure, I said 2 tall Caramel Ribbon Crunch\". He said \"alright, pull up to first window, we'll have it ready for ya\" \nI pulled up to the window, it took him about 2-3 minutes to finish the conversation he was having with his co-worker. Then he finally decided to talk to me by saying,\"ma'am, can you please repeat your order, what was it?\" \nI kindly repeated it again. He said alright, and it literally took him 7 minutes. I could see from the window there was only ONE guest upfront(it was 9:38pm) it wasn't busy at all. While he was chatting with his female co-worker and trying to figure out how to put the lid on. When he turned to me with my order. The co-worker took it from him and said oh i made the wrong one. Then she took extra started making another one(i assumed) it took her ADDITIONAL 4 minutes!!! i drove away and pulled into the parking lot, got in there and asked the girl upfront \"what is the point of Drive-thru?\" I told her i had been waiting THAT long. She said \"Oh it doesnt happen that often, this guy is on training, what do you want me to do?\" \nI told her \"nothing, but this new gentlemen should have told me that 'ma'am, it will take couple minutes, sorry for the inconvenience' \" During my conversation with the cashier, the young girl who made my order turned around and rolled her eyes at me and raised her eyebrow then said to the new guy\"seriously? The order didnt take that long\"\ni ignored that because i didnt wanted to deal with all that and cause a drama in there so I got my order and went home. Turns out to be that the young girl made my order totally wrong and made Caramel Frappe instead of Caramel Ribbon Crunch. I'm so disappointed with their service and I will never go there again, ever! \nEmployee like this NEED to understand that they get paid because of the customers! Honestly, It was such a horrible experience because of employees with rebellious attitude.
