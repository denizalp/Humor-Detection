I'm generally not a fan of these types of places because they tend to be inconsistent with their food. That said, I wanted some food last night and it was late so I decided to try it. Got a chicken burrito, a couple beef tacos and churros. The burrito was very good and pretty big. Out of the two tacos, one was good the other was deep fried so hard that the meat turned crunchy and inedible. The churros were ok for fast food fare. I don't know if I'll be back but I wouldn't mind getting food from there again.
