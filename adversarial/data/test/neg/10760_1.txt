Booking: I requested an appointment last minute based on the glowing yelp reviews for this salon. I was pleasantly surprised to be accommodated quickly and they were flexible around my own limited availability. \nFirst impression: parking was a breeze. I was greeted by name! *bonus points* (even if it was obvious that I was the last person if the day, it's the extra stuff that counts.) Salon is cute & brightly lit. \nStylist\/Cut: My stylist, Candice was an absolute doll from the handshake to goodbye. She is so genuine & you can tell she is both confident and passionate about what she does. She included me in the process and inquired about my daily routine, something not many stylists do. Hair is a very personal thing for many women, myself included. So her attention to detail really mattered to me.\nTakeaway: I left feeling great about my cut and happy to have found my new \"hair person\"! I can honestly say, it was the best experience I've had at a hair salon in many, many years...if not ever. Thumbs up!
