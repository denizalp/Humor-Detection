So-so freshness on the fish.  Ordered the Spicy Hamachi with avocado and jalape√±o, but the sauce that came on it was not good... Seemed too overbearing for the fish and avocado.  Sashimi seemed like it had been around for a while... Tasted pretty bland and had a tacky feel, like a preservative wash had been used.  Service was good and place was relatively quiet... Service and ambiance getting higher marks than the food.
