This office is quick and efficient with the warmest and most knowledgable of staff. I immediately was greeted by the front desk with smiles and on both appointments waiting no longer than 5 minutes to see Dr. Smith. He was caring and not at all judgmental about my dental condition (which I have experienced by a previous Doctor). This place truly restored my faith in dentist offices!! Highly recommend!!
