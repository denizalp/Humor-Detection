So thankful I found this gem in Phoenix! Over the past year I have spent many $$$ getting my hair fried and chopped by several stylists. It wasn't until I found Lindsey that I felt fully listened to and was able to leave the salon feeling like the best version of myself.\n\nThe salon is so stylish and cool but not pretentious. Their hair color is pure magic and very gentle. They use the BEST products to wash and style my hair. Don't leave without getting the solid dry shampoo. I received a sample in my birchbox and it is a game changer!\n\nThanks Lindsey for making me feel beautiful! I refuse to see anyone else for my hair needs!!!
