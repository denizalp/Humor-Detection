Very eco friendly, and efficient equipment in a clean environment.  Very friendly, prompt service explaining the machines operation. This place was a lifesaver when our block lost power from Hurricane Sandy. We also take all of our oversized items here. The owners have a passion for good customer service that I really appreciate. Nice job!
