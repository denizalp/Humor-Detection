I think that something I have to keep in mind when writing this review is that, due to my intense appreciation for the yelp community, I was already aware from previous reviews that I might feel overcharged for the portions at Butcher & The Brewer. \nWhile I might say this place gets 5 stars for their bar alone (reasonably priced, great beer), the fact that the rest of the experience (and the food) isn't as accessible (re: high prices, small portions) makes it hard to award the elusive 5 stars, top-of-the-line review. In fact, the ordering experience and food prices left me thinking 3 stars, so an average of 4 sounds about right. \n\nHere are my thoughts:\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my experience which consisted of beer and a charcuterie board at the bar. It was a bit loud, but the other patrons were friendly, and there was a wide selection of [silent] TV channels on the big screens above the bar. \n\nI really enjoyed their beer selection. While the bartender seemed uninterested in telling me about the beers (bummer), she was nice enough about letting me taste a few in order to make a decision. I tried the Hasselhefe, Framboyzee, and Spice Spice Baby (their holiday\/christmas\/winter beer). The Hasselhefe was mild, and a little bit sweet- I could see it being very popular on a hot day. I was not thrilled with the framboyzee- it was fruity, but lacked the tart and funky the description promised. The Spice Spice Baby was by far the best- spicier and smoother than the Christmas Ale from Great Lakes, for sure. I also tried their Gourdy (the Pumpkin beer equivalent) and was unimpressed- the spice was there, but it was lacking all things pumpkin.\n\nAs far as the Charcuterie board goes- get it. Just get it. For one person, it can basically be a meal. Not only do you get the cheese\/meat, but mine came with some great mustard, honey, and pear compote that complimented the different meats and cheese and amazing toasts and buttermilk crackers. Strongly recommend the chicken liver mouse. The only downside was the bartender's informing me that the menu online isn't accurate; it appears the online menu includes all of the possible options, only about 1\/3-1\/2 of which were available or on that day's menu. While I missed the buratta, the board I got was still pretty good.
