I used to go here often for pedicures because I love the herbal scrubs.  Some of the techs were better than others,  but I never had a horrible experience with them.  The owner Frank, is the reason I haven't been in months and don't plan on returning.  He is rude and rushes you in and out.   The last time I called to get my husband and I in for pedicures the same evening, he says to be there in 10 minutes.  I tell him I live more than 10 minutes away,  and now I have to stop at an atm to get cash for tip because you won't accept tips on credit cards anymore.   He says ok, get here as soon as you can.   10 minutes later as we are 5 minutes from his shop, he's calling my cell harassing us about why weren't there yet. That was the last straw.  I just hung up on him and never went back.   Pedicures, especially for the amount of money he charges,  should not be stressful.
