Came to the bar to kill some time. At first glance I was suspicious and could see a lot of regulars.  After getting a beer from the friendly bar tender Stephanie, the owner came up and introduced himself. Really nice guy, a former Marine and a proud American. He made me feel at home, he really has a passion for the place. It's like it's his second home and makes everyone who comes in feel like family. After a couple beers my wife and I ordered some jalape√±o poppers and there were amazing!  There are a lot of bars out there but only a few make you feel the way you do here. Will be back soon.
