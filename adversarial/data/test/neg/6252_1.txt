This location is pretty close to my job. It's a very common choice for power lunches and spontaneous happy hours. When the place first opened up, the food was awesome (pretty common) but now.... meh. I mean it's not bad but as my dad would say - It's nothing to write home about.\n\nI love their secret bar menu (it's not really that secret - you just have to ask for it) I used to order the burning roll each and every time I stopped by but nowadays - it's not as tasty as it used to be. I heard great things about their tortilla soup but when I finally ordered it --- it was just a bowl of veggies, a little broth with 3 pieces of tortilla chips and like - maybe 3 pieces of chicken??? Meh.\n\nNo matter what time of day I'm here, I always order at the bar. The speed of service is pretty darn good. I almost never have to wait more than 5 - minutes for my food - which is AWESOME if you're trying to get a good lunch hour in.\n\nHappy hour on fridays is always packed. The bar area isn't very big so when it's crowded it's - C R O W D E D.\n\nSo my final words are this, if you looking for something healthy and fast and you're in the area, then try it out. The food isn't life-changing but it's decent.
