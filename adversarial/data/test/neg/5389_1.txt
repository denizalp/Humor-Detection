This is one of the best places if what you're craving is authentic taste. When in the mood for tacos Asada and Al Pastor are our favorite. Please add Pi√±a- savory goodness! We've also ordered the Alambrado which is all their meats on one plate seasoned with the works and tortillas. Their salsas are very tasty and they have one for adventurous types which is super spicy. It's neon green. Their salsa bar also has limes, pickled onions, carrots cucumbers and cilantro, which is good for those picky eaters that don't want all the fixings to pick out. Every time I've been in here, place is clean, and staff is friendly. I don't understand why people hate on this place. Yea- it's not fancy, yeah-it's not cheap and the set up is funky as far as ordering. One comment talked about the small cups for the salsa- it's called a business- smart way to avoid wastefulness. Every time I wanted more Salsa- I got up and walked the 6 whole steps to get it. Winning. As far as prices- I get it $2 is steep for a taco, but they are quality, authentic and fresh. I'm happy for these guys and even happier to support a local business that started with a flat grill on Eastern and Bonanza when the sun went down. #tacosporvida
