Good, solid, upscale steak joint in Golden Nugget.  Old-school style and large portions.  Went in before a show and if its the weekend, better make reservations since its an institution.  The bone-in ribeye fed two us up with some left over.  The Caesar salad is one of the best in town.  service is attentive if a little rushed but activities are split up so you get lots of attention.  I do wish they had a little more room around the tables as its pretty cramp and gets loud and bustling.  Small compliant for an otherwise really good place downtown.
