The very basics of breakfast nothing extraordinary here. My trip would have been fine except I ordered hash-browns and instead got home fries. To make things worse when I asked the waiter about it she wanted to argue with me about wether hash browns and home fries were the same. Instead she could of said ok would you like something else instead. Oh well, I won't be back. If your in the mood for basic breakfast in a clean dining room with hit or miss customer service I dare you to check them out.
