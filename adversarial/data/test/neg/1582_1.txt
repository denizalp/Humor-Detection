Stayed there 6\/11\/17 - 6\/18\/17. The room was nice and clean. The ice maker didn't work in the refrigerator and was repaired within an hour.  Mid week towel replacement never happened until I called and requested it. Took about 1 1\/2 hrs. Parking can get a little difficult at night. You may have to drive around awhile to find a spot.  We were in Building 4 by the parking structure and it seemed like a long walk to get to the bigger pools or to South Point Casino. The staff were all friendly and professional. The resort had a lot of families yet it was pretty quiet. \n\nMy main complaint was the timeshare presentation. We exchanged for this timeshare to attend a wedding and decided to turn our stay into a weeks vacation. Upon check in we were turned over to a person to obtain our parking pass. She offered us a free gift to tour the property. We asked if it was a timeshare presentation and was told we would be in and out since we were already a timeshare owner. We felt pressured to attend, like it was a requirement to stay here. Needless to say it was High Pressure sales being turned over to 3 different people. After 3 hrs of this quick tour we had enough. The sales people  would not take no for an answer.  We were highly agitated and had to get mad to get out of there.
