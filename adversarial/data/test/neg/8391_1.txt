Orange, everywhere you look is orange.  And you can look everywhere as there are literally no bad seats here.\n\nThis is a great place to go to a basketball game.  Oh.  If you're an Illini fan.  People stand until both teams sink their first basket.  Everyone knows the words to the fight song and the alma mater.  And the Chief is remembered here as the proud symbol of a proud University.  \n\nAh, the memories!  I have been  attending games here since the '70's which is good and bad.  (Time to wipe tear of joy.)  Wait, we need to get back to the review.\n\nGood - lots of nostalgia, history and tradition in this venue.  LIke memorial stadium, local groups run the concessions and make money for the CU area.\n\nBad - with all of the history comes age.  This is certainly not the newest domed facility around.  The seats could be a little friendlier on the back.  (I didn't have this complaint in the 70s!)\n\nWe were just here last night and will be here a few more times this year. Why don't you join us?  Just remember to wear orange!
