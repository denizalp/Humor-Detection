Only giving two stars because I've found some good things here.\n\nThe store is pretty unorganized and makes clothes shopping difficult. It's a lot better now that they updated it because it was a trash pit before. However it's still not very clean. Theres always chunks of hair on the floor floating around, dirt, and left behind food and drinks from inside the mall.\n\nMajor thing to giving bad stars is the fact that everything that comes over the intercom even music is in Spanish. Last I checked we are in America, and as an English speaking American I would like to hear even just the regular radio station while shopping and be able to understand what they are even saying over the intercom. To be completely honest I have cut my shopping short and spent less money because everything is in Spanish.\n\nThey would probably save some sales by using a standard English music station.
