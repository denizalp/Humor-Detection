Our first time here from California.  We had the Sundance special with blackened chicken. Sooo good!!!  Rosey & the rest of the staff were great. We sat at the counter. It's great seeing how incredibly efficient everyone is during a busy Sunday brunch.  Kudos to all of you. We'll make sure to come back again.
