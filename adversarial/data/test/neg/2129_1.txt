Pickle Bill's is seriously the best place around this part of town to get all-you-can-eat crab legs! I come here every single summer and cannot wait to come back here again this summer. \n\nThe crab legs are fantastic, the wine is delicious and affordable and the vegetables\/side dishes are always served hot. Oh and you can't forget the doughy bread that they give you with cinnamon butter! It's out of this world. \n\nI'd say be sure to take your friends here on their birthday. They sing for them and give them an awesome mini cake!
