I've been here before a few years ago and don't remember it being as good.  That being said, on this occasion I had also just came from the Boulder City Beer Festival so I'm not sure if this is the beer talking or not lol.  Everybody always tells me how good this place is but I never have the opportunity to go unless I'm in BC.  This place is good though!  Giant portions of meat and potatoes, at least for what I got (1lb burger), great white sauce (whatever it is), small, divey type establishment but always packed to the gills both times I went.  It is definitely a locals hangout and a place where a lot of hikers go after a long day of exploring.  Check it out next time you're in BC, you may just like it as well!
