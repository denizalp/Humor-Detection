Wow, I can't believe I haven't reviewed MadCity yet. I've been to most of the music stores in town, and they're all pretty good (especially considering that in my neck of the woods now, my selection is limited), but I can confidently say that Madcity is the best. Madcity has a very good selection of vinyl albums, including 45s (which I almost never see anymore even in specialty music stores). There's also an extremely good collection of 60s CDs; most good record\/CD shops have plenty of the familiar hit-makers like the Beatles, the Rollings Stones, the Byrds, various Motown artists, etc. How many of them carry music by obscure 60s bands such as Love, or The Gurus? Also, their selection of progressive rock (i.e. Yes, Emerson Lake & Palmer) is very good as well. Contemporary stuff is in abundance here as well. If  you live in the Madison area you absolutely must come here, and even if you are just visiting the area... you still pretty much need to make a stop here if you are a music enthusiast.
