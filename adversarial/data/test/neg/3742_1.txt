Great place! Looks a little scary from the outside, but the food is excellent,.....not $100 per person formal steak house excellent,...more like local, homey feeling, neighborhood-y excellent.  The owner, Sarge, is a great guy. Food portions are plentiful, quality is excellent and prices are good.  Gyros are giant!!
