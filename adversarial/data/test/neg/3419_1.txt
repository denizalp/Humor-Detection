Ordered 1 dessert to go, I waited for 30 mins, the restaurant wasn't too busy, only 1 server was working so hard for dessert orders, while others were walking around and not helping. \n\nThe restaurant smelled so bad like curry and hot pot, my outfit was full of hotpot smell after waiting for 30 mins for my dessert. \n\nLastly, it's quite expensive for a dessert, will not be back again.
