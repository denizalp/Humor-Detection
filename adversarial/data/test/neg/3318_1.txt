I called Carpet Monkey because of the reviews! I just moved into a new home and discovered through the course of cleaning the walls in preparation for painting that there was dust everywhere! After the painting was done, I felt that a lot of it had gone into the carpet. As an aside, I replaced the carpet in the front part of the house with engineered hardwood, but the hallway and bedrooms section still retain the older carpet until I can afford to replace it at a later date.\n\nJoe came out, assessed that there were paint stains on some places on the carpet (yeah, I know. I was less than diligent in taping places that I'm replacing next year), and went to work.  The first thing I noticed was that everything smelled fresher! Yes,the carpets were very dusty, but not dirty. So that \"dusty\" smell went completely away. Joe went right to work and was done in about 45 minutes for about 600 sq ft of dusty carpet.\n\nGreat company. Happy with their work.
