Staff is very attentive and friendly. Great breakfast and environment. Place was pretty cold since we were one of the few first ones in on an expected hot day in Vegas. I had one of my breakfast faves - chicken fried steak and eggs. The hash browns, gravy, steak and eggs came out perfect. I'm very satisfied with my experience bring it's my first time eating in the area.
