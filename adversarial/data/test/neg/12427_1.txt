Some of the best quality meats and seafood you will find anywhere! Of course it's pricey, but then your paying for a much higher quality then Fry's or Safeway! Great Deli selection! One of the negatives is some of the fresh fruit they have to offer. The berries are always scarce, and not all that good....not to mention the price! Most of the time the employees are friendly and helpful, but occasionally you get one that is less then happy to wait on you....I guess they get tired of dealing with overly demanding people. I have had several of the pre-made dinners available.....fantastic food!
