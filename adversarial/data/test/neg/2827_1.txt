Ordered 1 paid cash waited 15 mins to check for my order girl said not yet; 10 mins later checked again both girls said no;  5 mins later I went up and told both girls I've been waiting and people who came after me are getting their orders;  they finally checked and they don't have my order.  No apologies and I asked for my money.  This took another 10 minutes as they don't know what to do ... I finally went to the back to asked if I'm getting my money.\n\nVery poor service; no communication, no apologies.  Wasted 40 mins in this place!
