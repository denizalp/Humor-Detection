Cute town nestled away behind Vegas. I happened to go when it was green and beautiful. Great little shops, not much parking (although Im sure not many people stop here), but cool little downtown. I would have given this a 4 star if the stores were a little less trashy. Worth the stop though on your way back from Hoover Dam
