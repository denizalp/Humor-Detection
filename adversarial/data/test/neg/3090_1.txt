I came to this vape shop for more liquid during the lunch hour because it was close to work. I looked at Yelp reviews first because some shops are iffy. \n\nThe staff is great here, and I felt more welcome here than any vape shop I've ever visited. The juice selection is huge, and the staff was willing to take their time and recommend the best flavors. Each time I come, they remind me to keep my receipt for a refund if something happens, but I've never had a problem with their products. Very impressed!
