Ordered 2 spicy sandwich meals.. with fries well done. Asked for ranch, Polynesian, chick fil a sauce & ketchup.. got none of them. Got a cherry coke and a regular coke... got a cherry coke and a Dr Pepper. Not only that but the chick at the window literally threw the bag in our faces and was rude as hell. I love all of my chick fil a experience but this one was absolutely terrible. Will never go to this chick fil a again!!
