Very good and inexpensive wood-fired pizzas. Humble Wine Bar's might be a little better but they're twice the price, and you can't beat the view here. Also they have Honey Hut ice cream now, so that's extra points in my book. Use the side door of the Marina building or enter through the Marina shop. They're open daily 11 a.m. - 8 p.m. during Memorial Day through Labor Day.
