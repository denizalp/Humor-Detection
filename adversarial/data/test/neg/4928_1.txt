Highly recommend this place for Chinese Dim Sum.  It is small, hidden away inside the Gold Coast Hotel and Casino.  Very well worth it to come and visit.  Their Dim Sum is so delicious.  I love all the foods there...chicken feet, hai cau, siu mai, dumplings, porridge, tofu, mango deserts, and on and on.   Seriously, who knew you can go to Vegas and get authentic Chinese Dim Sum.  Yummy!
