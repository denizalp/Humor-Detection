Wow.  Possibly the best BBQ that I have ever had, and I lived in Oklahoma for 8 years.  The chopped and sliced brisket were amazing - and the BBQ sauce was amazing as well.  Potato salad was decent, but I'm not the best judge of BBQ restaurant side dishes.  The smoked pecan pie was amazing as well.  Might have to wait in a line here, but it's well worth the wait!
