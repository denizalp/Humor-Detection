This is my favorite juice\/smoothie bar!! I come here all the time and have never had a bad experience or eaten anything I didn't like. The owners and staff are amazing and always so helpful and cheerful, even when the place is slammed. Anytime someone is new to the area or I hear that they haven't tried this place, I send them here. 5\/5 stars, HIGHLY recommend.
