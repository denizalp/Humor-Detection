Love this place!  Better than Aladdin's and they try to locally source as much as possible.  More affordable than Aladdin's also.  \n\nOnly negative is that they are very under staffed so you may end up waiting a while.\n\nWish they did smoothies and fresh juice like Aladdin's.  Then I would be a 100% convert.
