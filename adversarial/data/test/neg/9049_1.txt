Life changing experience.  Let's just say I was savoring my burps afterwards.  The prawns were so fresh and literally left me in awe.  The juices from the head coated my tongue with amazing flavors. The octopus was the best I've ever had. The tuna tar tar was very good but didn't really stand out for me. Heirloom tomatoes salad was divine and I don't even like tomatoes.  The mushrooms was the best I've ever had.  Service was OK. I expected a bit more for a $1k dinner for 5 but I think it was only the manager that was stuck up.
