New Vietnamese spot at yonge and weldrick. I have been twice with good and bad experiences. \n\nThe first visit I got the com bi with all the different meats, it was pretty good, small portion size from what I'm used to and the fish sauce (nuc mum)  was lackluster. Also never enough shredded pork! The egg quiche thing was quite small too. I also ordered the bubble tea out of curiosity. It was very good, the small is smaller than a regular bbt small sized cup. The tapioca is also lower in quality compared to most places. \n\nThe second visit I ordered the pad Thai which was very heavily made of tamarind.. It was way too tangy and not pad thai like at all. Maybe they made the wrong dish? Who knows. \n\nThe service is friendly, it's clean inside and the washrooms are also very clean! \n\nOverall pretty good but not the best. Would try other dishes in the future.
