I absolutely LOVE this restaurant.  The food tastes amazing every time I go and they can cater to my lactose free and gluten free diet.  Talk about amazing!  Today I ordered the Big Salad to-go.  It took about 15 minutes to get (this location is always super busy.  If you work in the area you can call ahead and pre-order your lunch so you don't have to wait.  Lunch wait times are usually about 45 minutes long.)\n\nAt Fresh they are very accommodating.  Since I couldn't eat the cheese the lady had the chef give me extra avocado.  I definitely would not complain about that.  I love avocado!  I also added Tofu to my salad so I would have extra protein.  The tofu was grilled and seasoned perfectly.\n\nI chose their Tahini Salad dressing and it was to die for.\n\nI highly recommend Fresh Restaurant.\n\nThey can also accommodate a kosher diet.
