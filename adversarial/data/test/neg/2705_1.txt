Not bad for a 4 dollar hot dog.  the bun was super delicious.  Bring your own catsup unless you want to spend 100 bucks for theirs.  lol.  Next time i want to try the brat with kraut.  That looks pretty good.  Also, \"sport peppers\", in case you're wondering, are little serrano peppers that are pickled and taste very much like pepperoncinis.  \n\nI'm betting she does a lot of early am business...\n\nIf she only made \"baja dogs\" then that'd be fantastic!!\n\nAnyway, i'll try the brat and update my review.
