I am so disappointed in myself that I didn't read any reviews before renting a car from ACE, because if I did so I wouldn't have rented a car here. When I first walked in it didn't give me any professional vibes. There weren't any greeting, there were two workers just talking to each other and all on phones, and one worker eating frito chips while she helps me. So as we finished up the process, we had a small discussion of the insurance fees etc. I've told her I have insurance and since I'm visiting from California can I have someone back home send a pic of my insurance card to show proof? After the discussion went on, she specifically said \"don't worry about it\" so I believed I was in the clear, not until I received a surprisingly $120 EXTRA for insurance charge. \n\nAnother issue I had, when I received the car I didn't realized there weren't any license plates on the car at all. That's not until a police officer stopped me to question me about it. However there was a slip in the front window to show proof that the car can be operated. It's was just irritating because who wants to go through that.
