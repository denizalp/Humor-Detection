I'll never visit this place with my money. I was required to come here by an employer for a pair of specialized shoes, but my personal income will go anywhere near this place. They have no sense of urgency. I placed my order FIVE WEEKS ago and they just sent it TWO DAYS ago. This is utterly ridiculous for a business. I even offered to pay for the rush shipping at the time of my first visit and I was told it wouldn't be that long. Five weeks is a pretty long time for shoes that the manufacturer has on the shelf.
