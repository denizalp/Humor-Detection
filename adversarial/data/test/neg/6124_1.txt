The restaurant has a unique feeling and the food is great, if you like Chinese food this would be a place to visit in Toronto. The service was personal and fantastic. Our main order took more than 40 minutes to arrive,so we had to wait for sometime. Last but not least be prepared for the bill, it's expensive.
