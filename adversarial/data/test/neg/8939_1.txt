I came here due to the good reviews on yelp hoping for a trouble-free experience. I took my car here for an oil change on 6\/14\/2016 and while I did have to wait a long time, I had called ahead of time and already knew they were busy and to expect a long wait. They told me it would take about 2 hours over the phone but I ended up waiting 3 hours. They have a TV and wifi to make the wait as comfortable as possible and the experience was generally positive. \n\nUnfortunately as I was driving home, I had gone about 2 miles when I heard a loud scraping sound. I pulled into a parking lot and discovered that the splash pan had come loose and was dragging under the car. I tried to call the shop as it was only 2 minutes after closing time but no one answered the phone. I eventually got a hold of someone at another location but they were initially not very helpful. I had to pressure them a bit but they eventually got in touch with someone there so I drove back and got it reattached. Everything appears to be ok but the entire episode didn't inspire confidence in a thorough and complete work-ethic. It makes me feel as if they rushed the whole job just because it was close to closing time. Who knows if everything else was put back together properly?
