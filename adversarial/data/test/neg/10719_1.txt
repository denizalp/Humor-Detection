Finally got a chance to go to the Bellagio Buffet since I been hearing rave reviews about the buffet at the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas.  Got to Vegas around mid day and went straight to the Bellagio, checked our bags and went straight to the buffet.  I heard that the buffet at the Bellagio was around $40, but for lunch it was $20.  Good price.  Got sat rather quickly and headed off to the buffet.  First noticed that it's setup in stations similar to the Rio.  All Italian food in one station, mexican food in another station, etc.  The carving station presented ham, some kind of stuffed chicken, some type of lamb, which looked great but I'm not a lamb person.  I got a small piece of ham and turkey.  Both were excellent.  The turkey very moist and the ham tasted like a honey ham.  Don't recall seeing beef in the carving section.  Had some type of ribs that were great.  I steered away from the just normal foods like the pizzas, pastas, mexican food and went looking for special foods.  I noticed they had cream cheese and lox but I think that may be staples in most high end buffets.  Since we got there a little early for lunch there was still breakfast there.  Grabbed a couple of pieces of bacon.  Bacon wasn't as tasty as the bacon at the Venetian.  Was excited to see they they were going to put out sushi at 12:00.  They put it out about 10 minutes early.  They only had cali type rolls but seemed to be made out of real crab versus fake crab.  and they had some veggie rolls.  Rice seemed a little mushy.   Asian area also had some spring rolls that I didn't care for at all.  One bite and I immediately placed the spring rolls on the trash plate.  Overall, I'm glad I tried the Bellagio buffet but probably won't go back unless it's a dinner buffet.
