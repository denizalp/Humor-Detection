You can never go wrong with the familiarity and great consistency of Swiss Chalet - and having it everywhere in Canada is convenient and comfort food goodness.  There is no exception to that thought here at the Toronto Pearson airport where the restaurant is located on the departures level of terminal 1.\n\n The Modern urban decor overlooking the newly renovated terminal facilities has a nice atmosphere; the back is actually nicer, yes go all the way to the back where you will see a hidden urban bar with 4 large tv screens to watch the hockey game and it is usually quieter.\n\nNow for the food, they always have the best \"golden orange brown\" rotisserie chicken with a side of vegetables and their signature centennial chicken noodle soup which tastes the same from Halifax to Vancouver and from when I was a little kid to now.  Certainly, they have tons of variety on their menu but this is what I have been ordering since I ate their the first time when I was in middle school hehe\n\nAmongst all the junk and grease of the airport eateries, this is a necessary healthy and comfort nostalgia stop when in the Toronto Airport; ah - a taste of home.
