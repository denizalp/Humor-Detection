Trish is awesome...She is my favorite! Every time I go I walk away happy. Cathy is great too and she is the owner. She continues to express her curiosity as to know  how your experience was with them. I've been to many nail salons in Las Vegas with terrible results. Lavish Nails has a beautiful environment with people that make you feel welcome and take the time to learn your name. Thank you for making me more awesome!
