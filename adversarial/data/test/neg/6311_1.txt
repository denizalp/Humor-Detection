The sushi here is decent quality and VRRY CHEAP ($2.95-3.95) and for that it is a great place to stop at for a quick roll or two. But the service is horrendous. There is no system in place for seating and I was confused the second we walked in the door and the hostess blankly stared at us (should I leave?). When we were finally seated it was next to the aquarium at a tiny table in the corner and given paper menus and pencils to order. The girl helping us at that moment seemed friendly but she was the only one. \nWhen I saw our order was ready, the servers were just mopping the floors around guests and laughing and ignoring the prepared food. Since I was seated so close to the food prep area, I had the opportunity to watch my order stand there for several minutes before someone finally broke from their very important and humorous conversation, and noticed it was ready. \nAs we were eating the girls continued to mop the floors around us, my table was surrounded by wet floor. It reeked of cleaning chemicals in my food while I was trying to eat and I couldn't get up to go to the washroom. It seemed as though they were trying to kick us out so they can close faster, but this was at 8pm and they close at 11! \nThe food was good and fresh and for the REALLY cheap price, I would recommend you go here with zero expectations of service and only for the sake of getting some cheap food (and inhaling some cleaning chemicals while you're at it).
