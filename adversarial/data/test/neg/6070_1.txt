We drove by this place several times and I'd made a mental note of it, so when we happened to be near enough I suggested we try them out. I've lived in Korea and adore the food and the people have always been more or less lovely to me, so I was excited to find a restaurant that felt nostalgic for my time there. The tang su yuk comes as a mountainous portion of tasty goodness! The meat is crisp and coated in a generous amount of batter. The vegetables were great- the onions were soft and sweet, the peppers crisp, and pineapple made a welcome addition. They give you the choice of having your sauce on the side or poured, we went with poured. Plenty of banchan joined the party with seasoned beansprouts, boiled peanuts, cabbage and cucumber kimchi, a seaweed salad, etc... I got a bowl of jjajangmyun too which came with pickled radish, raw onions and the tasty blackish dip that was ubiquitous at the little eateries I popped into while in\/around Seoul. Noodles were springy and the sauce was plentiful. It seemed a popular option among the other diners there during our visit. For the amount of food we had, and how many extras our sweet waitress threw in to our take out bag, I feel we paid a fair price. They have lunch specials and tons of other dishes I look forward to trying. Antho really enjoyed the tang su yuk and agreed that we'll be back.
