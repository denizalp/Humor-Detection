This place was amazing! So cute and hipster. It gets a little packed so try avoiding the lunch rush. The food was very flavourful, and it also feels nice to know they're healthy (minus the deep fried part). The food took a while to come out even when the place was slow but that's definitely my only complaint! Definitely worth a try
