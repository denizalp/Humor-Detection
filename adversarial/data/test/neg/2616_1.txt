Woke up Saturday morning to a swarm of Bees making a nest in my porch.. Paul at magic Want was the third or fourth call I made.. He was out within an hour removing the Bees, and even came back later that night for a second treatment.. Amazing service, competitive pricing, & top quality work.. I highly recommend using Magic Wand Pest Control
