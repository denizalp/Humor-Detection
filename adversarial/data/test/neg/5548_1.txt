This is the first Saver's I've ever been to and it has been the best!!!!\n\n+ HUGE store, literally as big as a Costco or something, unbelievable. \n\n+ Entire store is filled with high quality second hand items. So basically, they've already done alot of the editing for you, so you can see the best stuff and don't have to weed through lots of dirty tattered crap. ( I know that statement is subjective, but if you already an avid thrifter you will love and appreciate this...)\n\n+ Well staffed (at least on day I was there) friendly too! \n\n+ 20% off entire purchase if you bring a Bag of clothes to donate that day!!\n\n+ Bright and Clean\n\n+ GREAT Products!! (i mean... it is vegas)  use your imagination to what glories end up here..) hehe\n\n+ Wide aisles \n\n+ HUGE ACCESSORY SECTION!!!! literally like a wall of purses......\n\n+ Lots of shoes\n\n+ Lots of everything really..\n\n+ They donate alot of money to charity every year!!\n\n+ If you love thrifting, you will love going through this store, in my opinion. It's actually probably for the best I do not live closer to it... haha. Long live this Savers location, mwah! \n\n+ Large, easy to get to parking lot
