This is a really solid show- a throwback to classic Vegas.  The women in the show are beautiful and do a great job performing.  The theater is a little run down but I went with someone that wanted \"old school Vegas\" so that wasn't too much of a problem.  I go for the show, I really do, but I do wish there were more women performing on stage than men, its more of an art.  Focus more on the women!!! Otherwise great show.
