Went the last week of August 2015.  Frank was one of the finest waiters I've enjoyed.  The food was exceptional, although portions were often very small. ie The scallop la cena dinner had 1 scallop.  We had entrees come out first, tapas come out late, and three times wait staff brought out a second serving of a dish we had already ate, only to take it away.  So they are working on a few things.  Overall, very excited this exists in Madison, and will be back.
