I had an issue w my initial visit, but the manager reached out and asked how he could make my experience better. I really appreciate this kind of attention, it shows a lot about the character and business traits of an establishment. This was enough to help me give him a second chance. And I'm sure they'll tidy up the restroom and make sure there are towels!
