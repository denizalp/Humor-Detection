Absolutely ruined our wedding planning experience. Extremely unreliable! Ordered 1 tux + 6 suits for the groomsmen on November 2017 for April 2018 wedding and Kareem was not able to deliver. We ONLY backed out a week before the wedding because he kept saying it was coming \"don't worry\" and we trusted him. \nKareem did: refund us with our money back of $3300 for the 6 suits and provided $200 off from the Groom's tux (we ended up taking because our wedding was a week away), provided free bow ties, paid alterations from the suit we ended up buying at RW&CO given that we showed a receipt, he never did full compensate for the full amount of alterations (because we failed to 'provide' two receipts for it but never asked for the missing receipts). None of which can compensate for the headache, stress, running around we have experienced days before our wedding. If you scroll down more, there was another client getting married the same day as ours (April 28) and he delivered to that, guess he has challenges catering to several clients simultaneously. Would definitely not recommend. However, if you're one to take risks, don't pay full amount upfront.
