Loved it! Felt like I was in the movie Swingers! I would definitely recommend this place, even though the food and wine were not very good. The food is rather simple more than bad, kind of like the food you would have cooked in junior high school. But, the restaurant is very cute, and it is nice to get out of the casinos for a bit. Although simple, I thought the food was better than the food served at the casinos, which was often time just plain bad. And while the wine is not of the highest quality, it is drinkable.
