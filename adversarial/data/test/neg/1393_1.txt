My husband and I spent a little weekend getaway here. We didn't want to be on the noisy strip but not too far so that we could walk to the strip, which we did. The hotel staff was very pleasant and professional. Loved the artwork in the lobby. Our room was on the 13th floor (room 1317). It was spacious, comfortable and clean. Had a nice view of the strip. The a\/c was awesome. Enjoyed spending time on the roof under the stars. No jacuzzi and the pool is small. Used the gym; it is spacious, lots of equipment, and very clean. Towels provided on each equipment. Breakfast buffet included w\/the price. I always look for free Wifi and parking, which we had. No hidden costs. We will definitely return!
