STAY AWAY FROM SIERRA AIR!!!\nRUDE..NO CUSTOMER SERVICE..FLAT OUT DONT CARE FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS!!\n   Im not one to write or call in complaints,  but after Sierra Air Techs.(CHRIS & DAN) came out to our house today, there was nothing that was going to stop me from warnin people as to what a bunch of frauds they really are!!\n  They were called out to check on our newly put in A.C. unit which has been turning on & off every 10 minutes. We researched possible causes to go over with them, but they did not want to hear it. They shot everything down, wouldn't even listen to me (because my sister was the one who actually paid for the A.C.)\n  After about a lil over an hour of toying with the unit they concluded that nothing is wrong with it. We explained how our bill which is supposed to be minimized (with this new unit they recommended and sold thru Cost Co)..will now be even greater than our older one.  They acted like they could care less. They were RUDE, didnt listen, & in the end after they left saying everything is fine....which is B.S.   our A.C. unit is still turning on and off every 10 minutes.
