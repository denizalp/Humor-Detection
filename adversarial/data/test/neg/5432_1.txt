I come from Orange County, CA and they have amazing spin studios... I was so excited for The Cycling Studio to open. Every class is fun, exciting and you always burn a ton of calories! Each instructor is informative, lively and energetic. I highly recommend taking a class, as you will be addicted. Plus, they always have fun opportunities to earn FREE classes! Refer friends too!
