With a menu featuring eight unique chargrilled smokehouse hot dogs from Sahlen's Packing Company in Buffalo, New York it quickly became a daunting task trying to decide what we were going to try first. I figured if the first thing on the menu is named after the restaurant itself.. I'd be doing the world a disservice by not checking it out. So we ordered a JJ's \"No.1″ Red Hot Hot Dog, the Chicken and Herb Sausage, Andouille Sausage Sliders, and Onion Rings.\n\nThe Chicken and Herb Sausage was very well received at our table and ended up being a favorite of the night. The sausage was cooked to perfection and the toppings were piled high. As for the JJ's \"No.1″ Red Hot Hot Dog.. it was good. I guess I didn't realize that the Webers Mustard they use is a horseradish type mustard and not anywhere like the typical French's yellow mustard I'm use too. The first bite sent my nose into hyper drive and my brain scrambling to figure out what had just happened. I cant fault the hot dog for the mustard... there's plenty of people that love horseradish, I'm just not one of them. Without the mustard the hot dog was amazing. The smokehouse hot dogs from Sahlen's were chargrilled, juicy, plump, and full of flavor.\n\nThe Andouille Sausage Sliders were also on our favorites list for the night. It came out piled high with andouille sausage, creamy cole slaw, on toasted Martins bun and except for being a little on the messy side was perfect. The onion rings had a mixed reaction at our table. We couldn't decide if the batter needed a new recipe... or if they just needed some ranch to dip them in. The texture was right on point but we couldn't shake an awkward taste after every bite.\n\nJJ's Red Hots also has hand spun milk shakes in four different flavors. We tried the mocha (which was delicious), the vanilla (which was a little on the boring side), and the strawberry (which needed just a little more strawberry). For the most part they were all delicious and well worth checking out.. .especially if the whether stays above 100 degree's like it is right now.\n\nCharlotte is in desperate need of more restaurants serving up incredible food, at a great price, for the average person and JJ's Red Hots hits that mark. In a neighborhood over taken by platinum cards, vip parking, and fancy dining... JJ's Red Hots is a much needed breath of fresh air :)
