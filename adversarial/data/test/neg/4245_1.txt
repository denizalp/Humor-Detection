It's the closest auto shop near me but I'd rather drive twice the distance to go to Firestone. \nI got tires replaced here and when they did a rotation they didn't plug back in the wire for the AntiLock Breaking system. I brought it back in and they tried to charge me over $100 to tell me that I needed to bring it in to the dealership to get a new system. I refused to pay. Took it to Firestone and they charged me $20 for a full inspection and simply plug back in the wire. \n\nPep Boys is overpriced and filled with incompetent people. Sufficed to say I won't be going back.
