If I could give zero stars, I would. This place has to be the worst doctor's office I have ever been to. \n\nI called on Monday (it took 3 times before reaching someone after being put on hold and forgotten about) and made an appointment with Dr. Ramzan for Thursday. When I arrived, no one knew who I was and the reception desk employees were very rude about the ordeal. Apparently whoever I scheduled with didn't really make my appointment.\n\nThis office reeks of incompetentient and unprofessional individuals, I can only imagine what the doctor is like.
