Really I come here for the bread pudding....its my favorite...of anywhere!   I ordered the salmon with grilled pineapple and steamed broccoli....I didnt leave a morsel.  The salmon had a pineapple glaze which was out of this world tasty!  Ill be back for both the salmon and bread pudding! Service was good too.
