The store is fine, and the beauty boutique staff are friendly and helpful. However, after the last month of repeated issues with the pharmacy, I have moved all my prescriptions elsewhere. There were unneeded and invasive questions as well as sit down surveys with no warning or heads up (at half past eight in the evening). I would not recommend going there to anyone and will in fact be making a point of telling people to avoid it.
