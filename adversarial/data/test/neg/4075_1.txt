Chicken is actually marinated chicken cooked in a brick oven. Not your typical rotisserie chicken. The owner is underselling a great product by calling it on his menu and website \"rotisserie\". Really tasty, attractive flavor, not dripping oil\/ fat like typical store rotisserie. Sides: black beans are to die for. Yucca fries are delicious especially dipped in their freshly made sauce. Plantain fries are a nice sweet finish. Steak fries are the best I tried in a while. Fast service. We got our food in 2 minutes! All in all, great food, modest price, and a joint that may not be your choice for a romantic evening on the town but certainly a place where the family would eat a hearty meal. Open till 8 pm on Fridays. A great plus considering that the whole Strip area closes at 4 pm.
