Called and was greeted by Jane - Jamie (? sorry).  Her happy demeanor matched her helpful, professional service.\n\nEric arrived on time.  He was personable as well as efficient.  I am perfectly satisfied with the care he put into his craft.  My carpets look and smell great.  Look no further, this company is tops.
