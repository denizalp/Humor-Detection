I should have written a review immediately after I purchased my vehicle from here. (2013 Toyota Camry Pre owned), but I wanted to feel out the car and see how the customer service was. I must say I am extremely pleased. I worked with Larry and Lorenzo and they both did a great job with finding me the vehicle that worked within my budget but also met all of my requirements as far as what I was looking for. I will say I did not buy the first day I came in. With this being my first major vehicle purchase I wanted to ensure I was making the right decision. And I did. No pressure. No huge sales process. Just accommodation to my needs. After a month and a half of having the vehicle I had a dashboard light come on. I texted Larry and he told me to come in and took care of it no problem. No hassle. No charge. No wait. I am very pleased. I will always recommend the Toyota brand, but especially to Avondale Toyota.
