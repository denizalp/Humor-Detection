Food is great.  Atmosphere is awesome.  The only reason I didn't give a 5 is because often ..you r forces to wait for a table -even with reservations.  This is a great Lealieville spot and a place I've taken family, friends and even a date.  Great vibe, great specials and just one of my favorite spots in the area.
