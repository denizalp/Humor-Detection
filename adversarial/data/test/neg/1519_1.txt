This review is not for the brick and mortar restaurant, but for the taco cart they use on the road. \n\nI seriously think these tacos rival that of las palmas. There is finally another street food taco vendor that does good tacos !! \nThey had a deal running: 1 item for 3.50 or 3 items for 10.00. You could choose from tacos, quesadillas, or empanadas. The fillings for the tacos and quesadillas were chicken, pork,  chorizo , and beef while the empanadas has all the same options minus the chorizo and sub cheese & plantains. \nThey also served the staple Jarritos pop in the glass bottles and Mexican coke. \n\nThe tacos were a hefty size but I was disappointed to see that they were filled with rice underneath of the chorizo. The chorizo has potatoes saut√©ed in with them which I thought was a great touch, but the rice was truly overkill.\n\nMuch like Las Palmas, there is a small condiment bar. No limes, but pico de gallo, onions, cilantro, and squeeze bottles full of Mexican cream and hot sauce. I found the hot sauce to be a bit milder, but others may not be able to handle it. No limes for these delicious tacos, but honestly there was so much flavor it wasn't all that noticeable. \n\nThe empanada was fried up fresh, AND they used homemade corn tortillas, just like a pro!! \n\nThe price point (3.50 for ONE taco???) and rice in the taco is what made me give these guys only 4 stars, but don't let that keep you from trying them out. The gentleman taking the orders was a truly kind guy with the spirit of a salesman, and the cook was very friendly too! If you need the items to go, just ask and they will wrap the little paper basket in foil for you
