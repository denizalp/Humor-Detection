Wow! I was pleasantly surprised with this cute little cafe. I thought I was just walking into a coffee shop but it was so much more. Every chance I get, I try gluten free foods and The Root Cafe had an abundance of that.\n\nI had the winter wrap on a gluten free tortilla. It was so flavorful and I loved the sweet potato! There was just a little kick from the chipotle spread and peppers. \n\nOf course I had to snag a bite of my friends hummus as well....yum! So creamy, and I loved the array of dipping choices. A whole plate of veggies and pita. So much nicer than just bread. The whole raw food movement is pretty cool to me. Obviously I will return!
