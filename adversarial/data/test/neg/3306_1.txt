Perfect. Everytime I'm asked how was the catering, I say perfect. My wife and I are both 20+ years in the event and entertainment industry. Worked with vendors around the world. We heard about CHC through multiple recommendations. Their reputation was impeccable. We sat down for our first consultation with Sarah. The amount of food options and customization is endless. We had a 2 day outside reception and brunch at a private residence. The space was bare. Sarah was so helpful. Providing not only delicious catering on both days, but the tables, chairs, linens, plating, silverware, lighting, a dance floor, a bar, bartenders, servers, and chefs all managed perfectly. They came in set everything up. There was no stress or hassle. When we walked in, we were blown away!The food and bar staff were flawless both days. The chefs nailed the varieties and had rave reviews from our guests. When it was all done they packed everything up and left it cleaner than it was. Top to bottom one of the most professional companies I've ever worked with.\nThis is the #1 catering service to use in Arizona. They made our dream wedding come true. Thank you!
