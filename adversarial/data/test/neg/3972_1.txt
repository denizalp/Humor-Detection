Came here on a weekday morning around 9:00am, for total rewards members, you can use your comps here.  So we decided to give it a try.  \n\nWaited in line, ordered a berry crepe, asked if they had ice cream that could be topped with the crepe, nope.  \nAlso got a banana foster type crepe.\n\nIt took a little while for them to make the crepes, which is okay, since it's made to order.  The presentation of the crepes isn't that appealing.  Each crepe costs about $10.00.\n\nMy family got the savory crepe, I had a try at that, but even then it wasn't anything special, very loosely wrapped, everything falls out right when you cut into it.\n\nThe berry crepe needed to have more cream to cut into the tartness.  A scoop of vanilla ice cream would have been perfect.\nThe banana foster ice cream was pretty good, buttery and caramel, soft bananas.\n\nOverall, wasn't impressed with the price point, presentation and taste.
