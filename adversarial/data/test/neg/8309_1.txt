I went in with high hopes and we were disappointed. Getting our drink ordered s took too long. Getting our drinks took too long. Forgot my food order completely. Upstairs arcade was closed. The food was ok. The waitress messed up our tab (forgot the drinks) and it seemed to be super loud. Might give it one more try.
