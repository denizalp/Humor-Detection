The blog says that Bagel House bakes the best Montreal-style bagels, but St Urbain Bagel is actually the best, to my taste. An ex-Montrealer exiled to Phila, I crave the chewiness, density, and slight sweetness imparted by boiling the dough in honey water. St Urbain delivers, and Bagel House is a little drier and has no sweetness. If you visit the Phila area, the place to go is Mount Royal Bagel in nearby Marlton, NJ, which does the absolutely best job of recreating this Montreal delicacy.
