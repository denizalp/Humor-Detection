From flashlights, to toilet paper, to Terro Ant Traps (the BEST if you have ants roaming your house searching for food!), I have shopped for it all at this Canadian Tire.\n\nIt has lots of parking, and bonus - it's next door to a Marks Work Wearhouse AND a Shoppers Drug Mart so I can get a bunch of errands done with 1 park of the car!\n\nThis store is on the 2nd floor, so a trip up the escalator or elevator is required, but it's fun to watch the shopping carts take their own personal escalator up and down beside you!\n\nThere is a Service Ontario location inside the store, but I have never used it.\n\nAlways seems to have plenty of cashiers open, as well as the dreaded self serve check outs.
