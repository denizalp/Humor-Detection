Went here due to an issue with my shoulder. Ended up with Dr. Baker & I cannot express how much gratitude I have for him & his staff. My surgery went very well, Baker made sure I was comfortable & didn't force me into having an unwanted surgery. He explained all options I had to choose from before I made an educated decision. His staff is very friendly & warm. They do not treat you like a # or a burden. The office is also very nice. It is not cramped, they have an amazing saltwater tank to look at as well as a nice view of a lake. I really cannot complain at all. Thank you Dr. Baker! I look forward to having full range of motion in my shoulder again. WITHOUT the pain!
