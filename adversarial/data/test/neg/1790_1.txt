I visited for the first time yesterday with my family.  Friday evening around 6:15 and there were plenty of open seats but at first glance this place looks great on the inside.  It's a very nice space.  Located right next to the Publix in an area that has been starving for good food for quite some time.\nWe were greeted promptly and handed a handwritten special menu which outlined the daily specials and sides.  Sitting down at a nice booth near the kitchen area and opening the menu you are immediately overwhelmed by the shear amount of offerings.  OMG, it took me 10 - 15 minutes to figure out what I wanted which was OK in my book.  In the back of my mind with the lack of traffic that I saw this evening how does anything stay fresh?  The waitress came over and took our drink orders and was a little pushy about asking for our order IMO, with that size menu she's got to realize it's going to take a new arrival some time you know?\nWe ordered 2 things off the kids menu for the little ones and I ordered a steak and cheese sandwich which was served on a hoagie roll and a side of potato salad.  Sweetie ordered the salmon special with cole slaw and pasta salad.  The kids tender meal was underwhelming and served with 2 overly breaded foodservice chicken tenders and less than a handful of fries.  For $6.50 I expected more.  My steak and cheese hoagie was mostly bread and the steak was not seasoned and didn't have any dressing of any sort.  Ergo, it was flavorless and dry.  I paid an extra $.60 for mushrooms which offered a small amount of flavor but again I was mostly eating bread.  I will say the potato salad was very good.  Sweetie said her salmon was over cooked and dry.  We left with a piece of lemon pound cake to go which according to Sweetie was the best part of the meal.\nHey, it's somewhat new and I possibly ordered the wrong thing.  In theory I liked the concept of a deli like back home, corned beef, pastrami, brisket, burgers etc....I saw plenty of the Sun City Crowd which may explain the blandness but in order to draw in repeat business, they need to jazz things up a bit.
