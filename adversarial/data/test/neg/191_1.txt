Horrible service , lost my bag on a 1 hour flight from Vegas to fresno. When we arrived to Fresno they had no representative. The main office was incredibly rude and unhelpful. There is a limit to low cost and this airline has no problem sinking lower. I will definitely use another airline. This company is not worth the 40 bucks you save. It is hard to make southwest look good but this airline did it.
