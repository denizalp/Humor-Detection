For such a busy location I received top notch customer service with both make up and skin care products. I had the pleasure of working with their senior skin care person and she was amazing, knowledgeable and recommended products that were fantastic and didn't break the bank. I also for the color ID match done and I now have foundation that's is perfectly matched to my skin and perfect for my skin type. Seriously got in and spend a bit of time with these ladies and they will hook you up!
