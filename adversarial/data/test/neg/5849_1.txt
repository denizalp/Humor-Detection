Disappointed based on what other reviews said. Fork Scramble and Red Velvet pancakes were good, but DO NOT get the Green Eggs and Ham. Absolutely disgusting. Service was terrible and the server did not even react to the terrible food we were served. Travelers beware -- they do not accept American debit\/credit cards.
