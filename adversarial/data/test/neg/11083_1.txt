This is the solely a review on the food. Had the burger, salad, and the wings. Overall, this isn't a place to find really good food. Just ok food.\nThe burger was dry and forgettable however, the fries were cooked perfectly. Wings and salad were alright. Just passable. \n\nThe staff was friendly and welcoming and gave good service. I was honestly a bit disappointed with this place. More of a 2.5 than a 3. The sad thing is, this is one of the higher rated pubs in Richmond Hill.
