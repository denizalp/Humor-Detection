This is the goodlife location I've been coming to lately.  I haven't been organized enough to check the class schedule before I come down here, but the machines are in pretty good shape.  They have a ladies only area, it's pretty clean.  I'm not afraid of the showers.  Really, there's not much more you can ask of from a gym.
