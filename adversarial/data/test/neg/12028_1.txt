First and ONLY time I will ever be a guest of the Marriot.... TERRIBLE customer service. \n\nI called them twice (the day before and the day of) before my arrival to see if I could request a King size bedroom since it's not an option online.  Not only did I wait 20 minutes on hold, I was then told I had the wrong number, had to call back because they couldn't transfer me, and then was told they wouldn't be able to honor it over the phone and it was first come first serve in person.  DESPITE the fact that I had a 6 hour drive to get there from California as I told them! \n\nThen upon arrival, we request the king size and of course they are all out and my fianc√© and I have to take two double beds. \n\nThen when leaving, we ask for a late checkout and their response is \"we already have a high number of requests sorry can't help you.\"  \n\nWow. Thanks for absolutely nothing Marriot. \n\nGood riddens.
