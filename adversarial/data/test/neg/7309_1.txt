Wow what a great local sports bar.  Dropped my daughter off at her softball and me and a couple of the dads wanted to watch the Stanley cup finals.  Found this place and what a great find.  Excellent service! Giant frozen mugs of beer served with perfect timing by Daniella who by the way should get a raise!!! Seriously all staff was good plus Poutine served there! Never had it before but will be back for more. Taking the west side up a couple notches... great job Deli Sports Bar!
