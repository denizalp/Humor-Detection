Lightning fast \"strip-mall\" style Chinese food.  It's exactly what you expect it to be.  It's a great spot to stop by after work and pick up a quick take-out meal for the family, but I wouldn't expect too much by the way of \"cuisine\".\n\nHad the beef with broccoli, kung pao chicken, and sweet and sour chicken recently.  All of which were made from picky-eater friendly ingredients, and were a hit with the kids.  I do like the fact that the staff is all Chinese and a few words spoken from the customers in Mandarin seem to go over well.\n\nOverall it's nothing special, but a decent value for a mid-week take home meal.
