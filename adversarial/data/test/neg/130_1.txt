Titan roofing sent someone out to give us a quote for some minor roof repairs.  The gentleman arrived on time, spoke & understood English and communicated well.  After the inspection I was given a verbal estimate of approximately what it would cost to repair our roof and told the quote would be emailed to me.  I did receive the quote and it was almost exactly the same amount that I had been (informally) told and Considerably Less than a quote I got from another roofing company.  I informed Titan's receptionist that I needed the work done ASAP.  I was told they would have a person out within 3 days.  Unfortunately we could not get the work done then due to a family emergency.  \n\nAfter our family issues were resolved I called Titan to set up an appointment.  I sighed & returned the contract and made arrangements to have the roof work done a few days later (much sooner than I'd expected).  The roofer showed up on time.  He was courteous and spoke and understood English.  He finished the work in a reasonable amount of time.  \n\nA neighbor saw the roofing truck & needed 2 tiles.  There just happened to be 2 tiles the shape, size & color in the roofer's truck.  I asked if my neighbor could buy those tiles from him.  He said \"no\" and very politely explained that they were for his next job, where they needed those 2 specific tiles.  He recommended a place where my neighbor could buy the small quantity of tiles she needed.  He was kind, helpful and informative.  \n\nWe received an email invoice for the completed work in a timely manner.\n\nI would Highly recommend Titan Roofing to anyone in the Las Vegas or Henderson area.\n\nMickie Klusza
