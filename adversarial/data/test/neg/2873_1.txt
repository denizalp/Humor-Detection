Sorry, but it's just really, really awful. The main issue is the food. We had everything from Cobb Salad to ribs to fish and chips and it was all equally bad. Nothing seems fresh at all. The fish was probably just pulled out of the Shamrock foods bag and fried (along with the fries). The Cobb salad was dry and wilted. The pulled pork was dry as well, like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for too long. The same can be said of the entire restaurant, it's been sitting out too long. The decor is dated, the carpet is stained and you really shouldn't have carpet in a restaurant anyway. The menus were all greasy. The service was fine, but just. Do yourself a favor, walk on by unless you just want a couple of beers in front of the numerous tv's blasting Sports Center.
