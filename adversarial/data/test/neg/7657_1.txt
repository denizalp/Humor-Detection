I WILL NOT LET HER TOUCH MY HAIR AGAIN. This is my first negative review. I found Joni on yelp and went to her because of the great reviews and because she is a \"color specialist\". I've had my hair done really well with modern up-to-date techniques until my stylist moved. I thought Joni would be my next permanent stylist based on what I read. Sadly it isn't so and I am really confused about why she has such good reviews. My story:\n\n1. She had me go out of my way to come by in advance to discuss what I wanted done so she could schedule the right amount if time. A week later at my appointment she didn't remember what we were doing and then argued with me about what I wanted, which was to color my hair darker brown and balayage\/ombre highlight it AND cut it-think Jessica Biel and Olivia Wild color melt...I was ready to PAY. I don't think she really knows how to do what I wanted(it's all over YouTube!) I should have left right then! \n\n2. Even after our previous consult which resulted in a decision to do a time consuming baylage(that she forgot about)she booked 2 people that arrived while she was still doing my hair. That's when she let my highlights stay in too long and get funky while starting their hair. The bleached areas were ugly, misplaced and all different bleach-y colors***not in a good way...NOT the color melting effect that a color specialist should know how to accomplish. I went in with many photos, my mother in another state is a stylist...I know what's what and Joni really let me down. Once the other 2 women were there she was just trying to get me outta there. The haircut was a total after-thought for her. I had long hair and wanted 6+ inches off in a stylish way...I walked outta there with Walmart salon hair\/student cosmetologist hair(no offense to those of you talented or learning people in those places) 3+ inches longer than I told her I wanted, unflattering unblended layers. It took her nearly 5 hours to do what I could have done myself. Sure, I looked semi-cute when I left, not hideous but it WAS NOT what I went in for...and I still had to pay $300 and have my hair needlessly damaged. I look forward to trying again soon with someone else. I am really bummed it didn't work out and more bummed that when I expressed that I wasn't happy(which was hard!)she acted as if I should just be happy since it's \"good enough\". Well I coulda paid $50 for good enough....or $20 if I did it myself and saved time with either. I feel robbed. She should have admitted that she was unsure of her abilities instead of continuing on only doing what she knew how while still charging me for what I wanted which is what many women get from modern salons. That's my mistake. I ended up with a ton of ugly yellow and white streaks mostly on one side, forcing me to part it to hide asymmetry  and not put it in a ponytail until I finally colored over it. So sad! My poor hair!! And LAME haircut!:-((...I'm really sad. I'm not rich but for good hair I was going to fork it up. It was for a special occasion...I still tipped her too. If it came out right I would thrown down a big one...I felt obligated...and manipulated...tipped an extra $15...NOT 20+%...so little but ouch it hurt. I should have done what I wanted to...pay for what she gave me! What's right in this situation? I don't know but I'm posting this review for anyone going to her for balayage-DON'T!
