this place is a joke and very unorganized. I went here to give Mike at his yearly shots and get him vaccinated to be able to hang out in my garden. I wanted to make sure he was safe to be outside with me since he's always been an indoor cat. when I got there the waiting room was filled up with eight dogs. I checked in and sat down the waiting room while I waited there more dogs kept showing upI waited I'm in room for my appointment for 20 minutes with about 15 dogs. While I waited there I come to find out the a dog in there with us has fleas and they're just letting him roam around the room with every other animal. well after they take and my cat to get his shots and return them to me. and just a little memo they don't let you go in with your pet. my cat came back out and I noticed he had fleas now. my cat has never had fleas he's an indoor cat. this place is awful even though its cheaper it's not worth taking your pet because you will end up with a bigger headache at the end. Now I have to treat my cats for fleas and it's going to be a month of headache until I make sure they are completely gone. I came here so I can save 80 bucks because my regular vet was a lot more expensive for these shots and it had such good reviews which now I'm thinking are faked that I decided to try it out. AVOID at all cost pay full price and get a professional environment.
