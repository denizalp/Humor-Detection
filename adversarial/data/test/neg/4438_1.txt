Recommended from a friend so that I could take family for some good  Mexican food. They were not disappointed and we happened to go at happy hour.\nWe started with mango margaritas for $4,00 Yum.\nTaco and enchilada happy hour plate. Chicken flauta combo plate. Carnitas fried juicy pork loin which comes out on a hot iron skillet,absolutely delicious.\nAll plates served with great beans, then the rice. Carnita dish also comes with choice of tortillas and a little guacamole and pico. We enjoyed our visit.
