Looking awaited... Nordstrom is finally here! Great choices in every section. Definitely giving places like Holt's a run for their money (as I've had enough bad experiences in Holt's till I decided to stop shopping there as a form of boycott)\nThe run down....\n- Great choices and selection from the buyers. They really know how to select the brand's and designs they carry in Nordstrom as it offers a distinction of choices compared to what they sell at the stores in Eaton Centre and Saks.\n- Excellent variety of skincare brands. You name it, they have it. Especially the little must- have travel section. Convenient and great products perfect for on- the-go.\n- Concierge services available for Torontonians and can be delivered within 2 hours. \n- Personalisation services for purchases made in Nordstrom for only $8\n- Great location and ease of accessibility layout and entrance, exit point\n- Being a coffee person, I must mention about the Ebar Artisan Coffee almost like a Starbucks. Great fresh light bites, coffee and sweet treats.\n\nDownside is, it's packed with lotsa people daily as it just opened up. Yorkdale location is up next.
