I love the Vienna Beef Hot Dogs and the Bratwursts. Every Hot Dog or Sausage sandwich comes with fresh cut French Fries. They also have Pepsi products.\nThey also have Very good Beef sandwiches. Everyone is very friendly and they all go out of there way to know there customers. The place is very clean a little on the small side they have like 8 or 9 tables and a counter at the back of the space to eat and a couple tables outside. They this family business moved here from the Chicago Area. The decorations on the walls and display case are from the Chicago Area. They also have a drive up window to order take out or to go order.
