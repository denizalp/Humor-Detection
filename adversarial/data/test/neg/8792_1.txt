I had my ear pierced at this place on Saturday. Since it was my first time doing a piercing in my life, Alex made me feel confident and relax the entire time. My ears are healing well up until this point (3rd day), and trust me, piercing doesn't hurt at all! \nThis place is the best experience I had so far, highly recommended! and looking forward to purchase a new pair of earrings in store as well.
