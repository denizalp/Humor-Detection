I came here for dinner with my family. We heard good reviews about this place from a friend. I was expecting an izakaya similar to Juu but Tsuki was more like a Korean sports bar. \nThe service was great but the food could be better. \nThe takowasabi wasn't good - there wasn't enough wasabi sauce so it tasted a little bland. The spicy chicken with cheese was too dry and it also lacked flavouring. \nI also thought the menu needs more izakaya selections, so far it leans towards a Korean restaurant rather than a Japanese izakaya.
