My mom originally introduced me to this place and my husband and I have been regulars to this place for several months now. We love this place! We love the seasonal, changing menus (the side of local mixed veggies changes every day) and the fresh ingredients, the desserts are great (love the turtle cake and apple cake), you get super refreshing cucumber water, plus I get a night off from cooking! There have been a few times I've had an inconsistent dish. There are also a few items on the menu I feel I make better in my own kitchen. The parking is also inconvenient. However we love this place for date night and can indulge in yummy vegan food in one of my favorite and personally nostalgic areas of the city. We have brought friends here and they love it, too. I've been loving the falafel salad lately; it's very filling, the falafel reminds me of crab cakes and the curried banana peppers are so delicious. Planning on going this week for my birthday dinner and I'm very excited (:\nLove this place, try it if you haven't!
