I was advised by my local police department (Irvine, California) to contact the Phoenix PD to update and report my situation of a bad business dealing with a Local Used Car Dealership (Speed Auto Sales and Leasing) and the Owner Mike Aminov. \n\nI was able to file my report and given an incident number to be followed up by an investigator...\n\nSpeed Auto Sales and Leasing took my $6000 deposit and tried to keep it... They held my money and even denied they received it... I had to wait 9 months and file complaints with the Attorney General of Arizona to have them help me get my money back...\n\nNow the owner of Speed Auto Sales and Leasing is harassing by email and has threatened to sue me if I do not remove my review from Yelp.... \n\nTHANK YOU PHOENIX POLICE DEPARTMENT FOR PROTECTING ALL CITIZENS... EVEN THE ONES THAT DON'T LIVE IN YOUR CITY...\n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE... BE SAFE...
