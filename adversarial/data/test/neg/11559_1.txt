On a recent trip to LV, stopped by here after being too exhausted by the 108 degree day & walking to go any further.  We thought we would not want to eat \"heavy\" food on such a hot day when it was earlier in the day , but are SO glad we stopped.  First of all our server (wish I could remember her name!) was A1---she first off asked about allergies & when I mentioned a minor allergy she literally went over the entire menu telling me what might have that ingredient in it. I was impressed with her depth of knowledge of everything on the menu.  I ended up ordering eggs benedict with chicken substituted (due to pork allergy) and it was, hands-down, the best eggs benny I've ever had.  The chicken was perfect, as was the sauce and biscuit & egg.  Husband had the brisket sandwich & loved it as well. I could only get through half the eggs benny because I wasn't feeling too well to begin with, but we are looking forward to another trip to town someday and will definitely be back because everything we saw come out of the kitchen looked fabulous.
