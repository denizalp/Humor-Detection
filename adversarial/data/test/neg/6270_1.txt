Nice place, clean, friendly greeting.\n\nLunch specials were good. Pretty standard stuff. Egg soup was a bit boring, but I'm not a fan of egg soup. Crab puff and eggroll and fried rice were the sides and all were good. Main courses were large enough that we both had more than we could finish.\n\nGood selection of dishes and they serve beer too.
