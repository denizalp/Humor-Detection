Very clean room. Nice beds. Very friendly and courteous staff. Other than how horribly sketchy the immediate neighborhood is (although it definitely gets worse as you head south down the street it's on.), this is the nicest La Quinta we stayed in on our trip. Now, as long as our van doesn't get broken into overnight, everything will have been perfect.\n\nOh, they were they only La Quinta on our trip to honor our reservation request and had extra pillows and towels waiting for us in our room.
