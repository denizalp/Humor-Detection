Eating vegan felt so bad...but not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good.\n\nSeriously it is really nice to have a vegan option that is just straight comfort food.  The place is never too packed and is super casual.  You walk up and the hardest choice is what to try.  Don't worry you can't go wrong.  Every time we have gone the cashiers have been very helpful if you are still deciding between two options.\n\nFor food, I would recommend the BBQ po boy.  It comes with a little kick.  The fries are always good and come with a great ketchup.  I am not a big fan of the thai slaw, so I would definitely go with the fries.  I have also had the pizzas and they are always safe.  The veggie burger is good, but if mushy burgers freak you out, then go another direction.  I do wish is a was a bit more firm.\n\nIf you are looking for a ridiculous treat, grab a Soynami on the way out.  My fave is the mint chocolate version.  One small thing that I do hate though is they serve them with wooden spoons and I am a bit weird and HATE eating off a wooden spoon.  Am I weird?  The soynami is so good, I still do it though.\n\nFinally I am happy to have this place in town.  I am always amazed that Phx does not have more dedicated veg\/vegan places for as big as it is.  If you are a fan of That's a Wrap, then you will be satisfied here - same ownership.  \n\nAnother tip - Check out the t-shirts for sale.  I love my ninja deer on a bike shirt!
