PVSEC has always done an amazing job for my pup. I've had to bring my dog to PVSEC for emergency unfortunately a few times. PVSEC always took great care of him. The doctors and vet techs are all wonderful, caring and very attentive to my dog. And also caring to me because it's always emotional bringing your dog in for an emergency. \nThey are extremely pricey but for the quality, experience and care you get @ PVSEC it is worth it. \nIf you are going into the ER be prepared to wait and wait. They are always busy. \nIf you have an emergency or need a specialty doctor I would only recommend PVSEC!
