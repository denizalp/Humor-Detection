By far the best Barber in Las Vegas. I've been to 4 barbers out here since I moved here 1 year ago. He is hands down the best. After getting my haircut for the third time, I am back for the 4th cut. Consistency, precision and attention to detail is what i am looking for out of my barber, and Favio delivers. Not only can he fade, blend and cut, and practically do any tyoe of cut you ask, his line ups are on point. He finishes the job with an almost perfect lineup. And on top of that,  he listens to what you want out of your haircut and he executes efficiently. 30 minutes to fine tune and maintenance your hair. If your willing to pay the price of the haircut he will hook you up and you won't be disappointed. I will say this, its unfortunate that moving to Vegas resulted in having to pay a hefty price to get a decent haircut around here... But Favio hooks me up and my wife said I can continue to come here so that says a lot about his professional expertise. Schedule your next hair appointment with Favio today and you wont be disappointed.
