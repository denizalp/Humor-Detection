We used to live in Scottsdale and visited La Locanda at their former location frequently---now 15 yrs later we were in town for a few days and stopped by their new place in Old Town and I'm delighted to report that the food is just as superb as ever.\n\nBut why wouldn't it be with the masterful Chef Andrea still at the helm we would expect nothing less!!\n\nLobster Bisque and salads were all great starters, followed by Saffron Risotto, Lobster Risotto, Pork Chop and Squid Ink Pasta with Seafood all prepared perfectly.\n\nDesserts were a wonderful ending to a truly superb dinner.\n\nIf you're going to be in Scottsdale you absolutely must put La Locanda at the top of must visit list---with Chef Andrea crafting one delicious dish after another you won't be disappointed!!!
