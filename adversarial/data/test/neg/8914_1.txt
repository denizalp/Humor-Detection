Came here for a quick dinner on a week night. The place wasn't too crowded, we got a table right away. \n\nWe tried the Grande Meatball and the Pan-seared Scallops for appetizers and they were both decent. I had high hopes for the mains after the appetizer, but was disappointed by what came next. I went with the classic Rigatoni in tomato and basil sauce. Most of the pasta had cracked and broken up and i couldn't taste even a hint of basil in the sauce. The other entree we tried was the garlic shirmp with risotto cake, it came with 3 small pieces of shrimp. Nothing to write home about. \n\nIn addition, our server wasn't very attentive. We had to go up to the front to pay in the end because we couldn't even flag him down.\n\nWill not be returning to this restaurant again.
