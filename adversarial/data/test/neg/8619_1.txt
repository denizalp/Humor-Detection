I work in the area and have been meaning to pop in and try Marigold Maison for lunch for quite some time now.  This place had always seemed to slip my mind when trying to decide where to go.  However, I assure you that will not happen again.  We stopped in today and were blown away.  The food was SO good... great flavors, perfect textures and good portions.  The wait staff was very attentive, helpful and friendly - as was the Manager.  I understand there can be quite a wait for dinner - so you'll need to be smart and make a reservation or plan well ahead to order take out -  but the wait will be well worth it.  This will be my Go To when I'm in the PV area from here forward!
