Wandered into the Market Street Grocery for the first time this morning and was really pleasantly surprised. I didnt spend as much time as i wouldve liked because i was on my 30 min lunch break, but i was pretty impressed with the selection and the prices, and the staff working this morning was super friendly, which was great. I had my name tag on, and one guy working noticed and addressed me by name while i was browsing, which really impressed me and made me feel welcome. I cant wait to go back when i have more time!
