The Peppermill lives up to the diner hype here on Yelp.  Big portions of diner-style food are the main attraction, and a skilled group of servers deliver well prepared food with a smile.\n\nOmelets are huge.  This ain't Denny's or IHOP.  And they're delicious, too.\n\nSandwiches are all huge.  The burgers are best eaten with a fork, as they are big, piled high with your choice of tasty toppings.  The Focaccia Chicken sandwich is gargantuan with juicy chicken breast, avocado, prosciutto, and melted provolone cheese.  I dare you to eat the whole thing.  \n\nFor me the star attraction at Peppermill is the Onion Rings.  I started my cooking career at Howard Johnson's decades ago, and besides being a great place to get ice cream HoJo's made a few things very well that brought customers back.  Onion rings were thickly hand-sliced then dipped in condensed milk, then battered, dipped in condensed milk a second time, then battered again before deep frying.  The results were amazing, and Peppermill's got a good process, too, as their O-Rings brought me right back to HoJo's kitchen in Maple Shade, NJ.\n\nPrices are not cheap, though they are not casino-expensive either.  Any way you look at it, you'll find lots of yummy food, served by good people and fair prices.\n\nIf you're at the Convention Center take the walk or pay the cab fare.  Considering the food there you'll thank me later, fellow Yelper.
