I came here for lunch around 11:30 on a Saturday. There were only a few other tables occupied when we came, but it was getting full as we left. We were sitting at one of the side booths with the rounded padded seats. It looked more comfortable than it was, but overall the decor was nice.\n\nWe had the AYCE menu, and it was pretty much average for an AYCE place. It seemed like the sushi rolls came with lots of rice, but the maki rolls less so. We enjoyed the \"Alaska Roll\"; it had thin rice paper instead of rice. Cooked items were generally good, including the beef short ribs. The pork cutlet was quite small but it's AYCE so you can always order another.\n\nThe waitresses were all very pleasant and we got almost everything we ordered. They forgot to bring the golden shrimp, but we didn't realize until after we'd paid so it was too late to reorder. Everyone on YELP seems to recommend that particular dish so we'll try it again when we return.\n\nOverall we were quite satisfied and would go back when we're in the area.
