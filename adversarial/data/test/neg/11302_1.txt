The best seafood in the East Valley. Pacific Club is far more expensive but the quality is the same. Salt Cellar has been there since 1972 or whatever year for a reason. Only negative; they don't offer a Cesar salad. You'll be impressed with the uniqueness of this small, little gem. Make reservations in advance
