Bellagio had the best quality of food among the buffets I tried. Unfortunately, this buffet was not a part of the 24 hour buffet pass. However, after eating at the Rio Seafood Buffet, Flamingo Buffet, and Harrahs Buffet, Bellagio was much better as far as quality. The price is higher than the 24 hour pass buffets, but it's worth it.
