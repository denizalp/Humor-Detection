This place fucking sucks!!!!!!!! I've had my nails for only two days & two nails have fallen off already!  & not to mention my nails are all kinds of shapes, & sizes. I got my nails done by Tommy & he was swearing he had 30 year experience, yeah right!!! I had to keep telling him to fix my nails to the point where I didn't even want to keep on telling him anymore. I could of been an asshole & walked out without paying nor giving tip but I'm not a messed up person. Me not coming back & leaving this bad review will do! PLEASE DONT COME HERE!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!! I've been getting my nails done since I was 9 years old so I know when a good job is being done or not. I called Charlie to see if he can refund me the money that I payed for my freaking nails & he said no to a refund or doing a whole complete new set for me. How the hell are going to tell me that you're going to fix them when they aren't even fixable & then has the audacity to say \"I can't do them free for you because I I'm here to work & to make money\" yeah idiot but you're getting money from the customers coming to your shitty ass salon, if you're losing people you aren't making money so learn how to be more professional!! If I can give this place 0 starts I would!!!
