This place was amazing from start to finish. My hubby and I ordered the fajitas for two (just under $30) and were overwhelmed by the amount of food we got. Chips with two kinds of salsa and bean dip, two cups of soup, six tortillas, two plates of beans and rice, two trays with pico de gallo and sour cream and guacamole, and a huge serving of sizzling steak, shrimp, peppers, and onions. Which they lit on fire when they brought it too our table, which was awesome. It was delicious, and for the sheer amount of food, the price can't be beat. (The leftovers made a huge lunch for us the next day.) We also ordered horchata, which comes with free refills. It was on the sweet side, but I enjoyed it. Very impressed, and we'll go back again the next time we pass through Vegas.
