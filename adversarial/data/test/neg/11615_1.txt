My wife made an appointment after finding out she was pregnant. After having an ectopic pregnancy before, that resulted in one of her tubes being removed, we were quite anxious to find out everything was going well. My wife just wanted to get her HCG levels checked to ensure everything was progressing normally. When we got to the office, the appointment was not in his books and the office staff couldn't care less.The staff weren't even willing to help her get a rushed appointment even considering she's a high-risk pregnancy. I would encourage everyone to find an office with a more professional and compassionate staff.
