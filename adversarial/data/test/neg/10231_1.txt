This place is huge! I sometimes come here just to walk around and look at random things. Customer service is ok here, it's either hit or miss depending on who's working and you usually have to seek out help. Don't come here expecting to stand around thinking that someone is going to ask if you need help. The employees here are either really busy, or they don't have enough people working to cover the store. Pricing is moderate, some things are overpriced. I really like their selection of store branded items such as Red Head, Bass Pro, etc. Good quality items without the name brand price. Also, if you sign up for the rewards program you can collect points for a 2% rebate on eligible purchases. This is one of the main reasons I continue to shop here
