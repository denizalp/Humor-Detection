I recently had a horrible experience with this business. \n\nTravelex stated to me numerous times when I first purchased euros from them that they would buy the euros back at the same rate that I purchased them at. \n\nI returned from Europe with some euros still on my card and she offered me 33% less than what I bought the euros for. She tried to tell me that I probably misunderstood her because of her poor English. \n\nI never misunderstood her, I asked her numerous times during our conversation about their buyback policy. She told me quite a few times that they would buyback the euros left on the card at the rate that I purchased them at. \n\nI feel that she lied and manipulated me into purchasing euros from their company and that the transaction process would be so easy, when it has been the complete opposite. \n\nI would advise anyone that is thinking about doing business here to speak with their banks first and not stop in travelex as they do not practice honest business with consumers.
