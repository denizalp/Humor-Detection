As a barista visiting Montreal from the Pacific NW, I had a hard time finding a good coffee shop. \nPourquoi Pas offers multiple beans that are medium roast (a rarity here!) and takes the time to weigh each shot and prepare them with care. Absolutely left any other cafe we visited in the dust, we came here every day after our first visit :) \nThe environment is great and the staff friendly. \nDefinitely stop in.
