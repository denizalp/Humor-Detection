Let's just say, it's refreshing to step into the lovely Planet Hollywood and to be embraced with quality decor, great service and overall good energy and vibes.\n\nI come to Vegas all the time, since I am from Los Angeles, and have tried a variety of places....I have two high strong recommendations\n\n1) planet hollywood\n2) aria\n\n\nHave a great Vegas trip and good luck ;)
