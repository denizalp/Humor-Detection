Good donut, fun and decadent- also love that it's open 24 hours. What I don't love is being rushed and pressured to order within their guidelines. I think the girl told me \"no\" about 5 times on my visit. Let me just order what I want and then charge me what it costs. Tired of the: \"that doesn't come on that box, you can't do that one\" just give me what I want and then give me a bill! Frustrating- I'm a customer- make it easy for me to give you my money for premium donuts.
