Whenever we come with our friends, we either stay at the Venetian or Palazzo.  We've stayed in either the Venetian or Palazzo more than five times and have never been disappointed.  If you have a big group, this is the place to stay at because they also have sofa beds and the rooms are classy, spacious, and clean.  On top of that, they have a good selection of restaurants on the property and nice pools.  We've also made a few trips to their nightclub TAO and have had a blast there.\n\nOn our most recent stay, the room I had booked was unavailable, but they graciously upgraded us to the Penthouse suite which was AMAZING.  I couldn't believe how lucky we were.  They asked me if I wanted a piano or a fireplace, which I thought was pretty funny.  Why would you need a fireplace in a hotel?  So we opted for the grand piano even though none of us could play it.  The Penthouse suite was HUGE and more than enough space for us.  There was also a sound system that was easy to use.  After a long night of clubbing, we all soaked our feet in the giant tub with the complimentary bath salts.  They also had Robert Cavalli toiletries when we stayed in the Penthouse, but they smelled very masculine.  \n\nI hope we get the chance to stay in one of their Penthouse suites again because it really made our trip memorable!
