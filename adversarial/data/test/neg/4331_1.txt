I think this place is awesome staff is super nice and the place is immaculate!!!! They always make me feel welcome. I have been taking the Trufusion classes and have had a lot of Rad instruction and help from the team. Miss the trufusion60 on Tuesday and Thursday morning. Invigorate is the class that replaced it. Guess I better step it up. Thanks Trufusion Team.
