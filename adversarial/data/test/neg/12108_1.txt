While in Las Vegas for business, a friend recommended this restaurant. Loved it! Food was great, service was first-class, and the atmosphere was very relaxing and quiet (a welcome diversion from the loud sights and sounds of Vegas). \n\nThe waiter was informative about the menu and very helpful in making our choices amongst all the great-sounding meals. There are familiar dishes on the menu...and some very unique as well. I had a creamy pumpkin soup (with the spices just right), and fish cooked perfectly with a light, yet flavorful sauce. The wines were varied, and my very affordable Cabernet was rich and smooth. \n\nThis is the type of restaurant, that if I lived nearby, I can see it becoming a regular!
