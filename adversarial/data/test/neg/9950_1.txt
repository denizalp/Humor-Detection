Excellent excellent food. Excellent service. My husband took me here for my birthday and every member of the staff wished me a happy birthday. Champagne was brought to the table, delicious birthday dessert. Started with risotto and it was delicious. Lamb as my main was gorgeous and delicious. Yes, it's expensive but it's worth it. You get what you pay for here.
