I crave pancakes every now and then. I also tend to crave then late in the day, meaning that I need to find an all-day breakfast place. \n\nWimpy's fixes all my first-world pancake needs! I ordered three blueberry pancakes with a side order of ham. For the record, I tend to do pork sausages, but changed it up a bit. Everything was yummy. My pancakes were done perfectly. I also got to hoard the bottle of maple syrup for a bit. \n\nI like Wimpy's. The music suits my style, as I can listen to 80's music until everyone around me gets sick! The servers here are always nice. It's comfy. \n\nFree wifi is wonderful, too. Otherwise, I wouldn't be posting this review so quickly!\n\nThere's plenty of parking, as the diner is at the north war corner of Elgin Mills and Bayview. \n\nIf you'd like a quiet place to eat, this diner is for you. There is actually a guy doing work in a booth while he chows down. I don't recommend doing work when you are hungry, but it's an ideal work setting than a loud coffee shop, for instance.
