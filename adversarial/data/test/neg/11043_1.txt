Food is usually good at any Baton Rouge. Service is OK also. Probably why it is one of my restaurants of choice when surrounded by chain restaurants. However this location is a must avoid. I assume it must be closing down soon based on the condition of the restaurant. The seats are ripped and worn. The menus are all tattered and grimy. Graffiti is carved into the bathroom walls. I'm not sure why the hostess would choose to seat us in the grimy back corner next to a pile of high chairs and table parts when the restaurant was 95% empty at 6:30. We couldn't get out of there fast enough. I felt sorry for my kid who suggested it for his birthday - he had to listen to the rest of us make jokes about the filthy, dumpy state of this hole. At least the food and server was good. Note to chef: you may cook your burgers slightly pink intentionally I'm ok with that I often order them that way but a Kids menu burger pink. LOL. Waitress was excellent However very low points for service when you consider the host seated us in the worst seat in the house (and despite having a reservation) when the restaurant was empty. That table next to the pile of furniture and high chairs with ripped seats should be the LAST table filled. The final laugh was seeing the best location award proudly displayed at the entrance. Close this dump it's an embarrassment to the brand.
