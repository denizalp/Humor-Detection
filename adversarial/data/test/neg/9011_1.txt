It's safe to say that the first time I went to a Gal's Sushi restaurant, it was 10 years ago. Back then, they had a location near Bayview on Highway 7 (near the YogaTree plaza) and that was probably before this location even opened. Both locations used to be owned by a Korean family I think and I LOVED this place. I used to come religiously every week. Their sushi and Korean dishes were so affordable and so good. Even when I didn't come to eat, I'd come get takeout. \n\nI think in the past year or so, they've sold it to new owners. Although the menu hasn't changed, I think the prices went up a bit and the quality\/authenticity has gone down quite a lot. I miss the days when it was really really good.
