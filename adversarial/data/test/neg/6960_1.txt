What a lucky find. Traveling through Ohio on the way to a family wedding in Nebraska from Maryland. What a find. After our \"Diners Drive-ins and Dives\" pick (Geraci's) was closed due to a power failure we quickly Yelped for alternatives and this place popped up. Intrigued by the description and eating at several great Jewish Delis in Philly we gave it a try. Great luck. The family had  potato pancakes appetizer, chicken noodle soup, hot borscht, onion rings with a triple decker (corned beef AND pastrami) the mini bagel sampler and the veggie burger. All were great. \nTo top it off the manager brought our table a huge iPad mini sized brownie because it was my daughters 18nth birthday. What great customer service.  \nI also had the old fashioned seltzer where there was so much carbon dioxide in it it made my nose burn as I drank. \nI'd most definitely come again. This is the kind of place you don't forget.
