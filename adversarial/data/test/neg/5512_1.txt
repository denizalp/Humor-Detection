The restaurant is a small narrow strip that is painted a beautiful shade of Tiffany blue! There is some seating space, but very limited as it is only a row of chairs facing a long table that lines the walls.\n\nYou can order from the menu, or customize your own poke wrap or bowl. The wrap (burrito) only comes in a regular size, while the bowl can be regular sized or small sized. Regular costs roughly $12, while small costs about $8.\n\nFor the regular sized bowl and wrap, you can get the choice of any two proteins. I chose a half-half base of sushi rice and zucchini noodles, with raw salmon and red tuna. I got all the toppings except for jalape√±o, and my three mix-ins were nori, tobiko, and seaweed salad. The portions are super generous! Although I only got a tablespoon of each topping, it was more than enough. The seaweed salad was a huge amount, and there were many fish chunks. In fact, I was so stuffed by the end of it all that I couldn't even touch the sushi rice (what a waste). My only complaint was that the zucchini noodles were quite difficult to eat, causing the sauce and whatnot to splash all over my face!\n\nMy sister ordered a wrap and said that it was not as good as Corners by Spoon and Fork in Mississauga. Although she didn't get all the toppings, they were still unable to fully wrap her burrito. She got the wasabi sauce, and found the entire burrito too saucy and spicy. In the end, she left most of the fish and half of the burrito untouched.\n\nIt's a pretty decent meal, but given my sister's experience, I'd advise getting the sauce on the side!
