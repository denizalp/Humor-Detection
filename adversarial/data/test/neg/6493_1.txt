We loved this place for a lot of reasons great atmosphere, music, and food. The fried bacon was great, but it wasn't what you would think. Very nice. Brunch was great on Sun. Sit outside if it isn't too hot you'll enjoy it....Whatch out for the bloody mary's though they're a little on the spicy side.
