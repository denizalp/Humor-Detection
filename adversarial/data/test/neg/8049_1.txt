I thought that this place for a bit overpriced for what you got.  The chicken was so-so.  They did have a nice selection of sauces but nothing original.   The Texas toast was a slice of bread and not really Texas toast. We also ordered the fried pickles and have had them before.  They were ok, not a lot of flavor or crispiness though.   Oh well at least we tried it.
