I'll keep this short and sweet, because that's what my visits here usually are.\n\nI've had the crab roll, the spicy shrimp roll, and the gyoza so far, and each one far outshines the usual Asian fare I find around town. The atmosphere is cozy, and the price point is great for a quick bite. The staff is very friendly too. Great place for lunch downtown.
