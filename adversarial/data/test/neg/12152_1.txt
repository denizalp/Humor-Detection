Went there 3 times. First time was not a good experience. They seated us by the kitchen so it was very loud. Couldn't have a conversation. \n\nSecond time: Went there with one of my girlfriends. Again, we were seated by the kitchen. The restaurant was not very busy. When I asked to be moved, we weren't moved. Their reasoning was that tables were reserved for others. Ok. Sure.\n\nThird time: Well I wanted to give it a fair chance so I went there for the third time. Same seat. I'm wondering if they just did that to me or others as well. \n\nAll three times service was slow. Food was not that great. For an Italian restaurant, food was very Americanized. If that is a word. \n\nNot very happy. Will not go back. But at least I gave it a shot. Three times.
