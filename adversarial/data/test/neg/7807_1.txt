A wonderful show!\n\nThis is not the touring company, but a resident production that will be in town (hopefully) for years to come. That tenure means that they can can do things with lighting, sets and sound  that just can't be done on the road. It is beautiful. The live, 24-piece orchestra is something that is rarely heard these days, and is a joy to experience.\n\nWith only one major cut (the dreadful \"Morning Report\" is, thankfully, gone) the show runs just a few minutes shorter than the Broadway production.\n\nAlthough it is kid-friendly, this is not children's  theater, and little kids will probably find it too long and wordy. It  is - as Joseph Campbell would say - \"The Hero's Journey\" re-told to wonderful effect with African music and costumes. The Elton John\/Tim Rice pop songs keep it accessible to a younger crowd, but adults will love the breathtaking scenery and wonderful story-telling style. Everyone likes the puppetry and mask work which harken back to the origins of theater and ritual.\n\nOne of my favorite shows in Las Vegas.
