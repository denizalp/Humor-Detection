I come here for Dr. Schroeder he performed surgery in 2014 and did an amazing job and now I check in for maintenance.  There's a surgery center attached which is convenient sometimes there's a bit of a wait but there are several physicians here.  Schroeder takes him with his patients and he is worth the wait.
