\"While staying at the Venetian I stumbled across sushi samba a restaurant I am well aware of since I live in Miami and they have another location on Lincoln Rd.. The food was as amazing as it is in Miami I have to say the service was much better in Las Vegas then Miami. The only thing it was lacking was the ambience I am use to Miami were they have a dj inside the restaurant playing music at all times didn't get much of that in this restaurant, but overall great experience. \n\nRecommendations: Edamame Yellowtail tacos (fav appetizer) Sea bass is delicious\" el topo roll.
