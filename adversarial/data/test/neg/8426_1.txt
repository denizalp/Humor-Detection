Wow, how have I never been here before? I had an appointment here today with Renee and it was honestly one of the better hair styling sessions I've ever had! She was very attentive to what I was looking to do and was very personable the entire time. Everyone I encountered was super friendly and made for a great experience, but especially Renee who cleaned up a year's worth of hair damage and left me grinning from ear to ear. Definitely ask for her if you call in, she was great.
