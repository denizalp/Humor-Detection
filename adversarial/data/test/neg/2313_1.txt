Not sure what they could do better or worse, great bakery items.  Staff is friendly enough.\n\nWhile I can \"tell the difference\" between bread\/cookies from here and from Giant Eagle I'm not sure it's worth the inconvenience for me.   Pincus is a bit of a drive and doesn't take credit cards.  Given that the cookies are $1.50+ that adds up quick when you're buying for more than yourself.\n\nAll in all, I'd recommend it for anyone that's in the area.
