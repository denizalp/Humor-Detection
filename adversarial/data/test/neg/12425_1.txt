Went for lunch today and it was very crowded. I understand that, but no one was seating customers so I stood in the doorway for 10 minutes -not a good start. Once I finally got a seat the service wasn't great. I saw my server three times - order, bring food, checkout. The lunch special is a lot of food. I got the Las Vegas roll, shrimp tempura roll, gyoza, and miso soup. It was fresh but I didn't think the sushi was very flavorful. It had size on its side but not as good as others I've tried.
