Wanted to personally thank everyone working here and recommend them to anyone looking for superb service and reliability. Been going to them consistently since this location opened and prior to that the Main St. Location in Mesa. We've been with Sun Devil Auto for over 20 years and can't say enough about how they've taken care of all our family vehicles each and everytime. Kudos and gratitude from a loyal customer and family.
