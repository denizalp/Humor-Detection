We used El Grito catering for the rehearsal dinner the night before our wedding. We did the \"drop off\" option and everything went so smoothly. The employees who dropped it off were helpful (and arrived exactly at the pre-arranged time), the ingredients were so well-organized\/packaged and labelled so we could set it up easily, and everything was delicious.
