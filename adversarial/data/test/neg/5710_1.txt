Definitely worth a try.  High points for originality and fresh ingredients.  \nI have to admit I'm not necessarily a vegan kind of guy, but with the sky high ratings, I was hoping for the best pierogies of my life.  Didn't get the best anything of my life, except polish beer on draft.\nWe interacted with three servers.  One very nice, one indifferent, and one a little unfriendly.\nPrice was reasonable.
