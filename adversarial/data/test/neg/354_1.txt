We've had the orange chicken, shrimp fried rice, sesame chicken, crab puffs, & teriyaki chicken. All of it has been consistently fantastic. Staff is super friendly & the mango tea rocks too. My favorite is definitley the orange chicken. The breading kind of reminds me of the mochiko chicken I had in Hawaii. So far we've had excellent experiences every visit! :)
