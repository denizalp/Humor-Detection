The service we received from Calliber was exceptional.  Brandy at the front desk made us feel very comfortable as well as Chris our service advisor! We dropped our car off last Tuesday and was told it would be this Friday before she would be done but she was done yesterday to our satisfaction.  We could not be happier with the daily updates and service we received.  Thank you all for your exceptional and timely work!
