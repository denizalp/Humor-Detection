Chino Bandido was featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. \n\nProbably one of the most interesting menu's that you will find. Chino Bandido's menu consists of Mexican, Chinese, and Caribbean choices and allows you to mix and match cuisine items. \n\nAfter seeing the Jade Red Chicken featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, I decided to go with it. I kept it simple and ordered a bowl of the Jade Red Chicken with white rice. \n\nThe Jade Red sauce was very good and is the main reason that I rate Chino Bandido as above average. It had a sweet and slightly spicy flavor and is different then any sauce that I've ever tasted.\n\nThe service was fast enough, and some-what friendly and the prices were ok.\n\nThe tasty Jade Red sauce along with a very unique experience gives Chino Bandido and above average rating of four stars.
