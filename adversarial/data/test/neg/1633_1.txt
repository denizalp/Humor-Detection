I've been a patient for over 10 years and have never had anything but great experiences.\nAnd I HATE going to the dentist. The staff is extremely friendly and makes me feel comfortable and less anxious. Dr. Sielicki has a great manner and disposition and the quality of work is absolutely excellent.\nTop notch facility and technology.
