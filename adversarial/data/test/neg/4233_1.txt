I would give the food 5 stars but the place is not ideal for sitting down with small chairs and no washroom, thought its kept very clean.. \n\nThey serve subs\/salad\/soup. The subs are amazing and much more valuable than subway.. They are what you would call FRESH and HEALTHY (of course if you choose your toppings wisely).\n\nI usually get the roasted chicken on wholewheat bread and just love how fresh and good it tastes. \n\nI also tried the chicken salad which had plenty of chicken slices on it and was a great portion. \n\nThey also do catering for parties and the platters look very good on picture, thought I've never actually tried them.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend you give them a try.. I've heard good things about the stake as well!
