Really nothing you can say bad about the Winking Lizard! Great service, the hostess was super friendly, our waitress was extremely helpful. The employees seem to enjoy their jobs and put you first. Great atmosphere. Everyone in the group enjoyed their meal. I would give 5 stars but it does have average bar food. Nothing fantastic but nothing bad at all. Nachos have standard ballpark cheese on them. If you go, make sure you get something with BBQ sauce. They also have a 32oz Miller Lite for around $4, it was a great deal! I enjoyed the Winking Lizard.
