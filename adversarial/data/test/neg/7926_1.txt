The host was very helpful and although they were very busy, he was very helpful and gave us the table that we were asking for. Another staff was very nice and super helpful as well.\nThe food was very good, the only downfall that I can say, their chicken liver mouse looked like it's been seating in the fridge for a while, but still tasty.\nThey had a band that was playing jazz. That was enjoyable as well. the atmosphere is very nice. we were seated in their patio area, which had a very nice natural light, and the temperature was very pleasant.\nI had raw beef tartar. It was my first time, so I cannot compare it to anything, however, I found it very fresh, and the presentation was amazing. Raw meat and raw quail egg sound very risky to eat. I had it, and I'm still perfectly healthy, so I can say that they're doing a great job on keeping their food fresh and healthy.
