Just happen to stop in here and it was 1\/2 price burger day. The place was super crowded but we had a drink at the bar and waited for a table for about 20min, which was not bad. THe burger were large and I felt very tasty. We enjoyed the meal and the Mgr was nice to chat with as he stopped by the guests tables. We would stop in again.
