Jankiest full set of my life. All I wanted were short, natural looking acrylics (I'm a nail biter). My acrylics are about 1\/4 inch thick and completely misshapen. I had to go home and file them myself because one hand the nails were longer than the other and the shape was horrid. One side was rounded while the other was square. I kept pointing it out and the girl would \"fix\" them but the shape was still awful. I will never ever return. I can't wait until I need a fill so I can go somewhere else and have them fixed. Awful!
