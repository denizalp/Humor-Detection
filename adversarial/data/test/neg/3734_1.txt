The best Chinese take out in Denver, easily.  But don't think you're getting some kind of rubbish food here, mind you.  While your food is ready faster than you would ever expect, the quality of the food is far beyond what you pay for it.  The sauces are all perfect - whether sweet or savory.  The vegetables have the right texture.  The meat is fresh and cooked just right.  And the service is second-to-none.  \n\nGreat dishes we've tried:  sesame chicken, chicken with garlic sauce, sweet & sour chicken, general tso's chicken, hot & spicy beef.  I don't remember trying more than those, because it's hard to mess with perfection!  We've been going here for years.  Egg rolls and fried rice are excellent as well.  And free iced tea is hard to beat!\n\nPortions are massive, prices are not.  My three daughters are love the place, too (ages 2, 4, and 7).
