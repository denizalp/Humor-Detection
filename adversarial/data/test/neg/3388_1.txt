I don't particularly LOVE Mexican food (East Coaster) and I don't often choose Mexican over other kinds of foods. But this place is awesome! Got a smoked pork burrito and it was soooo good! Smoked in house and the crispy ends were included, best part! Will mostly definitely be visiting this little spot again.
