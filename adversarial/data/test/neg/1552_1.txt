I was very excited to eat here. We were sat right away. The atmosphere was charming & fun. We started looking at the menu everything looked wonderful. Another table was sat right next to us & their waiter promptly arrived taking their drink order & we still waited. We waited for 10 minutes with no one coming to our table. We decided to get up & leave due to time constraints because we were going to a shower & if we waited 10 minutes with no one acknowledging us how long would it take to get our food?  As we left we told the hostess what happened & she was very apologetic asking my name & said if we came back after the show she would have a table for us she made no love to write my name down or put into a computer.
