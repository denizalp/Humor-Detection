Went here to shoot my own gun and bought their ammo. Great ammo prices for range time. The downside is that hands guns and rifles are the same area so every now and again you get pelted with the person next to you rounds. But I also went to shoot one of their packages with a friend and they're priced good compared to everyone else. Wish you'd get more rounds but hey,  this isn't a charity. I had fun though. The instructor was nice and they make it a great spot for tourists and locals a like. Would recommend to a friend.
