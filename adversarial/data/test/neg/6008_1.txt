Not a fan.  Contrived, with terrible rental clubs (of course with top golf brand) and low flight balls.  Had to buy a glove because of course they couldn't provide one.  They charge to become a member, charge for gloves, charge for the bay, charge for the food, charge for the drinks, charge for the air to breathe.  \n\nScoring system is a joke.  The targets are like drains so everything tunnels to them, especially the ugliest struck shots.  Only thing that was good was the service.  Won't be back.
