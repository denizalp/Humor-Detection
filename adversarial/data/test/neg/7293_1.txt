The mattress we chose was great!! The price was reasonable.. The only reason I'm giving only 3 stars is because our sales associate Eric Nelson who is also a manager there never informed us our bed would come without a mattress frame. I gave this as a gift to my family and was so disappointed to come to their house and see there brand new king size bed on the floor. If Mr. Nelson would have told me that it was not included I would have made sure to buy one so their new bed would not be on the floor. I feel that for the amount w paid in cash he could have at least let me know it would not be included. So if anyone buys a mattress there please make sure you tell them you want a bed frame.
