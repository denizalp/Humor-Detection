Good all the way around. Used Yelp to find something in the area we found ourselves in, and wow! We would have settle for a disappointment just to quickly find something to eat, but we really scored!\nI had the baked penne with marinara bolognese sauce, which is one of the best I have eating in a resturant. \n\nEven if you are just kinda feeling like Italian, don't think, just head over.
