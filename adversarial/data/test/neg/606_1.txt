I love this store.  Nowhere else that I know of shoots video of you in the shoes before you buy them so you can see exactly how they are fitting in your foot and what your foot and ankle is doing.  They really take the time to get you the right fighting shoe for your particular foot.  \n\nI also love their molded insoles.  I had (have) plantar fasciitis and the insoles have relieved all of my foot pain.  Each of my kids broke a foot in the past year and neither have had any foot issues since being in the insoles. \n\nI highly recommend them.  We worked with Sheryl today on the fit and insoles for my younger son and she was great. Kyle was also very helpful. We feel like we really got the right shoe for his foot and appreciate.
