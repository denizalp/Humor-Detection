After we were rushed to order at the drive thru (no one else was even there), we waited at the window for close to 5 min confused why the worker hadn't greeted us or had taken our payment. So we walked inside and with no greeting the worker blurted our order. No eye contact or smile, we felt awkward and felt as if we were inconveniencing him
