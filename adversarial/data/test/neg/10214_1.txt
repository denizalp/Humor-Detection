Came to this location for the first time sometime in July 2015 for my mom's birthday.\nWe had made reservations at the Leslieville location (which I had been to many times), unfortunately it was storming out and a patio umbrella was swept up by the wind and knocked down their power supply. So after being told we could not order any food (and receiving zero compensation for the drinks we had already ordered) we had to switch locations. We called the Queen West location and told them what had happened and not only did this girl have poor phone etiquette, but she also said they would not reserve a table for us as we only had 3 people....however when our waitress was kind enough to call Ossington they were very understanding and had our table ready when we arrived. The server at Ossington was super sweet and he was great with my 1 year old niece who was infatuated with him.\n\nThe food is delicious!\nLobster Mac & Cheese is great, as well as the Lobster Poutine.\nThe Maine Roll is my absolute favourite though, there is sooo much lobster and it is just delicious. The french fries are also a hit on their own.\nThe Lobster dip was really good too, a bit too much fennel for my taste though. Not sure if they sell it anymore as it is not on their online menu.\n\nI am not a Caesar fan but my mom and sister both loved theirs, which is to be expected as they have been winning best Caesar in Toronto for a few years.\n\nFood has always been a solid 10\/10. \nService at THIS location was superb, but I was really disappointed with Queen West and Leslieville.
