yeah, it's probably overpriced, but we got a good midweek deal for $110\/night, so since it was on the husband's expense account, we gave it a try.  the rooms are nice for Vegas -- the suite format, with a separate living room, was especially nice when the husband was on conference calls at 5am.  Nice big bathroom.  Average toiletries and linens -- I'd be pissed to pay upwards of $250\/night or more for that.  Our room got really cold, very oddly, and maid service didn't come until 6pm. The plumbing is VERY loud.   And the flat screen TVs (all three of them!) were either of sub-par quality or the cable quality sucks in Vegas.  It's good if you're on a \"business\" trip or get a deal, but otherwise I probably wouldn't return.
