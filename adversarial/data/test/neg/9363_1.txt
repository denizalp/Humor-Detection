No major issues they were fast, friendly, and courteous. The food was okay nothing special it was packaged a bit messy. This is my first time to a rally's and the burgers were really small (they were like the hamburger size from mcdonalds the $1 ones ) The fries  were made different and were very tasty. My son ordered a blue slushee and he enjoyed it very much. I also ordered the boneless wings and they were okay, but for me they were super spicy and again they were served messy. If I had to choose a fast food restaurant again this would not be one for me.
