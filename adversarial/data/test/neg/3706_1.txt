I have been getting eyelash extensions (Glamour set) from Shylah F. for almost a year and I truly LOVE them. The extensions are natural looking, they make my eyes look bright, therefore I rarely wear eye shadow and I always receive compliments. \n\nShylah is highly skilled and truly compassionate about her work. I enjoy the time as she provides a comfortable and calming environment. So if you are thinking about getting eyelash extensions I highly recommend Skin Glo and Shylah F.\nSuzanne
