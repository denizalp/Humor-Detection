This was a very pleasant place to stay.  The suite was large, and clean, the bed was super comfortable.  There is not much more you can ask for.  Even tht partition between the sleeping and living area, each with its own TV was pretty cool.  The facilities had everything you could need, with a little snack station, to shuttle service, a great restaurant, pool, and services for flights and business.  This was a great trip and I'm sure to return. I should also add the complementary breakfast was awesom and the priority club express check in was done in under 3 minutes.  The service was very good.  This place offers value for the money.
