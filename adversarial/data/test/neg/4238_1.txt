Even though my husband kept referring to it as \"a damn hipster restaurant\", we both really enjoyed the experience and the meal. \n\nWe had a great waitress to start things off! Her name is Vanessa, she wasn't a total food\/beer snob, she made great recommendations on the menu, and made sure we had a positive experience. \n\nWe started with drinks, my husband is kiiiiind of a beer snob so he enjoyed the selections. I had the \"crushed velvet\" and LOVED IT. Great drink, freshly made, superb balance of alcohol and mixer. I was super impressed. \nWe chose the buffalo cauliflower for our appetizer, and it was awesome! Flavorful batter on the cauliflower and extra buffalo sauce if you wanted to make them spicier. I highly recommend this appetizer to everyone. \nI got the The Huntsman burger for me entree, and it was good. A little undercooked but I'm cool with that. Very hearty, and the carmelized onions help balance the flavor. My husband had the wild mushroom and telaggio pizza. He loved it! Again, great balance of flavor. \nWe finished off the meal with the Nutella ice cream cookie with bacon brittle. Yum. Don't need to say much else. \n\nIt was a really positive experience and I will definitely be back. The only con is that the music is really loud. Or maybe I'm just getting old.
