My first impression of the Hyatt place was not very good. Seems like an old beater they've tried to put a face lift on. The rooms have been lived in for years and don't have the best smell. The hotel seems quite far from my work center for the week in downtown Phoenix. But, as I stayed there longer I was more and more ok with it. There is no stores or restaurants or bars within a walkable distance. ASU campus, mill avenue and other great spots were fairly close. The room served its purpose and the staff was very kind. Just could use a renovation in the rooms in the near future. And maybe a facelift to the pool and fitness areas, and the elevators and hallways. Lobby and kitchen \/ bar area is good though!\n\nPros: Free wifi, free continental breakfast, free parking, very few kids, if any, big rooms, fairly good beds, shuttle picks up and drops off anywhere within 5 miles including Airport, somewhat close to ASU campus and several great bars and restaurants. \n\nCons: Mildew or cigarette smell everywhere you go, Dirty and small pool, dirty and small fitness room, not to close to downtown Phoenix.
