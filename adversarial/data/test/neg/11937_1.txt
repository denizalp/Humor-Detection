I found Elements Therapeutic Massage online, based strictly on geography. When I called to inquire about an appointment I was greeted politely and professionally, and my appointment was booked quickly. Upon my arrival I was again greeted and provided with new client paperwork. The facility is quiet and serene, well-decorated and maintained. My Therapist Clare was very communicative, asking about my preferences in terms of style of massage as well as degree of pressure. We discussed my experience with massage, and any problem areas or old injuries. The massage itself was the best massage I have ever received, and I have been a proponent of massage therapy for over a decade. My session started and ended on time (crucial for anyone on a tight schedule...which is almost everyone), and I look forward to my next session at Elements. There was no part of this experience with which I could find fault, and I give both Clare and Elements Massage of Summerlin the highest possible recommendations.
