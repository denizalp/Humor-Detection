It's an Arby's like any other Arby's...    staff's always been friendly and food's always been a good value.       The facility seems clean,  even if the interior's a bit dated - I don't go to a quick serve restaurant to be wowed by the ambiance.  \n\nI'm giving them 4 stars because as Arby's go,  they're fine.
