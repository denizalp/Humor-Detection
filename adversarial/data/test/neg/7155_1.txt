Update...I was contacted by who I believe to be Marks boss, although I didn't catch his name.  He  did not call to make things right or apologize in anyway.   His only concern was the above review.  In our short conversation he said he had reviewed what had been said between Abraham and I.  I find this hard to believe.  How could he have reviewed the messages left on my phone without contacting me to get them?  He also said that 99.9 percent of all pool customers allow their equipment to be taken without any permission what so ever.  He repeated this numerous times.  He said he was aware of what Abraham had called me and that it was my fault for threatening him by saying I would file a police report if my equipment wasn't returned.  They also ( not sure who) dumped someone elses used pump on my front patio and left it there even though I asked them to remove it and return mine...He also said that there isn't a judge anywhere who would side with me because this is how the industry is..which I do not believe.  I think most pool companies are reputable and that their customers matter to them.
