This place is just like being in mainland Spain ,it's small and relaxed , the staff are very friendly and helpful .\nWe opted for the Serrano ham and cheese toasted sandwich and cafe con leche and it was great plus free wifi. The whole front of the cafe opens up soon a hot sunny day you can sit and watch the world go by!
