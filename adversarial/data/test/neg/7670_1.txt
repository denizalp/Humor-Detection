Scheduled a well visit with a rescue I adopted. The well visit and stool worm test was done. Sold me a color and ear medication. Thought the price was high $214 but this is my first dog. I called back to get a heartworm test and was quoted $149-200 and told them that was too much. I called another vet and was told that I couldn't get the test without the well visit. Dr Anger's office refused to allow the other vet the permission (?) to write a script, even though she did the well visit if the dog needed it. I'll check with PAWS-I feel like I'm being extorted-don't put yourself through this ordeal.
