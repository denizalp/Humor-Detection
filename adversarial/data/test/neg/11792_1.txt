I wish I could give this place 0 stars!!! I have had several terrible experiences here and today just topped it off! They run consistently late for appts. They do not follow through with what employees say. They lost all of my sons' information for the order of their glasses and they do not stand behind their frames!!! I have contacted corporate and I'm awaiting a call back. Let's see if they even follow through!
