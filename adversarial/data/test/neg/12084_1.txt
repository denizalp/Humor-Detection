By far the worst service I have ever experienced. I waited more than 30 minutes for eggs over easy, bacon, potatoes & toast. When my order finally came I received eggs almost raw, sausage (not bacon) & toast (no potatoes). My server gave me a 10% discount for my trouble. For the first time in my life, I left no tip. While I was waiting, one guy who had been waiting a long time made a fuss, and was assured his breakfast would come soon, & be boxed for to-go. He ended up running to his gate without eating because he was so late. I'd rename this dive \"Losers!\"
