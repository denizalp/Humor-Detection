Can I say I have been dying to try this place.\n\nFirst a word for the wary, it's super popular so make sure that you get a reservation. However, I went for lunch, so I will be reviewing that.\n\nMy friend Cam and I love our BYOBs. It's an awesome way to enjoy your food properly without the hassle of stumbling through your budget and the often meager selections. Cam is the wino and I pick the food [it works] today we had a Williamette Valley Pinto Gris 2013 which is fruity and perfect for so many items on this menu. \n\nWalking in the first things that I noticed was the smell of Brussel Sprouts [the rave] which automatically told me that it was going to be an elongated space which a direct line from the kitchen to the reception space [wind tunnel] which is perfect for speed and customer service allowing any potential short staffed scenarios to be minimized. I seated myself at one of the two seaters on the left side of the room. Immediately ahead and behind me you could find chalk board with the specials from the menu. Perfect. Unfortunately my current new shoutout item of grilled octopus is only a dinner item [:-( I will be back for that]. \n\nThe menu is short and sweet on a single slim placard divided in beginning, mains and sides, the deserts you are told by the waiter. We were brought our waters [with lemon of course] and wine glasses promptly but he scattered to give us time to order. \n\nWe started with a beginner to share the Vegetable Tempura in a Japanese Aioli. There are two veggies, carrots and asparagus and they are just slightly battered where the entire vegetable is covered but not drenched. Delightful. What a great start.\n\nI was torn between two dishes for main but settled on the Wild Mushroom and Roasted Squash Pappadelle with Rosemary crumbs and Chevre. I love it, however I do not consider it perfect. The portion was just right, the Chevre was meltaway to moisten and enhance you mushrooms, the shrooms were lovely and woody but the pappadelle were slightly too al dente for me. Maybe an extra 15-30 seconds would have been good for me. Oh well. I sized filled me up well. Cam got the Grilled Chicken burger that came with greens. I personally am not a Burger go-to burger but it looked delicious. Beware of the fluffy bun. \n\nWhat I can't forget. The side of Brussel Sprouts. How could I smell it and not get them? Seriously. Duh. Anyways, first of all this is not a side, this is an appetizer and perfect to share, almost too much. They are charred roasted to perfection, crispy as all heck and accompanied with super salty candied bacon. Perfect, perfect, especially with the fruity wine. Weird, I know! But it did it for me.\n\nAt this point I was satisfied and full but Cam wanted desert. There were two available, either a Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee and a tri-flavored icecream with pineapple pieces and a maraschino cherry that made it in a icecream pineapple upside down cake in a bowl. Great, great! Love the fruit variety but I will say that those chocolate lovers will be disappointed. \n\nBetween the desert and the pappadelle I had to knock off a Star because It was just not perfect for me. But that is just my opinion, but kill me. \n\nHowever, I am beyond intrigued to come back to try the Octopus. Come for a great lunch!
