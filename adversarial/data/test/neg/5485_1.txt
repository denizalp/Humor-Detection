My review is based on fun so to all of those who don't get what this place is about maybe you might understand after I am done. \n\n1. This place is meant to be funny, if your food sucks don't complain because it won't mean shit. \n\n2. The menu sucks and is on the wall, but then again who cares, you should be there to laugh and enjoy the fun. \n\n3. The servers are paid to be assholes, I heard this about the place and understood this about it before I went there.  I can dish it out also.  It was fun to call a server a dick and have them flip me off and say now you wont get to eat.  I LOVED IT!!!! \n\n4. All of you at one point have wanted to say FU to a server and get away with it and have them not mess with the food.  Here is the place where you can do it. \n\n5.  The funny big boy everyone keeps talking about on here.  He was a blast, they are all normal and are getting paid by YOU to act like this, so if you can't hang then don't go.... \n\nNow on to the food. \n\nI got the ribs and wings.\n1. RIBS were great, i really wished I didn't get the wings because the ribs were so good.\n2. Wings were great and spicy although I don't like spicy I went with it.  \n3. Soda was brought out in a pitcher, I LOVE THAT.  No wait. \n4. Ranch was served fresh by a woman standing above me on my park bench table and acting like the bottle was a penis.  I laughed. \n5.  A little costly, but again your in VEGAS on VACATION.  Expect it. \n\nALL in all we will always go back, we will always bust a gut laughing and again I have never laughed this hard or had this much fun while eating... \n\nPROPS TO DICKS!
