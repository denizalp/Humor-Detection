Dunkin' Donuts Mint Hill is not my favorite location. The bagels and donuts are always stale and I know from talking to employees they get shipped in a few times a week $8 for stale old donuts not great. Now the drinks are a different story when the employees (who seem to be young and not trained well) Â do my drink right they are really good my favorite is the iced coffee with hazelnut. I think this location needs some strong training and work on the freshness and it would really boom as it is the only place like it in Mint Hill!
