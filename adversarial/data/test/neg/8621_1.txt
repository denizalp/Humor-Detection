We showed up about 10 minutes to closing and they still seated us and did not give us any problems.  The only problem is we had to order our drinks right away for last call.\nWe did get the guac made at the table.  It was good, but didn't have cilantro.  But it had a bit of spice which made it delicious.  Chips and salsa come with the table.\nWe actually ended up getting an assortment of plates and apps family style between four of us.  It worked out pretty well.  Their house fundido was amazing.  I don't even remember what was in it, but it was a great mix.  Got a couple of tacos and a quesadilla as well.  All in all, the food was tasty. \nThe place has a bit of a classy feel, but not like you have to dress up.  It's a nice decor with good lighting.
