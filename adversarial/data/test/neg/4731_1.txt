My husband and I had wanted to try Honey Salt since we moved to Vegas and we heard about it from our friends and we finally got the chance to try it during a date night. It ended up being restaurant week and we decided to go big or go home. The menu consisted of two appetizers - meatballs and caesar salad, two entrees - we both got the chicken with the mac and cheese (the best part) and two desserts - bread pudding and apple pie, which were all amazing. We were so full by the end of the night but every bite was worth it. I hope that they have some of these items consistently on their menu but I am more than willing to go back to find out.
