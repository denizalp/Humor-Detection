I contacted my Allstate Insurance company to replace a windshield and was provided the number to Safelite Solutions (a.k.a. Safelite AutoGlass).\n\nThe service was great. To make the appointment was easy. The guy was on time and finished within the time frame that he stated. He was meticulous about making sure everything was just right. He was polite and considerate.\n\nThe product was everything that I expected and the service was top notch.
