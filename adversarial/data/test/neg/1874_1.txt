Great spot for dinner before a big night out. has a \"sceney\" vibe, but less than that of Nobu. the sushi here was actually really good and creative. stand out was a beef gyoza with a foie grois dipping sauce. they also had a great seaweed sampler (awesome if you enjoy the texture or otherwise just a great palette cleanser) and a make it yourself spicy  tuna over fried rice cake dish. reservations are always good, but dont seem necessary. somehow seems to get lost in the shuffle with the other MGM restaurants
