Went here on a date with my boyfriend. The restaurant itself actually smells like a bonfire. Which I thought was super quirky, but later found out that this is because of the rotisserie they have in the back. Still cool.\n\nThey label their menu with what options are gluten free - awesome.\nIt's a little pricey - we had 2 entrees, 3 drinks and one of their dessert shooters and the bill was $75.\nService was great.\nHerb rotisserie chicken was awesome. The meat was super flavorful and not dry at all. The mashed potatoes that come with it were also delicious. Green beans were meh.\nMy boyfriend had the ribs and he said they were some of the best he's had in a restaurant. His came with corn that seriously tasted like it came out of a can and had way too much black pepper in it. Meh.\nI tried the white chocolate cheesecake dessert shooter (gluten free of course) and it was yummmmmmy.\n\nOverall a nice place to come on a date , or any occasion I guess, when you want to get out of the downtown craziness and don't mind spending a pretty penny.
