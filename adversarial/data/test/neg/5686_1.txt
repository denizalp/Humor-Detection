I had the big breakfast and my husband had the blueberry pancakes. The restaurant is located in Planet Hollywood and open 24 hours. I requested a burger for breakfast they were doing breakfast only. The big breakfast came with pork sausage and pork bacon. No turkey or chicken products. They\n did let  me substitute apiece of chicken for the pork meat at  no extra cost.   The food was hot which I like because when you sit in a restaurant I expect my food the come out hot. The pancakes were big enough to share. The restaurant being in the tourist area they should  have other meat products for breakfast other than steak. The service was great.
