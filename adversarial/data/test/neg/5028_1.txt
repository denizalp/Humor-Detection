In my office, Kretzler's is the only place we go during Lent. Their fish sandwiches are delicious, french dips are great (just not on Fridays!), and their Macaroni and Cheese (offered only on Friday, I think) is beyond delicious. Honestly, I have never been disappointed in a meal from this place. Between the food quality and the low prices, it's a tough one to beat.
