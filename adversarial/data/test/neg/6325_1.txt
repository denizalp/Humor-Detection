You can't go wrong with a subway sandwich for lunch. I frequent this location because it's near home.\n\nMy personal favorite is the $5 foot long menu. Eat half now and you have lunch for later. My usual is the cold cut combo loaded with all the vegetables and honey mustard. But that's the beauty of Subway, you can customize it any way your tummy desires. \n\nConsistent subs. Friendly and fast service. Clean facilities.
