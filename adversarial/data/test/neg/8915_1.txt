My new best place in Scottsdale.  First time had good food and wine, but spotty service due to being understaffed on a Sunday evening.  Last night the place was well-staffed, served creative and tasty hot and cold tapas with very nice wine selections.\nCloth table coverings, nice stem wine glasses,conversation friendly as no other place has been.\nSmall bites well within budget.
