Though we live within walking distance, we waited almost a year to try this place out due to rumors of bad service,  figuring they needed to work the kinks out. Last night we had a reservation for a very early dinner with another couple. The restaurant was not crowded .I was immediately told by the young lady that my reservation for 4 was not found and then, that it had been canceled. I had made this reservation myself on the phone a week prior and showed the gal the confirmation text I had gotten the day before.... our male server had a bad attitude and seemed like the last thing he wanted to do was wait on us. He was very disinterested in answering menu questions and we had to ask him to wipe us a spill from the appetizer we ordered. I won't go on, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. At this price point, waiters should be way more happy and accommodating. I did not like my dining experience at all. A\nWe will take our business elsewhere... no shortage of great places around here.
