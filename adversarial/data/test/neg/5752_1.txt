Location: 7600 Weston Road Vaughan ON L4L 9L9\nPrice:$$\nService: ehhh\n\nSo feeling adventurous tonight- a friend and I thought we'd try Spin if it is any better than Demetres... I was really hoping to like this place and it would be my new dessert place. It wasn't.\n\nIrresistible (crepes and strawberries) and red velvet cake (w\/ice cream) was ordered. Needless to say both were just okay... But, I really did like their crepes- it was the right texture. Other than that this dessert place is nothing spectacular. I like Demetres better to be honest. \n\nThey had wifi but it wasn't turned on until we asked... Awkward! The connection was extremely slow and it didn't work either when it was turned on. \n\nThe service was alright. It seemed like the server wanted us to leave. She tried to clean our table when we were still eating. We came at 6:30pm...there were plenty of empty tables! So why are we rushed?! I don't know. \n\nVerdict: Not 1st choice
