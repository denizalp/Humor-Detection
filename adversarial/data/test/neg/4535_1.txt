This is my favorite place to shop for \"make your own sushi night\". They always have all the stuff we need to roll our perfect sushi at home. I haven't had a chance to explore their actually seafood selection nor the produce though. The neighborhood is not the best and their parking lot could use some repairs. Nevertheless, I love coming to this market!
