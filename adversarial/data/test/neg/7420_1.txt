Chef personally served me my entree, cornmeal fried Lake Erie Perch with Louisiana oysters, veggies and mac n cheese.  Perch perch perch, I love it and this was yummy with the chipotle tartar sauce.  Veggies were great, specially the always challenging eggplant.\n\nMac n Cheese?  Loved the  sauce, pasta cooked properly but I didnt touch.  Hmmm fish lovers generally don't do mnc when they are enjoying the amazing fish!\n\nSalad,  meh just tossed some mbg out of a bag on a plate,  but the balsamic was right on.\n\nOh yes.  They get serving NOLA style, meaning cocktails\n\nMaitre de Patrick was attentive to a SF, from my online res to my arrival, big props for that!\n\nDef a return visit is due on my next trip to the home Land in May.
