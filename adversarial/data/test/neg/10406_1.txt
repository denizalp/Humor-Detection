Had an amazing experience! \n\nSo pleasantly surprised by the service and the food we had.\n\nEverything from the bread we got when seated to the dessert (apple crisp). The BF loved the ice cream and I'll have dreams about that potato au gratin! Sweat and sour cheesy dreams. Devine!! \n\nAnd our waiter Alan was amazing, very accommodating.  \n  \nOnly thing I would add is a little more salt to the steak ;)\n\nThanks guys!
