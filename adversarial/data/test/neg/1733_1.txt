I came in on April 24, 2017 to drop off a disposable camera to be developed. Susan who helped me, told me that it would be a week before it could be picked up since they do not develop disposable cameras at the store. Okay, no problem. Susan told me it would be ready for pickup in May 2, 2017 after 5pm. I went in today May 2, 2017 at 6pm to pick it up. First off they couldn't find my folder in the pickup box. They called in the shift leader of the store at that time to assist. Only for her to find my film sitting in a FedEx box still waiting to be shipped out!!! Her response was, \"We wait till their are more disposable film cameras to be set out.\" Your kidding!!! Who knows how much longer that will take or when it will even be set out. Its bullshit it the first place when your employee tells you and hands you a slip saying this is the time and day it will be ready for pickup. Only to find that it has been sitting their for a whole week!! Pisa poor employee\/customer service. If it was possible this store would get no stars!! Biggest bullshit I have heard today! Don't go to this store!
