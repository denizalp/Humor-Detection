After my van was damaged in a kind of freak accident on the 202, where a truck tire came off of a semi and damaged my front bumper and then tore the undercarriage cover off as well as the back bumper.   I was very scared and upset......hysterical in fact.  When I got back to Fountain Hills, I went directly to Finishing Touch (because I know that is where my insurance company will send me).  Matt made sure the van was safe for me to drive until it could be repaired.  They were great!!   They know how to handle a crying scared woman (besides Kleenex, John offered chocolate). Today I picked up my completed van and it looks wonderful.  I am so thrilled with the service as well as the workmanship. Thanks guys!! I highly recommend them for all jobs, big and small!!  I almost forgot to add that when Enterprise Rental failed to show up to pick me up at the prearranged time, Matt told me to hop in and he would run me up there.  That is really going above and beyond.
