Very nice staff! Made me feel welcome the minute I walked in the door. I was wary about my dog going because she hadn't seemed very comfortable around dogs since I had adopted her, and they made me feel so much better about being apprehensive rather than feeling crazy. They introduced my dog slowly to the other dogs and were so patient and kind and I was so happy when they told me my dog did great and passed her interview! I am so glad she's a camper.
