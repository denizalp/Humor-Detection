A friend and I stayed here for 1 night last night. The location is convenient to the university as well as the interstate and a mall. The room was clean and comfortable, and the ppl at the front desk we're polite and welcoming. The place is a budget hotel, so nothing fancy, and the breakfast is nothing to write home about (canned fruit salad, yuck), but for the price, I'd definitely stay here again.
