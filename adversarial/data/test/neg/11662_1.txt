Since I live within 1\/2 a mile of this center we were very excited to get a new restaurant in this spot. Many restaurants have come and gone right in this space so we've been hoping for a good place that stays around. We tried Cyprus Grill of Chandler last week for the first time (and 2 times since!) and it was clean, new, fast, has a friendly\/nice staff and most importantly, has very good greek food. We met the owner (and his wife) and they were both very, very nice.\n\nThere are a few tables outside as an option which is very nice right now since the weather has been beautiful. \n\nNow for the food- I ordered the Spartan Club which was very good. It was 2 pitas (like a sandwich) with gyro meat, grilled chicken, tzatziki, tomato, lettuce and hot sauce. It was delicious and the hot sauce gave that \"extra kick.\" \n\nMy parents got the gyro's (gyro meat, pita, tzatziki, tomato, lettuce) and they loved theirs as well and said they'd come back. My husband got the hummus appetizer and it was really good too. We were all going to get a drink but since they just opened they are waiting for their liquor license. I'd definitely recommend this place for some yummy greek food. It looks like their full bar is going to be really nice too.\n\nCyprus Grill- stay friendly, clean and cooking and I think you'll do great! I think you'll have a big following out here in Chandler, we are telling all our neighbors. :)
