I absolutely LOVE this place!  I just tried it for the first time today...but I'm definitely hooked. I had the Coconut Mango Cream smoothie and the Protein Power Balls. They also have some savory dishes that I will be trying out this week. The customer service is amazing! As soon as I came in, the employees were very welcoming-- they asked if it was my first time there, and happily explained the menu and lunch specials.
