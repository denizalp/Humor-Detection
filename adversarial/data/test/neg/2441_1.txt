Finally got to try this place! Right next to Ryerson University and walking distance from Yonge and Dundas or Dundas Station. Came here on a Monday for lunch with a friend and expected it to be busy but it was half empty and I think it was because their service is just so quick. It's very much like a custom salad fast food restaurant but Vietnamese style! You choose your base, your protein, veggies and sauce\/dressing. All the ingredients were fresh and the Sweet Chili Lime was a perfect compliment to the Lemongrass chicken. The portions size of the box was perfect for lunch but I wish they served a little bit more meat as thats the most expensive thing you are paying for. At $12 roughly a box, the meat servings should be a bit more. \n\nOverall, it was pretty tasty and I look forward to trying the other proteins and some of the other sauces.
