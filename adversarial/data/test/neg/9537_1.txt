What a new little gem in Huntersville. Being a plant person with a \"black thumb\" I can always appreciate a plant place with a guarantee on their live plants. \n\nThe workers are friendly, and the store is pretty well laid out. It's not the biggest nursery but it's definitely perfect for Huntersville!\n\nI would recommend signing up for the rewards program!
