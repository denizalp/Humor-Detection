Dr Yuri Bunamovich diagnosed me with something that 2 other dermatologists missed--even though I presented with the exact same symptoms. He was very concerned and actively involved in my treatment. I liked him and he has responded to requests for alternatives to prescriptions that did not work. I see another review complaining about having to wait 45 mins and have to say this is not unusual for any doctor.
