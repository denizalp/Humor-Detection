best quality AYCE sushi place we have been to anywhere so far. in terms of variety, portion, quality, and selection it is excellent. and quality is as good as some a la carte sushi places. on my next trip to vegas i will go back for sure. just be warned like others have said here that there can be quite a wait at night if you have a large group but it is worth the wait.
