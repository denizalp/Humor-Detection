Excellent physician and diagnostician.  Dr. Dykema does extensive research and is very knowledgable about a wide range of medical issues.  She is thorough and conservative in her practice.  Dr. Dykema has been my primary care physician (and AME) for over 20 years, and I can honestly say that I'm in the best shape of my life thanks to Dr. Dykema's advice on living a healthy lifestyle, eating right and exercising regularly.  Over the years I have recommended several other colleagues to Dr. Dykema and to date everyone is very happy with the care they have received.
