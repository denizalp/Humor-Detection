Ok, we were passing through town and found this by chance and the owner suggested the meatball sub and WOW it was seriously great! The only sad part is I live in Texas and won't be back yet will remember this place. And if you live near here consider yourself lucky the food was great and the owner was so inviting, thanks for a great lunch break on our way home to Austin, Tx.
