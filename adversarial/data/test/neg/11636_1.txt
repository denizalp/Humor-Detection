I've been waiting to try this place for months now.  They have had some issues getting started -- odd hours and unplanned issues.  And yes, they're still learning so the service is a bit scattered.  I expect this will get better.\n\nToday I finally managed to get in there and try the Montreal smoked meat.  It was delicious.  I've tried Kaplansky's and this is better.  Note: that is the extent of my smoked meat knowledge.  The pickled sides were good too.\n\nI'll definitely be back.  The menu is much more extensive than I had expected.  I'm looking forward to trying their bagels next.
