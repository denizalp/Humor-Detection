Just a little anecdote to add for my love of this place. \n\nCame in for brunch today and they had a tomato salad special with CHEROKEE PURPLES. I love these guys. Ate our first order and I went back up. I asked if I could pay for another special but just have chef slice a tomato and finish with some olive oil and finishing salt. The kitchen said no, but they gave me a Cherokee Purple for free to take home. I love this place.
