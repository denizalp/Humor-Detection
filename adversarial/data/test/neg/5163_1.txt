Thank you...once again, Border Grill for another amazing brunch.  This time around, my best buddy was with me, and we stuffed our faces with dishes, mimosas and margaritas recommended by our outstanding server Jessica.  She is the very definition of cute; she has a great sense of humor; and she treated our low roller asses like we were whales. And once again, Chef Chris was on his A-game in the kitchen.  I'll never forget that phenomenal Oyster Rockefeller.  You know I'll be back!
