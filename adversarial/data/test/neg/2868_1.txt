From the moment we walked in they greeted us. They were very friendly and explained their menu. We got 2 burgers and the animal fries. Let me tell you they were cooked perfectly! The bread was soft the bacon thick and juicy! I would definitely come back again. Also we had service we haven't received in years! They constantly were checking on us. I would give them 10 stars if I could!
