Good quality food: well-seasoned and adequately juicy  Kabab  and chicken, yummy kashke bademjoon( fully garnished with  crispy onion chips and fresh whey sauce), aromatic saffron rice. The two stars are just for its great food, not the whole experience!\n\nVery poor service: received no welcome nothing. Being rushed to choose quickly as they were about to close in 45min!! Being served with grumpy servers with frowning faces as if they were forced to work there! (I should say there was only one exception among them! ) They didn't even bring us bread for the kashkbademjoon.\n\nOverall, highly recommended for take outs not dine in.
