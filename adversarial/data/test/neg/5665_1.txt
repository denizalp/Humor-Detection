Absolutely amazing !\nI called last minute as I was going to do avortion in other place who was horrible so I run away . I called safe sound @10 am and told them please I need surgery today they told me as long as I get there before 1030 they will fit me.\nAll female staff is amazing from the reception who accommodate me last minute to the nurse . The place is very clean and very safe I feel like I did the right choice . I went to sleep so all I remember is telling doctor I want be back to myself I woke up in my gf car . I don't remember any of the procedure .\nIt's been 6 hours for now just almost no bleeding I ll update as I was 6 weeks 4 days they said I will bounce back in 2\/3 days . I'm very happy I was scare and anyone in Las Vegas who ever need avortion I recommend this place 100%\nI'm now in bed took ibuprofen and have hot lavender blanket on Tommy they saved my life as I was sick with pregancy and also saved my all day but taking me in last minute I recommend call one two days before the wait was only 2 hours.\nThe doctor was very nice and very understanding and did amazing job .
