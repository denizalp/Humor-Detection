When I lived at yonge and Eglinton, I'd save up all my bulk shopping for my trips to Kensington, where the prices are amazing. Now that I'm on the Danforth, I mostly just go to nearby Strictly Bulk. \n\nThe prices are good and the selection is pretty awesome. They have an array of gluten-free flours, nuts, vegan chocolate chips, cheap compostable bags for dog\/cat poop and green bin-ables, environmentally friendly cleaning products, and more. They carry different oils and many soy products (though no soygurt *sniff sniff*). For super foods (like cacao nibs), I'll still be going to Kensington where it's significantly cheaper. \n\nThe staff seems friendly - it's always been university-age guys when I've been in there. Haven't had a lot of questions but other people were asking some and one of the guys, possibly the manager, was very knowledgeable both about what they carried and about items they didn't carry.\n\nAlthough they don't have a way to figure out the ingredients of all their items - a characteristic I personally think is essential in any bulk store - they manager is knowledgeable and found the boxes for products to look up ingredients for me on some items I asked for. Would still prefer to see ingredients listed on bins like they do at Bulk Barn though.\n\nI'll be going there later today to pick up some TVP and bouillon!
