We stayed at \"The Fitz\" this past weekend, but only for one night (which was our reservation through hotels.com).  Our room was upgraded from a regular room to a suite (but I think it's because we checked in late and they probably gave away our reserved room.  The room was large, but a bit outdated.  Eh..whatever.  We didn't come to Vegas for our room.\n\nWhile the price was good, there are several reasons we won't stay here again.\n1. The parking situation is a WRECK.  There was no parking in their entire garage so you had to valet you car.  \n2. Some of the people who stay here are sketchy (please don't tell me about sketchy people in Vegas...I used to live here!).  Someone needs to put up a sign in the elevator that says NO SMOKING- for real.  Someone was actually smoking in the elevator.\n3. The location is at the north end of the strip...I mean, ALL THE WAY north.\n4. The casino is small (that's ok by us since we didn't gamble) but what that means is all the smoke is confined to one area.  You simply can't walk through the casino without smelling like a cigarette.  It's just not possible.\n\nI found the staff to be ok- nothing great, nothing special...but then again, we really didn't interact with them.  Valet was quick with our cars, even during prime check-out time.  We had no problem with the elevators and we were on the 28th floor.  Maybe that issue has been resolved?\n\nWe wouldn't stay here again simply due to the location.
