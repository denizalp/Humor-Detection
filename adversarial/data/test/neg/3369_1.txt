They had lightweight shoes in a wide width I was looking for. I had the assistance of a lovely young lady associate with a unique name. Pronounced something like Ohmwhey. Great customer service skills! Very friendly and helpful. The young Asian man with the short double braids on the top of his head (didn't get his name) at the register was also very friendly. Makes me want to come back. Now to see if I love these shoes too!
