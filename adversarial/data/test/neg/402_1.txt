I love me some breakfast food!  IHoP is exactly what you'd expect from any breakfast style chain you can go to.  The inside is nicer than the Waffle Houses of the world, but hell, it's breakfast food.  How can you mess up breakfast food?\n\nI am typically a fan of Mom and Pop breakfast joints for the atmosphere, but IHoP will give you quality food consistently.  They're not pioneers in inventiveness or delicate flavors...just bold syrup and bacon ones...mmm...bacon!\n\nBeware the Sunday church crowd!  This place gets packed!
