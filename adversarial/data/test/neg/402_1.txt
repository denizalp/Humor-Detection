Stopped for a bite on our way home from Vegas since they were open late.. by far some of the best tacos I've had in my life and I know tacos. Carne Asada was filled with flavor, melted cheese on top mixed with their homemade salsas made this by far the best meal of the weekend. Menu is simple but it has all you need! 10\/10 recommend, and will stop by every time I'm in the area.
