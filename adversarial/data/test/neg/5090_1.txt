I had been to Vegas a few times but never stayed at the Venetian. Last weekend I stayed here and was very happy with my choice. The rooms were clean, nice and spacious.   The bed\/mattress was pretty comfortable. \nThe room I was staying in was a regular king suite. I was surprised to see a dining table there in addition to the desk.  \nI was pleasantly surprised with the fact that when I ordered room service, the attendant came in and set up a table with a tablecloth for us, instead of the usual leaving a tray of food on the desk. \nThe service we received was overall good. The only time I was upset was the two days I called for room service. Both times the operator was cold and inpatient, and the person I spoke to the second time was pretty rude and couldn't wait to hang up. \nI am looking forward to staying here again, maybe trying their attached new hotel Palazzo next.
