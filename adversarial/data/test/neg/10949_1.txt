Love this place! They make my tacos exactly how you like them & the service is welcoming and professional. I confess the Windy City Fries are outstanding but the price of $12 for a large is a bit harsh given the surrounding competition. If they can find a way to make that a bit friendlier, you may just have yourself a 1Stop Taco shop!
