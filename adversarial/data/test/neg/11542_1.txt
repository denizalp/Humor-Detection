Came here for the first time with my gf for breakfast and was very surprised at how good the food was. She got spring benedict ( eggs benny with spinach avocado and swiss cheese ) with homefries and I got the mars mountain ( scrambled eggs with bacon sausage homefries on top of a pancake with hollandaise . each breakfast is 12.95 so depending on what you order it can be pricey but well worth it . I will be back !!
