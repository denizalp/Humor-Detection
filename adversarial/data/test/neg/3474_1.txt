The moment I walked into the store, I knew we were in the right place.  They are not a big box store, therefore, customer service is a major focus. We purchased a sectional. It was delivered earlier than we expected. We absolutely love the furniture. It is beautiful, elegant and comfortable. Who could ask for anything more?  I now want to buy a beautiful bedroom set. This place has by business and I would highly encourage my family and friends to give iDeal furniture a shot.
