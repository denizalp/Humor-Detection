Good food not great but good. My girlfriend and I had nacho's to start.  The nachos were very fresh and filling. Then we both had the fish taco's wich were good. If the soft taco shell was cooked I think it would have made a world of difference .  But the flavor of the fish inside was really good. The plate came with 2 taco's wich we both Could not finish. Needless to say I had a fish taco's for lunch.
