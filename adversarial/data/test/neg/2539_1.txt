Pros: decent ingredients (but not mind blowing - have your expectations in check). Sake pairing was good but again, $50 for 5 small shots -  pricy.\n\nCons: \n\nI noticed one of the chef's nail is black and used the same wiping towl for the knife, surface and handing - it ruined the experience \n\nWhen the 18 pieces were done, the chef asked if anyone wanted more without telling us they are gonna charge us for the extra - feeling fooled. \n\nIn all, won't go back and doesn't worth the $300 bill and one month wait on reservation.
