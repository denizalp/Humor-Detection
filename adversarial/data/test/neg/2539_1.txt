I've been coming here since I was a kid and absolutely love this place. If you have never been just know that the raw food looks like a lot but it cooks down to about half the size so pack the food in. You get to make your own sauce I recommend the chiefs choice thats my favorite and I add some of the spicy thai sauce to give it a little kick its not too hot.
