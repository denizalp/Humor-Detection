It was really busy during my experience at Hooters, but the waitress was still quick with her service and was really friendly. She kept checking up on our tables regularly, but not too much to the point it was annoying. She kept our beers refilled and our waters refilled as well.\n\nHooters has classic wings, and most of them are saucey. They have a lot of screens and this is probably one of the coolest places to watch a game because of the food, plenty of screens, and of course, the beautiful waitresses.
