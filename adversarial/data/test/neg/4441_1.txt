Have been wanting to go here for awhile. ...\nWe booked a table  3 days ahead while on vacation. \n\nThe place was amazing,  wait staff were very friendly. \n\nWe watch Bobby Flay's....shows all the time. \nAnd the food was so good, presentation was unreal and tasted superb. \n\n\nI would definitely be coming back here.....
