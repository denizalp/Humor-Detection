Our family of three always searches sushi places in every town we visit. The 5 stars does not do justice to this sushi. We barely touched the soy sauce or wasabi because the sushi was so flavorful. It had a mix of textures and testes that made us fight for the pieces on the platter. This is on top of the clean, neat friendly family atmosphere and the great relaxing music. I wish we lived closer (we live in NH)..we would come here weekly.
