Carpet Monkey is an amazing company. Called and got a quick telephone quote. Let them know about some problem spots and they noted it. Employee showed up on time, with a courtesy call informing me he was on the way. They got our whole house carpet done in about 1 hr and did a fantastic job. They did so well I hired them to clean my new house and again on time, about an hour and exceptional service from both employees that helped us. The employee helped me move some furniture I couldn't pick up myself. Owner even called to follow up and make sure everything went well. A+++ for this company. Will highly recommend to my friends and neighbors and they will get our repeat business as well. Thank you carpet monkey for making my homes beautiful!!!!!! You guys do an amazing job and have the friendliest staff!!!
