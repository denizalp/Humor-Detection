Amazing lack of compassion and common sense. Dr discharged patient after 8pm on Friday night following stent implant for heart attack with elevated diabetic level. Patient given paper prescription as opposed to electronic one, told by pharmacy 3 hour delay in filling it only to then be told insulin cost over $1000.  The doctor obviously had no concern that chain of events contributed to addtional stress and increased sugar levels with no rx to combat mounting problems. Advised by pharmacy more reasonable priced alternative available .\nGood luck getting weekend hospital assistance.  This doctor has no excuse nor the hospital that allows this.
