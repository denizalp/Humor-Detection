Eh, wasn't that impressed despite having heard a lot about Eggslut. I was definitely a little disappointed. I ordered the \"Slut,\" the coddled egg and potato purée in a jar. The portion size was small and the egg itself was small. The coddled egg was prepared well, but most of the jar was the potato purée, so I felt like I was paying $10-$11 for pretentious mashed potatoes that didn't taste like anything special. Probably would have been better off with one of their breakfast sandwiches. \n\nTaste | 3.5\nAtmosphere | 3.5\nPresentation | 3.5\nService | 3\nOVERALL | 3-3.5
