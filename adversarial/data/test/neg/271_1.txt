I recently held a corporate event at the castle at Ashley Manor.  The event itself was an amazing success! But for me the amazing part was getting to work with Laura and the staff at the castle. Their willingness to help me trouble shoot prop issues, provide vendor recommendations and general enthusiasm to support my event was refreshing!!  I look forward to to working with Laura, George and the staff at the Ashley Manor in the future!!
