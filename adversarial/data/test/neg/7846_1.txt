I cannot thank Cody and Desert Diamond enough. Our a\/c compressor died in the middle of the night on a record heat day. Cody was at my house within 20 minutes of me calling them in the middle of the night. My compressor was under warranty so we had to wait until morning to get the new one. Cody came that day and had cold air blowing very quickly. I am a customer for life now. Service like what we experienced with them is unheard of these days. Extremely courteous, trustworthy and professional. The price was very fair as well. Thank you again Cody!
