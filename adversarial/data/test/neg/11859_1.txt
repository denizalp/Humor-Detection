I placed my order online which of course wasn't too difficult. I did ask for a substitute - chow mein versus fried rice. The lady called me and I didn't happen to answer (I don't answer calls I don't know the number) and she leaves a message telling me chow mein will be extra and to call back. \n\nI call back about 5 minutes later and I can't quite understand all of what she says, but what I did understand is that she sent the driver out with the order with the rice. She said that I didn't call her back right away so she sent him out and that I should answer the phone next time she calls.\n\nThe driver got here, was nice enough without saying anything but smiled, and left. Delivery was about 40 minutes. The food was actually quite decent. If it weren't for the rude lady I could barely understand, this establishment would receive a much higher rating.
