We decided to get married in Las Vegas and stumbled onto A Special Memory's site and I'm so glad we did. After looking through all of the wedding options on the site, we went forward with the helicopter ride. It was the easiest process you could imagine for a wedding! We literally called and after speaking to Aurora for about 10 minutes, we had our wedding booked. \n\nUnfortunately on our way out to Vegas from Chicago, we were delayed due to our flight having \"mechanical issues\" and we weren't able to make our wedding that Friday night as was planned. While waiting at the airport for our bags, we called to let A Special Memory know what was going on. Within about 10 minutes, the gentleman on the phone was able to move our whole wedding back a day to Saturday. \n\nThis was an amazing experience, the photos are beautiful (Brandy was our photographer - really sweet!), and I highly recommend this team to anybody looking to do something fun for their wedding.
