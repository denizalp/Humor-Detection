Usually have no problems there..I went there craving a chocolate shake & they hardly added any chocolate syrup (or whatever they use to make the chocolate shakes.) I had to fix it with my own chocolate syrup at home. I shouldve just gone to Smith's & bought ice cream to make it myself. Such a bummer to go somewhere craving something simple & the place messes it up..broke this pregnant mama's heart lol
