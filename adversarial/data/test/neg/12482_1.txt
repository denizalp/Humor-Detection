I never used any VIP services before,so I was skeptical at first.But Brian really took care of my party of 8.Especially with bottle service package prices.They really are the best prices.Plus no hidden costs.With tips and gratuity included,you can't go wrong with that.He even took care of our transportation to the club.Thank you Brian for making my wife's birthday a great experience!I will be using your service again!
