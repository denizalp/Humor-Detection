We went today and spent some time reading and doing work (yes I did work on a Sunday and it was the Forth of July) - anyways on to my point.  I learned a new fact about this place that bumps up my appreciation for it - free refills on iced tea!!! Can't beat that! \n\nAlso - its a good place to get some work done - lots of good sized tables. \n\nAs before - donuts were delicious!
