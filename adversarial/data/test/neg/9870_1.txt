Found this quaint little place near Trader Joes and Kmart off Eastern Ave. in Henderson. When we walked in we were impressed with the d√©cor. It looked so nice that I thought it was going to be expensive. To our surprised the menu prices were pretty reasonable. The food was tasty and delicious. Our party ordered sweet and sour chicken lunch special and it came with salad, soup and a hefty stuff wonton. The portions were a good size. Someone else order crab friend rice and wow was it good. I ordered pad thai and it was decent. WARNING: Their spice range is on point. When they say hot...It's going to be hot. My lips and tongue were on fire! When your brow sweats you know it's hot. So order a level down and it will be perfect. Anyways we will be definitely visiting this place again.
