I pre-ordered 2 platters for my office, we were having clients in for a conference. One of the platters was an \"assorted mini breakfast pastry platter\" the picture showed all types of mini pastries... yum! When I picked them up it only had crescents with a chocolate drizzle... yuk! When I complained they told me they were out of mini pastries...  pastries I ordered 4 days in advance? She told me I should order 2 weeks in advance to make sure I get what I order. WHAT? 2 weeks for pastries? It's not a wedding cake, geesh! After a little more complaining and coaxing they pulled some full size pastries and cut them into fourths and threw in a fruit bowl. Next time I will save myself time and money and go to a grocery store, instead of this store with an inconvenient entrance and annoying pumped in perfume smell and snotty employees.
