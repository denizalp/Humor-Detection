Came here on our last night in Vegas. We sat down and the wait staff immediately traded out our cloth napkins based on what we were wearing. Our server was especially helpful telling us what was popular on the menu. Excellent service. Probably the best service I've experienced at a restaurant. As far as the food goes, the maki rolls were good but did have a lot of rice. The yellowtail sashimi with jalape√±o and miso glaze was two thumbs up and a must try. The sea bass skewer with ancho sauce was delicious. Overall, great service and food.
