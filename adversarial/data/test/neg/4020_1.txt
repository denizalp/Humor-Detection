I've been coming here for lunch breaks for the past week and have been consistently pleased with the quality of food they offer. I have tried both the green salad as well as the quinoa bio salad and would say that they're both decently hearty so you wouldn't be hungry a hour later. As for soups, I usually go for the lightest tastes, which are usually vegetable based, and I quite enjoy them. \nI prefer the location on Crescent st. or Mont-Royal, but the soups themselves taste the same! Would definitely recommend to all those who want a lighter lunch!
