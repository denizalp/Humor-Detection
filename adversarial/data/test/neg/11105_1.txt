Really bad customer service started the minutes I walk in, staff staring and \"screening\" me like radar, no one even bother to say hello. I already have a purse I like in mind, so I just ignore their attitude, and ask a lady to show it, she tell me to wait and another staff come and help me get the purse I like, which is a Luna style in light pink epi leather. \nFours days later I change my mind due to the heaviness of the purse and their chain on my neck, as well as the worry that light color may get dirty easy, I bring the purse, nice and clean in original box and receipt back to the store for return. The store is still cold, unwelcome, unprofessional as always. Lulu inspect my bag and said it's not returnable, then she have Vanessa ( the store manager) to confirm it, they tell me there are marks on purse, in which I could not see, nor anyone with normal vision could see it. I suspect that even with microcoscope, would any one could see it ( and I  am a microbiologist), but I could see the store severe lack of customer and revenue could have prompt them to do that? Would never come back to that store. ( Chanel have better services)
