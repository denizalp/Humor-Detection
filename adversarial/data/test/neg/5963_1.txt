This review is only for the rent-a-car center itself, not for any specific rental car company.\n\nThis was a nice centralized location for all of the rental car companies. After you land at McCarran Airport head for the buses and look for the rental car shuttles. From here you just go to the counter for your rental car company to take care of your paperwork before getting your car in the parking structure.\n\nIt's located on Gilespie St just South of the 215 freeway. You'll need to remember that since this is where you'll need to drop off the rental car. The entrance to drop off your car is on the North end of the building. Just follow the signs for your rental car company. After you've dropped off your car, you'll need to take a shuttle to the airport. There are two shuttles, one for terminal 1 and terminal 3. There are signs that tell you which airlines are at which terminal.
