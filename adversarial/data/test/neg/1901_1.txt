Wish I could give it negative stars\n\nUnbelievably slow, dropped off my mother at 11:30 am, they accepted her in and they took about 50 minutes to come back in the room and see her, then she was waiting on her prescription form, they told her 5 minutes, 40 minutes later were still waiting so I go ask at the front and the girl gave me this nasty attitude like I bothered her. Horrible
