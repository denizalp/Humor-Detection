Came all the way here bc I wanted to Gangnam kbbq but they were so busy so we headed Kaizen instead. \nWe got the Lasagna, BBQ and California roll.\nAnd it tastes absolutely amazing. We loved the bbq roll tho. \nThe service was great. We were seated right away and servers would always check on us. Will come back definitely!(:
