Ordered takeout from here for the first time and will never again. I had a taste for chop suey and Bo Bo is one of the only places in the area that had it, so I decided to give it a shot. It was super bland and VERY oily. I've never had oily chop suey before, but their sauce literally separated in the container. I could have *maybe* looked past the oilyness if it had tasted remotely appetizing, but it had no taste at all. They also gave my vegan boyfriend the wrong tofu dish with pork in it. Save yourself the calories and don't eat here.
