Unfortunately, we had a disappointing experience at the Avondale claim jumpers restaurant on Friday evening. Service was slow, not attententive,  food.order was wrong, we had to ask another waiter for silverware to eat with...when we were paying we ask for a bag for our take home boxes...never got a bag, we ended up just leaving frustrated.\nNo one was at the front desk when we were leaving, people coming in just stood there looking lost.\nNot sure what was going on there last night, but dissapointing for sure...
