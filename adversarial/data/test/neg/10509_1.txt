The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is that the service was great and the corned beef sandwich was very tasty. We were very excited to have a Jewish deli open up in Summerlin. We all had the chicken soup with a matzoh ball. We asked for noodles and they had said they ran out, but we got the soup anyways. The chicken was super dry and tasteless. The carrots and celery were hard like they had just added them to the soup. Matzoh ball soup is a staple in a Jewish deli. They should be making a ton of it and have extra on hand including extra noodles made just in case. Both of my kids had the Mac and cheese with they seemed to like. I had a bit and seemed to be Kraft Mac and cheese..nothing special. We also ordered a piece of the 7 layer cake. It's from freed bakery and wasn't worth the price or the calories. \n\nWe were anxiously waiting the opening of Canter's since the sign went up at tivoli. We won't be coming back.
