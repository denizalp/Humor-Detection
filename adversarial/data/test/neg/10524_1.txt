I went to grab lunch here, and instantly was overwhelmed with the great aroma as we walked into the bakery. The store is filled with free samples all over, and I was able to try almost all the different sorts of bread. My coworker and I got 4 cakes; the japanese cheese cake, new york cheese cake, mille crepes cake and the green tea mille crepes cake. We also tried the sea salt coffee. The cakes ranged from $5-$8, so they were a little pricey but it was definitely worth it. Everything was so delicious, and they had great customer service. I will definitely be back!
