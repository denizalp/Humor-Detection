My son and I both love this school.  He went here for pre-k and is currently in private kindergarten and doing great!  He is reading, writing, doing math and writing book reports.  I only wish he could continue going here but I feel confident that he will have a head start going into 1st grade.  The classrooms are really nice and well equipped.  The staff are friendly and he really likes his teacher Ms. Burleson.  The playground is covered and matted and they have water activities in the summer.
