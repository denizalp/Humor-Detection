Great bookstore\/comic books\/jazz & blues shop on 3rd floor of the Lili cafe building.\nA colorful psychedelic vibe to the space with a very knowledgeable owner.\nA nice concise selection of jazz, blues, folk & rock music cds at great bargain prices. \nLots of heady books to peruse.\nI like to get a coffee @ Lili and then, go upstairs to Copacetic, afterward.\nThere is a cool vinyl record shop on the 2nd floor that is definetly worth a visit.
