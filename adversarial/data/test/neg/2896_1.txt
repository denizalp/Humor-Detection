This is such a cute neighborhood restaurant! I would hang out here a lot more if I lived closer! It was not very busy on half price wine Tuesday so I hope they are doing ok business wise! Service was great and I had one of the tastiest sandwiches EVER! Order the SalmonBLT and you won't regret it...fries were perfect!! Will definitely return!
