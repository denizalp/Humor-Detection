Back in the fall, I bought a deal via FabFind (spend $25 get $50) to eat at Earth. This past weekend, my girlfriend and I finally got around to making use of the voucher. We decided at the last minute (5pm on a Saturday) to see if we could get a table at a reasonable time. We were told that the earliest available table they had that evening was 830pm. By chance we arrived early at around 815 and were told that the prior seating for our table never arrived, so we were seated immediately. \n\nPrior to the delivery of our meal we were each provided a very nice buttery rosemary biscuit. I thought this was a nice touch compared to the standard white bread that is provided at many establishments. \n\nFor starters we shared one of the flatbread options ($12) (I believe it had duck, and ricotta cheese on it). On the whole, I'd say it was tasty. It was crisp and just the right size to whet our palates for the main course.\n\nAfter we finished the flatbread and our plates had been bussed from the table, a few minutes went by and our waiter arrived with a few complimentary potato\/leek soups (as there was a delay in the kitchen in terms of our mains). I thought that this was a very nice touch as we could have been waiting for another 10 minutes for our mains. This, in my opinion, is the difference between a 3 star and a 4 star restaurant.\n\nFor mains my girlfriend chose the Rainbow Trout, and I went with the Fettucine pasta with duck meat sauce ($20). I had no complaints regarding my main. It was filling and tasty all at once. I had asked my girlfriend what she thought of the trout and she said that it was ok, but not worthy of a 5 star restaurant (she's a tough critic in my opinion).  I had a taste of it and thought that it was perfectly acceptable. I think she had higher expectations for a main that cost $22.\n\nI would have gone for dessert as there appeared to be a few appealing options, however I was so stuffed from dinner, I erred on the side of caution.\n\nAt the end of the night, I asked her what she would have rated the restaurant. She gave it a 3.5\/5 rating. I would have given it a 4.5\/5 rating (as Yelp doesn't allow for half ratings, I'm bumping it up to a 5).  \n\nAs far as the service was concerned, there were no complaints. The staff were friendly, and our server took the time to explain a few items on the menu that were unfamiliar to me.\n\nConclusion: If you're looking for a nice place to dine in the Rosedale area, you can't go wrong with Earth.
