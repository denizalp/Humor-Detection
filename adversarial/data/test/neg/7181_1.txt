Once again with lobsterfest, I usually go for it every year but this time i felt it was special. Every thing we had was tasty. I didn't know if that's bcoz not many people came here on the game day (final four) and chefs were not too busy so that they were very focus on our dishes.  However it was  my great day. We got a free appetizer which was a bowl of garlic mussels.  I would say I really liked it but the side bread was too salty for us. We had wood-grilled lobster,  shrimp and salmon and  lobster lover's dream to share.  I usually don't feel craving for pasta but for this time I had to give the thumb up for the chefs. Awesome!
