Came here for the crystal dome platter and it's sold out.  Opted for the Flaming dark sesame sponge cake instead. The cake looks exactly like a charcoal inside out.  It's dense, heavy, and bland.  Popcorn chicken is juicy.  Black pearl supreme is good but small portion.  Prices are a bit steep.  Excellent service.
