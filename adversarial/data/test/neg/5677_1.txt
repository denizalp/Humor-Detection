I keep trying to like this place because it's convenient and the reviews are always so good. I have to confess IT IS JUST NOT that good! This location loves rice.... there was so much rice on my roles I could barely taste the sushi\/fish. Sometimes when you fly solo sushi is the way to go by sitting at the bar.  The hostess wouldn't give me the \"One\" seat at the bar and sat me by myself at a huge table in a crowded restaurant. It was just WEIRD!!! That's it I'm not trying to like this place any more!
