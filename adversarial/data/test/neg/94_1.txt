First time there tonight. We were greeted right away and seated in a comfortable booth. We both had the 1 1\/2 crab legs for 20.00. Monday night special. Had the hush puppy's and cole slaw. All was delicious. My friend had sweet potatoe frys and a side salad. \nOur waiter Rian was great!  Really on top of things. Kept my drink full and didn't have to ask for anything!! I love it when I have a professional wait staff!!  It was relaxing and I fully enjoyed it. \nI really like this place and can't wait to go back to try the other items.
