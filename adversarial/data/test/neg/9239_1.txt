I took my car to this location for a diagnostic on my transmission talk about unprofessional not only did they lose another customer's vehicle while I was there but the supervisor I'm presuming proceeded to yell and scream at the front desk clerk in regards to something that he had done incorrectly I took my vehicle without allowing them to do the diagnostic and won't return.
