Highly overrated.  Gave it several tries.  On my most recent visit, we waited 30 minutes to be seated, even though there were empty tables everywhere.  We didn't get any food on the table for another 40 minutes, so it was an hour and ten minutes from when we arrived to when we actually had something to munch on.  The waiter was nowhere to be found most of the night.  A few times we saw him just standing there, watching the football game on TV.  Almost all the plates got served with horrible, overcooked homemade potato chips (which they refuse to substitute out - I suspect because no one would ever order them otherwise), which were universally disliked by the entire table.  The prices are rather high for the type of dining experience you're getting.  This isn't a fancy restaurant, this is a boisterous, chaotic family-restaurant type environment, with kids running around and playing in the aisles.  I ordered a chicken sandwich which was gigantic and looked amazing, but was far less impressive when I saw that the \"chicken\" was actually frozen factory-made breaded \"chicken\".  And it wasn't just my dish.  Most of the menu item seem to be cobbled together from various pieces of processed food.  If I wanted to eat processed garbage, I'd go get fast food.  I want real ingredients when I eat out, and especially at these prices.  And the other reason for my low rating involves the the ceilings, which are sloped inward with no attempt whatsoever at sound dampening.  To call this place noisy doesn't do it justice.  No, noise doesn't really begin to describe it, it's more like a cacophony.  I found it really uncomfortable.
