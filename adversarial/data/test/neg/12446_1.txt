We meet a friend that was in town for dinner at this location last night. Husband, our kid's, our friend and I . As soon as they brought my dinner plate to me which was the chicken fettuccine alfredo, I was like really that's the food. I never have been to a CPK where the food was so little. I ate my whole plate which wasn't that much in it along with three pieces of bread. When we left my husband said I am still hungry he had the shrimp fettuccine.... I said to him what I am writing now. So I wasn't just tripping my dinner plate didn't look full enough like I have experienced before at other California and Nevada Locations. My kid's had the same dinner plate they split it ages son-5 daughter-7 and they finished all of their as well which again wasn't much in it for a Dinner Plate. Not happy would not go back or recommend to hotel guests where I work at. Other then that it was good food as always, just wished it was a bigger portion last night.
