Stayed here for a few nights while in Vegas. The rooms are nice and quite spacious. However, we did have a problem with the shower, although it was more of a specific one-time occurrence than something that would affect everyone, so I deducted a star for that. Otherwise, the service is good and the rooms are modernly decorated.
