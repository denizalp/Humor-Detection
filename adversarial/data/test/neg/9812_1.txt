This is the same place as Knives and More. Very bad customer service and even lower employee representation. I went here looking for a good deal off of a backpage ad and did not find anything here that even remotely matched the description of what was on their ad. Anyways, here is my experience....\n\nI went inside to not even being greeted. They were more interested in watching a movie than even bothering saying hi. The store is in very big disarray and dusty. You can tell that cleanliness is down to a bare minimum. When I asked for help, a guy wearing more than 8 knives finally came up and said \"yeah\". So, after asking about a benchmade pagan benchmade infidel - he tells me that he only sells to military and law enforcement. I inform him about a law that was signed last year by our governor. He rudely interrupted me and didn't even let me finish. I told him to have a good day and I left the store. I guess me needing my benchmade pagan sharpened wasn't good enough here and me wanting to buy a second one wasn't good enough either.
