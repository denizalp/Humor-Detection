Went to Sugar Daddy's at Lucky Dog, and it was worth it! The Sugar Daddy slider was my personal\nfavorite, followed by the Token White Guy. The Sliders are fantastic, but don't forget about the sides!! The Amaze Balls are appropriately named and were SO DELICIOUS!! The Bougie Lady fries hit the spot. I love that all the sauces are homemade and makes this truck unique. Definitely with a stop!
