This is one of my favourite restaurants in Montreal.  Market fresh cuisine, with a menu that changes regularly depending on what is in season.  Everything is always amazingly fresh and simply but elegantly prepared.  The stuffed zucchini blossoms, when in season, are a must.  Serving portions are as small plates, good for sharing.  Order 3-5 per person, depending on how hungry you are.  Decor is delightfully rustic and casual.  They have a short but excellent wine list with several unusual choices, a great chance to try something new.  They don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait with a glass of wine (not a real hardship) or come early to get a table.
