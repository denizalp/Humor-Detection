Driving down Finch on the way to the 400 when I spotted the sign Happy Bagel.  Yes!  We immediately turned the corner and pulled into the lot.  OMG.  I haven't seen such wonderful looking Danish pastry since leaving Montreal in the 70's.  YUM!!!  Lots of cheese danish to choose from, large, small, with\/without fruit and heavy with the generous amount of cheese they use, and the wonderful light lemony glaze over top.  Oh boy.  I brought home half a dozen different ones, plus 2 potato bournekas (sp?) for supper, ate a cheese danish there along with a GREAT cup of coffee.  I'm fussy about coffee and this was a really good cup of fresh made coffee.  I had already had lunch so couldn't sample the sandwiches which looked delish too.  Highly recommended! - They also have fresh baked bread, most notably Challah, the Jewish egg bread.  Yum again.  Yes, we brought one of those home too.  This place is now bookmarked on my GPS!  Oh, and service is friendly, fast - welcoming... and they do have a small group of tables and chairs where one can enjoy the food and eat in.
