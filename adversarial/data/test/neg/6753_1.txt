For the most part food was good. I ordered ribs and biscuits and gravy. The ribs were really dry and gross. I ate my biscuits first while they were walking around asking if it was ok and yes at the time it was good but by the time i ate my ribs they were gross and told them i was not satisfied with just the ribs the manager came and told me i didn't say anything before when they walked by and told him because i hadn't tried them so i didn't no they were Going to taste gross and all he said was he couldnt do anything about it but give me more bbq sauce now why would i want more sauce for when the ribs are dry. So all i have to say is make sure you try  all your food before because the manager doesn't care.
