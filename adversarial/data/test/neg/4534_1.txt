The worst thing about Fern is that it's too far away from home for me to come back and try the rest of the menu! The atmosphere was a bit yuppified - the mason jar and hemp chandelier installation really sets the tone. Service was quick, attentive, and very friendly. It's all about the little details, like cucumber water and only serving in-state breweries' beer. They walk a thin line of pretentiousness, but the food and people are good enough to keep from crossing it.\n\nI ordered the vegan ramen, and the boyfriend had barbeque tempeh. I have never had anything that tastes like my meal before. I mean this mostly as a good thing. :) His opinion: \"I really like it! It's fun and tastes really good, I'm just not sure what I'm eating.\" Seaweed flakes, coconut foam, and pureed something-or-another just aren't typically on the menu for us. I thought it was fun, but I'd hesitate to take any less adventurous friends or family.\n\nWeird side note for coffee snobs - they use instant coffee! Not the \"real\" stuff. I actually liked mine enough that I asked where it was from and was surprised.
