Came in before Cavs game. First time in Cleveland and enjoyed this area of town. We ordered the hamburger (teen didn't like - tasted funny but we thought it was fine), bacon wrapped dates was excellent, the Brussels sprouts were good but nothing special, shrimp and grits -excellent and the chorizo flatbread was very good.
