Came to Border Grill for my sisters Bachelorette and it was a fun time with the girls but the food was ok!!! Service was slow maybe we got there late and staff was over us also it took forever to get water hello am hungover!!! The food I think had great balance and lovely presentation but the rice was hard and cold and so was my tortillas very cold. I ate and didn't complain I was starving probably won't go back.
