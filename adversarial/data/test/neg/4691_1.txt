We had the samosas and the saag paneer. Absolutely delicious and perfect spice level - medium spice is perfect for those who like spicy food but aren't necessarily looking for a challenge!  It's a little pricier than your standard Indian in Pittsburgh, but it's worth it!  Not too greasy.  They definitely add their own flair.  Service was great, and the atmosphere was meh to relaxing. Nice light fixtures.  We're not too big on ethos though.
