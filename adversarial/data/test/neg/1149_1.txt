So, I'm confused. Is this place or is this place NOT the same as Pizzeria Bianco? Same place or no? It seemed like the same place with very similar if not the same items on the menu and a nice fancy but down-to-Earth vibe. \n\nWe came in on a stop at the plaza to shop a bit and were kinda excited to see it here! \n\nPizza at 2 in the afternoon? Why the heck not! So we sat down in the courtyard to enjoy some delightful spring weather and a yummy sausage pizza. We received our warm olives and drinks and just hung out until our food arrived. The edges were very burnt but we just ate around it, wood fire oven, it happens. I do wish that the toppings were cut up a bit more, the sausage was so big that it was kind of awkward to split up the pieces so all had some. \n\nFor the price I feel like it wasn't really very flavorful and the crust was a bit too black for my liking. I would much rather spend my money at The Parlor across the street on Camelback.
