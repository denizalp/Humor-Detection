This has seriously been not only my favourite cafe to relax in, but it has had a serious hand in keeping my sanity during the school semester. It's not too far from SCC, so I'll usually plop down on one of the comfy couches and study for hours while sipping on a cappuccino.\nThe coffee is amaze, and I love to occasionally get one of their cinnamon rolls. The staff is super friendly, and the atmosphere warm, cozy, and great for getting some work done.
