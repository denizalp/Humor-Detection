I was given several names of groomers from my vet. I called two who did call me back, the first didn't work on large dogs and the other wasn't taking new clients.  When I called pawsattraction I was given the option of bringing my two dogs in that day or the next. It was around 2pm when I dropped them off and they were both ready for pick up around 4:20pm. I had never taken a pet to a groomer before and was so pleased not only with the cuts but with the great friendly service. I will definitely bring them back!!
