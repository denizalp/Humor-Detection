This needs no introduction. If you seen Ocean's 11 then you will remember this. It's free and great. It usually plays the same music everytime. Most played song is Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On. It does play holiday music. It always crowded at night. Some stat as soon as it is over, some leave. You should watch both day and night. At night it just looks so beautiful.
