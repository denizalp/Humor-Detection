The only reason why this place isn't getting 5 stars is because it doesn't have damn BBQ sauce!! I had the salmon sandwich and kitchen chips (which are best with BBQ sauce of course) and to my chagrin, the grill didn't have any!! Food was better than most airport food and I appreciate the healthy options on the menu.\n\nStaff is amazing, especially Norris who tried to find a solution for my BBQ sauce and made sure I was mostly happy (can't be at 100% because no BBQ sauce!)
