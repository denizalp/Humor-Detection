Just like it's Vegas home, this store front is glammed up and blinged out! It's a candy, chocolate, gelato, and bakery store all in one. Their claim to fame is the Couture Pop...a lollipop (a tad bigger than a tootsie pop) that has it's own bedazzled and bejeweled reusable stick designed by celebrities such Britney Spears, Kim Kardashian, Nicole Scherzinger (Pussycat Dolls), etc. The reusable stick also has a round plastic holder for the pop in case you don't finish it at one sitting. A Couture Pop retails at about $25 and lollipop refills for a set of 3 is $12. I don't know about everyone else, but whenever I indulge in a lollipop, saliva typically runs down the stick...the thought of reusing a stick, even a couture stick sounds unsanitary!!! And seriously, who wants to save a licked up, sticky lollipop anyways...gross!!!!!!! \n\nThe candy selection was no big deal...most of them you can find in your local CVS, Rite Aid, or Duane Ready for you East Coasters. Otherwise, go to any mall and visit your nearest Sweet Factory for cheaper. Not sure if they make their own chocolates, but I do have to say they looked pretty delish. But what chocolate wouldn't if it's behind a glass case out of reach to you???!!!!!! Right???? The same also goes for the gelato! \n\nThey did have a good and pretty selection of baked goods, which included cupcakes, cookies, cakes, muffins, and brownies. But the one item that stood out to me was the Red Velvet Brownie...a big chunk of fudge brownie topped with a red velvet cake layer with cream cheese filling in the middle and cream cheese frosting on top. It was only $5 and big enough to split between four because of it's density...it was definitely decadent and heavenly! \n\nOverall, this place is just fun and appealing to the eye. I do love their signature duck that is represented all over the store and on their cute lil bags! :)  This place knows how to market their stuff!!!
