It's taken me nearly 9 months to be comfortable enough to write this review.  \n\nIt took me a lifetime to reach out for guidance from a therapist because I'd rather chew off my own arm than ask for help from anyone, but after numerous family issues, I needed someone impartial to help me cope with things out of my control, as well as someone to point things I could do to be a better wife and mom.  \n\nI called for an appointment in January, received an intake appointment after two weeks, then could not get in for a month.  The day before my appointment, I was canceled because my assigned therapist either quit or was fired without notice.  I was scheduled with another therapist, but had to wait a few more weeks to be seen.  When I went in, I was told I didn't have an appointment, and a supervisor had to help figure out what happened and I was able to be seen. \n\nAfter waiting for two months, I was relieved to finally talk to someone who would listen to me, because that is their job.  Instead, I got someone who told me I need to relax. Obviously.  When I tried to explain to her how I feel I can't relax because of my responsibilities, she literally slumped in her seat, threw her hands in the air, and told me she was \"just going to wait for me to stop talking\".  I tried to tell her the things my husband points out about me and she told me she didn't want to hear his opinion.  At that point, I knew I was done. If I couldn't discuss the reasons I needed to be there, there was no point in continuing.  \n\nI went through with her breathing techniques and left with a \"prescription\" from her that I was told to tape to my door at home. The prescription told my family to deal with their own issues and to leave me alone unless it was an emergency.  I didn't know what to think of this after I left. This tough love method might be appropriate for a therapist to say after numerous sessions with a patient, but not on a first meeting when trying to identify the reasons your patient is there in the first place.  \n\nShe canceled my next appointment due to other obligations and I was relieved. I canceled my next appointment and opted out of future visits.  I was hesitant to seek any outside help my entire life and she solidified that for me.  After being made a joke of, I will not return to therapy.  I am strong enough to handle something like this, but I hope Harmony is wise enough to keep her away from their more fragile patients.
