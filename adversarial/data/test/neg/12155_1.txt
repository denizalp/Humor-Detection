Quick to take your money, but hope you don't need them to come back. They won't! PestoKill was very unprofessional. The phone number you call is a cell phone, not a pro company at all. I had PetoKill spray one of my rental apartments for Cockroaches, they offered me a 6 Month  guarantee on the unit. The pricing was a little more then the other number I called but they seemed like a good company and I liked the 6 month warranty. They did reduce the amount of Cockroaches but they said they would do a follow up within 6 months if the problem did not go away. The tenant was complaining that there was still low activity. I called the main number they said a manager would call me back. never did! I called several more times and finally I did speak to the owner Yahya he assured me he would take care of the problem. I offered to pay to spray all of the other units while he was there just to make sure the problem is gone. He gave me a ridiculous price not even taking in consideration that he would have to come anyways. I refused his pricing for all the units since they did not have any issues anyways and I just asked him to fix the problem I have in the one. He said Ok, I am really busy this time of year but I will come after work Friday 4pm. I was thinking sure but I am a customer too. We paid you and this is your work? Like he was doing me a favor for coming. I didn't say anything because I just wanted to end this problem. I arranged it with tenants to spray.  Guess what NO SHOW!!  Wow what a surprised I called him twice Friday. Texted his phone Saturday asking what happened and one last chance Monday. Nothing doesn't pick up his phone or on the main line. I called another company and within a few hours I had the problem dealt with and ended up spraying almost all of the units for half what they offered me without having already paid them. Waste of my money and more important does not respect his customers and their time. I would never use them again!!
