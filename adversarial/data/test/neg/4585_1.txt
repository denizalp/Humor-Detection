Aaaannndddd... they are open again. Heard a rumor that they might be staying open and changing the name, so drove by. Was told everything was back to normal. All righty then. The personal trainers were there working. Still no TV's or computer when I got there, but when I left after my workout the computer was up and they were scanning cards. they don't have all their free-weights back either. \n\nHey they can do whatever they want, as long as they don't change what I pay!
