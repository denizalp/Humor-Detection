Scramble is a nice breakfast restaurant that only uses the freshest local produce and dairy in their mouth watering dishes. Every bite will leave you wanting more until you have an empty plate or bowl before you. Their customer service is spot on. The service is fast and friendly.  Its easy to see why this place has so many loyal customers and they gain new ones all the time. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for something that will wake up their palette and open their eyes to new flavors and delights.
