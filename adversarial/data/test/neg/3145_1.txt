Awesome job Yelp! While visiting Phoenix for a convention I found this place only a few blocks away from our hotel. We stopped in for dinner and although we were part of a small rush crowd we were quickly seated. \n\nThe waiter was humorous and prompt, and made some great recommendations for our meals. I ended up with the sweet potato pasta which is somewhat unusual for me. It was incredible! The broth was pretty sweet, but the waiter recommended the spicy ham which was a perfect balance. The wine was lovely and reasonable priced and they have a really cool way to create your appetizer charcuterie plate. \n\nIf you're a meat or cheese fan this is a definitely visit in the area. It also works well for vegetarians as the sweet potato dish rocked!
