Silly name but very good food. \nAmbiance and decor were ok; background music a la Kenny G got a little annoying. \nTom Gha soup was pretty spicy even at level 3 (out of 5). \nThe drunken noodles and Pad Thai were both very good- level 3 and 4 spicyness but they seemed about the same. \nPanang Curry was delicious- maybe a bit runny but tasty with steamed rice.
