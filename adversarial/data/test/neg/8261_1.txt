Best service I've had at a restaurant in a very long time! Waiter was Matt and he was very Attentive.\nI got the Eggs Benedict Pizza, really good prosciutto and the crust was buttery and hot when it came out.\n\nGrandma got the chicken and waffles, tried it as well was really good especially with their take on waffles which was made out of corn bread. Love corn bread and the fact it was eagle texture but still filling and hardy? Perfect. Gravy was chunky but still flavorful. Overall all the flavored balanced well.\n\nUncle got Lamb Burger, looked good and he enjoyed it but said it needed the creamy horseradish he loves and once he got it A1 as well.\n\nCame for brunch and they also have bottomless options. \n\n5 stars in my eyes because of one key thing. Went to the bathroom and my family had walked out and I thought they'd grab my left over pizza.. Was about half.. They didn't so I walked back to the table - no more than 3 minutes later- pizza had been tossed. Didn't even insist and Matt out of his way to stop what's he's doing speak with his manager and quickly inform me if I am in no rush if I could wait 5-10 for a new one to cook for me to take home. I mean I wasn't and was gonna walk around anyways so I opted to wait around and was expecting maybe half of a smaller version of one. But they gave me an entire pizza.. This one even seemed larger than my original one! Don't know the managers name, Caucasian man maybe 6'3 .. Thank you nd hats off to this place!\n\nAwesome decor; color schemes matched & you can tell the place was good simply by the fact that they were slammed.. I'm not the only one who thinks it too.\n\n100% recommend and I will be back to try some of those crazy percentage drafts
