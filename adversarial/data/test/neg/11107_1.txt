Once we landed from our uber early flight (came from east coast) we were running on empty so we agreed to try the Bellagio's holiday brunch buffet. \n\nNo lines at 8:30 am - jolly.\n\nBtw the Bellagio's champagne holiday brunch buffet is $37.99 plus $12.99 per person.\n\nHubs selected that option while I preferred the regular holiday brunch buffet. Champagne\/booze makes me sleepy and I wasn't tired -_0\n\nStaff informed us that the champagne holiday brunch also included mimosa and sangria drinks too. He just asked for champagne. The glass was always full :)\n\nAs I mentioned in previous buffet reviews, I'm not a volume gorger - rather I'm an assortment grazer.\n\nMemorable treats:\n+Regular French toast (freshly arrived)\n+Red velvet waffles also fresh (I added walnut topping)\n+Broccolini (sauteer w\/something zesty yummy)\n+Bacon (need I say more?)\n+Large cuts of watermelon (MMMM lycopene)\n+Coffee tiramisu (woke me up w\/caffeine flavor)\n+Key lime pie (love tarty taste)\n\nAlso thanks for constantly filling up my hot tea pot (brought my own oolong).\n\nService was courteous, professional, and efficient. As staff was switching some assignments over, our current server introduced us to our new server. Flawless switch. Nice.\n\nGreat way to start our random last-minute LV trip ^_^
