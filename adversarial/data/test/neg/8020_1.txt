We were excited seeing lunch special menu. We ordered pad thai with shrimp and musamun curry chicken. The portion for pad thai was good and it was okay. The portion for the curry was small. Taste wise, not impressed at all. The meal came with soup and egg roll. Things inside the soup were hardly identifiable, and it tasted overly sweet (for what we believe was hot and sour soup). Overall, visit was OK.
