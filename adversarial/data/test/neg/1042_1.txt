This is hands down the best BBQ I have ever had!  My bf and I had it a couple years ago and have been plotting to eat it again.  We planned a quick 24-hours in PHX just to eat!  We arrived straight from the airport right when it opened and was told it would be a two hours wait.   Our persistence paid off as we arrived in F A T T Y BRISKET HEAVEN after a little over two hours wait!  The wait is not too terrible if you're friendly and chat with the hungry folks around you.  The most nerve-wracking part is the occasional meats update and the fear of a fatty brisket shortage!  We may or may not have conspired with our neighbors in line to jump someone with a huge tray of what appeared to be fatty brisket :P\n\nPro tips: Fatty brisket, pork ribs, beef ribs and sausages \n\nSkip (only bc we had limited stomach real estate not bc it's not delicious): pulled pork, turkey \n\nSides in order of deliciousness in our humble opinion: potato salad, beans, jalapeño cheddar grits.\n\nDon't miss the pickles, jalapeños and onion to offset the fatty deliciousness!\n\nService was amazing and super friendly!  Everyone was very happy and share the common love for Tecas- style BBQ!  Cannot wait to come back!
