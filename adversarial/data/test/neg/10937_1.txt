Ridiculously awful, overpriced food. The bread served at the start was significantly burnt at the bottom. The fettuccini meat sauce dish was not a good recommendation. Needs a kick to it or something + imo pasta could have been cooked a little more. I've had microwaveable dinners better than that. Got the dessert that came with the meal + yelp review. Gosh it was awful... Must really have a rare palate to enjoy that. Definitely think they need to improve their menu, more taste tests and standards for cooking. Real flowers around the restaurant is a plus. Fake candles brings the experience back down a little. Don't go.
