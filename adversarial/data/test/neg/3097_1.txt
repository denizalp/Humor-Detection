this review is based on dim sum experiences in Los Angeles (626 area), Chinatown Los Angeles, Chinatown San Francisco, Chinatown New York, and Asia.  \n\nif this review was based on only las vegas dim sum, this would be a 4 star easily. \n\nthe service is TERRIBLE.  i'm chinese and i live in a highly populated asian area and i must say the service is terrible!!!!  they need to hire about 5 more waiters\/waitresses to handle all the business on holiday weekends or weekends in general.  they had at least 10 tables complaining and yelling at the manager, and the manager did not say sorry once.  \n\nthe food is good for vegas standard, probably the best dim sum you'll ever eat in las vegas.  but compared to dim sum in general, it was just up to par with normal-los angeles dim sum standards, nothing spectacular or special.\n\nprice: most items are $2.88 a plate, some (but not many) dishes are $2.18 and then there are some special priced items.\n\nWAIT:  do NOT come here with a big group.  most tables are meant for max 4 people and if u come with 5 person table...expect to wait over an hour without anyone giving you an estimate of how long the wait is.  also, if you have a gold coast member card, you get to cut, thus making the wait for other people even longer.\n\nin short:  best dim sum in vegas, but not worth the terrible service.  just skip dim sum and drive 4 hours to LA for better dim sum.\n\n-E
