5 stars alone for the Alaskan king crab legs.  That's all I pretty much ate.  Due to the holiday weekend, we had to wait a bit to get a table and pay more but when we did, we got to relax and take our time eating.  Steamed Alaskan king crab for me please! The sushi was meh.  So disappointing because they looked good but tasted boring.  There was such a huge variety of food that I feel badly I didn't eat anything but the crab legs.  Oh well. I guess I will just have to go back.
