I like Greek food, especially gyros so I was excited to see Mr. Greek open not too far from my home. I stopped in for some takeout on my way home from work.\n\nThe location is nice and bright, with high ceilings. The staff were friendly.\n\nI ordered the Original Traditional Gyro meal with rice, pita bread, and Greek salad. It was still warm when I got home but I have to say I was a little disappointed. The meat was kinda dry and the rice was a bit mushy. I wonder if dining in would have made a difference...
