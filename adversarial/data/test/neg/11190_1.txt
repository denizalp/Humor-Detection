My buddies and I were in Vegas and we decided to walk across the street from the MGM over to New York, New York for dinner.\n\nWe saw the 4 stars on Yelp and decided to make the trek.\n\nWe decided to sit outside on a beautiful night and they have a cool bar out there and lots of TVs. I ordered a beer (Pizza Port IPA) and the Cuban. I have had much better Cubans. Hardly any mustard, I couldn't even tell if there was pickle in there, it was very three star.\n\nI tried a few of my friend's chicken tenders and fried brussel sprouts though and they were fantastic!\n\nThe kale salad was nothing special, but good.\n\nOur service was slow, but I got a free beer because they brought the wrong one that I ordered though, so that was cool of them.\n\nGreat setting, but no way a 4 star place for my experience.\n\nI got 2 beers and my meal and after tip it was about $40.\n\nGreat company though, so it was a fun dinner!
