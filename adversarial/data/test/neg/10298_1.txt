Delicious natural casing dogs with a variety of toppings, great milkshakes, awesome design. Very happy to have this new addition to the scene.\n\nEDIT: After many return visits I can say the quality is consistent and the staff is always very friendly and competent. It has become my favorite \"fast food\" stop. Oh, and try the Retro Burger, it is, dare I say, better than a Swenson's Galley Boy. I know, blasphemy, but true.
