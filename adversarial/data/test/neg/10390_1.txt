The BF and I were looking for a simple brunch\/early lunch after flying in from Chicago. The four star rating I saw made me pick Bluebird Kitchen but we're leaving disappointed. The price of the food does not match the quality. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich, which was handed to me from a cooler in the back, and my boyfriend ordered the August salad, which he was told to pick from the cooler in front. I understand being prepared for the lunch rush, but why even call yourself a kitchen if you're simply handing out prepackaged food like 7-11? My chicken salad was entirely too salty, and my boyfriend's salad had bitter lettuce. Disappointing. And the customer service is likewise disappointing, as other Yelpers have mentioned. No one walks you through the menu, or explains why they serve some foods prepackaged or some foods hot.\n\nTL;DR not coming back and not recommending it.
