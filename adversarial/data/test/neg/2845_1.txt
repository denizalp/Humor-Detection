Awful, I called ahead to ensure there was no wait time, arrived to find not only a wait but other people ahead of me. After waiting 20 min the lady finally started my nails. Broke my real nail being hasty and careless. So then all my nails had to be shortened. I ended up paying $50 for a glorified manicure that doesn't look that great. The lady rushed through it and it still took over an hour. Never going back, wouldn't recommend to anyone.  *UPDATE* LESS than a week later and the clear coat is already flaking off.
