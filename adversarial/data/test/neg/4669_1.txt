I haven't gone here for vet services, but I bring my small dog here for small dog only daycare!  :D  Prices are very reasonable and the staff are so friendly!!  My little puppy loves them.  They also boarded her for a night once and I was very pleased with their accommodations.  :)  I can greatly recommend their daycare.  It's on Tuesdays and Thursdays only and I feel good knowing my little 8lb dog isn't in danger of being crushed by a much larger dog.\n\nI have a great recommendation for their vet services, though, and may start going there for regular vet now that I've moved further away from my current vet.  If I switch, I'll update my review here.  :)
