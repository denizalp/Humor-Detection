I went into BMW of Las Vegas Friday night, 05\/26\/2015. I was met by a very nice sales rep. After driving a car, we went to talk about pricing. As my Credit is not the best, I asked that my credit be checked BEFORE negotiations for a lease, as the lease amount may be different based on my credit score.\nThis process was done Friday night, I was unable to come to an agreement on the car, no hard feelings. I left that night and decided to look some more.\nI was contacted by this sales rep Saturday afternoon, I opted in to come in and check out a few different cars. \nSpeaking with the SAME sales rep, I dove a few cars, and then went into negotiations. \nWe were able to come to a pretty fair agreement on cost, and was asked to wait to see the fiance manager. This is where things started to go down hill.\nWe waited for about an hour before anyone came to see us. When someone did come see us, it was the floor manager asking me to fill out the credit application again, I expressed my concern about having to fill this out again, I was told that it was probably shredded and that they didn't store this information on file but that my lease about WOULD NOT be affected as they knew my previous score (I even handed him the credit report which I signed the night before from BMW)\nI was offered from BMW cups due to the wait and I accepted.\nAbout 30 minutes later I was brought into the fiance office, I was told in fact my credit paper work WAS NOT shredded, but on someones desk, on top off that BMW did again run my credit check again (which produced a worse score due to running again). The finance manager asked me to speak with the manager as the score I had was not able to get the offer we had all agreed on.\nThe manager came in, extremely rude, over talking, evening putting his hand up to stop my g\/f from speaking. \nHe refused to even allow us to talk, it was obvious he made a HUGE mistake.\nBefore my g\/f and I walked out, I demanded to watch him shred my information, he just mocked me and put it in a drawer instead and pointed us to the door.\nAt this point we walked out, I ran into my sales rep and explained the situation, then the very nice floor manager wanted to know what happened. I explained to him he should go speak with his manager as I was done being at the dealer.\n\n5 hours total a waste. It was a shame, the sales rep and floor manager were extremely nice and helpful, as was the fiance manager.\nIf the manager at this location were at the lease a little more honest and were able to talk then I wouldn't have any problem doing business with them. I now will not be buying any car from this location OR the Henderson location.\nI will also be making a complaint with the AG for loosing my personal information (Including SSN, Address, Telephone number, business name, etc) I will also being making a complaint with BBB for deceptive business practices of lying and changing the price of the car.
