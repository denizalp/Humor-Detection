I have been going here for over 4 years now. I love it - they are available sometime last minute and they do take appointments in fact they prefer them but they do accept walk in as well.  They listen and do what you ask for. \nThey do an excellent job on my nails and are fast.  The pedicures are great too - they really go the extra mile - The salon is clean and well lit.  I enjoy relaxing when I go - my favorite part is the chair with the massage while I get my pedicure!
