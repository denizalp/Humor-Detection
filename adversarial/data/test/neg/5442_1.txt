On a scale of 1 - 10 I give it a 4 at best.  If you are looking for purely quantity and quality is not an issue, the $5.99 for lunch is a good price.  The food is adequate.  It will keep you from starvation yes.  Is it good, well, in regards to other buffets, I give it so so at best.  If you are in a crunch then go ahead but dont expexct much. \nThere is ZERO atmosphere.  The place looks like a 70\"s cafeteria.  The service is good, the servers were quick to clear dishes and refill my drink.
