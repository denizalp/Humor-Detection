This location is the former J and C Tasty House. The restaurant offers a Chinese Soup Bar experience. The soup bar is quite interesting and this is my first time. Food tastes good but is reliant on what you self select as ingredients. Yes, that's right, it is a make your own soup approach. The kitchen does the final preparation. The staff pay close attention to cleanliness.\n\nWould have given 4 stars but, the space and the ambience needs a complete enhancement.\n\nWill recommend.
