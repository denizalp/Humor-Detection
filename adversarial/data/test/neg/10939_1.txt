Came here on a Thursday for early-ish dinner and shared several tapas\/small plates. I really liked the stuffed dates, warm pimento cheese dip that came with our soft pretzels and the mac and cheese - definitely recommend those. The patatas bravas were too burnt and came with hardly any aioli - I had to ask for extra. Tried a bit of the cauliflower tempura - pretty good. \n\nFor drinks I skipped the beer and had a fall sangria - very delicious but should've had that for pre-dinner cocktail and then just have wine with meal because the flavors of cider and spice-laden sangria overpowered food at times.  \n\nOverall I liked it here, the space was large, plenty of room at communal table, waitress was very nice.
