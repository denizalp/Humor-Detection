Stopped in for a quick free diagnosis of my brakes because they've been rather noisy lately. Got a call about 45 minutes later saying that the problem was that my struts and\/or cartridge needed to be replaced and the cost was expected to be about $1300. Well, I don't have that kind of cash on me so I just went back and grabbed my car and then called another local mechanic who is very well trusted in the area. I wanted to avoid this because I had to borrow my partner's car to get to work, which left him stranded without a vehicle for at least a day. Well, it was worth the wait because he says that my brake system is completely safe. He checked the struts specifically and said they are totally in tact and not leaking. \n\nI have heard from more than a few sources that Pep Boys will scam you out of your money if given the chance, and this was more than enough evidence for me to never go back for anything, no matter how simple or inexpensive the task. Feel free to Google \"Pep Boys scam\" and you'll find a ton of results from customers and employees alike. Although I can't say whether or not these statements are true, there does seem to be a lot of them. They do, however, have an A+ on the BBB despite 86% of their reviews being negative. \n\nI'll take inconvenience any day over being scammed out of several hundred dollars. Shame.
