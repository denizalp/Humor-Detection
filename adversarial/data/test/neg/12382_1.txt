We made a reservation at 6, for a group of 4 for our prom. We called them before & told them we're running a little late! When we arrive we thought it was going to be packed, considering it's prom but it wasn't! Bless lol! We were seated near the window, which I love because that's where the best lighting is & hello window seat!! I love the interior of the place, it was very classy & I really like the red seats against the wall. Our server was nice, he read us the specials and was very attentive by refilling our glasses MANY times! (We were SO quench, we just came back from taking pictures LOL) I ordered the salmon BLT, no bacon & the quinoa salad. Salmon was cooked medium, I feel like it could be cooked a tad more inside but it was good! The bread that it came on was heaaaven! My quinoa salad was pretty good too. Oh, btw the restroom is super nice too! Just thought I'll throw that out there(: Overall I really like the atmosphere of this place, can't wait to come back on a nice sunny day to try their brunch(:
