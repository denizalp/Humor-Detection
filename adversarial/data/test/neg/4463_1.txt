I'm from the northeast and this place reminds me of home. It's like walking into an  Italian deli back east (or about as close as you can get to it out in the desert).\n\nChick Parm...deli meats...fresh pizza dough...I love this place. They also sell a lot of Italian groceries you won't find in the local supermarkets. Pretty cool...
