I wanted to like this place. Shoot, I even gave it a second Groupon try, but unfortunately, I can't mesh with the female teacher here. \n\nI have had her for both of my experiences, and both times have had the same results. I know it isn't just me, both times I brought at least five people in my party.\n\nIs she nice? Yes. Very. She teaches school and seems really cool.\n\nBut for some reason, I feel like she hasn't really clicked with the whole concept. Every time I have gone, she rushes ahead, messes up, doesn't paint the picture that we sign up for, and leaves us with incomplete paintings because we run out of time. The last one I did, she simply kind of just announced we had ten minutes to just \"do whatever we wanted to finish our painting.\" It was quite disappointing as we aren't artists and wanted her to instruct us how to do the painting all the way to the finish. \n\nAlso, as mentioned, she went way off from what we signed up for. The first time she didn't hang a picture of the original. So, the second time we asked several times if she would (knowing she strays from it) but she wouldn't.  \n\nIt sounds trivial almost, but when you pay that much and want to paint a specific painting to hang up in your home, its insanely disappointing. The second picture we did was a poppy field. We never even got to the poppies. So, I came home with a picture of some mountains.
