What an amazing arena! Parking is not that bad since during an event there are slot of people directing you where to go. I've seen Billy Joel, Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood perform at the T-Mobile Arena and honestly, there are no bad seats there. I think the designers and engineers really thought this arena out so that everyone can enjoy a really good show. There's a huge jumbo Tron in the middle of the ceiling so you could see wherever you are sitting. There's a Budweiser Lounge in there if you want to get some drinks. Also, if you go early enough before your show you can walk right over to The Park, which has trendy restaurants and bars. There was a sushi restaurant, a pub which had casual Americana food with table games around, and the one I actually tried Bruxie. Bruxie serves chicken sandwiches in waffles and it was so good! Just remember to keep an eye on the time before your show starts! The facility is really clean and organized. I personally recommend wearing comfortable shoes though. The stair steps can be a little steep. I wore heels which wasn't so bad, but I think I would wear flats or wedges next time just because I was walking around a lot. Great place to see a show though!
