Had a great time here and will definitely be back.  I do wish there was a way to make reservations though as I live in north toronto and it's hard to get down there and then wait 45 minutes or so.  Had fun though and really appreciated the staffs knowledge of the games.  They even sat down with us to play a few rounds until we got the hang of it.
