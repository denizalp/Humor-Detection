The ambience is great!  Perfect for a date night, they have a full bar and the food is amazing!  Seriously, I think this is my favorite Indian restaurant of all times.  I just got done eating and I think I want to eat some more, its that good.  There was also a bellydancer that was amazing and super friendly.  They apparently have dancers every Friday and Saturday, perfect for a girls night or just something different to do.
