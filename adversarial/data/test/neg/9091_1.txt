I see a lot of good words here for Paul, who probably is the owner of the company. Unfortunately I had the misfortune of getting service done by Matthew who works for Paul. Boy Matthew is a person with an attitude, he thinks that the he can boss around the homeowner just like he was bossing around with his poor assistant. No manners and I will never allow him to be within 100 feet radius of my neighborhood. He will not clean after himself and just wants the homeowner to clean up his mess. Paul, get rid of him before he ruins your reputation.
