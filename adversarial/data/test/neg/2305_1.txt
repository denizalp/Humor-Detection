The service was amazing, I was thinking that since their \"all you can eat\" sushi deal was only for an hour, we were going to get gipped but I couldn't be more wrong. Every order was brought to the table super fast, no way I could eat all of that in an hour. The menu was very extensive, tons of new things to try.
