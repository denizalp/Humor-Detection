This is the second time my mother is at La Estancia. The first time was for a knee replacement a few years ago and now was for physical training. I would give this establishment 10 stars if I could, but 5 is the max. All the staff are exceptional, respectful, professional, courteous and above all care for you and your family member. I always evaluate a place by asking myself if I would be Ok to be there myself! And the answer is YES for La Estancia! Go visit the place and see how friendly and nice the staff is for your self!\n\nThank you LE for taking good care of my mom!!!!
