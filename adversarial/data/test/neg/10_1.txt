The best meal we had in Las Vegas and worth every penny. From arrived to help and suggestions with the menu to explaining each course that arrived, we were blown away and that was before the incredible dessert and a visit from the manager to check on our dining experience! You must try the amberjack tiradito and I urge to to get the sea bass anticucho.. Literally melted in out mouth, simply outstanding. We also had the shishito peppers and the Lima roll, both excellent. Dessert was chocolate banana cake... Just when we thought things could not get better, they did. Thank you Sushisamba we will return as soon as humanly possible!
