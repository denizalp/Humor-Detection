Even though I visited the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument during a renovation period where everything around it was being excavated, I still found the monument to be beautiful and humbling. The bronze monuments were so well made that they felt quite lifelike with life-size representations of Lincoln and other famous individuals from American history.\n\nI will definitely visit it again after the square is renovated.
