I love grocery shopping, ergo I love the Real Canadian Superstore. They have a ton of everything, are Canadian owned and operated, and have a ton of distractions that make each major trip a worthwhile venture. \n\nI start off each visit by quickly peeking through the toiletries section. They have some very good salon quality products like Joico and Biolage in the haircare selection and they are CHEAP. They I swing into the very obvious, very awesome section of Joe Fresh style. I'm sure buying clothes from superstore says something about me, but they're often cute and stylish and a VERY good deal. I then swing up past the electronics section (cheap DVDs!) and the housewares section (cute dishes! bed sheets!) and then up to their admirable cheese and deli sections. \n\nI feel like this Superstore has a few notable strengths: they have a stellar fresh seafood section, a great variety of dry ethnic (Chinese, Japanese and Indian) foods, and a great variety of unusual fruits and vegetables. Shopping here is also considerably cheaper than some of Calgary's higher-end grocery stores and it has everything that they have and more. This place is HUGE.\n\nThere are some notable downsides too. As mentioned by Christopher W., this place is packed. Visiting on the weekends is the worst, but even weeknight evenings mean parking near the end of the lot, scrounging for a cart and fighting your way through the store. This is grocery shopping as contact sport. You can avoid it by going very early or very late, or just sucking it up (I do this).\n\nThey have everything you could possibly need, and it is really cheap. Books, toiletries, a pharmacy, electronics, school supplies, work out equipment, ethic food, tons of dry goods, bulk bins, sea food, EVERYTHING. \n\nI don't come when I only have a few items to pick up, because there are almost always massive lineups, even in the ten items or less lineup. \nI limit my visits to one massive trip every few weeks. Saves on frustration, cash, and time.
