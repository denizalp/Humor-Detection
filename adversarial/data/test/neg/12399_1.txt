A good Greek food experience. Cretan Moussaka was delicious and complete as a portion. Meat, vegetable, rice, layers over layers and topped with cheeeese. The meal is too big to finish and we brought some back home.\nI did not like the Espresso though! Why espresso in a Greek restaurant? Needed some to swallow the super sweet baklava. But the cup was so tiny and half fam before I reach some drops of the bitter dear :)\nThe baklava is much bigger than what you get in Arab or Turc restaurants. I would like it more if It was crispier.\nIn sum, I would definitely try Greek food again. I left with many untried items on the menu. \nStaff: friendly. \nService: slow for a Sunday night and a half full restaurant.\nPrices a bit inflated but I say the big portion make up for it.\nParking was plenty when we dined here.\nAmbiance is casual, good for children, medium level of noise.
