This newest sushi style.\nThey are using fresh fish,so good.\nTheir cooked items, like eel and tempura, are very delicious as well.\nThe in house unagi sauce had plenty of flavor and not overly sweet.\nI enjoyed having endless vegetables to choose for my burrito.\nThe service was very friendly and the staff helped me through the whole process.\nI can't wait to come back.
