Ordered a chicken shwarma and it was very small- finished it in 3 bites. Taste is a bland. Would much rather go to Soulvaki hut and get the same thing, same price, bigger portion and ten times better.\n\nService was okay. When I was at the Take-Out counter, the workers  (who were right beside me) ignored me and no one acknowledged me. Took about 5 minutes until I asked one of them if I could have my order and they gave it to me...
