this has to be one of my favorite locations. not for nothing else but, they have BOOTHS, sometimes they are always taken up, but they have BOOTHS! \nthe service here is really good, and the store is kept pretty clean all the times I've visited. \nunfortunately is outside of queens park station, but as long as you visited outside of peak hours, I think you would be in and out in a quick fashion. \nthe staff get a tiny bit upset when you ask to use the bathroom though, please let me go before I place my order, thanks! \ngreat transit options, and parking is offsite.
