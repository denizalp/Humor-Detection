I am a teacher; I went to buy some supplies for classroom; there was a teacher appreciation deal for 30% discount; I thought why not let me use it. I bought for $43. When I went to checkout (I saw the cashier, he is working there for the last 4 years: The time I moved into this area). He really asked for help from another person in the back to see why the machine is not taking the discount (he pretend). Remember, The machine refused to give the discount which is $12.9. I do not have a problem; but why they do these type of ads if they do not want to honor them.? the guy is red headed white boy. what a shame. waiting 12 minutes for him to discount a teacher $12.9 for supplies to classroom. It didn't work, hey teacher: do not buy from this ugly attitude store.  I haven't shave for the last 10 days because I am enjoying my summer vacation; a blonde old woman kept looking at me; okay; I went on shopping she followed me in the aisles and ask me: may I help you find something? huhh; I thought for a little; what was she thinking? Then I thought may be I look suspicious; but also thought may be she needs a date; I finally came to a conclusion: I am married and happily after. Thank you office lie.
