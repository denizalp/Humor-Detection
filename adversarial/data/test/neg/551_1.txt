Before I get some response telling me that I don't understand Bikram Yoga and I should do more research, I'll tell you that I do know what Bikram Yoga is and I've done my research. \n\nThere *is* more than one Bikram studio in the city so there is a way to compare. I don't want to start some yoga war, but I find the atmosphere of this studio not very welcoming. There seems to be no allowance for any modifications if you can't get the pose. Other Bikram studios I've been to want you to try for the pose, but will help you get there if you can't. \n\nI've given this studio two separate trial periods at different times, but it's really not for me. And they do have an issue with regulating the heat. I find as soon as the windows are open, any kind of heat regulations goes out the window...\n\n***\nJust a response to Zeb, I don't feel like I've been cooked at any other Bikram studio. They just keep the temp and humidity constant, which I appreciate. Opening a window doesn't give you precise temperature regulation.\n\nAnd I actually tried this studio multiple times both under the old ownership and the new ownership. I went in with an open mind and a positive attitude, bec. I love all types of yoga. But having the owner of the studio glaring at you on the sidewalk outside, as you walk in, does not give a good impression. And no, it wasn't just in my mind and I'm actually not being overly sensitive and yes, it was obvious I was going to do yoga and I did try to smile at her bec. I recognized her from the website.
