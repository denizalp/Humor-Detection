BFF dinner date: great spot in DTS, we sat on the outside balcony as the sun was setting. Great views. we had the ceviche and deviled eggs, which were perfect for 2 and the shrimp and chicken noodle salad to split. Everything was super fresh and just delicious. To top it off, our waitress Rachel was amazing: she knew the drink and food menu like no other and really helped us decide. The menu has so much variety! What a great experience.
