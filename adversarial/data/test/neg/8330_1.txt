What a great choice we made to come here. We made our decision based on the reviews and were glad we did.\nWe were promptly greeted on arrival by Tony, who in turn introduced us by name to the entire staff. Nice touch!\nAs we were seated, Tony arrived with the delicious garlic knots. We wolfed those down and he delivered a second order, both on the house. Another nice touch!\nWe ordered the special version of the pizza (round)and it was delicious. \nService was prompt and friendly the entire visit.\nThen Tony sent over some delicious cannoli for desert. (Also, on the house).\n\nThis place was far beyond my expectations.\nWe plan to return for a second visit tonight with 4 friends and introduce them to this awesome find!\n\nThank you to Tony and Staff! You guys are awesome.
