Received a gift card for here a looooong time ago and figured it was about time that I tried the place. Along with the gift card, I signed up for their E-Club where I immediately received a coupon for a Bogo pizza. A fantastic deal, in my opinion. \n\nWe ended up getting two pizzas and an appetizer. \n\nThe app was a Mediterranean Dip Trio. It included Hummus, baba ghanoush, and Lebni cheese. My favourite out of the three was the baba ghanoush. The hummus was also good, but the Lebni cheese just tasted like a really lemony sour cream. Of course, this was my first time having Lebni cheese, so I can't compare it to others elsewhere. I'm not saying it was bad, just not as good as the others on the trio platter. \n\nThe two pizzas we got were the Goat cheese pizza and the Burrata and Pesto pizza. Both were good. My boyfriend preferred the Burrat and Pesto, but I preferred the Goat cheese. \n\nThe pizzas aren't large. They are about the size of a large dinner plate. We ended up taking leftovers home. Not a whole lot, but a few slices of pizza. \n\nOverall, our experience was a good one. The food is decent and the menu has a LOT of variety.  Our waitstaff was also very pleasant and constantly smiling. Will we come back? Not sure. It was good but not anything special. Perhaps during happy hour?
