Nice simple interior, clean and friendly staff. I was recommended by a friend who is American  but has spent considerable time in India and...... drum roll.... omg this is my new favorite Indian restaurant in Arizona! Actually it's my new favoriteIndian restaurant period, I lived in California for 40 years and this gem  now takes top spot! My husband and I both chose platters for lunch and I had shrimp and he chicken. Everything in plate was good but The Marsala was DIVINE, we both agreed. I will definitely be a repeat customer wanting to try the rest of the menu.
