I have fallen in love with this place. I thought it was just a lil bar so we never bothered to eat here. But it goes all the way back, it's a huge full restaurant.  Everyone from the hostesses, busboys and waiters are very nice and attentive. The decor is so tranquil, restaurant is clean food is reasonably priced and DELICIOUS.
