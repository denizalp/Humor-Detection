As a vegan in the Cleveland area, I squealed in delight as my husband and I drove past the shop and saw \"Vegan Frozen Yogurt\" in the window. Even if I weren't vegan, I would have appreciated this option, as dairy never agreed with me.\n\nMy non-vegan husband and I split a vegan yogurt with a variety of toppings (and he got to try mochi for the first time). He also appreciated the non-dairy option, as he didn't leave with an upset stomach either. We enjoyed the flavors and choices, and my husband agreed that if you didn't tell someone it was coconut based, people would think it was regular froyo. Neither one of us sampled the regular yogurt, but they seemed like they had a lot of good and unique options.\n\nOne of my only complaints is the staff seemed young (and I'm not that old myself - 30) and not very involved. They need to work on their customer service skills in general. Not very conversation and very much into their own conversations. Some other works came in as we were leaving, and they were all engaged in socialization conversation (not work related) and we said goodbye to all of them several times, even as we walked right by them, and they ignored us. I don't know if this was because it was 11:45 AM on a Saturday....or what.\n\nThe cost seemed fine to me, and in line with other yogurt places. I would rather pay a little more for higher quality food.\n\nI appreciate the owners taking a step in the organic direction, with good vegan options as well. I support organic and local, so this place was refreshing to me. AND I was so excited to have a frozen yogurt treat! I would recommend this to friends, non-vegan and vegan.
