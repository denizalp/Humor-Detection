Had breakfast with a friend and selected this restaurant based on previous reviews. We had a concern about poor service comments and the staff being overwhelmed. We however didn't experience this!  Our server was attentive, the food tasted great and the cost was very reasonable. We had the Farmer's Breakfast and Tuscan Veggie Omelet, with drinks the bill was $25. We look forward to a return visit!\n\nWritten by Fork of Fork N Knife\/Knife N Fork...be sure to check out reviews by my critic in crime, Knife!
