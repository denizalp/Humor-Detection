I Wasn't impressed with this location at all. They were out of almost all of the cookies the night we went. The guy working told us the previous employee didn't leave him with anything, so he had to bake everything himself.  He couldn't keep up. They had a small selection to choose from and none of their specialty cookies were available. My mother in law wanted one of the specialty cookies that were on display but he said it would be 20+ minutes.  She decided on a brownie after that.  It was dry and tasted a day or two old.  My cookies were ooey and gooey and just came out of the oven.  They were tasty but after we had been waiting for ten minutes he served two other girls that just walked in ahead of us.  Overall a poor experience and probably won't be back.
