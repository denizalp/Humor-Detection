I've been here twice now, once for a birthday and once for a date night, and been impressed both times.\n\nI've tried their house margarita and their hibicus margarita - both were very good, but there really wasn't much of a difference in taste.\n\nThey have a great variety of tacos on the menu for about 4 bucks each.  Their fish tacos are delicious.  They have a 2 taco combo with rice and beans for I think 8.95.\n\nI've come on a weekend night both times, and both times the place was pretty empty.  I'm not sure why!  They've got a great selection of drinks and this would be a fun place to get a night out in Old Town started.  I will definitely come back!
