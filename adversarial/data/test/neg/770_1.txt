I was headed to the Middle Eastern Bakery, but parked on the north side of the complex, and Lizabelle's Treasures was the first building and caught my eye because it is an antique store.\n\nI walked in and was delighted.  Not only do they have cool stuff, but a lot of it is reasonably priced.  Meaning, even I, the queen of cheap, could afford it!  The space is larger than would appear from the outside, and you keep discovering doors to go through - love that!  They have quite a selection of cool stuff, and you can tell from the tags that the owner likes his stuff, and what he does. \n\nI didn't have the time I'd have liked (the bakery was calling) but definitely will go back!\n\nLizabelle's Treasures is a delight I can't wait to explore further.
