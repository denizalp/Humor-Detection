I LOVE that this is a dedicated gluten free restaurant and I don't have to worry about getting sick when ordering. I was able to eat biscuits and gravy for the first time in a long time. It was really good and there were a lot tempting items on the menu (chicken waffles anyone?). I will definitely be back to try more.
