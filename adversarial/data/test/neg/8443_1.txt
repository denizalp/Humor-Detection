Had a nice dinner here on a Monday night - tried the Chicken Madeira which was delicious - it came with asparagus and mushrooms with a yummy sauce and mashed potatoes - really good. Service was OK - not the best, waiter was very busy, but very nice, so nothing to complain about.\n\nThis is one of my favorite chain restaurants - they have a huge variety to choose from both in food and drinks and their cheesecake is so good. Mondays are a good day - they were busy but not crazy busy - and there was no wait, which is good because if I can't make reservations I usually don't go to a restaurant if there is a wait.\n\nWine is overpriced - but I am not surprised.\n\nI recommend the Godiva chocolate and white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake - they are amazing.
