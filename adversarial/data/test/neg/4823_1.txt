A sea of people, awesome live DJ's with splashing, twerking, dancing, and rave like atmosphere!  It's where the party is Vegas!  One negative is the price for drinks and minimums! Try $1500 for a table... Hello!!? We had good wait service but the prices are crazy. Major holidays are slammed, don't get me wrong it's a good time but the comps at Wynn are horrible now. We heard from people and cabbies on the strip that Wynn isn't comping much anymore and we sure figured that out. Wynn properties used to be so good about comps if you're a player but seems things have changed!  Cosmopolitan and Marque are a great alternative. I still had a great time and music was sick, just would have been better if Steve Wynn still ran his properties the same as he used to. Starting to feel like the other corporate yea who's on the strip.
