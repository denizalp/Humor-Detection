I brought my I8 in for a gas tank issue, first thing the truck driver said when pulling up to pick up the car was 'these I8's have a recall on the fuel pump-gas tank, 4th one I have picked up this month'!. BMW told me it was just a software update, I thought that it would be more than that and I was correct. This was a fuel pump issue, they kept the car for 3-4 days, i had to go to enterprise to get a rental which was a nightmare.  They fixed the fuel pump & When I got the car back there were scratches all along the driver side from the front bumper all the way to the back tire.  I asked what this is from? they try to use an excuse that their car wash might have accidentally done this, which is not possible when paint is chipped. I took pictures asked for a manager Immediately I dealt with a woman with black hair, i forget her name but she was helpful and got me into a BMW loaner vehicle & said 'we will take care of it, this is clearly our fault, I am so sorry!' then I started dealing with this gentleman named Josh that is a service director\/coordinator he was very hard to deal with.  I got an original quote for $3000 in paint work from AutoNation instead of them fixing it at AutoNation they took it to a third-party car wash to try to get professional buff work done, I was trying to get an update a few days later and spike to Gus, he hung up on me when i called their bluff, first estimate they gave me said paint work, they sent a second estimate which was cheaper that did not include paint work, now I am so upset I do t even want to go back in there but they called me back a few days later acting like everything was okay & fixed, so I went to go see.  when I arrived the car still had scratches on the driver front and Close to the back tire. They still did not want to paint it!  I said I was going to get my lawyer involved they took me more seriously. Josh was very hard to deal with he made me feel very uncomfortable he changed his story multiple times as I asked him as what they were going to do to rectify the situation.  he said 'honestly I don't have to fix it we are trying to be nice' knowing that BMW damaged the vehicle. He then said that he would just park it out in the parking lot if I mention my lawyer again, but did continue to talk to me about the situation. It felt like he just wanted to argue with me about it, basically they wanted to cut corners & did not want to pay the cost to fix the car properly at say a certified BMW specialist collision center, instead they bring it to a car wash to get a buff! keep in mind this is $100,000 BMW I8 that I just purchased not even two weeks ago, out of the two weeks it's been at BMW for a week and a half!  the car is currently there as we write this review! they gave me a loaner to use & said I could not drive 50 miles a day or I would be charged? The reason why I'm writing this review is because people should not be using this dealership for service or for anything at all! They are independently owned & BMW North America will not help you at all with any situation or escalation. Best thing I could do is try to help the next person that is going to go through the same thing that I did. My suggestion is try BMW of Henderson because that's where I'm going to start going and I will write a follow-up review on my experience there.
