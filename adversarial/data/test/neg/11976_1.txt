A totally unique and open 3rd floor space feels fun and cool. This location made a perfect birthday surprise spot for my amazing fianc√©. Not only because of this great third floor bar, but because of the wonderful Italian restaurant on the second floor (just take the elevator back down to entry floor and walk up the stairs to 2). Loved the appetizers and the craft beers on tap, hard cider options and wine - everyone can order their favorite drink here. \nI cannot wait to visit again especially in the summer when the roof is open. Even in early Oct with the roof closed, this unique space made for a perfect start to a special bday celebration. Service was great too!
