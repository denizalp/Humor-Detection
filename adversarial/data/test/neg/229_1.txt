I love Bertha's Cafe! I go there often for lunch as it is near my work. Their food is fresh, tasty, and reasonably priced! My favorite is the half sandwich half salad combo which comes with a mini cookie and bag of chips. I usually get the roasted turkey sandwich and the chopped salad for my combo and it's great! Lots of ingredients, lots of flavor. I've tried almost everything on the menu and it's all wonderful.
