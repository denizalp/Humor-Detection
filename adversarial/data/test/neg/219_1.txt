The place is good and the hotel rooms are also great. What I did not like about the whole thing was they tricking us into a 'timeshare presentation'. They will just tell you that you need to fill a 'survey' and there is a free brunch and some gifts. Well, the gifts are not really 'free' gifts, its discounted show tickets in Vegas. So spending 3 hrs on this 'timeshare presentation' (they take you around the resort to sell their timeshare property) for a free brunch and tickets, don't make sense at all! All my friends and I were so irritated by the end of it. They do not tell how long the whole thing will take, and one would never guess a 'survey' taking 3 hrs to say no to it.\n\nSo, just stay from this 'timeshare' scam and buy your tkts elsewhere if you can!
