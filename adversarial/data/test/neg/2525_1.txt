I can't believe I went to this store, every time we passed by it. All the hard candy and the gummies..the chocolate...the pastries...they're all just too inviting!!!!\n\nSo i got the bling hello kitty lollipop for $25 and 2 sets of a mix of lollipop toppers. I super love the watermelon and the blue raspberry flavors.\n\nI love it!!!!
