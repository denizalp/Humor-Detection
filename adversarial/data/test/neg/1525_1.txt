Kohl's has the best-looking, brightest, most spacious, and cleanest...\n\n...bathrooms out of all department stores out there.\n\nThe whole store is the same way. I love Kohl's for great deals on clothes and accessories. With Kohl's cash in hand and coupons, my budget can be stretched further here. I love the little surprise finds too in the watch & jewelry section, as well as from the kitchen & appliance sections.
