I live in L.A and I liked this place, they actually cut my hair how i wanted it, which in L.A they dont do it exactly how i want it. I was even considering coming to vegas just to get my haircut here. \nEmployees are funny and make you feel welcomed, these guys know what they are doing, best haircut place ive been too.
