This nail salon is not worth your time or money! Today I went in without an appointment because this location is close to my house. I thought it would be busy due to holiday time so I was prepared to wait, however there were only about 5 customers in the salon. I picked out a color and they sat me in a pedicure chair. I ended up waiting in this chair for over 30 minutes until the water was cold. When someone finally sat down in front of me, she was scolded by the manager to go over and assist someone else. I proceeded to wait 10 more minutes and when I was attended to, I ended up with about a 30 second foot scrub, no leg massage and wax put on my feet. By the time my toes were painted, the \"pedicure\" had lasted about a total of 7 minutes. No cuticles were cut, no calluses shaven off and no leg or foot massage. The manager came up to me before my last toe was painted and says \"You pay now\" in a very demanding tone. I pay the $35 with a card thinking the receipt will have a tip line and she returns a receipt with no option for tip. She then gets mad at me because I don't have cash to tip and she has to go back and create a separate transaction to charge for tip on my card. I ended up paying $40 for a polish change that I could have done myself at home. Strongly advise to go anywhere but here!
