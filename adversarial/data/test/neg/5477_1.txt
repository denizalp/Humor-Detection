I'm so happy to have found this place which is right down the street from my job. I stopped in during my lunch break with a craving for fried rice, but I opted for a lunch menu dish instead. They offer a $9 pre-fix menu with a decent amount of options. It includes rice, a wonton, soup and a salad. For my main meal I ordered the garlic chicken and mixed vegetables which was absolutely amazing!!! What's more, the service was fantastic, along with the ambiance of the restaurant. Definitelty give this place a try if you're in the area.
