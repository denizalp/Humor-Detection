Great service by David this week.  He completed a second repair on an aging built-in refrigerator.  He was running a little behind schedule but kept me informed of his arrival time.  He completed the repair quickly and even found a creative solution to another issue I had with the fridge drawer.  He saved me money, time and worry.  I will recommend this company to friends and neighbors.
