I echo the other reviews - great place with a small but well-chosen selection. The guy (Doug) who runs it is very friendly and knowledgeable about midcentury modern decor. \n\nUnfortunately, this location will be closing soon. I'm hoping he opens another local shop sometime soon, since it was great having this little slice of Palm Springs retro sophistication in Central Phoenix.
