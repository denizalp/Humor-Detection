We wanted to try something new and yelp brought us here. We were very pleased. We got a calzone and a chicken gyro. The food was reasonably priced and made to order. It taisted awesome and exceeded our expectations. The staff was very friendly and seemed to truly care about their customers experience. So many places don't concentrate on customer satisfaction but these guys hit is out of the park!
