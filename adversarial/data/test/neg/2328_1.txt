I recently moved to Vegas and had my first haircut appointment with Sharyn today and she was AMAZING!!). I have moved a lot in my life and always dread finding a new stylist because nobody ever listens to me and does what I ask!!  It is so frustrating and it usually takes me several months to find someone that I like and that I can trust!  Not this time!!  Sharyn called me back 10 minutes BEFORE my actual appointment time.  She spent a long time discussing exactly what I wanted and asked me lots of questions about my hair and what products I used.  She then gave me an awesome shampoo complete with a scalp massage and spent a very long time cutting my hair.  She was very meticulous both with my cut and styling and spent a long time with me, all while showing me different styling techniques to try and make it easier for me to take care of my extremely fine hair.  ( I moved from extremely humid weather in Florida to dry weather here in Vegas and was having a difficult time managing my hair!!)  She gave me some awesome and easy suggestions.  Her knowledge and passion for what she does was evident!  I didn't feel rushed and she wanted to make sure that I was completely satisfied with her services, which I was!!  I \"hit the jackpot\" this time and I look forward to having Sharyn as my stylist for years to come!!  :o)
