I would have given 0 stars, if possible.  This company is absolutely terrible. The service is EXTREMELY slow (waited on line for 20 minutes) and despite having a quote for $185, the actual bill ended up being $450!  There is 40% tax apparently and they charged an extra day since we were 3 hours late on return, despite us telling them we'd returning the car in the late afternoon. Apparently 12 pm is the same as late afternoon. They basically screw you since you have no time to argue when you're trying to catch a plane. Will never use this company again. STAY AWAY!!
