Tyler of Penguin Air came over  to conduct our Maintenance & Tune Up of our two HVAC Units.  He was ontime, professional and most importantly honest.  We have older units (15 years) and he quickly identified a problem that he was able to resolve inexpensively and to our satisfaction and the unit works alot better now.\n\nIt was pleasure working with Penguin Air and calling on them for our future HVAC needs in the future is a no brainer.
