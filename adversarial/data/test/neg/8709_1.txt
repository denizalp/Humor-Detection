Just wow! Great menu with a lot of very shareable plates clearly for people who want to have unusual focused dishes not a meat and sides place but there's still things to appeal to most. Take a picture of the menu if your not seated near by. Wine list is fabulous. Beautiful desserts (but huge) loved the fois parfait. Veal Tartare was well prepared.  Fois breakfast sandwich was yummy. Get the potato wedges.
