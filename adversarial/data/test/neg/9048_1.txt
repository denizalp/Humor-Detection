I live in Iowa and have owned a property in Queen Creek, AZ for 6 years and have had the property under management of Revelation Rentals.  They have done a superb job for us.  I haven't had to worry about a thing.  They have been very timely in everything that they have been responsible for (Leasing, repairs, HOA notices etc.).  As a property owner I would highly recommend Revelation Rentals.
