No stars\nVery disappointed, food got us sick and to no avail owner felt it wasn't his food. Well it was the only food we ate. We ended up vomiting and spending a great deal of time in the bathroom with bad cramping and diarrhea. Still not feeling well yet and ended up going to Doctor and getting antibiotic. Patrons beware as one of the other patrons was told don't eat the leftovers From a staff member, a bit concerning. I wish I would of read there review. New management is just not doing it.\nNo compassion and understanding by owner. Felt customer wrong. Did say sorry but can't do anything.\nBad PR\nSick and disappointed of how to handle your business\nI give you 0 stars
