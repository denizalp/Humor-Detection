I had lunch here three times and the taste is good.\n\nThe only issue is about service.\n\nI have never experienced of no show of the server to the end. \n\nCan you believe this?  Due to busy time? Not at all. \n\nPlease make a manual for employees and make them memorize it fully.\n\nTaste can't make a big difference more and more so the quality of the service would be the factor between the good and the bad or the ugly .\n\nI hope a manger or owner will read my review  very seriously.
