I found this place kind of stuffy not very cheerful. I felt the staff sized us up because we didn't appear as the other customers. In any case, my son works in Ohio city and I guess he had been there for a happy hour and swore by the food. I thought food was overpriced and drinks not as great as other places. I do like the patio.
