Just ok. This place isn't bad just not great. I ordered rolled eggplant which was pretty good as was the sauce but there wasnt enough of it and had to ask for more. The menu said it came with the starch of the day and vegetable of the day. So I got eggplant with tomato sauce and...mashed potatoes? Really? who does that? When I inquired about it I was told we are a NORTHERN Italian rsetaurant...condescending ( and, yeah, I've been to Northern Italy and know the difference). I was then told they were \"Parmesan Whipped Potatoes\" ...I tasted them.... pretty much mashed potato witout a hint of parmesan.  I was told I could get a side of spaghetti for $3. It can't cost more than 50 cents to make that.....almost $20 for that meal is not a good value. To be fair my wife had a salmon dish that was more generous and very good.
