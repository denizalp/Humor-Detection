This can't be a typical experience, but I think my visit here set a record for most efficient license renewal ever.  I walked in and there was an employee standing by a screen; as I walked up (no line) I told him what I was there for and answered a question or two; he pushed some buttons on the screen and it printed a queue ticket.  He didn't even have time to hand it to me before the number was called.  He gave me the ticket and I went over to the right place, showed my papers (including a current PA license) and answered some questions (mostly displayed on a screen, answered by a num pad), did the signatures, had my photo taken, and walked out with a new license less than five minutes after I had entered.  I had ZERO waiting which was totally unexpected.  Employees I interacted with seemed very professional and generally kind.  They beat expectations by a long mile; now it's just a challenge of consistency.
