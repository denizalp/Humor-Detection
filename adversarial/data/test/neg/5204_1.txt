Place is a little cramped but food is pretty good. I ordered the house special sandwich and it was really filling and the peanut butter sauce went really well with the sandwich. Also ordered hot milk tea but it was really mediocre. Was expecting \"teh tarik\" that you find in Malaysia. However, I would definitely visit this place again to try the different dishes.\n\nEDIT:\n\nVisited this place again and tried the laksa and tasted the bak kut teh. Very authentic and delicious. This is a great spot for brunch.
