Food is good, if not evenly done. Each time is an experiment in inconsistent portions, techniques and in getting your order right. Prices are fair. Today, however, loud rap music with vulgar lyrics with the F-word be shouted out over and over while there were children about. I don't care for profanities being shouted from the speakers while I eat. I really like the food, but I find the aptitude of the staff leaves a lot to be desired and may try once more before I see if things improve before giving up permanently.
