This is one of the best Greek restaurants in Toronto.  It is a little out of the way and not much to look at but the food is amazing, portions are generous and the staff are attentive.  The parking can be tricky but worth the walk from available free street parking, unlike the Danforth.  A must try is the spicy red pepper dip and delicious saganaki.
