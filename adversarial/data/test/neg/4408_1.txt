I have only been here once to get a dozen bagels but I only had to go once to know that these bagels are yummy as well as their homemade cream cheeses.  I got lox and raisin walnut the day I went it but they have a good variety of cream cheese to choose from.  I will definitely be back to try more bagels, as well as their bagel sandwiches.
