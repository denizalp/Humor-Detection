We ordered a Tiramisu cake for a Birthday and it was a hit!  The decoration on the cake was elegant and it was very enjoyable. It tasted very fresh and it had the right amount of cream and liquor. Everyone in the party enjoyed it and asked where it was from. We will be sure to try more cakes and pastries from Francesca.
