Legit, affordable, authentic Chinese joint in Vegas. Great for rice dishes w\/ bbq and hot noodles\/ noodle soups after the club. I get real nostalgic for these dishes because it's the stuff I ate growing up! Real Chinese food AND it's the best hangover prevention! I had the wonton noodle soup, and it piping hot and delicious. My friend let me try some of her sliced rice cakes, and they were PERFECT. Would definitely be back. Highly recommend.
