So good! Walking up and seeing the old style feel was awesome. Especially seeing all the kitties playing outside. I tried to pet a couple but they were not having it. \n\nI had the Duke Burger and Mike had the Western Burger. Both were cooked to perfection! The thick steak fries were perfectly crispy. \n\nAll of the staff, especially Anatoly, was extremely friendly and I was even given an iced tea to go due to it being hot outside. Lunch menu was very reasonably priced, it was cheaper than our BWW dinner last night. Since we came for lunch we will definitely be returning for dinner!
