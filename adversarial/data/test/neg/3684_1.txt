We don't eat red meat, but the chicken quesadilla and the wings were good. Not very spicy, though. Go during happy hour for $4 blackberry sangria at the bar. They were awesome! There was a misunderstanding with the pricing of an item and our bartenders (Kristen and Wendy) had the manager take care of it right away and didn't even make us feel uncomfortable about it. I'm pretty sure we misunderstood them... Never the less, great customer service!
