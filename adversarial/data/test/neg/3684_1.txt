The bar tender Stephanie was amazing with making a meal recommendation (fish tacos) and was by far the best food item I've had on the menu. The vibe is great and the staff was super friendly. The Outside patio is a gem in the summer time, overlooking the beautiful lake with our impeccable skyline on the horizon.
