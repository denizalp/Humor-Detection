Good buffet option but also a surprisingly good value!\n\nWent during weekday lunch for 22.99\/person and was very pleased. Although the selection was poor in certain aspects (for sushi there were only california rolls and one spicy tuna roll), I was very happy with the overall quality consistency of choices. The heavier meat cuts including the St Louis pork ribs, brisket, and flank steak were all very solid. Even the Asian foods (from the perspective of this Asian) were very tasty. Interestingly, many breakfast foods were still available well into lunch hours, including an omelette station if that's your thing. Finally, it looks like they put out the full desserts repertoire for lunch, which includes awesome sugar-free options that are just as tasty as their guiltier counterparts.\n\nIf you are looking for a Vegas buffet that will make you happy without breaking the bank, the buffet at bellagio is a great option!
