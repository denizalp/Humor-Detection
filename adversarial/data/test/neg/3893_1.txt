Great, lots of locally sourced ingredients, full menu available late at night, quirky\/vegan\/veg\/foodie options, nice atmosphere. With the exception of the Friday night DJ who was super excited to bring reggae culture to the forefront and who played Shaggy for an 8th grade flashback, this place is a must visit. Fair warning, and I did know ahead of time, but just to pass it on, they don't take cards, so bring cash.
