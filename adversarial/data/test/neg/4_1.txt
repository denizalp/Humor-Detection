Don't go to any of the franchised breakfast places and come here instead. Your stomach, wallet and community with thank you! This small restaurant is located in the inner corner of a strip mall that looks very abandoned on early mornings. This will be the busiest little corner.\n\nI got here on a Saturday morning at 930 and grabbed one of the last open tables. And from that moment on, there was a steady line of waiting patrons for breakfast. The staff is friendly but efficient, the food is great and I love the family-run vibe that is harder to come-by these days. The prices are decent for what you get, and they deliver on the usual breakfast choices without any issues. Will remember this place for breakfast in the future!
