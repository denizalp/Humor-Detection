I refuse to shop at this Circle K. The floors are full of trash and sticky from spilled beverages. The counters are also sticky and a mess daily. The fountain pop rarely taste as it should either the mixture or carbonation is consistently off. The outside is just as bad with trash and debris all over the lot. \n\nAlso, the clerks are less than professional. I have heard one female call guys sweetie over and over and then gives them their fountain drink for free. I will drive out of my way to do business elsewhere.
