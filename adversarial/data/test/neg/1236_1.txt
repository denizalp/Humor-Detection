Canada Computers has the best prices in town on anything to do with Computers. Recently purchased an Andriod device from them that was broken. Device had obviously been repackaged but they were very helpful in replacing it. Would suggest a slightly easier process to replace the device.\nI found the staff extremely helpful and courteous, while I usually go to them for the price, I find that the staff willingness to help is something that is very rare in discount computer store. I should be clear I am talking about the Brampton Computers Store, my expereinces in there other stores has not been nearly as pleasant.
