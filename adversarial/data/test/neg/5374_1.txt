Went here last night for dinner with my friend and everything was alright.\n\nI ordered shrimp tacos (which were good), French onion soup and tornado potatoes.\n\nMy potatoes were a bit too over done as you can see in the picture.\n\nWe pretty much saw our server when we first came in, ordered our drinks and when we paid our bill.\n\nThe other servers were the ones bringing out our food and brought us water in case we asked for it later.  Our server didn't come to ask if everything was ok after we got our food.  When we were done, another server had to ask if our server came out and had to go get her for us to pay.\n\n\n\nOverall, food was good but service could have been more attentive from our actual server.
