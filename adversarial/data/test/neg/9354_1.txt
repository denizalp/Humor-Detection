Very bad experience on 7-30-2014.  Took two interns for lunch at the Cafe Fiesta.  It was Senior Wednesday.  One third of tables occupied-30 minute wait.  Told it was the kitchen staff.  Computer system down and cannot use points-cash only.  Online menu many more items than sit down menu.  $28.00 for meal-no senior discount with points.  Was told that is the way it is and I wasn't the only one affected.  Last visit for me.
