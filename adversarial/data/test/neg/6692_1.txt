My favorite chicken place.  A buck or two more than your supermarket chickens but it includes sauce and is cut up and ready to eat.  Tastes better too. Breast is not dry like other places and the wings are usually not burnt.  Piri piri sauce is a hit or miss. Sometimes you get the pepper at the bottom and other times it's all oil.
