The one server was friendly and attentive.  Two stars for her.  The food, however, was not impressive at all.  The Texas bacon sandwich, hashbrowns w\/piece of melted American cheese was not good.   Being called The Waffle House, we ordered a waffle ... it was soft and cool in temperature!   And my husband and I were 2 of the only 6 patrons in there!   Go to IHOP or any other breakfast restaurant!
