someone had the arguement that this location is better then \"insert toronto franchised pizza joint here\" and i am on the fence over that comment. \nthis one off location does pizza and does them with pretty decent pricing, the service is great and quick, my only issue is the flavor, its very bland, like extremely bland. \nthe wings are pretty stellar. \nbonus points is that they have specials from time to time and i believe discounts on orders above a certain amount in dollar value. \nnot 100% sure if they deliver. \npersonally i've been spoiled with better, but from a price point perspective, its a meal at a good price. \na huge parking lot is a plus as well to this location, although steeles is a nightmare to get in and out of.\njust my two penny's
