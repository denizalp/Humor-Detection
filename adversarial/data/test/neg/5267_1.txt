Visited here for breakfast!  Ordered the egg, cheese and bacon sandwich served on an everything roll.  If you like smoked bacon, you will love this sandwich!  The only thing I would ask for different the next time is to toast the roll.  Heavy smoked aroma and flavor.  Atmosphere is small and inviting.  Order at the counter and they bring it to you.  Worth a visit!  I will come back for lunch and dinner!
