I had the clam chowder here and I can only compare it with the claim chowder I've had at Sea Harvest Fish Market in Monterey. This clam chowder was loaded with many seasonings and spices, a bit too much for such a wide, white bowl. I prefer a less complicated approach not peppered over with so many extras in a bread bowl please to fill me up. That's the only way to serve clam chowder.  Forget the fluff & aim for great taste like seaside restaurants across the world.
