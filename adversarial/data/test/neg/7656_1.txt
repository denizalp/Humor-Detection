This place is less than a week old so patience is helpful but the wait is worth it. Being a recently transplanted So Ca resident, I was disappointed Vegas Valley lacked the burger fast food places that also have Mexican food, big breakfast burritos, breakfast, dinners and salads. And Chili Cheese Fries! Giving four stars as the food was worth the wait and the learning curve a new place needs to overcome I.e items not available yet, so help wanted sign in the window should help improve the service.
