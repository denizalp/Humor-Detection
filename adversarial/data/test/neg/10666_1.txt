Great burger and fries. I tried the macaroni and cheeseburger and it was perfect. HUGE. Too big to eat it all. Loved the mixed types of fries and love how they serve them with the burger. Great atmosphere. Second time we went had to wait forever and when we finally got seated (got passed up several times) they switched to a different menu which didn't have what we wanted so we left. Worth a visit. I'll be back but earlier in the evening for sure. Limited menu not great.
