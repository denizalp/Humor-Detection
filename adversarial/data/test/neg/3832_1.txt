Three letters, three words\nAdults Night Out \nNo children allowed, no one under 18 years old. Started back in 2012 and was a great success. \nEvery first Friday it's free that's right free to the public. No children no school field trips only adults roaming and running around. When you walk in you are greeted by a couple of workers who point you the front admissions. After entrance is the cash only bar, so make sure you have cash available if not there is a ATM right by the bathrooms. \nIt was so much fun to explore the science center with not much of a crowd but yet a decent crowd. Everyone looked like they were having a great time relaxing & enjoying being a kid at heart. Definitely recommend going! It's a must experience for adults. A chance to be a kid with no kids around
