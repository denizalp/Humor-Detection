I could personally say, this place is one of my comfort zones when I'm in Vegas. Nice view and people are generally nicer compared to other establishments. Its considered a bar so you probably wont see that much dancing like Tao, Tryst etc. but don't get me wrong, there is a good amount of space to get your groove on. So put this on your list on your next trip to Vegas.
