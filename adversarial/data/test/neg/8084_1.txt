I went in to have my GF's pomeranian's teeth looked at as they were smelly and all jacked up. We pretty much wanted to know how much it would cost just to have them all pulled as we felt they were affecting his breathing too. Their quoted price was way more than other places. So we ended up not going with them. They were nice and the initial exam was free, so that was good.
