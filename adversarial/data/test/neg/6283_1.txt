I was a little thrown off when I walked in and saw this place had a line to order at the counter and then take your food to your table, but you know it's really good food.  Every staff member I came in contact with was happy, helpful and seemed to enjoy their job.  Here's a good tip: sit at the bar and you can order there without standing in lines.  See if Omar is working - he's awesome!!
