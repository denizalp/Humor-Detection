This review is super late, but I must share my experience with Jane. First off, before I saw her, my skin was in bad shape. For someone who's never had any skin problems through her early 20s, I was desperate for help. For 3 years, I struggled with cystic acne, horrible scarring, and OVERLY oily skin.  \nHundred of dollars spent on every kind of wannabe skin \"miracle\" (AKA: toxic poisons in the form of Proactiv, Acne Free, Clinique, etc.) I was even prescribed pills and I had no changes but the breakouts increased. Itching skin, when one pimple would pop, one would grow right next to it and stay for weeks....bad! \n\nBy the time I got to my appointment with Jane, I was basically defeated and she felt my energy. The very first day she educated me on MY skin and how it all works. Then she developed essentially a \"12-step\" plan of attack for me to get results. Exactly 2 weeks after my first facial with her, my skin was CLEAR. I repeat CLEAR!!! Just remember, Jane's plan of change in your skin isn't just the products she uses or recommends, she takes a holistic approach to the internal care of your whole body. She nurtures your spirit with her positivity, gives tips on what changes to make in your home to remove toxins and tells you what foods to avoid and which to add to nurture your body! Who does that? Certainly not the \"reputable dermatologists\" I saw. Jane is an integral part of my progress, and she's been a total blessing to me!\n\nAgain, if you decide to surrender your bad skin to Jane, be sure to follow what she says to a T.\nTreat it just like a 12-step program. Listen when she says to throw away the toxic products you normally use at home, take your vitamins, drink your water, etc. You will see change! Inside as well as out.
