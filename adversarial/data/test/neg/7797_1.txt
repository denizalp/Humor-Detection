How does this place not have a full five stars on their rating?!\n\nYes, it's a bit spendy, but as someone who likes to relax and spend a little more time in the room than the average Vegas tourist, it doesn't get any better. I haven't stayed here in quite some time, the last visit was a couple of years ago (though I've stayed here about 3 times), but every penny spent was worth it. I always request a room with a king bed and strip view, but if you don't care about that then the rooms are a little less pricey. All the rooms are suites and feel like mini-apartments. No joke, if it was an option, I'd live here. I loved that while waiting for friends at another hotel to meet me I could relax on a sofa with a beautiful view and watch TV, rather than attempt to be comfortable on a bed for a few hours. The bathrooms are large and luxurious, I always looked forward to watching TV while I relaxed in the tub or showered (yup, TV's in the bathrooms!). Never had room service here so I can't rate that. It's great having everything in one spot with the shopping and restaurants. When I went once with my mother we wanted to see Blue Man Group and Jersey Boys. She can't do much walking around and isn't a fan of Vegas, so it was beyond convenient that both shows were within the building (Jersey Boys was in Palazzo but it's all connected, we didn't have to leave). If I wanted to go do stuff on the strip she was more than entertained in the main grand canal area where they have real human \"statues\". If I were a gambler, the casino is very nice. Staff is VERY friendly. No buffet here so if that's important to you it may be a problem. Another thing I loved is it's mostly an adult environment. I'd see a few teens here and there, didn't really see any small children and that is HUGE for me, because at the risk of sounding like a horrible person, I'm not a fan of kids and when I go to Vegas I don't want to deal with your screaming toddler while I'm doing anything (lol). The rooms are also beyond quiet, if I ever would have had neighbors I never would have known it. I could go on and on and on about how in love with this place I am but I think you get the point...\n\nI can't say enough good things, I really can't. Once you stay here, it's very hard to stay anywhere else (since my visits here I have stayed at Paris, and it doesn't compare anywhere near this). Trust me, save your pennies and do it, at least once.
