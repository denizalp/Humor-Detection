Best ice cream flavors in the area. The flavors lean towards Hispanic favorites and trends. There are at least 30 in the case. I highly recommend the pine nut, has a delicate sweet taste with a light pink hue and pine nuts dotted throughout. They also have agua frescas, about 10, and of course the horchata is AMAZING!!! After speaking with the owner, she alerted me that they will also have street food. yay!!
