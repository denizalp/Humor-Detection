I love Chipotle, I use to work for Chipotle, and after the recent E. coli issue I still ate there eating a bowl every week. It's because of this I say there is nothing that makes my trip to this Chipotle worse than stale chips. It's for this they will only get a two-star review. This is not a once in a while issue... this is an every single time I visit this location issue.
