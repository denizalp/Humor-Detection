Picked this place from a combination of Yelp and DD& D while visiting Phoenix. Read a couple of bad reviews and so was a little hesitant but decided to give it a go. Am really glad I did! My colleague and I ordered the Italian Stallion and the  Dolce Diavolo (DV on a recommendation from the waitstaff.)  While the Stallion was really good, the DV was fantastic.  Service was great even though the place was very crowded. I normally pass on dessert, but on a whim I asked what they had. When told that they had cheesecake and that it was homemade I went for that. The cheesecake was a perfect ending to the meal. Very smooth, very creamy, and absolutely delicious.
