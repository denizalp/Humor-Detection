My girlfriend and I were just looking for a place to eat after our first restaurant choice wasn't available. We walked by Cleo and checked out the menu. I can't say anything blew me away and I'm not much of a foodie, but we decided to try it. It's Mediterranean and tapas style so we ordered 4 or 5 different items. \nTo say I was blown away is an understatement. The service was amazing.. The food was beyond amazing, with some items smelling better than anything I've ever sniffed. \nI'm a local in LV and am so happy we found this spot. Will I be back? Oh ya!
