So happy to see Viva Mercado's open again.  Love the new location.  The food was great as we expected.  The salsa is my favorite in town, just the right amount of spice and not too chunky.  I'm a big fan of the bean and cheese burrito enchilada style (of course).  I also like the cheese enchiladas and beef tacos (crispy).\n\nIt was great to see some familiar faces working there and the staff was fast and friendly.  Can't wait to go back again.
