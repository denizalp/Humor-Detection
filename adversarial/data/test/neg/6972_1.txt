Although I went on a Weds. Night for the half off sushi I ended up with a shrimp hibachi meal that I could not even finish! Overall the food was very good and I had plenty of left overs to eat the next day . Our cook was really nice and did all of the normal tricks and what not. I did expect a bigger restaurant when I walked in but I guess it's a good amount of space! It seemed like they had maybe 4 or 5 hibachi tables and then other normal dining room tables for non-hibachi patrons. The table behind us seemed to have an issue with their cook but it looked like the manager took care of that quickly. Overall I would come back it's a decent priced hibachi meal with quick service. The parking in front of the restaurant seems a bit tight not sure if there was more in the back but I can only imagine what it's like on a fri sat night!
