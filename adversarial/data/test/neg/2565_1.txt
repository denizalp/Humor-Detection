I heard good things about tacos chiwas, being on the Food Network and all. When I arrived the lady taking my order had an attitude the trash was overfilling and they told me there was no guacamole left in the salsa bar. I sat down and received my tacos and my \"famous bean soup\". The tacos weren't bad and the soup is pretty good however I was surrounded by fruit flies everywhere while trying to enjoy my meal. I don't want to imagine what the kitchen looked like.
