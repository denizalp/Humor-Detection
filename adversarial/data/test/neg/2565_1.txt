The people at the credit union are fine and everybody treats you as you should be treated but as far as being up-to-date technologically they are far, far behind. Every time I try to deposit a check online it results in some sort of error or multiple attempts before it goes through. You can't connect to simple online resources like PayPal or mint or even have your rent check automatically withdrawn. There are definitely much better resources out there than Dane County credit union. UW Credit Union here I come.
