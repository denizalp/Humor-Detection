I'm not sure why so many bad reviews. We just went here randomly on our way home and we almost didn't stop because of all the bad yelp reviews but I'm glad we did!  We both ordered breakfast burritos which, by the way, breakfast was no longer being served (stops at 10:30 and we got there after 11) but they were still willing to accommodate our request and make the breakfast burritos. They were delicious!  They even crispier my friend's bacon as a special request and she was super pleased (she made me add that to my review).  I was also nervous that the prices would be bad as others here have mentioned but they were very reasonable. 2 burritos and a drink was around $12. \n\nAnyway the experience greatly exceeded my expectations set forth from the other reviews!  Give this place a chance!  Good, friendly staff.
