Just finished at Ciao wine bar and I must say I am extremely disappointed in the service. It was mine and my boyfriends anniversary and she did not even greet us. The food was fantastic but it was sad when she did not even thank us for coming. I am very disappointed as tonight was supposed to be special and we were ignored and treated like trash. I will probably never go back. When a server  is rude it puts a bad taste in your mouth
