Taj Mahal exceeded our expectations! We are from out of town and brought our son to ASU. My husband and I have recently come to love Indian cuisine. I'm not one to write a review but we were so impressed we had dinner here twice in 3 days. \nFreddie our waiter was extremely attentive. We especially loved the chicken tikka masala and saag paneer. The Naan was hot and the best we've had! \nIf this restaurant isn't busy when you go don't let it deter you. It's just a seasonal thing according to the owner.
