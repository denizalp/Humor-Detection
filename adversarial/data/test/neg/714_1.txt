It's (obviously) not the best pizza in the Valley, but it just may be the best bang for your buck. My wife and I cruise over probably every two weeks when we don't want to cook or spend a lot of money. For $5, their regular cheese or pepperoni pizza hits the spot. Fast, simple, cheap, and pretty darn good. Very underrated in my opinion!
