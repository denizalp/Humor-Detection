Mostly sours.. lemonade stand -sour- it's delicious, so good, the lemon gives it a kick.\nSpadina monkey -cherry sour- has a tart flavor.. hmmm amazing.\nMacaroni and cheese with mushroom was perfect, the bread, soft but crunchy at the same time was yummy. Magic mushroom Pizza was great, that crust!!!
