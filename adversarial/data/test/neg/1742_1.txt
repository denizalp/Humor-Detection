melt is my favorite ice cream spot ever. the people whom work here are very friendly. the flavors are very unique. if you use your credit\/debit card you get points toward a free ice cream. the presentation of the ice cream is very unique the serve it to you in a chinese food togo box it's very different and fun if your in phoenix and want something different try melt.
