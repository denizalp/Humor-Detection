While in town for a mother\/daughter weekend, my 21 year old and her friend were really excited to have dinner at Grotto, in the Golden Nugget hotel.  They had found it online and were very much looking forward to eating at a restaurant with an aquarium.  Upon arrival, they were so disappointed to find that the restaurant had just a distant view of a very small aquarium in the pool area.  It was nothing like they had expected.  For our meal, we ordered 2 Grotto salads to start (very basic chopped lettuce & tomatoes with a vinaigrette), a margherita pizza (just ok), a bowl of soup (very bland), a chopped salad with chicken & the half rotisserie chicken with roasted potatoes & sauteed spinach (the chicken was very dry and I only ended up eating a few bites of it).  We declined dessert, though those looked really good.  All in all, the meal was very mediocre and we woud not eat there again.
