Beef Brisket Curry w\/ Roti--- simply delicious, though I've had better roti in a hole-in-wall resto in scarborough, it's still really good and the curry is perfect for me. Not too spicy, just enough coconut milk, nice and creamy.\n\nThey also do party trays, as they catered our wedding rehearsal dinner. Cheap and delicious.
