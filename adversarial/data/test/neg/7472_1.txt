I was SO excited when I saw that one of my all-time favorite comedians, Wyatt Cenac, would be at the Comedy Zone!! I ended up going alone since my friend bailed but I had a great time anyway. They walls show upcoming acts and I'll definitely be back to see some of my other faves who are coming into town. \n\nThe opener was hysterical and Wyatt was as amazing as I'd dreamed he would be. \nThe best art is that I was at a front table for less than $30. Great ticket prices combined with the talented comedians they bring in combined have me excited to see another show. The staff was friendly enough, and the food service was quick. Apparently you can't just order water here... I tried and was offered bottled water, Coke products or tea which was confusing.  On the downside, the food was absolutely awful and the Blue Moon I ordered was so warm I thought someone may have actually heated it. I had the buffalo shrimp; the sauce was very salty and just not good, while the shrimp were smaller than those mini salad shrimp. Not cool. The French fries were average, nothing to write home about and certainly not worth the $13 I paid. I will definitely skip the food next time and eat before the show. \n\nI also love that you can meet and greet with the performers afterwards. I got to talk to both Wyatt and the opener and get a picture with Wyatt! Score!\n\n\nOverall, awesome venue and location, great acts, but do yourself a favor and eat before you come in.
