Nothing like the johnny rockets out west, literally no selection maybe 15 items on the menu. $5 for a milk shake no malts only 4 to choose from comes in a Styrofoam cup worse than any other place like dairy queen or steak & shake. Was also $5 for cheese fries there are no combos it was $24 for a meal everything tasted great just felt like a low quality fast good joint but with a hefty price tag for it. Literally got 1 single patty burger 1 shake no drink and 1 fry.
