Delicious!!!!  You can pick your fish\/seafood fresh from the display of fish flown in daily. Mediterranean salad is so simple yet with the fresh produce was delicious. We had our fish salt crusted and it was the best fish I've had in ages. Tender, flaky, fresh. The waiter brought the fish encased in salt to our table side and proceeded to break through the salt and deboned and served the fish to us directly. Makes my mouth water just writing this!  We have eaten here many times and have never been disappointed. And you have to get the yogurt and honey for desert. Not too sweet or tart but the perfect way to end your meal.
