The airline deserves negative stars.  It could be called the Greyhound Bus of the air.  Highlights include - a check in system that assigns the worst seats to those who check in first - slovenly flight attendants (I not judging their beauty it is their grooming and personality - dirty hair and rude, very rude) and seats so close even short people can't fit.  If this airline is the only option, take the bus.  You would have a better experience.
