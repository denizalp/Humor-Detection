Utopia is delicious and perfect for those who eat meat and who won't and especially for when those two types of people want to dine together with no compromises! \n\nThe food is cheap and the beer and wine list is decent. The service is also pretty great as the place is fairly small so there aren't many tables to worry about, but that's also the downside since the place is small, you need to show up early or wait a while for seating because they don't take reservations.
