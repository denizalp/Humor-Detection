Have gone to a number of hotel spas on the strip and decided to try A Touch of Las Vegas today before flying out.  I had an amazing 80 minute peppermint deep tissue with Korinna.  Truly one of the best massages I have ever had!!  She was personal, professional and had fantastic technique.  I then had a signature facial with Norma and my skin feels wonderful!!  She gave me a number of great skin care at home tips too! I highly recommend  A Touch of Las Vegas and will definitely be back!!!
