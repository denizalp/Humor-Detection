I'm sorry to report that Jeremy L. was right.  I used to eat here or order takeout maybe once every couple months, over a period of a few years.  Consistently excellent flavor, generous portions, and quality ingredients.  My favorite was the garlic lover chicken, served in a rich brown garlic sauce over spinach.  They don't have it anymore.  My husband liked the cashew chicken, which always had plenty of meat and a variety of vegetables.  We always ordered the Tom Kha Gai soup.\n\nToday's experience:  Soup was just ok, not as flavorful and didn't have the deep red color we've come to expect.  Cashew chicken was very bland, and was mostly green peppers, carrots, and onion, very little chicken.  I ordered the red curry chicken instead of the garlic lover.  It was ok, but not as good as I've had in the past.  It's a lot more disappointing when you know you should expect better.\n\nI'm sad and disappointed that we'll have to find a new Thai place near our home.  We won't be ordering from Swan Thai again.
