The staff was very friendly and the food was great! I did not have to wait at all to get seated, and I was with a group of 4 people. \n\nWe were seated next to the window, which is great for people watching because who doesn't like to do that especially on the strip!?\n\nI enjoyed my chicken fajitas and the margarita slush was really good. I ordered two and got a slight buzz from it. The atmosphere was awesome, and so was the music!
