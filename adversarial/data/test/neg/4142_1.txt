Stayed there Wednesday evening, prior to flight departure early AM Thursday. I've been a Hilton Honors member for 10 years now and have been Diamond VIP status for some time. Do it's fair to say that I've had my share of hotel stays with the Hilton chain. My loyalty to them is directly related to the standard of service and hospitality that they consistently provide. However I am leaving this feedback as mine and my colleagues experience at check in was shameful. The smug helper at the front desk was arrogant, argumentative and demeaning. His manager was from the same mold. The manager finally checked us in but not without yelling and name calling. Once in my room I made a call to Hilton Honors to let them know about the brand imaging taking place at this hotel, whilst doing so the phone in my room continued to ring and ring. I finally picked up and yes, it was the manager with an apology       I do hope that this was an isolated case as I've been a happy HH member for years and have never once come close to experiencing anything so derogatory during those years.  Watch out for the smug one at check in.
