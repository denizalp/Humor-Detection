My parents took me here for my birthday. I was pretty impressed by their menu as they had an array of different ethnic foods, which I was pretty excited about. However, the food was pretty mediocre and not worth the 30$ you would pay for an AYCE dinner. I would have much rather spent that money at a Brazilian steakhouse or a more expensive Japanese AYCE restaurant.\n\nThe waitresses there were pretty rude and spoke to us in a condescending tone. My mom wanted to order the lamb chop when she first took our order because it would take a while to cook. But she insisted we only start with the appetizers and soups first. We were not pleased as we are the paying patrons and should get the say, it was not my mom's first time there either. \n\nWe ordered 4 plates of escargot, which were pretty good. Some salads, and italian pasta. The lamb chops we had asked for medium rare, but they came out medium, and tasteless. We also had some sashimi ... I've had fresher tasting sashimi at AYCE restaurant, this was definitely below par. \n\nWe went on a Monday night, it was pretty empty, less than a quarter of the restaurant was occupied by guests. \n\nMy family will probably not return after this experience.
