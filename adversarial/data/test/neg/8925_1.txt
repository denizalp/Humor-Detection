The cool thing about this place is that they make their own specialty meats.\n\nI tried the Reuben and the Beef and Cheddar Melt. The Reuben was my favorite. They shave the meat right in front of you and it tastes better than any regular sandwich. \n\nThe Beef and Cheddar Melt was good too. The part I liked on this one was the bread. It is a soft bread with garlic and tomatoes in it.\n\nThe sandwiches are expensive but they will fill you up. I could only eat half of mine, and I saved the rest for later.
