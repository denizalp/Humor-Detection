I called yesterday for an appointment today.  Quickly had it scheduled (for a specific time and not just a vague period of time), and I was called twice just prior to the Tech's arrival on time today-once by Gene from the office and again by Louis when he was on his way.\n\nLouis was wonderful (and I'm not the most easy to please).  He was professional, friendly, and very thorough.  My clog was quickly cleared, but he went the extra mile to explore all possible causes.  He confirmed that I could us e the Yelp deal (which I did), so from the service to the price, all was great.  Very pleased.
