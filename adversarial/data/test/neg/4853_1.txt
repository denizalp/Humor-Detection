I have been a long time customer at Roys, and I get their coupons through email, and wanted to use the $30 off coupon.I have always liked everything about this restaurant -- the ambiance, service, food.  I hadn't been there in a couple years, so I figured since I had a coupon, I'd go. We had a nice booth with a great view of the outside, which I requested through their website. First, we ordered the Maui Wowie Salad.  Hmmm. It was really disappointing. It had shredded romaine\/iceberg lettuce, a couple tomato cubes, and three tiny pieces of shrimp on top, and the salad dressing was flavorless.  My first thought was that this salad doesn't even look as good as the side salad you get at Red Robin. All three of us ordered the Butterfish because it had always been scrumptious.  We got the skimpiest pieces of fish -- it was like four bites.  The fish was really mushy because there was too much sauce on it.  Oh, the worst part of the meal was that rice. It was not fresh!  It seems like its made ahead of time and left out; it was dry and crunchy!  For dessert, we ordered coffee (the coffee was really good, though) and split the lava cake three ways. It wasn't as good as I remember.  It tasted.....burnt?  I can't put my finger on it, but the food tasted like typical \"food service\" hotel food. Just mediocre.  Oh well, at least I have memories that this place once served delicious food.
