I went in with a partially collapsed disk. Every other place recommended surgery. Dr. Fed recommended after diagnosis that I could use exercise and an inversion table and the pinched nerve that the disk was causing would recover. He also recommended a heel lift based on the MRI results After following his instructions, my back pain disappeared and I continue to fight in one of the most brutal sports on the planet.
