The food is nice., not a lot of choice, but it's fair. I often go there for lunch, as it's close to where I work, and it's almost always packed. \nWent there a few times in the evening hours with the Groupon.. and no matter when you go.... the service is SOOOOO bad. If only that would improve, the place would be one of the nice spots in Calgary.\nI've seen a lot of reviews mentioning that, and will never understand how the owner doesn't care.\nI also agree that the service is much worse when you go with a groupon.
