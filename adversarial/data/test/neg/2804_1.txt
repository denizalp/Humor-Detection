As always like their other locations this place is quick and delicious. The servers are always nice and bring out side dishes and tea quickly. Quality is always good and you can't go wrong for a great meal for under 10 dollars. Got the regular spicy dumpling and it was great with good portion size. Free refills on the side dishes as well!
