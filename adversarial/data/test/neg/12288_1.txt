Great! My boyfriend and I walked in and it seemed crowded. That wasn't the case once we ordered and found a seat. The menu was a bit overwhelming for the first time being there. I decided on the farmers market bene and I don't regret that decision. Coffee was excellent and was self serve. The only thing I found to be weird was that there were no napkins\/silverware on the counters. When the servers bring the food is when they napkins and silverware are given out. Besides that, everything went swimmingly.
