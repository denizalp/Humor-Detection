I've been going to Gossamer ever since I moved to Scottsdale almost two years ago.  Lauren and Selena are not only A+ hair stylists...but two of coolest people i've ever met.  It's always great getting a killer haircut and just having a good time at the salon.  I always recommend Gossamer to everyone when they ask who cuts my hair and always get good feed back after they go.  One stop to Gossamer and you will become a lifer, guaranteed!!
