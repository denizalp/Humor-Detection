Wow, am I the only person that didn't like this place?  This is probably the worst Mexican food I've ever had.  They didn't have any interesting meats (no lengua, no cabeza) and I'm used to paying a lot less for much better and fresher Mexican food.  I think Tacos Mexico is waaaay better-- the environment isn't as nice and makes some people uncomfortable, but the food's great.
