Yeah wait times suck sometimes but that's because Dr. Garcia takes time with her patients and I couldn't imagine taking my kids to anyone else. She has worked with us on my kids allergies, referred us to specialist when needed, and been awesome when our insurance was screwing up! If your going to walk in, plan to wait. Morning appointments are almost always quicker.
