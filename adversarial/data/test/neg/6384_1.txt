yum! the larger groupon here was worth it with our little party! \n\nambiance: 4 - The location is small and intimate. There is a long, rectangular table in the middle in which they either sit a huge party or several little parties. they sit many groups there because it's just so dang huge. \n\nservice: 5 - The servers were really attentive and funny. they refilled our drinks constantly, and our server was even kind enough to add up our bill along the way to make sure we didn't surpass our $80 groupon bill. \n\nThey were very personable and made jokes all the time! it just makes your day!! \n\nfood: 4 - the food was high quality and pretty cheap for a ton of dishes, but I have to give it a four because the taste was alright. Everything was cooked fresh and to order. \n\nI do have to give a special shoutout to the garlic chicken and hookipa roll! yum yum :)\n\ntapas is a really good way to not break your wallet and still be full. however, I can't tell you what we ordered because we got so many dishes. \n\nthe desserts are not that special; pass on them!
