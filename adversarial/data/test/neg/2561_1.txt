Color me impressed like the rest.  I'd been meaning to go to Salvatore's forever but just never made the pilgrimage.  Then my wife started reading me this terribly obnoxious review from the unconsidered section which was met with one of the best responses I've ever read from the owner of a restaurant.  That was enough for me, the mystery of this place had to be known.\n\nWent on a Friday night, small joint in a very relaxed neighborhood downtown and it was packed to the gills.  Fantastic cozy atmosphere, and a nice warm reprieve from Wisconsin's brutal cold.  There was a 45 minute wait and it was already 7:30, but the host said he could take our number and text us if we wanted to get drinks at the Public House next door (since their bar area was pretty full).  It was a nice gesture, so we followed his advice and got to try two places in one evening.  The Public House was a pretty comfortable coffee shop with good beer and a nice way to pass the time before our table was ready.\n\nAll said and done we finally put in our first order around 9:00 after getting a table, which at most other places would irk me a bit, but all was redeemed.  When our bacon and cheese bread appetizer came out, with Siracha dip, hoo baby.  Absolutely delicious.  \n\nBut then.  THE PIZZA.  I was extremely skeptical going to Salvatore's because I really don't know how you can separate yourself in the pizza world, but apparently you can.  Like others mentioned, local ingredients and an attention to detail are all the difference.  Both pies were unbelievable, divine morsels freshly prepared for your happy zone.  Where I thought I would leave hungry instead I left with a full to-go box and a half a beer, falling asleep dreaming of the next day where I would be able to eat the succulent leftovers.\n\nPrices are awesome for downtown, $13-15 for the 12\" pies and $23-25 for 16\".  We both felt that 2 people could easily just share a 16\", so don't let your eyes be bigger than your head unless you want those oh-so-sweet leftovers.  I had the Forza for my pizza and my wife had a sausage, pep, mushroom, both amazing.\n\nDon't be like me and wait an eternity to go here.  Quite possibly the best pizza in Madison
