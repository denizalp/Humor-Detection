I am a big victoria's secret fan. I've been to countless stores all over the country...this one is not my favorite. The service is fine, but since they are currently in a pop-up location by Barney's, the selection is extremely limited. I'm hoping that when the regular location by the food court re-opens I will be pleasently surprised. I'd love to see a larger VSX Sport collection available. I love their yoga pants, but they are becoming harder and harder to find!
