This is usually my go-to gas station.  Barring Costco it always has the cheapest prices in the area without exception.  The staff inside have always been friendly and helpful, and I'm usually in, out, and on my way in a breeze of efficiency.\n\nThe only issue with the establishment is that the parking and gas pump situation is pretty cramped.  There are only four pumps and since I drive a full size SUV, it can be hard to maneuver when it gets busy.  I always avoid during rush hour as a result.\n\nStill I highly recommend as they will always have the best priced gas, and for me, that will keep me coming back long into the future!
