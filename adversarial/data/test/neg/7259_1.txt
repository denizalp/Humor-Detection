My food was good, but my fiance's dinner was a different story. He ordered a simple dish of spaghetti and meatballs. He found a hair in the spaghetti, removed it and found multiple short, black hairs throughout the dish. It gave a new meaning to angel hair pasta   The waitress and manager were very apologetic and did the most they could to make things right. I do recommend they have a good tiramisu.
