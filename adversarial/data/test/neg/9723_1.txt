If you are staying at the LVH and need a quick bite or margarita, I would recommend stopping by for some quesadillas and a drink.  I did not have a full meal, so cannot comment on the rest of the menu.  It was a pleasant place to enjoy a drink, but you do have to listen to all Motley Cru music, as you might imagine.
