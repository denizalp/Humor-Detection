Good food. Everything made to expectation. There is a  language barrier when ordering your food. Sometimes you have to shout or spell out what you are ordering. This place has good customer service but can come off rude because of the language\/culture barrier. I am a regular here and always enjoyed everything that I have ordered. My go to is the assorted vegetables and rice. Sometimes paired up with a vegetable lo mein. Anytime your in the neighborhood and looking for traditional  oriental food this is a definite suggestion.
