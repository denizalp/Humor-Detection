I went to Jadon Foods to get a gluten free dairy free cake for a close friend.  I was so excited because I saw Jadon make gluten free cakes that actually looked very good.  I was a little worried because this was a very last minute.  I went in on a Friday and asked about making the Lemon Raspberry cake and to my surprise Jane (the owner) was able to make one for me.  She actually came in on Saturday morning (the day they were closed) just to accommodate me.  Jane went above and beyond to assist me, and on top of that, they cake was delicious.  My friend loved it.  Jane you have earned another client.  thank you so much.
