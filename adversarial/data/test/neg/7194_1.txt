In a perfect world, a virtual reality feels like the Matrix or Inception. You can drink beer, eat bacon, throw people, get thrown, and apply triangle chokes. But we don't live in that world yet. Zero Latency's \"Singularity\" is the best possible application of TODAY'S state-of-the-art VR technology. It can't prevent you from no-clipping through the game world's obstacles. But if you crouch behind cover, your in-game avatar will also be crouching behind said cover and presenting a smaller target area. Your real-world body\/gun are sync'd up very nicely to the game world and everything feels very immersive. \n\nAt first I thought this game would be too easy, in order to appeal to the general public. I was wrong about that. There is no losing condition, but you will feel adequately challenged. In our group of 6 (3 gamers, 3 non-gamers), there were moments where we felt overwhelmed. The # of total deaths ranged between 2 and 4; no one had 0 deaths. \n\nI also thought this game would have shallow combat, because it already had the VR factor going. I was wrong about that too. The environments and enemy types are diverse, with a couple levels really showcasing the power of VR. There are four different types of guns which each feel like they have their place, and you can even block with a shield. \n\nAlthough I was pleasantly surprised by how challenging the game was, I was equally surprised by how well it appeals to non-gamers. In our group the highest # of kills was 229 (yours truly) and the lowest was 77, which is still a good amount. That means everyone can make a substantial contribution and no one will feel useless. \n\nCons:\n-There is an annoying siren sound which sounds whenever you are close to someone, for safety reasons. It was sounding pretty much ALL THE TIME since the space you're fighting in is relatively constrained so you're ALWAYS close to someone. Maybe they should lower the distance threshold which triggers this sound. \n-There was a graphical glitch where everyone's legs were rapidly flopping back and forth the entire time. This did not affect game play but it made everyone look funny. \n-No glasses allowed within the headset. They have a visual zoom adjuster which I'm told goes between -3.0 and +3.0 diopters, but my prescription is -10. Since the screen is so close to the eyes, it's possible that this is enough for me, but I got contacts to wear just in case. \n\nTips: \n-The left and right buttons both cycle guns in the same direction. For example, if the guns are 1 2 3 4 and you are on gun #1, pressing right and the left will put you on gun #3. This made me very disoriented in the beginning of the game until I figured it out. \n-Beam gun seems to be the best choice for the end game. It also seems the best choice in general for large teams that aren't super coordinated since there's less overkill and no delay for switching targets.
