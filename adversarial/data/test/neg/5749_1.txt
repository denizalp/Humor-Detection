I use to live this place. The restaurant use to have two sections, a cheaper side and and more upscale expensive side. The food was great and you could usually get a decently priced meal on the less expensive side. Today is the first time I come back after their renovations and their prices appear to have increased by over 25%. They used to be, I believe, limit on the price for what they offered. Now they are just overpriced.
