A little slow going in. We waited until 7:30 to get in line and it was basically a free for all. Once inside it is very well laid out. Lots of escalators and stairs to get you where you need to go. Lots of great signage to point you in the right direction.  There are plenty of vendors of all kinds on every floor so no super long lines. \n\nRestrooms were clean and well attended and there were plenty of them.\n\nSeating in the arena is such that there is a really good view from any seat. In order to do that,  upper deck is pretty steeply laid out without a lot of room to get in and out of the rows. However no matter how tall the guy is in front of you, you are going to be able to see.\n\nAcoustics were great too. Which was a surprise in such a large venue.
