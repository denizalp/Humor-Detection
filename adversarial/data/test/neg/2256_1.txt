Lunch yesterday with my boss.\nHe chose this place.\nVery nice exterior, well maintained.\nInterior also very nice.\nThe boss had a fish sandwich with sweet potato fries. It looked better than anything I ever ate while living in FL. He said it was excellent. \nI had the chop salad, also excellent.\nOnly negative thing, they serve Pepsi not Coke.
