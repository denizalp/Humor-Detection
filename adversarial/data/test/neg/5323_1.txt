This place was amazing. When coming to Vegas my mom told us we had to visit yardbird. She was absolutely correct. The food was amazing!! My wife and I split chicken and waffle and brussels sprouts. Everything we ate was dynamite. The chicken was magical. The bourbon syrup was just to die for. The waffle was great. And the hot sauce was equally amazing!! the price was a little high, but if you split something its not bad and the amount of food you receive is easy to split. I will definitely remember this place forever!! And will definitely make a trip again!!
