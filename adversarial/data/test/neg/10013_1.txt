if you could stay at any hotel in las Vegas this hotel would not be on my list put it this way if I could give this place zero stars I would but unfortunately I HAD to give them at least one star in order to write this review. Hands down the worse hotel customer service EVER!!!! Especially when you hear all the staff talking shit about you right in front of you. Long story short they overcharged us 700 dollars didn't give us the correct room tried to make us take our own luggage up when we asked for help it took them 30 minutes to bring up four bags FOUR BAGS!!!! correction 2 bags we still had to go back down to the lobby to get the other two bags so in conclusion this place sucks ass!!!
