OK, so I go to Dirty Pretty, excited that there is actually a \"rock\" bar, especially in Scottsdale.  It seemed that most bars that I went to played the basic hip hop songs that me, personally, do not enjoy dancing to.  So, I walk into the bar, and I am pleasantly surprised by how the place looked...a little Gothic and rock...the staff dressed the part....but that is where the \"rock\" ended.  \n\nI was happy at first, because I ordered my drink, and the bartender thought that I ordered 2 of them, one for me and one for my friend.  I told him that he was mistaken, so he only charged me for the one, but I got to drink both. :)  Good times.  There were a lot more chicks at the bar, and I was really unimpressed how they dressed going to a bar like this....way too pretentious for a place like this (or how it was supposed to be portrayed)\nThe part that really really threw me off was the music...what the hell?  How am I supposed to dance to a mixed version of the Doobie Brothers???? Or CCR???  This is not rock!  Where was my Guns N' Roses, Disturbed...hell I will even take Nickelback!  But mixed?  Nuh uh....no way.  (and dancing was impossible anyway since the people on the supposed dance floor were just standing around chit chatting.)\n\nThe only reason why I am giving this place three stars is that my friend's brother actually owns part of the bar.  I am hoping! that they will get the idea on how a rock bar was supposed to be.  It was way to \"pretty\" to be a real rock bar.  Sorry folks.  But, I am available for consultations...if anybody is interested on how a real rock bar should be.
