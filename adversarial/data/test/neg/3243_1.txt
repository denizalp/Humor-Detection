I don't know if it's because my palate has grown or if I've just learned to appreciate the finer bowl of ramen... But whatever it is, Monta is my go to spot for ramen when I'm feeling happy, sad, celebratory, or whatever. I've been to a bunch of other ramen spots around town, and they still have the best quality and prices by far!
