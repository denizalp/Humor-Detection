Where did my super-efficient server go? Why are there weird pressboard walls separating me from the now ample staff so I can't make eye contact with them and get my miso already? \n\nThe sushi is still mediocre, but I can't really balance it out with fantastic service anymore. I miss you, fantastic server. At least they still have the inexplicable hieroglyph menus.
