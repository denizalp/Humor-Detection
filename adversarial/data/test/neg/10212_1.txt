I am super bummed to report that Brittingham Boats no longer serves grilled cheese!  4 stars because I'm so sad about this!\n\nOther than that, it still remains one of my favorite places to spend a sunny afternoon. On top of their fun rental options they have also been expanding their options for special events. From ice cream floats, to full moon paddle events, and stand up paddle board yoga workshops there is always something fun happening at Brittingham Boats. \n\nAlso, even if you're not interested in paddling it's still worth stopping by! They often have live music and a fire going. A nice place to spend time, for sure!
