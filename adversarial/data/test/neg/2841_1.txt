This was my first time at this restaurant and at first glance the comfortable sofas, beautiful chandeliers and booths looked very promising. We waited less than five minutes to order and the food came out quickly. My friend ordered a Thai curry which smelled sort of funny so she had to change her order. The server was very accommodating and got another item for her. I ordered the vegetable manchurian. I am very particular about vegetable manchurian as this is the one item I always order at every hakka restaurant. Unfortunately my plate was bland and not as salty or spicy as I usually like it- even though the portion was very big for 10 dollars. I was not impressed with the taste although the customer service was pretty good.
