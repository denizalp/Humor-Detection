Several months ago I gave this place a 3 star. I talked about the constant changing of management, the terrible office hours, and the blatant disregard of any issue that their residence have. I am following up after renewing for another year (only because moving all my stuff was a huge pain up those tiny stair cases). This place has literally gotten worse for all of the reasons I mentioned in my first review. Management has changed again, and now the leasing manager, Susanne, is impossible to get a hold of. They answer the phone maybe 30% of the time and are in the office 60% of the time. To be frank, I feel bad for them. Clearly whoever owns Uptown Gardens is not giving these ladies the tools they need to do their job correctly. Second, Uptown gardens has many things that are wrong but they don't care enough to try and fix. The maintenance team is so incompetent there were several times I had to go back and REFIX whatever they tried to hack together. There's definitely a bug issue that they're avidity trying to avoid. Our air ducts or AC was not working properly all summer which resulted in a $155 bill each month (to be fair though they finally compensated us for part of our bill after I reluctant about letting it go). And lastly they dont fix or maintenance amenities such as the grills or the vacuum station. Whoever said Uptown Gardens is a pig with lipstick is 100% correct.
