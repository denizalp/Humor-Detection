With so many dinner spot in Sin City, Milos provides a fresh and modern twist on Greek cuisine. All the food that is served has that farm to table taste! We started with appetizers: Greek salad was beyond perfect, have never had better tomatoes and feta in my life! Grilled veggie platter with tatziki was super tasty as were the fresh oysters and fried cheese. For our main course, our waiter presented us with a wide range of fresh fish to choose and pick out firsthand. The lobster pasta we selected was exceptionally presented and tasted terrific.  The branzino was even better, perfectly grilled and seasoned. The fish was rich in taste, and prepared to perfection. Ambiance and service are on point. All my fish and Greek food lovers, do not pass this spot up.
