Bong the barber is the best I've been following him for 5 years now. My head shape is very difficult and I've gone to different barbers in the past and bong is the only one who satisfies me. He takes his time and makes sure you get the quality cut that you want and not like other barbers who rushes everything for quantity. Highly recommended
