We really like this place! The first time I attempted to order delivery the lady stated they are unable to deliver. Just as well we were living right across the street and walked over to pick up. The white pizza we ordered was fresh and some of the best we have ever had! Even the kids liked it which says a lot. Now that we moved to the opposite side of town hoping they offer delivery in the future! Totally worth the visit!
