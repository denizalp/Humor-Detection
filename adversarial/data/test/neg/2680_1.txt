I dropped my Cardinals tickets off Sunday morning with the agreement of 70\/30 split in my favor. They called me back an hour later and said they made a mistake and it would be 70\/30 in their favor. REALLY???  I'd rather eat my tickets than do business with someone that doesn't keep their word. Seller beware.
