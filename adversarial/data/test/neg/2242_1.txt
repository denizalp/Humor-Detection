I thought this place was going to be \"just for show\" since I had seen pictures all over my social media when it had first opened. I finally decided to come and try it out as a treat for my sister, and I was surprised at how good they actually taste. On top of being so adorable, the macarons are filled with flavour. I tent to opt for the non-fruity flavours, but the mango and passion fruit macarons that I did taste were amazing. My favourite was the HK Milk Tea. I got a few replies when I posted a picture of the macarons on my story, and I kept recommending the milk tea flavour. One of my friends even tried it the next day and thanked me for recommending it! The staff was super friendly and helpful as well.
