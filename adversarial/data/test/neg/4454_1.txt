Dr. Delee isnt the problem its the front office. I am pregnant with twins and constantly have to re schedule because the front office over books. Dr will not even be in the office and the front office does not call to let you know that the doctor is not there they just let you come in and could care less about wasting your time. I like Dr.Delee but after my twins Im switching to another OB. His front office is just horrific and rude.
