Went into see Mr. Sean John on 10\/6\/2017 for a shampoo and dry...let me say, if you want to be treated like royalty this is the place to go & Sean John is the person to see!! He is so friendly, bubbly and positive! The atmosphere in the beauty parlor is beautiful and relaxing....Sean gives the best scalp massages and while your conditioner sets, you get an amazing shoulder massage too! I've never had such an awesome experience in a shampoo chair as I did with Sean! He also turned me onto the Enjoy hair products which are amazing! Literally brought life back to my hair! I fully and 100% recommend this parlor if you're looking for a positive environment to kick your feet back and enjoy some R&R!
