I've been told about this place for the last year, mainly by my regular cab driver (you can't possibly live in Vegas and think you can have a bloody mary or 3 and then drive home) who drives one of the bartenders from here.  \n\nHaving tired of the tasteless food at Red Rock after bingo, we decided to venture over the I-215 bridge and try it out.  \n\n1st: it is NOT fat friendly if you are on the hippy side.  They only have 3 types of seating.  Outside skinny bottomed armed chairs; inside you have your choice of high-boy bar chairs or cramped booths.  So just a bit of a warning before you go.  \n\nWhile we were seated quite quickly (in the ever shrinking cramped booth) our waitress was very slow getting us drinks..a standard Bloody Mary and a beer.  \nWe were on the fence about the menu but it was, after all, a bar.  \nMy dinner companion ordered the surf and turf..surf being 2 large lobster tails and turf being a huge ribeye.  Appx 35.00 for the plate.  It comes with a side salad that our waitress repeated after each entrée order was placed (down to the pine nuts).  I ordered the steak fajita tacos with a side of Mac & Cheese.  My son, who was left at home, called in his order for pork chops which are on the web menu but apparently have been removed from the actual menu.  \n\nSurf & Turf:  I had a piece of the turf (surf allergy) and it was FANTASTIC.  The rib eye was cooked to perfection. Tender Juicy and spiced just right.  \n\nFajita Tacos:  Even without the standard condiments of salsa\/sour cream they were delicious.  The meat was tender, delicious and in abundance topped by just the right combination of onions\/peppers.  \n\nSide Mac\/Cheese:  light and flavorful.  Not your blue box variety, but a very nice blend of white cheeses in elbow macaroni.  Served in a steel pot.  \n\nIf you can squeeze into the booth, don't mind the airheadedness of the wait staff and their continuous need to be posers, the sticker shock of the bill (2 drinks, 3 entrées, no dessert - $120.00), then it is well worth it for the food.  \n\nI will go again but will make it a to-go box while I sip my coffee from the fabulous Dunkin' next door.\n\nUpdate:  We've been back 3 times since I wrote this.  Got take out for the steaks.  Still no \"regular\" seating outside.  It's sad because we are stuck on steak there and they probably have other good things but until they fix their seating situation my little group will never find out.  Note: you cannot be 6'8\" and sit in the high top chairs.  it just doesn't work.
