This is where I get my allergy shots, so I'm here on a weekly basis. Every staff member I have interacted with is extremely caring and nice, from the front desk to the ladies in the shot room to the doctors. The usual wait time for a shot is about 10 minutes, but at peak times I've had to wait about 25-30. \n\nThe waiting room is very nice, playing good music, decent selection of reading materials, and comfy chairs and sofas. The location is also extremely convenient as its right in Ballantyne Corporate Park. Definitely recommended if you have allergies!
