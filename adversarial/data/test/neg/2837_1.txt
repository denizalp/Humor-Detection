I have had worse dim sum, and I have had better.  Be prepared to wait at least thirty minutes to get seated.  The food here is average at best.  There is nothing worth raving about.  Without even a second thought, the best dish was the soy sauce chow mein.  I was blown away that the dish had more noodles than bean sprouts.  Normally, it is the other way around.  \n\nThe service was adequate.  There was nothing that the staff did that blew my mind.  There were three carts that the servers kept pushing around, trying to unload all the old dishes.  The food that we received were not fresh.  For example, the contents of the lotus leaf were completely soggy.  The rice was stuck to the leaf, making it nearly impossible to eat.  \n\nWould I come back again?  Maybe.  Better dim sum can be easily found elsewhere.
