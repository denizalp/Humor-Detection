We go to this store the most, for picking up Nutro dry food for our cocker-spaniel and sometimes, turtle food, as well as for grooming appointments- this is probably the best grooming department between this one and the eastern\/patrick one (the other one we go to, sometimes). \n\nThe location is super convenient because it's close to a group of strip malls- including stores like Michael's and Wal-Mart. The people working here seem to know their stuff (the products) and they really like when customers bring their dogs, too. There are cleaning stations for, ahem, pet accidents; our cocker-spaniel always has to pee or poop, it seems (did I mention that he is high-maintenance, compared to my 14-year-old lab-pit mix?). Even in the parking lot, there are dog bags for your dog's silly number 2 business. The trash can is in front of the store. \n\nThis store always seems to be organized and clean, too, which is really important. The parking lot is equally in order.
