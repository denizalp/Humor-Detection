Visiting from out of town. Had my food ready very quickly. I experienced some issues with the app and paying. A couple employees I spoke to were able to trouble shoot quickly, and brought their manager out. I understand that they aren't tech developers but do appreciate how they were able to find a way to have me pay through the app. The manager and her team were quick on their feet, and provided great customer service! Thanks Sonic N Las Vegas!
