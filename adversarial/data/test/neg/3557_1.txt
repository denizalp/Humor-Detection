So authentic!! My wife is from Hawaii and the family who owns this restaurant are from Hawaii, too!! Food is so authentic and flavorful. My favorite is the GARLIC SHRIMP which is packed with flavor. The family is so friendly and their menu represents the islands so well!!! Menu offers a lot of options! My new favorite Hawaiian restaurant! The family is so nice and they have a lot of aloha!
