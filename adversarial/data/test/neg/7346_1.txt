My wife and I shared a tasty Vegas strip steak and smashed sidewinder potatoes meal. This is a huge 10 oz steak meal and can easily be shared. Our steak was cooked as ordered, medium, topped with caramelized onion crisps over an cheesy potato home-fry-style (not mashed) with a little bacon and slight sour cream. Yummy. Asparagus was cooked to perfection. With a shared extra side, house salad and tomato vinaigrette dressing the meal was pleasantly filling. Overall, one huge, good solid meal for 2 people. \n\nThere were no issues providing a second plate to share the meal. Meals over $30 are huge.\n\nThe restaurant is casual, very busy, noisy, and bustling with activity. The wait for seating two people is about 20 minutes.
