I always order a cinnamon-raisin bagel toasted with butter, and every time I always complain that I wish there were more raisins in it!    It seems like at least half of my bites are just dough, no raisins.  But that is the only thing I could complain about!\n\nThe service is always fast in the morning and the people who work here are super nice.  I definitely recommend it!
