The food was okay, but not spectacular. They charge a set price for kids and adults both, so we had to pay $50 a pop for our 4 year old, 6 year old, and 8 year old. They stopped making sushi around 8, which sucked. Our server was also extremely rude and impatient, which made our subpar dinner tense and uncomfortable. All in all, wouldn't come back, but food was okay.
