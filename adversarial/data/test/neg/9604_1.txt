First of all I used to be an avid BR (aka bubble republic) fan but after having gone to green grotto, it's now my go to place for a hang out if I'm craving BBT.\nI tried the black milk tea (ok) and the jelly trio (AMAZING)... What can I say, I was thirsty  \nI like the factories have desserts though it was a touch pricey for what you got. I like the decor, and the hosts I've met the four times I've been are amazingly friendly.\nOther Pros: the place takes credit card (I'm all about them points lol), their tea isn't tooth achingly sweet, AND best of all FREE popcorn\nCons: there isn't as much seating
