After yelping for a bit, my buddies and I decided to try Border Grill. As enthusiasts of Mexican cuisine, we were extremely excited to try the many dishes they have to offer. \n\nThe taco plate was an okay option~ You're given the option to pick 3 different tacos, so I went with the shrimp taco, carne asada, and brisket taquito. \n\nShrimp Taco: shrimp were small and rubbery. The sauce wasn't anything amazing.\n\nCarne Asada: meat was super tender and cooked to perfection! Enjoyed this one the most.\n\nBrisker Taquito: juicy and filling! Was my second favorite.\n\nFood Quality: 4\/5\n\nAtmosphere: 5\/5\n\nService: 4\/5\n\nPrice Point (food quality versus price): 3\/5\n\nOverall: 4\/5!
