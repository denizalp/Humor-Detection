I had a DIY bowl over mixed greens, and really enjoyed it. This is a really healthy place to stop for lunch or for a snack, and it's pretty accomodating to meat-eaters and vegetarians alike. I do wish the bowls were a tad bigger, but for a light lunch the small bowl works just fine, and it's much better for you than a lot of other options in the area.
