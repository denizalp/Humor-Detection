I wanted to send a bright and colorful arrangement to my friends to congratulate them on the purchase of their new home. I ordered the \"Sweet Cheeks\" and was very pleased to find out that the bouquet I ordered was almost identical to what was shown online. That has not been my experience with other online florists...\nMy friend loved the arrangement!!! I will definitely order from Blooming Expressions again
