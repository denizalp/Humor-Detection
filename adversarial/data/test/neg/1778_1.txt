The airport is big and beautiful but it is not efficient. There are very long slow lines at customs and waiting for luggage sometimes takes 1 hour after landing. I have never experienced this anywhere else. The airport authority could definitely stand to use some process improvement experts to tackle some of the issues. This should not be becoming of a world class airport
