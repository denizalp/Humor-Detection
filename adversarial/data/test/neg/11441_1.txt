I've stayed here many times before. The front desk staff was friendly and efficient. But the room was horrible. It was clean, the maid had obviously done her job BUT, the bed was nasty. There were stains on the bedspreads- so I was uncomfortable about what was underneath. My sons bed was the same. I ended up putting a clean t-shirt over the pillow and slept fully clothed- I was NOT putting my naked body on those sheets. Did I mention that the mattress was lumpy? \nI ended up getting about 4 hrs of very light and not so sound sleep. I hope they improve these situations-I'd hate to lose this option, but stained bedcovers?...c'mon now!
