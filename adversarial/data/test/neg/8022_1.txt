Our second TopGolf facility we've visited. The other one being in Las Vegas. This was the first time I decided to take my clubs to TopGolf and not use their Callaway clubs at each bay. Well, be prepared to have your golf bag inspected by a staff member. You cannot take your driver, fairway woods, or hybrid irons into their facility. Only irons & wedges. I was shocked to find a 30-45 minute wait on a Thursday around 1pm! After all, it was Christmas\/Winter break for all the kiddos. The backdrop isn't as pretty as the TopGolf Vegas with the Linq Ferris Wheel in and the Vegas Casino buildings on the strip in the background, or the swimming pools like Vegas but remember, you're in Arizona!!! Other than that, the same quality, service, food, and style can be appreciated here. From what we were told, Gilbert's TopGolf location is a little less crowded and busy than their sister facility in Scottsdale. I guess if you're going during their busy times, Gilbert would be preferred. Other than that, not much to dislike. The kids, novice players, moms, high schoolers, first timers, etc. should all like TopGolf! My 14-yr old son tried it for the 1st time and absolutely LOVED it! I think he's now hooked on golf, and I only took him here to try it out. Now if they could just open one up in San Diego, that would be great!
