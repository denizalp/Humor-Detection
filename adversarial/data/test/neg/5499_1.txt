Despite the bad and outdated name, Gypsy bar is actually one of the best spots to enjoy evening entertainment and Nightlife in Maricopa County! The place is huge, has multiple bars, an arcade room, a dance floor, a sit down restaurant section, a bowling alley attached to it, and an outdoor smoking section. My first time going I was shocked that this great combination existed in Downtown Phoenix. My first time eating there we received great quality food with a decent wait time. The DJ played the perfect mix of EDM\/Hip Hop; I thought I was in Old Town for a second.\n\nThey had two people painting behind the DJ booth, which didn't make since because you could not see what they were painting with the dark lighting. Three things to caveat off of the positive here; finding parking in Downtown Phoenix is a nightmare, you will have long wait times for drinks since they under staff themselves during nightclub hours, and the first time I went there was a group of Hispanics hanging on the patio who were all dressed like possible gang members. I don't know how Security Staff let them in their club dressed like that. I understand it's location is South of McDowell, but you can still ensure your patrons feel safe at your club.
