I was sold a car that had been in multiple collisions and lied to about it. When asked to see the Carfax report during the sales process, the salesman laughed and said \"it's fine! This is a BMW certified pre-owned car!\" Which it was, so I didn't think twice about why they didn't show me the paper. When I went to trade the car in last week at a BMW dealership here in IL, I was told that the car has diminished value to the tune of $12,000 due to the compromised Carfax history. Not to mention, I've been riding around in it with a BABY for the past 8 months!!! After putting up $6,000 in CASH and rolling the rest into my new car lease, I am finally out of that car. I'm looking into whether I have any legal recourse since I've already traded in the car, but I'm assuming not. Overall I'm just glad to be done with the situation. I tell everyone I come across how shady this dealership is. Worst car buying experience EVER!
