Like being in a generic sports bar filled with only men? Then this is the place for you! Sharkclub's combination of snobby servers and mediocre food is a sure fire way to have your pockets feeling lighter while you constantly question why on earth you didn't go to toad and turtle next door. I give it two stars simply for the fact that they have a large TV.
