This is the best food we have had in Vegas. Absolutely Amazing! We had the Charred Peruvian octopus which was fantastic. The Calamari was the best I've ever had. The mushroom quesadilla was really good. The Marquesa De chocolate desert was out of this world. Monica was the BEST waitress we have ever had. Thank You!
