Most people probably don't put a lot of thought into choosing a pest control company and the determination as wether they're good or not generally relies on wether you have pests after their services are rendered. After our experience with Las Vegas Pest Control, I can safely say that there's more to it than that. We've been using this company and our technician Stephen, for about 4 1\/2 years. We've moved twice during that time. Not only have their services been reliable and their technicians courteous and professional, but the owner and entire team have made transferring and ensuring our services during each of our moves trouble-free and near seamless. They are easy to contact and communicate with, reliable and professional. We are proud to support this local small business.
