We were excited to try this place after all of the great reviews on yelp. With the 30 min wait just to order, we thought we were in for a great treat. The staff was friendly and the coffee was good, however we were disappointed by the crepes. I ordered the \"pick me up,\" which is supposed to be a coffee flavored sweet crepe. Unfortunately, the dish was cold and sour and tasted spoiled. Therefore, I couldn't even eat half of it. When taking away my full dish, the waiter didn't even ask if I liked it. My friend got the breakfast burrito, which was just okay. We were sad this place didn't live up to the hype. However feel free to stop in for some good coffee if you think it's worth the wait.
