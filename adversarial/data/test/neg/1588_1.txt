No such thing as service at this place. \nWhen you first walk in, they do not even give you anything to drink until you ask (which can take forever for them to come).\nAlways only one person working and they are in the kitchen 90% of the time. Frustrating, if you want to dine for 5 hours, this is the place. The food is not good as well as the sushi feels warm and not fresh
