I kinda went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. You see when we were entering the restaurant, a number of young men in track suits were leaving. \n\nThe decor was surprisingly not as tacky as I imagined it would be and the service at the bar was very good. We did have to wait longer for our reservation. It was a laid back atmosphere with excellent service. \n\nAs far as food goes, I would lean toward the seafood dishes and getting a number of small plates. They are also excellent about splitting entrees for you. Of the small plates, I particularly like the tuna poke. The enchiladas are just okay, but their dipping sauce is very good. The lamb and cockles were very good. Eastern Shore Sea Scallops, Mussels and Littleneck clams was excellent. Crispy duck breast, creamy cornmeal grits, charred mustard greens, chili gastrique was good, but I found the sauce a bit on the salty side. Portions are quite generous. \n\nAs far as desserts, the creme brulee was the best. The bread pudding okay, but a bit too egg-y. The chocolate cake was meh. The texture was too dense and dry. I think they need to soak the cake in rum. \n\nWine selection was a bit disappointing. I would have like to see some South African wines considering that this is a African \/ Carribean fusion theme restaurant. Though I had a glass of the Carmenere and it was quite good. \n\nOverall, I was quite pleased with the place. It would be nice for a date. It is a bit spendy on a grad student salary. It came to approximately $200 for the 4 of us with a couple drinks each, tax + tip.
