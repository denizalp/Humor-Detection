The mac and cheese balls were good, half of one was enough for me though.\nthe bruschetta was really good. \nI had the steak salad (dont remember name) and it was just what i expected. Big portions though so i couldnt finish it. drinks are good too. some stronger than others, just stop by! its nice because its right across from belagio fountains so you get to see the water show, its nicer during dinner time. =)
