6 of the pumps are not working. Old lady cashier is on her phone and NO customer service at all. Won't even try to assist the customer. She's on her phone while talking to the customer and then came out on her phone (I guess for better reception). I had to move to 3 other pumps just to figure out which one is working. The manager should check the security cameras and see how many costumers the lady tried NOT to assist. After I left there are 4 other costumers that needed assistance.Check the security cam from 1200-1220 pm 19 November 2017.
