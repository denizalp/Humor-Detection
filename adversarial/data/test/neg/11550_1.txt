Came here after a night out per the suggestion of a friend. It was 11 am on a Friday and I was wondering how this line was even this long. It was well worth the wait though. \n\nI ordered the gaucho sandwich and a slut. Gaucho was on point with the tender steak and the freshness of the arugula, tied together by the yolk of the egg - mmmmmmmmm! \n\nNow for the slut , I was curious about the name. I'm sure there is a history on it, but I'm not sure why they would name it that. Regardless, it was surprisingly pretty good! Such a simple idea, mashed potatoes and an egg coddled.  Mix it together and you get this smooth flavorful spread for toast. \n\nI would say a definite must visit place when in vegas. Starts your morning off right!
