This place is an overlooked gem!!! We are always looking for different breakfast places to try and we are so happy we tried here!!! My wife and I had the most amazing breakfast sandwich ever here today. I would recommend this for anyone that loves excellent customer service and bomb food!! The Taylor ham, egg and cheese was an explosion of perfection!!! If you want a corporate chain meal this is not the place!! We can't wait to go back and try lunch there!
