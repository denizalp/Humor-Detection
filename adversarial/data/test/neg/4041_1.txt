We used Brian years ago to clean our camper cushions when we purchased a used pop-up camper.  He did a great job cleaning them.  This was our first time using Brian to clean our carpets.  We were very pleased with his work.  We were way overdue to get our carpets cleaned, so they were pretty bad.  Our carpets looked great when he was done!   He is very thorough and meticulous, which I like.  We will definitely use him again.  He comes highly recommended....
