We went at about 2:00 PM with a party of 5 and were seated promptly. Parking can be tricky and I only found out later about the lot in back! At first, I was a bit skeptical of the service as it took a while to get to our table, but once we ordered, everything seemed to fly out of the kitchen!! The Hummus, Falafel Platter, and even a chicken noodle soup. Everything was tasty and our server was a real delight, as was the rest of the family. Anybody planning a trip to the West Side Market to should include a stop here as well.
