Just finished a quick lunch here and am totally impressed. I ordered the steak fajitas and the chicken fajitas lunch specials with my wife. Both were excellent. The chicken and steak were flavorful, juicy and tender. The onions and peppers were perfectly charred. The accompanying rice was fluffy and great by itself. The refried beans were some of the best I've had. \nService was excellent. Totally attentive without being obtrusive. \nTo top things off, I just received the bill. The place deserved five stars at twice what it cost.  This may be my new favorite restaurant!\nOnly downside - it's a bit of a drive from my house. \n\nWife and I have become regulars. Restaurant is remarkably consistent. We are creatures of habit and almost always get the same things. (See above). However, we have also had the shrimp fajitas - definitely 5 stars. We have also met the owner. Incredibly nice guy who really seems to care about the customer experience. He's actually the one that made sure we knew about a 15% off Yelp coupon at our last visit. BTW - the lunch fajita special with the 15% discount may be the best food deal in Vegas in terms of quality and value.
