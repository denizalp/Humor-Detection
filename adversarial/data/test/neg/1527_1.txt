I had the pleasure of running in to the owner Chuck Taylor at the Wonder Bar last night.  There was a large group waiting to be seated and the bar was packed.  As the group was going to the table I held one stool at the bar and pulled out another to make it easier for the lady seated to get out.  At that moment Chuck grabbed on to the stool I was holding and said \"I'm sitting there\".  I was shocked and said I've been holding on to the stool. Chuck said he had been waiting for half an hour and preceded to sit.  I said to him \" fine, if you think that makes you a better person\" to which he replied \"Go f@ck yourself!\".  WOW!  I don't think Chuck thought anyone recognized him.  Who in the restaurant business would act like that to a fellow patron? Hey Chuck - Rightbackatcha!
