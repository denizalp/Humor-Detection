Good sandwich place. The hog heaven was very good with a nice sauce and the multigrain bread had god texture. Friend had the godfather which was excellent with nice ingredient. \n\nWe had regular poutines which were good. The shoestring fries surprised us but had a good flavour and texture or \"mouthfeel\" as my friend described it. \n\nRecommend trying.
