I wanted to find a salon closer to home.  I had been going to one that was within walking distance to my office, but the wait was always so long and because I was going after work, I was getting home around 8:00 pm because of the wait and then driving from Southpark to Huntersville.  So, I did some research and found Solar Nails Spa and booked an appointment for a Friday morning (I had a long weekend girlfriend getaway trip so getting to go on a weekday morning was a treat).  There were several people working, several people getting their nails done, but no wait time.  I had a full set done with what they call S&N.  I have never seen this done before.  Your fingers are dipped into different powders.  Rachel did my nails and they came out amazing!!  I was going to do a new pink and white set, but was so glad she suggested the S&N.  Your nails look just like they were done pink and white, but your nails are lighter and they feel like your own nail.  They look and feel more natural than the pink and white. There is no putting your hands into the ultraviolet dryer (or whatever they call that thing).  It will be two (2) weeks tomorrow that I had them done and they still look fresh.  I am guessing they will need to be filled every three (3) weeks.  I will definitely be going back and getting the S&N fills.  I can't stop staring at my hands because they look so beautiful!!  One more comment, this is a very nice, large and clean facility.  All the staff are very friendly.
