I have been to this location before without any issues. Today I walked in and the woman was completely rude when asking why I was there. Then after I said I just wanted my gel nail polish removed to let my nails breathe, they were completely confused. The woman who was doing my nails kept trying to change my mind which was irritating as I said previously that I wanted them to grow back because they are really damaged. I asked for a manicure and didn't expect to pay the amount I did for the service I received. There is still gel polish on my nails and they look terrible. I won't be back after today.
