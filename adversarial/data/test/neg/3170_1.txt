Best seafood in the East Valley by far!!!! The fish is really fresh and incredibly delicious. The service is excellent. And the ambience\/decor is lovely. The problem is that this restaurant is not cheap. This is not a $$ restaurant. More like a $$$$ restaurant.  But the food is so good, it's worth the splurge every now and then.
