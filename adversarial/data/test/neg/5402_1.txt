This place is rightly called the five star gym. The membership is expensive but the place is so comfortable and clean that you will feel like working out. The boxing gears, yoga sessions, spinning classes are very good. They have an iPhone App that you can use for booking spinning classes or for knowing the schedules. I love this feature. There are enough treadmills and they are cleaned and maintained properly. You will also get clean eucalyptus dipped wet towel after the work out that will make you feel refreshed. The showers are nice. The staff is friendly - there is coat check facility available. They have a store that sells some sporting wear - tees and yoga pants etc. The place also has some folks who prepare healthy juices and shakes for you. There is a nice lounge where you can relax and use the free WiFI. I am not a fitness junkie but the place inspires me to come there and spend at least a few minutes a day.
