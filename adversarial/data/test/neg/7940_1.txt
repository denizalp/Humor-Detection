We stayed at the Excalibur recently and had dinner and drinks here one night.  We had a blast!  We sat at the bar outside and had a great time chatting with the bartenders.  Everyone was actually really nice to us - but we did get some pretty obscene hats to wear.  The drinks were delicious, and the food was better than okay but certainly not great.  But you are going for the fun, not the food anyway.
