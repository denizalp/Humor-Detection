Scottsdale Memory Care has been a real God send!!  They took careful care of my mom for five years, until she passed on Nov. 27th 2017.\nEveryone on staff takes a personal interest in the residents well-being, and are very professional. The Caregivers are very compassionate, and demonstrate through knowledge of their most difficult jobs.\nThe Office Staff members do a phenomenal job, Jerry, always offers his assistance in spite of the subject not in his job discription!\nColleen, past Director of Medical Dept., has been extremely helpful during the tenure of my mom's residence. All of the nursing staff are exceptionally professional, and caring as well.\nThere is not a better facility for Dementia patients than Scottsdale Memory Care.\nOh, and the food preparation is awesome!\nThank you Tracy! \nAll the very best to each and every one of you awesome folks!!\nThank You.\nMike and Jan Larsen
