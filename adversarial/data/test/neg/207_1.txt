I took my first ever spin class here through a Yelp Elite event which was geared towards beginners. I really enjoyed the experience, so thought I would start going to the spin class offered at the gym where I'm already a member.  I quickly realized how good I had it over at Harness Cycle...there was a NIGHT AND DAY difference between the quality of the class, how much fun you'll have, and the welcoming & encouraging nature of the instructors. I vowed to never go anywhere but Harness Cycle again, and just enjoyed my second class this morning! Thank you for lifting your students up no matter what skill level! \n\nNow if only things didn't book up so fast! When the weekly schedule gets released Monday at noon you really gotta be on your game to get in!
