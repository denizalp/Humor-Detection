Waaaay overpriced, think double what you would normally pay. Prices are not posted anywhere and no one will tell you what cleaning costs unless you ask. I guess they know their prices would scare off most customers so they don't post them. \n\nService is nothing special, certainly nothing that justifies the price. This is not a \"green\" dry cleaner, don't fall for the organic in the name. \n\nStay away from this business\n\nUpdate - owner responded apologizing that I was \"upset\". Just to be clear I'm not upset I'm just exposing this businesses shady practices to help other yelpers from getting ripped off.\n\nTo the owner - how about posting your prices and explaining to customers that \"organic\" doesn't mean you are green. In this age of transparency it doesn't help to apologize or make false promises after you deceived and ripped off a customer. Maybe if you had an \"honest\" business then customers like myself wouldn't have to steer others away from your shop. Best of luck.
