I'm a long time user of yelp but this is my first review. I have been to many restaurants that I would give 5 stars but the reason I am writing this review is because not only was the food superb but the service was excellent. The atmosphere was cozy and friendly. There is something to appeal to everyone on the menu, from wood brick oven pizza to duck confit. The portion sizes were very generous and the preparation and presentation, spot on. With so many places to go in Montreal, we were pleased that our first night here we hit a gem!
