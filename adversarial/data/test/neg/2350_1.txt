My wife and I usually order from Pizza Palermo on those nights we're too tired to cook and need dinner delivered.  EVERYTHING is good, especially the Italian Hoagie.  HUGE, and tasty!  They promise a 45 minute delivery, but the food usually comes within a half hour.  (Delivery guys are very polite and professional.) As a bonus, if you order on-line (more than $20.00) you get a free medium-sized pizza box of bread-sticks with marinara sauce.  We save the bread-sticks for breakfast the next day; sliced and toasted.  (Two meals for from one order.)
