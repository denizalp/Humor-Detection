My Wife and I frequented this place almost on a weekly basis. Today we took my Mother in law  who is in from out of town. The restaurant was not busy.  When we were at the host stand, my wife over heard the server tell the host not to sit us in his section.  We were seated but no sever ever came to great us or take our order for about 20 mins. No one even acknowledged our table. Another table was seated and immediately greated. Needless to say, we got up and left.  NEVER COMING BACK
