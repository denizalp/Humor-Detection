I absolutely love this place. I've had dinner here several times, but I had brunch here for the first time last week. I sat out  on the patio because It was a gorgeous day.  I had to wait a few minuets for a table, but the wait was totally worth it. I am a huge fan of France and anything french, so LuLu was on my list of places to explore in Charlotte. The food is always amazing, the service is fantastic, and I always enjoy myself. The wine list is awesome as well. My only complaint is that the bathrooms were pretty dirty. Other than that, everything was perfect!
