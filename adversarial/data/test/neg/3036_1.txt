Went on a Sunday for their brunch, it was raining so the outside wasn't really open. This made the wait almost an hour, but it was so worth it! We got the biscuits and gravy and the lemon waffles and both were amazing! They gave us a free smoothie that was also delicious. Highly highly recommend this place!
