I went to Kelly's early on a recent Saturday night with a group of four friends, as it had been recommended to us.  We wanted to have some drinks, try the food, and have a casual dinner before the weekend crowds hit.  This space is nicely decorated and comfortable, but I have to give the lowest review possible based on the restaurant's misguided policies.\n\nOne person in our group happened to order a Moscow Mule when our server was taking drink orders.  She said \"OK I'm just going to have to take your ID\".  We were so confused we all just kind of looked at each other, and my friend handed over his ID (was he being carded?  We were all in our 30s and 40s at the table).  \n\nIt turns out, Kelly's assumes its customers are going to steal from them.  Our server informed us (when we asked why she needed to hold one person's driver's license) that the copper mugs they use in the Moscow Mules are \"very expensive\" and \"people steal them\".  I sort of waited for her to laugh, as I assumed she was joking... apparently she was dead serious.  If you assume that I'm going to steal from your establishment before I even walk in the door, you can be assured I'm not going to spend my money with you.  \n\nKelly's was busy and full this Saturday night, and I'm sure they'll be successful without my business.  The five of us paid our drink bill, and walked across the street to Barrio Queen for a great dinner, where none of us were asked for collateral when we ordered.
