First time we attempted to try this shop we were told the wait would be approx 30 min and 5 orders ahead of us even though no other patrons were physically there. That alone told us this place was going to be great and it was. My bf said it was the best el pastor he's ever had and he grew up on authentic Mexican food. Definitely plan to wait or order ahead, while we sat and ate I heard several food delivery notifications they received. Well worth trying it for yourself!
