Bought the adjustable bed bases and mattresses to go with it.  We knew within the first few days it was not for us.  Yes, we made the purchase but when I asked if we could switch it out, they said they would sell us a new mattress and box spring but would not give us any type of credit towards a new purchase.  The whole thing was over $2,000.  They said they would donate the mattresses which we slept on but could not re-sell or donate the bases which makes no sense to me because they did not have any kind of body contact at all OR we could donate it and bring them proof and we could get a greatly reduced price on a new set.  Basically, they get paid 2x and we are out even more money.  Plus the bed is a bear to make up because the twin mattresses are so crammed together you can't get your hands between the mattresses to re-tuck the sheets.  Please think about the whole idea of purchasing an adjustable bed before you buy.  I didn't think of problems like making up the bed OR trying to get another set.  I know we purchased it of our own free will but the now we are stuck with a very uncomfortable, very expensive bed.
