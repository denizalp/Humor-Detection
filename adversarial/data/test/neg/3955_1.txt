Surprisingly good food, rice and beans alone were very tasty, flavored just perfect.  The drinks were good, and it was a nice atmosphere.\n\nI sat at the bar, and the bartender made a good waiter, but I couldn't say anything about their service.  Also I went in when a very few people were dining, so it was a mellow experience for me.
