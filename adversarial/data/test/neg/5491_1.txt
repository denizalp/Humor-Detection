Have been to this location several times in its past iterations, not so good.  What a pleasant surprise to eat there today!  My Cuban sandwich was better than most I've had in Florida.  It was so good, in fact, that, even though I was quite full after the first half, I are the whole darn thing, just because it was so delicious!  My husband really enjoyed his beef quesadilla as well.  Our server, Lisa, was delightful.  we will definitely be back.
