Fitst of all I want to say I came here with very high hopes because I am a steak lover. Sadly this restaurant was an epic disappointment!  Here's the thing I don't mind paying good money for a good meal but a side of macaroni should never out do a bone in ribeye! I mean the price you pay at this place is absolutely ridiculous for the steak you get. How can you have steak in your name and not be even decent at cooking the dang thing. Wait staff is friendly but overbearing and a bit pompous at times but I mean it's a classy place. I would really try something like golden steer much better food and really quiet atmosphere along with some neat stories hanks on the other hand gets a big \"sucks\" sticker.
