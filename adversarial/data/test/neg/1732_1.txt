My husband and I stopped for the first time looking for bedroom furniture. We were welcomed by Sara. Sara was inviting and made us feel comfortable. There was no hard sell. She came to check on us numerous times. She was helpful, knowledgeable and patient.  With her help and patience, we were able to find what we were looking for at a great price and delivery of all items.  Thank you Sara.
