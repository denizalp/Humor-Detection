I love the food (aside from the green eggs and ham omelette.) My only issue is the noise. The size of the place is part of the issue, but generally the employees are loud and the place just seems to encourage a very \"barking\" atmosphere. Very tasty, but I'd like to see them work on creating an ambience to match the food.
