the place can get a little crowded but if you're looking for something fresh that won't make you feel horrible after eating it, then look no further! their menu and plates are very simple yet full of earthy flavours. the service is quick and excellent whether you order to-go or to eat on the spot. a great plus is that the music isn't too loud like in most other establishments of this kind. highly recommended.
