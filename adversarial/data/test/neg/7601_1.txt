We've been coming here since they opened. Everyone that works here is really nice and really good at their job. I never feel like I'm bothering anyone by asking for anything there. They will always put on Pittsburgh sports for us, even though I am pretty sure they aren't Pittsburgh fans.\n\nI really like that they have a vegetarian menu, but last time we were in there, the waiter told us the fideo is made with chicken broth (I knew that) and so is the rice (I didn't know that). I mostly don't worry about stuff like broth when it comes to Mexican food, but I do think they need to either tell people or get it out of the rice, because it's a little misleading to call it vegetarian when it isn't. On the other hand, I did ask Juan once if they'd ever consider tofu or fake meat for the fajitas and he told me if I brought some in, they'd try it in ours. I'm not sure if I'm going to do that, but it was nice that he offered!
