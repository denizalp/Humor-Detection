What a great way to spend an afternoon exploring my with my boys! We thoroughly enjoyed this little slice of Nevada history. It is truly a hidden gem. Old home sites, super old jail cell & smaller buildings, random parts & pieces from old farm equipment & pioneer days, some farming stuff, little chapel, a barn, Boulder City Depot, walking paths....it's very cool & a nice peek at our days gone by, especially for $5.00!!!!! And the lady in the little gift shop, wow, super nice & very friendly! I have asked about this place before & was told it closed years ago! My parents took me as a child so I was so very pleased to discover it was still open! It does need some TLC here & there, but it is certainly worth the $5.00! A lot of these buildings originally existed elsewhere & were moved to this sight, that's cool!! \nAnd since your on that end of Boulder Highway grab some lunch @ El Torito Mexican restaurant. Yummy!!
