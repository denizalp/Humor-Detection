Dined here a couple of weekends ago because all of the surrounding establishments had waits between one and two hours.  We walked in and were seated immediately (this speaks volumes).  It's the only restaurant in the area that was empty, dead! Every time I drive past the place, it looks vacant.\n\nThe food was served super fast, and the wait staff was very attentive.  I would give both 5 stars.  The problem is the taste of the food.  I found the meals to be very bland and unremarkable.\n\nMy try once more for the specials mentioned in the other posts.
