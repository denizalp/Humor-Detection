Had cod and halibut fish and chips. Was satisfied with both but I've tried a few better places in the city for fish and chips.\n\nThe potions and price were good. The fish was decent no complaints but again nothing special.\n\nThe fries were really good, although they were a bit too salty. \n\nThis place is small with not much seating so you might be forced to get take-out if it gets really busy.
