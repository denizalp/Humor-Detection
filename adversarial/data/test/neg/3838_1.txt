I had the chicken sandwich here when I was with my family and was pleasantly surprised! The chicken was tender and flavorful, and the bun was great. \nMy family all had burgers and really enjoyed them, although they said it wasn't the best burger they had ever eaten. \nI loved the fries but my sister said they were a bit too salty, so if you like flavorful fries these are for you!
