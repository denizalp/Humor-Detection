This place just opened near College and Crawford where Easy Restaurant used to be. The staff is friendly and gave us a few free small dishes (I'm assuming since this was a new restaurant). The food is good for what it is. I am a fan of lamb and was happy to find at least half a dozen or so dishes on the menu.
