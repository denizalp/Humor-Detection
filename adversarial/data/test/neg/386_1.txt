Ok, so me and my friend went there on the weekend and we had to wait in line for 2 hours!\nWell, if the food was great it may be ok to a certain extent but we were terribly disappointed. \nI have been to cheesecake factories in the States and have had a good experience but this place wasn't good at all. \n\nThe calamari tasted like it came out of a frozen package from Cosco and that for some $17. \nEverything seemed overpriced considering the low quality. \n\nNot great.
