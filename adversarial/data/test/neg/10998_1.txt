A little disappointing... Was so excited to have something like this open up in the neighborhood. \n\nI ordered (3) things: Tiger roll, seaweed salad and miso soup. The Tiger roll was bland and missing flavor. The miso soup was not miso soup and was quite flavorless. The seaweed salad was normal, however the amount given was way more than necessary. It did reflect in the price as well. \n\nI did not appreciate that the menu did not have a description of what was in some of their specialty rolls. \n\nOverall, it was overpriced, bland and unexciting. I may consider trying them again in a few months to see if there is any improvement.
