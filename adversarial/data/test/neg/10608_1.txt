i've been a big fan of border grill santa monica for years, even after it got kinda touristy and lame, the food was still great.  so, when in las vegas for a trade show, i thought, \"why not,\" and plopped down at the bar and ordered some old favorites.  yikes, the food was so vile, i pushed it away after one bite.  when the bartender asked if i'd liked the soup, i told him, 'it tastes like tomato paste.\"  his answer, \"people say that a lot.\"  really, and you keep serving it?  the ceviche was dry and downright awful.  i give this place a huge yuck
