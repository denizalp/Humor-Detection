Finally after years of patronizing the uptown Libretto's, I got a chance to try the Ballantyne location which is much closer to my house.  They have a special on Mondays which is a large 18\" cheese pizza and garlic knots for $10.95.  I called in the order, went and picked it up and it was fresh and hot.  I was worried that this location would not be as good as the uptown location, but the pizza tastes exactly the same - and that's a very good thing.  After trying just about every alleged NYC pizza place in the Charlotte area, there are few that are worth my time and money.  Even amongst the best ones (Junior's, Lorenzo's, Palone's, Da Vincis', and Luigi's), Libretto's trumps them all.  None of the other places can boast the fact that they actually started in New York City.  I'm 25% Italian, my ancestors came through Eliis Island, I lived in NY state for a while, and I've been to NYC twice, so I know good pizza :)  Libretto's is it - hands down :)  The Ballantyne space is a little larger than the Epicentre location but what I was really surprised to see was that they were open until 2am most nights of the week.  That is hard to find in Charlotte. They also had the obligatory slices on display for purchase which all looked so good.\n\nThe only thing I would ding them for here is that the special only came with 3 garlic knots.  I'm not complaining too much because even the pizza at $10.95 with plenty of cheese is a good deal in itself.  But knots are relatively cheap and I would have been happier with 6.  \n\nIf you've been on the hunt for a good pie in Charlotte, I can now safely say that either Libretto's location will do the trick.  Good flavor (and they do not doctor it up by adding oregano), good cheese and plenty of it, and a nice thin but not too thin crust.
