We loved our experience at Yardbird. It was quite delicious! My burger and my husband's chicken was really good. We would definitely come back next time! We actually really liked this more than a famous fried chicken and waffles place in Southern California (gasp!).\n\nTheir ranch dressing was addicting and went great with my fries.\n\nThe service was really good!\n\nI thought the price of this place was a little high so I'm giving them 4 stars. However, the food itself is 5 stars.\n\nI highly recommend!
