DO NOT RENT FROM THEM!!! Rented two units for NASCAR weekend. One of the units was operational but filthy with tank sensors that didn't work. The other one was a complete nightmare from the get go. Water tank wouldn't hold water. They \"fixed\" it by bringing out a sealant that we were expected to apply, still didn't hold water. Their compensation was to replace that unit with a \"deluxe\" Class 3 motor home. Needless to say not deluxe given that the generator was completely shot - as in no running AC in 100 degree weather when 4 small kids were with us, a fact they knew in addition to it being filthy as well. \n\nTheir solution, after we had to scream at them on the phone, they'll give us an external generator at no charge. Granted they did send it out Saturday evening, but they told us the guy who was dropping it off was their mechanic, Jeff, who was nice enough and said he wasn't high enough up in the business to make it right or offer any discount because of all of our troubles but come to find out his name isn't Jeff, he shares the same last name with the owner....\n\nHowever, the external generator was still not a fix and the explanation was that we were taxing the system and using it beyond it's capabilities, um no, we were simply trying to run AC, that's it. My son-in-law is a certified Ford mechanic, it was obvious that the issues with what they rented us were many and severe. \n\nReturned both units yesterday, was anyone there to check in with, nope. Has anyone contacted us since to make it right, nope. This isn't how people who rent from you in good faith should be treated, it's not how ethical businesses are run, fake names, really?\n\nDo yourself a favor and rent from someone else...
