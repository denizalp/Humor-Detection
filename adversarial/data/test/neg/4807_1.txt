I booked an appt here on a Thursday afternoon and when I walked in, the salon was clean and not too busy. I had a shellac colour change done for $20 and was satisfied with their work. My only complaint would be that one of my cuticles was shaved down too far, but I was otherwise satisfied with my experience.
