This is our community's Golf Club restaurant and bar.  I have brought my wife and family for lunch, dinner and special events and had a consistently good experience each time.  \n\nLive local musicians are often playing.  Many of the meals have the options of half portions for almost half price, which makes for some great options to sample things or get one of the large variety of appetizers or just pound drinks like many of the folks chilling out after a round of golf in the bar or watching some sports on the many TV's in the bar section.  \n\nWe don't even golf, but the views are nice and it's great to have a common and close by place to meet other neighbors while enjoying a nice meal.
