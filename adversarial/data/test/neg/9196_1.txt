I usually like Licks so I was surprised when I visited here not too long ago. I ordered the regular homeburger combo. I was not impressed. It didnt taste the,same, the burger was dry and the fries were not good. I just recently started buying the Licks burgers at the store. When I cooked them on my own Licks is once again redeemed!
