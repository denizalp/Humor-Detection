\"Serious Slices\" is the tagline of Jimmy & Joes. I know I know, you hear these slick marketing slogans all day long, but in this case it couldn't be a more apt descriptor. These slices are huge! And tasty!\n\nI don't live down in Chandler, so I don't get a chance to slide into J&J's very often, but I always make a point of it when I find myself in that corner of the world. The ingredients are always fresh and plentiful, the crust is thin and perfectly crispy, sauce has a nice tang, and the value is great. I have always found the staff to be courteous, quick, and look as though they actually want to be there. \n\nOverall, a great place to go to pick up a quick slice of first-rate pizza for lunch or anytime. Watch out for lines out the door at the lunch hour though! \n\nFavorite slice: crumbled sausage, onions, and green peppers.\nBonus: Grab a side of the signature dipping sauce (I believe its called Joe's Sauce?)
