Seemed like a typical Scottsdale $10 lunch at first, but not after I started eating.  This is good wholesome food, not overcooked\/over-sauced restaurant food.  I got the madras curry bowl with extra roasted vegetables which was packed with broccoli especially.  This is a rare occasion that I feel almost better eating out as I would if cooking at home.  Good amount of sauce to flavor the dish but not overdo it.  Also, I've missed ice cream since becoming sensitive to dairy and a small sample of the soy swirl ice cream really hit the spot.
