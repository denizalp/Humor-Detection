This place is awesome! I usually get the Grilled Cheese and it is probably the best grilled cheese i have had in my life. I also really appreciate how it comes with a hearty side order of fries, onion rings, salad, etc. Whatever you want- pretty much. Additionally, last time I was here- I had exceptional service! I am usually rather picky when it comes to tipping well but I left around 40% tip. Would recommend 10\/10!
