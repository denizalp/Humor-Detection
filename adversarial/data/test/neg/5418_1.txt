Absolutely one of the best Pho in Toronto.  The food here is consistent in taste with freshness and deliciously delightful.  I have been here many times with my family and have enjoyed them as always.  The pricing of each of the items is fair and the food portion is great.  I highly recommend this restaurant to my friends.
