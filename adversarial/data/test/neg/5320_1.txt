Good sushi. Very interesting combinations.Terrible, terrible service. We were there on weekend with a couple of our friends. We had to wait for a simple combos for 40+ minutes. By the end of the period the place was empty. 3 guys were working behind the counter... And still it was slow. Plus they made a mistake in my order. And also forgot to serve one of items, but charged for it. Add zero attention to customers (after all they did not even come to ask if all good, if we need a check, or at least to apologize for the mess).  Sushi places are not missing... Will pick another one next time.
