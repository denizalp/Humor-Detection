the staff there sometimes used to be nice   and sometimes there were condescending persons that rolled their eyes when you bring a bag or just mostly ignore you. I have sold many items at this location before they changed \"politics\" which they had to because they went down from 17 to 4 stores, now they don't take kinda basic stuff anymore but more like Common Sort style merchandise, brands and stuff to dress up, fancy dresses etc. I guess it's more worth to them that way (not everyone's cup of tea though!) but I have barely ever bought anything there. still nice to pop in when I am around although its a small location.\n2.5\/5 altogether
