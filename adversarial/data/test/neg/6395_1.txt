I'm so done with this salon. I guess my great run is done. I loved coming in. The atmosphere was always wonderful but my last two experiences have completely turned me off and I won't be returning. I got burnt on the side of my face and even the next time I tried a new stylist I booked the appointment at the beginning of the week only to get a text at 7:30 am the day of when my appointments at 9 from the stylist saying that she wasn't in town after all my confirmation emails and text. I am beyond disappointed because making arrangements before work and being up and ready was a waste of my precious time. Officially my last attempt to give anyone at this place a chance.
