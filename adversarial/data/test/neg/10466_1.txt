I had the sea bass in lettuce cups and the duck quesadilla.  Both were out of the box amazing along with their twist on the cucumber salad. Everyone is so pleasant from the front to the back. Theresa was especially sweet and very helpful. The dining room appears to be small but there is a huge back part they open for big parties and when the hotel is full and busy. Im going to try their sweet and sour chicken next time.
