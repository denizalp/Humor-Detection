If you wonder why they are called \"Art of Flavor\" you need to come in for yourself. This place seriously has some of the most bizzare (art) flavors I have ever seen!\n\nWe made a pit stop here before heading home so I didn't want to try anything wild for the car ride home (steak & eggs, salt & vinegar, basil, brie, etc). I know, I know i'm a pansy! Tried some samples of the more \"normal\" gelato flavors and decided on the creme brulee! Love the crispy burned chunks scattered on top. It was creamy, smooth, flavorful and everything a gelato should be!\n\nNot too far off the strip in Downtown, LV. Stop by if you ever get a chance. You won't be disappointed =)
