4.5, rather than a 4, this place is great with kids and adults. If you are a space nerd the content might be a bit tame for you. But the interactive part will swoop you anyway.\n\nYou can go for a mission or up to three.(60 minutes each)\n\nIn each mission you can play alone or team up in duo.\n\nThe scores are not displayed in a communal screen and every team can play different difficulty level so comparison are never made. If you have competitive kids it minimize friction.\n\nWhatever you do, don't go for the visit of the spacecraft. You just enter the model with a teen reciting a text of facts about this module. Plus the best part is off limits, you have to do the space camp to see it.
