One of the best places for ice cream! They always have some really good and interesting flavors. I definitely love how unique they are. It's very small and during the summer they at times can get a line out the door! Super hip ice cream shop.  The employees are friendly, but not very talkative? They somewhat lack in customer service it would be great to be able to have a somewhat of a conversation, I guess. Overall really good place for ice cream. And if you cannot make up your mind on what flavor to get just order a flight you won't regret it!
