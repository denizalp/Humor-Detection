Ordered from Amazon and was promised the order in a month. A month came and went no update no information. Tried to call the seller but no answer and the voicemail was full. Try to call the shipper and no one called me back. Sent multiple emails asking for the status of my shipment and never heard anything back.  Very poor customer service
