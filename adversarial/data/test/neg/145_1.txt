This review is for the Mermaid Bar in the Silverton.  I haven't stayed in the hotel or gambled there much but the Bass Pro Shops is awesome so I drop by everytime I'm in Vegas.  \n\nI had a few minutes and felt like a drink so I dropped by the Mermaid Bar which is located right by the giant fish tank at the entrance to Bass Pro Shops.  When I walked by the fish tank there was a diver in the water doing a class on the fish inhabitants of the tank.  Pretty cool for a casino.  The bar had a great deal going, during the football games on Sunday there were some great drink deals ($1 beers and Jaeger shots) and half price on the bar food menu.  I had 2 MGD 64's and a big plate of chicken wings for like $6.  Not to mention all the lovely ladies who work in the casino that made the view so enjoyable!  \n\nNext trip I may stay at the hotel but as far as eating and gambling, if you're looking for a relaxing casino off the strip to just hang out and have fun, this is the place.
