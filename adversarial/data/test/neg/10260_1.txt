First things first, the Five Drive-In is a great deal. With the cost of going to see a movie at a regular theatre continuing to shoot up exponentially, two movies for $12 is a steal. (They also have $6\/per person on Tuesdays and $17 for a car full of people on Thursdays.) \n\nI've been coming here since I was little and I have great memories of killing time at the playground in front of screen one before the movies started. They also have a beach volleyball court as well. When you're waiting for your movies, they really ensure you have something to do and don't have to fill the void with conversation with the people you came with. \n\nThe sound quality is fine but if you're in the backseat of a car, it can be tough seeing the movies and not the most comfortable. It's a drive-in so there's some obvious problems -- some people just opt for lawn chairs which works too (but the mosquitoes are deadly.)\n\nSomethings about the Five lose it a five star review: You have to get there about an hour before your movie starts or you might be waiting in a huge line. The washrooms aren't the nicest. They don't allow outside food or drink (a lot of people disregard this rule and smuggle things in but it's still a rule.)\n\nOverall, it's an awesome throwback and a great way to save money to come here.
