The food is sooooooo bad. My boyfriend almost barfed eating the watery crab legs. I only took a bite of almost all the food I brought back to the table because it was already cold and hardened. I will say the mashed potatoes were good but Im so sad I wasted 50 bucks on this place. Please don't waste your money or time. You will be disappointed. I recommend going to a nice restaurant for that kind of money. At least your food will be tasty and fresh!
