Ok, just making my way to all the Persian restaurants in Arizona and I have found my guilty pleasure kabobs- AZ Kabob is the creme de la crop of Persian kabob eateries!  To start, let's talk about teasers- I mean, appetizers ;) We had the shallot yogurt or \"maste moosir\" in Farsi....yummmmm!  It was perfect- creamy and delicious.  I had the \"chenje\" or beef cubes. To die for!  I mean, I asked it to be well done & it was nothing short of phenomenal! Moist & tender & decadent!!  Can we talk dessert??  I can't believe I had enough room for dessert. We had the Persian ice cream- pistachios, saffron, rosewater, cardamon- angels were singing all around me!!  Loved it from start to finish. My compliments to the chef Mr. Aref!  He is awesome! And my compliments to the owner, Mr. Armen- so warm, welcoming, & exceptional!  If I could, I would give this eatery 10 stars!!  I will be back weekly ;)
