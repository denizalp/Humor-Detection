I want to love this place but cannot. Tonight was the second time my family and I went there. I was reluctant to go there a second time because the service the first time was poor. Both times the food was good, if you like Mexican food and don't care about service you will like this place. We had the fajitas, carne asada tacos, carne asada and the table side guacamole, all were good. Tonight my wife and I got our drinks between 10 and 15 minutes after our kids got their drinks. We had to ask for our drinks, apparently they were ready but just sitting at the bar. They forgot the habanero salsa and and jalape√±os that I ordered and paid for. They forgot the corn tortillas for the carne asada meal.
