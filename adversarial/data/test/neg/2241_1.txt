First of all, it's truly is PITCH BLACK, which is part of the experience, but it can be intimidating at first. I wouldn't go back, but I'm happy I experienced it. The food was mediocre, and service was above average. The only thing, the atmosphere in the main lobby before entering one of 4 dark rooms was terrible. You enter a lounge area, check out a menu and order your meal and beverage. The lounge hasn't been updated since the 70's! It was smelly, old and uncomfortable. The dark rooms where you eat obviously you couldn't tell what it looked like, but you could tell it was cheap, the cutlery, the tables, the chairs, everything was old and cheap. I don't think they should look good, but the feeling of the cheapness stood out. I would recommend going, but don't expect anything other than an experience.
