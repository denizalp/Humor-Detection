Lots of selections if you're a sugar addict, which I'm really not. I ordered the vanilla shake and they give you a huge portion! I wasn't able to finish! One of my GFs ordered a root beer float and it came with a long blonde streak of hair! Which is OK, shit happens! The waitress kindly gave her another, new and hair-less float!
