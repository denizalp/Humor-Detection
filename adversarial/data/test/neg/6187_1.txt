First off the food is AMAZING!!! Best brunch in town. The grits are the bomb. Everything we ate was awsome. The drinks are so kool. Brass monkey!!! Who doesn't want a 40 oz in the afternoon. Best thing was the service.. RYAN is the BEST waiter Ive ever had. Definitely making this a regular stop.Thanks to Ryan!!!!
