Good coffee, wonderful aroma..a lot of noise.\n\nI went here a few times while my sister was in the hospital across the street. As mentioned previously everything was great (good seating, good people) until the operated the roaster. Since my main purpose frequenting coffee houses is to work (novelist) the noise of the roaster was just too much to ignore for me, Aside from the noise the place makes a great cup of coffee and is well worth a visit if you're in the area.
