I have gone to this shop for a while now and have been pretty satisfied with the crew and service. You can't go wrong with the 90 day return\/exchange policy and they have a pretty good selection. Also have an indoor putting green and some bays to test out clubs. Good location, nice and close to many good courses. I prefer Vans over Golfsmith anyday.
