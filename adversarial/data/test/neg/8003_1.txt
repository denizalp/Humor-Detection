Been going to Lawrence since moving to AZ 3 years ago. He will take care of you and makes sure your hair looks right every time. He worked me into a haircut I didn't have enough hair for over the course of 6 months and every cut looked fresh. He trims up beards like a champ and has great products. \n\nHis studio is in his house but licensed and cleaner than your average salon. Don't be alarmed when you pull into a neighborhood. You are in the right place and are about to experience great service.
