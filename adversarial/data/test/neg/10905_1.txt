Forgot why we stopped coming to these theatres,  first of all no reclining seats no free refills in drinks not that it is needed but that is a perk also not the selection of drinks that AMC has ( every thing you can think of and able to mix).  Ticket prices are higher and the theatres are not very clean.  Ugh I will never come back here sorry to compare but AMC has us spoiled- recline large couch seating, matinee prices for $5 -6 serve yourself drinks everything you can imagine, free refills. And very clean.
