My husband and I went there last night and we were very disappointed. The waitress was brand new and should have still been in training. Service was very slow when it came to ordering and receiving our food. It took us 2 hours to eat and we didn't order dessert. As you'll read in other reviews you have to ask for bread...don't bother unless you're really hungry. It's not that good and I love bread! Presentation of the food was good but the taste and quality were poor. Wine selection was nice but they never seemed to notice if our soda or wine glasses were empty. Again, very disappointed because from the outside seems nice but not worth it your time or money.
