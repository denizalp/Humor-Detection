Toby Keith's is a party and everyone is always invited!  The bands they have are great, at least the ones I've seen there.  The food is amazing, large portions and filling.  The wait staff is also one of the best in the city.  At the end of my experience, I always find myself echoing Toby's words, I love this bar!\n\nAs for food, I've had the fried bologna sandwich, and a few other of the sandwiches.  They come hot and delicious out of the kitchen with \"freedom fries.\"  The freedom fries were some of the best I've had.  Also I tend to drink a lot of soda and my glass was never empty thanks to the amazing waitresses!  \n\nThe entertainment- the dance floor is never empty, even between sets as the house music tends to get at least a few people on the floor.  Then the band comes back and it kicks into high gear.  The bands take requests and even though it is a Country music bar, I've heard them cover Rock and Pop hits as well.  \n\nIf you're not having a good time by the time you leave, I'm not sure Vegas is for you.  Hopefully you'll try it and find out you too love this bar!
