Other than family, the only reason I look forward to going to LV.  If you're not fit, there are a few places you can get out and walk a few feet and take incredible photos.  If you're really not fit, or are unable to get out of a car, drive the loop, roll down your windows, and enjoy the view.\n\nThe trails are well-marked, and even a 1\/2 mile exploration is amazing, when you get close to the rocks and see all the little crevices and plants.  I really love this place!
