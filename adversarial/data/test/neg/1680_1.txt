Dinner was Good but wasn't as great as expected. However breakfast\/lunch is a lot better! Free drinks ( soft drinks, juices, coffee and tea) and $12 unlimited alcohol package available. Staff is very rude and unorganised however waiters are friendly but very few, so do mind then running around past you a lot trying to do a 5 man job on their own.
