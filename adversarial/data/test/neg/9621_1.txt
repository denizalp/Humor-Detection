Horrible!!! I was told by a manager that they would replace an order that they sent me cold and with mushrooms that I did not order after I throw away the pizza and callback for the refund, they say it's nowhere to be found! Shady business! Someone is stealing there and they take it out on customers. TERRIBLE OPPERATION!!!!!
