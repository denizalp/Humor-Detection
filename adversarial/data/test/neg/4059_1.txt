Great food, a ton of options, host was great, service was just okay. The shrimp and grits was spicy, but nothing compared to the spicy fried chicken and cornbread pancake. Oddly enough, the syrup cut the spice nicely and it was still edible, even with the burning mouth. TVs all around to satisfy the sports fans.
