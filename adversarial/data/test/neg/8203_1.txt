Ok I can honestly say I was very surprised this evening. Chick-fil-A is customarily spot on with their orders but tonight was a mess. We were passing through the area after an afternoon at Seven Springs. I went inside since the drive thru line was long and they weren't busy inside. I ordered two kids meals (one with a juice box and the other chocolate milk), a spicy chicken sandwich meal and a separate drink. Then we were back on the road. About 10 minutes into our drive I realized our kids meals had no fries and the chocolate milk was a white milk. Uuuugggh!!!!! Let's try to explain to an exhausted, hungry 4 and a 5 year old that they're order is wrong. Extremely aggravated I contacted the location and the replied I received was \"sorry you had a bad experience\". Really?!?!!! Not, \"let me take our address or email and we'll send you a coupon\" or \"we'll credit you one of the kids meals\" Now the kids and I are both wigging out! Not sat!!!!\n\nUPDATE: The day after my review I was contacted by the location's owner. I was able to provide all of the required information from my visit's receipt to assist her in rectifying this situation in the hopes that it doesn't happen again. I was extremely satisfied with her attentiveness toward our issue. She was extremely kind and professional. We look forward to our next visit to her location and continuing to give it our business. Thank you.
