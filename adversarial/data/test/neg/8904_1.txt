Had great dinner here with my hubby. Did not make it to Roy's on Maui so we decided to try local. \nWe started with the calamari. Slightly overdone, not bad but the Thai basil dipping sauce was delish. We split a roasted beet salad. It had both red and golden beets (a fav), toasted mac nuts and a bright citrus vinaigrette. Loved it! Hubby throughly enjoyed his Choppino and I had the shellfish mixed platter. I had melt in your mouth butter poached lobster, scallops done to med. rare (now how often do you get asked how done you want your shellfish?) perfection and perfectly grilled shrimp over a delightful macadamia pesto asparagus risotto. \nDarcie our waitress and her assistant were friendly and provided excellent service. Look forward to going back!
