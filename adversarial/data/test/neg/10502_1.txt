Average Chinese food, we often order delivery because they deliver for $2 and usually get it to you in 30-40 minutes. We often get the bbq chicken sticks and the combo plates are a great deal! You get fried rice or noodles with meat (broccoli bee\/orange chicken etc) and a spring roll. When we do low carb we get he weight watchers selection which is a steamed meat like chicken or pork with steamed broccoli. I love that they have this option.
