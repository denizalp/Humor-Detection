I don't mean to add on, (but as I add on) maintenance comes VERY QUICKLY!  I have called for 2 different things once my fridge the other my heater. Both repairs were completed in less than a week from when I made the requests! I more than  happy to be living here... if you haven't already read my intial review below. Lol\n\nJust thought that many people are quick to leave a complaint but slow to leave a compliment. This is definitely worth sharing to a potential renter as myself when I was looking. \n\nI love it. You will too!
