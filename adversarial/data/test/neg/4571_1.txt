Defalco's will always have a special place in my heart. This one of a kind Italian deli nestled on the border or Scottsdale and Tempe has served me at least 15 lbs of prosciutto over the last few years. I go here for one reason only, the Il Purista sandwich. It's basically 1 while inch of prosciutto and fairy dust on a French baguette. \n\nThe only reason I'm giving Defalco's four stars is because the service is pretty rough. When I'm having an amazing day and feel on top of the world, I come to defalco's because I know they can even me out with their stern personalities, long wait times for takeout, and overall lack of smiling\/positivity. Though I enter their doors and soon lose self esteem, I continue to come back time and time again to be reunited with their prosciutto and phenomenal ingredients. \n\nPro tip - leave your personality at the door but bring your tastebuds and second stomach.
