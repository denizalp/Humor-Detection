I'm a president's club member.  I am also an Avis president's club member.  I would say at McCarran, Avis was better.  Last time I came into town, I had from Avis a Lincoln Mkz which I likded better.  Also the car was parked at Avis a lot closer to the escalator.\n\nAt Hertz, we were given an upgrade to a white Buick Lacrosse (same as the Shaq commercial) which was a pleasant vehicle.  There weren't any cars to choose from, that were of similar quality, at the Gold Choice section so we stayed with the Buick.\n\nThe car was not washed very well.  There were dark spots and dirt patches all over the car.  Not dirty, but just not a great job.  This was particularly obvious because the car was parked next to the prestige collection and even more expensive cars (Porsche's, Cadillac) which looked like they had been detailed.\n\nI asked the attendant at the exit to make a note.  All he did was write a note on my rental contract so my feedback went nowhere.  Otherwise everything went smoothly.  The car was there waiting and was returned\/checked back in easily.\n\nThe McCarran facility is not bad.  There are a lot of shuttles to and from the airport and it takes about 7 minutes each way (per the electronic announcement).  The rental car taxes are pretty high.  If you have the time and can rent from an off-airport company, you will save a lot of money (but usually off-brand as well - Enterprise?).\n\nTip for gas:  don't pay for the full tank if you aren't leaving the greater LV area (LV, Summerlin, Henderson, etc.).  You won't use up a tank unless you are there over a week and drive around a lot.  When driving back to the McCarran rental center, pass by the street that you are directed to and go to the next light and turn left.  There is a Chevron on the corner there with competitively priced gas.  Then you turn right out of the Chevron and left at the next light back to the rental center.
