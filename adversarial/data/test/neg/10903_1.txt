I'm a stay at home mom that loves going to target to spend hours walking around just to get out of the house. This target ruined it for me the last time I was there the loss prevention guy that's undercover (don't know what it's called exactly but I've seen him get someone before) was literally following me around like a lost puppy acting like he was on his phone.. Come on I had my 2 month old baby in the cart strolling around with me.. Was it because I was in target for 2 1\/2 hours straight? Hmm. Really annoying and uncomfortable. It was the most awkward unpleasant shopping trip ever. When all I really was trying to do was enjoy my day out of the house lol..
