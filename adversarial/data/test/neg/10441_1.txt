Don't try and do take out with this place in less you want to wait all night.  Called tonight at 6pm to order a pasta dish (no pizza) and was told it would not be ready until 8:30pm - no place is worth waiting over 2.5 hours for a take out order.  Called STREETS OF NEW YORK, ordered the exact same thing and got it delivered in 30 minutes.  DON'T even try and place a take our order with Oregano's!!!  They should not even offer take out if it is going to take that long to make something that I have to go and pick-up.  Done with this place.
