I don't know if it's because I was starving, but I really enjoyed my slice here. It was particularly tasty, crisp, and the right amount of sauce and cheese (not too much). I liked the seasoned crust bottom, unlike some other reviewers. For some reason, I always like root beer with my pizza, and my craving was satisfied.\n\nWhat I didn't like: not much seating, Speed channel playing, styrofoam cups with instructions not to refill more than twice. I wouldn't anyway.
