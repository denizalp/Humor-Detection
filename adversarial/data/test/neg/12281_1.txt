Fabulous meal, lil' lacking in the experience department. It was one of those cases when the server has you pegged as a student-poor-not-going-to-tip-no-matter-what  person before you've even made it to the table. The scoffing continued when we didn't order drinks but perhaps we redeemed ourselves with appetizers? \n\nThe caprese salad was fresh and tasty. Some freshly ground pepper over the top was a nice touch but no olives for me. For a main I got the orcchiette alla primivera, ear pasta with rose sauce, sun dried tomatoes, peas and mushrooms. Right away we got some parmesan (not fresh, still welcome) and freshly ground pepper. The pasta was perfection! Al dente with everything cooked perfectly and it made for quite the treat. Orchiette might just be my new favourite pasta shape. \n\nThe uninterested server got us our bills and off we went. All in all, great food but maybe I need to wait a few years to return.
