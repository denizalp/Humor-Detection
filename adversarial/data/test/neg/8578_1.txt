Not terrible. Not good. \n I'm beginning to wonder where people eat to give this five stars. Hot food served on a cold plate. Undercooked and under seasoned Mahi.  Service to match.  The waiter told me the cooks intend on serving raw, cold food for a hot meal.  \n  However,  the kids chicken strips were delicious, and at the price of five bucks I was very jealous I hadn't ordered the same. \n If Popeyes chicken kicks the bucket, I may return.  Otherwise, I'm staying away.
