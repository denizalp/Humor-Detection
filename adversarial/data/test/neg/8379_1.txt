Decided to come back and try again b cause the other options in the area are not good at all. Service is still just as shitty, we ordered 2 rolls and as I'm typing this review we've been waiting for over 35 minutes for the food to come out.\n\nDon't think the quality at this place is bad food wise but the service is beyond abysmal
