I used to love coming to this Panera Bread all the time on my lunch break until recently when they let go the most AMAZING employee with some of the best customer service I've ever experienced in any type of service industry. Eduardo always made me feel welcomed, like a friend, but most importantly always took care of me and made sure I was 100% satisfied with my food. I don't see myself coming back to this location after hearing how management treats fantastic employees.
