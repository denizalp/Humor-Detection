Went to Upstream after finding it listed on an OpenTable Valentine's Day restaurant list.  Decided to take my girlfriend there on 15 FEB (avoid the rush) as she loves seafood.  Should have probably read the Yelp reviews before, but hey... \n\nAnyway, we arrived at 19:35, five minutes after our reservation time.  Hostess sat us within ten minutes of arrival at a booth.  We ordered oysters and wine to start things off.  The half-dozen oysters (Chef's Selection) was good - the New York oysters were our favorites.  Wine is definitely overpriced at this plate, especially considering how little they give you!  We were very happy our visit coincided with half-price wine night, as that made the prices fall back to the \"reasonable but still high\" range.  \n\nFor dinner, we tried the pecan crusted trout and the lobster special.  The wait was long, but the pecan crusted trout was well worth it - good meat with a good crust!  The lobster was a disappointment as it was overcooked.  We called the waiter over, and he promised to bring us a new one quickly.  Within ten minutes, we had a new lobster that was cooked more reasonably.  \n\nAs compensation for the overcooked lobster, the manager comp'ed us a dessert.  We tried the passion fruit creme brulee which was quite nice.  Total bill came to $105 (dessert was comp'ed).  \n\nI would say that this restaurant is overrated for what it is.  While I like seafood, I think I can find it more reasonably priced elsewhere in Charlotte.  Ambiance was nice, but not worth the extra cost.
