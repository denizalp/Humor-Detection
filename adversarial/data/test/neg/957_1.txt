When we walked in my wife and I smiled, looked at each other and new this place was going to be good. There was this vibe to the place. Welcoming, the people are helpful and friendly. But in the end it's the food. My wife just said \"this is the best waffle I've ever had\". I had buffalo chicken soup which was very good. You got a hint of heat but not to much. I also had a salami, pesto, goat cheese, arugula and spinach sandwich. Very good. We will be back.
