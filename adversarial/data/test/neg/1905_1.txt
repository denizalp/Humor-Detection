[RESERVATION]\nI had been meaning to go here for a while. However, when I came with my parents for dinner, the hostess told us the restaurant would have an opening two hours later. When I came here with friends, some time later, they told us the same thing. Long story short, you should make a reservation. I was able to get a table for a Sunday night when I called two days before having dinner with my family.\n\nI don't think the Olive and Ivy sign does the restaurant justice, because it makes it seem like the usual casual, chain restaurant. However, the inside is great (just a tad too dimly lit). There are jars with lights in them hanging down from the ceiling and a view of the river(?)\/creek next to the restaurant. It is kind of loud as well.\n\n[APPETIZERS]\nWe were served complimentary homemade focaccia bread and pesto sauce. For appetizers, we ordered \"Choose 3 for $11\" bruschetta and Kale Salad [$11]. The butternut squash was my favorite. The prosciutto and fig was also very good. The amount that they give you for the salad is pretty filling. I think this is good to share because I feel like I would become bored with it if I just ordered that for myself.\n\n[ENTREES]\nThe Prosciutto and Marscarpone Tortelli [$16] doesn't look well put together. I was actually disappointed by the presentation when it first came out because it doesn't look like it will taste good. However, it tastes amazing. The sauce used in this dish is great to dip bread in.\n\nMy brother ordered the Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin [$24], which was amazing. I don't usually order pork because I fear it will be tough and not flavorful, but the bacon definitely was a great addition. I don't know what they did to the brussels sprouts but whatever bad taste they left in your mouth the last time you decided to give them a chance will go away once you try these. \n\nShrimp Risotto [$25] was good - my dad really liked it. I'm just not much of a risotto person - I think that's what I'm starting to realize about myself. But if risotto is what you like, then you won't be dissatisfied. \n\nMy mom ordered the Pacific Sea Bass (I think). I thought the presentation for this was well done.\n\n[DESSERTS]\nDesserts I would suggest that you get elsewhere. I mean, they were okay, but nothing amazing. We ordered the bread pudding(?) that comes with a scoop of ice cream and lemon blueberry cake.
