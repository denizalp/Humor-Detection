Taste was a bit insipid for Koreans.  Perhaps the taste better suits non Koreans whose taste buds aren't burned off by years of eating Kim Chee. The Korean Meats were not marinated enough and the hamburger patty was a bit dry and needed a little more salt and pepper. The Kim Chee was a bit too sour. The highlight were the jalepeno which was more spicy than the Kim Chee. The service from the staff was efficient and the chef was attentive and friendly. He even gave us a free sample of the kimchee. Has a lot of potential but needs to tweak the recipes a little more.
