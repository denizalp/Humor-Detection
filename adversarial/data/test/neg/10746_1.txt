I really do like Tropicana Animal Hospital. I've tried taking my dogs to vets I felt were more reputable or intimate or whatever but bottom line is Tropicana Animal Hospital is almost always open when I need them and they've never steered me wrong. The other great thing is you don't need to make an appointment and wait days or weeks to be seen. You just take your pet in and you can either see the next available vet or ask for a specific one depending on how urgent your needs are. Their exam fees are reasonable ($50 compared to $100 at an emergency vet I used to go to...). I've had one dog neutered here and recently I had to hospitalize another due to an infection and could not believe I didn't end up paying thousands of dollars (too many experiences at emergency vets). I really feel like they care about my dog and are very patient with me even if I call them multiple times a day to get updates. \n\nI'll admit I was nervous to make Tropicana Animal Hospital a primary vet for two main reasons: The bios of the vets in the exam rooms show that pretty much everyone came to Trop Animal Hospital straight out of college and most of the time that was within the last few years. I also wasn't a huge fan of not knowing which vet I'm seeing on a given day but once you find someone it's easy to continue seeing them. But really I haven't had a better overall experience anywhere else. I didn't think it was possible to have competent and caring vets that you can visit at almost any time at a very reasonable price but here it is. Don't let the location scare you. They also have boarding services at what I can only imagine are also very reasonable prices. Seriously try them out if you're looking for a vet.
