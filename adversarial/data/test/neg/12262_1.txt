Where can I start..... We were in town from Salt Lake for a paintball tournemnt and wanted something other then fast food or chain restaurants. We found Biaggie's on here (Yelp) and decided to give it a try. Not just the best pizza in town...BEST PIZZA I HAVE EVER HAD!! From the garlic knots, to the amazing supreme pizza, ending with the out-of-this-world New York cheesecake with raspberry drizzle that tasted homemade!!!! I couldn't eat anymore but had to get some knots to go!!! Thank you for the amazing customer service and amazing food!!! Next time we are in town we will for sure be stopping by Biaggie's!!
