Good place for some Italian food! I love the pizza and the pastas here! You can't go wrong with the Mac n cheese option here! It's actually one of my faves! \n\nThe latest time I came here we enjoyed a nice pizza and bruschetta. There are definitely some more fancy Italian places that can serve better food, but the convenience of this place is what makes it a go-to option that will satisfy you.
