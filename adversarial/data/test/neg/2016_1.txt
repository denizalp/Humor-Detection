No there's no 'Yelp wards I have used, as A person in life at some point you get tired of business running over you! Not willing to take part of their responsibilities to help you when some business are at fault. 'Yelp is one of the best things out now, to let people and business owners no whether it's GOOD-OR-BAD. There's no way your employee should have had the attitude the way he did and on top of that not even a called back from a manager, so it's not about putting any business or a manager On blast, with a callback and your employee with the right attitude this post would have never been posted on 'Yelp. \n\nIN REGARDS TO YOUR 2nd RESPONSE: No you cannot be of a service to me, since that happened and it shouldn't have taken me to post this on 'Yelp to get a response. Just see to it that your customer be helped, when needed.\nGood day.
