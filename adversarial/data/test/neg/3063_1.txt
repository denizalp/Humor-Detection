They are trying to buy five star reviews. They posted on their Facebook page that they would give free smoothies to those who post five star reviews. I didn't care for them but I wouldn't have bothered to post negativity about them until this act of dishonesty.\n\nThe food is pretty good but the service is terrible. They are very slow and always get the orders mixed up and they are VERY overpriced. I won't give this business my money. It's sad because Laveen needs good places to eat.
