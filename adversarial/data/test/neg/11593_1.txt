I live in Seattle and have a son that is stationed in Las Vegas. I wanted to do something nice for my son and his girlfriend for his 21st birthday.I saw the travelzoo special too late after it was sold out, but emailed the wonderful people at Bagatelle inquiring about gift cards. Todd, from Bagatelle customer relations emailed me right back and with his help I was able to set up an incredible party brunch experience for them. Outstanding customer service here! My son and his girlfriend loved this place so much that they plan to go back and bring friends. They said the food was delicious and entertainment and atmoshphere were incredible. Thank you, Bagatelle Las Vegas, and Todd, for helping me make his 21st birthday one to remember.
