Randomly walked by this place and decided to drop in.  What a place! The owner is the nicest person you could encounter and he was offering samples of his homemade soups while you looked at the menu. I ordered a burger and a thai soup and both were excellent. It's refreshing to find a restaurant owner who is all about hospitality! Would definitely go back again.
