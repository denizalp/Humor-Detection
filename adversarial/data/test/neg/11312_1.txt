An authentic Cantonese \/ Hong Kongnese dim sum experience. The food tastes fresh and delicious, and the way they push carts around to serve dim sum is how it's been done in Cantonese dim sum for decades. The unfortunate name of the restaurant is about what I expect from Chinese restaurants in general, and the quaintness adds to the authenticity.\n\nThe restaurant is always busy, so expect to line up for maybe half an hour to get a table. Once you're in though, the food is cheap! We sat for 3 hours, stuffed ourselves full, and it only cost $12 per person after tax and tips. No wonder so many people choose to dine here. And despite most Chinese restaurants being super-noisy, this one isn't! I could actually talk to people across the table from me in my normal voice.\n\nOne funny behavior I observed is that for dim sum items that people really liked, they would walk up to a cart and hand their paper over to the cart lady, instead of waiting for the cart to come around to their table. Sometimes there would be 5 different people swarming around a cart at the place where the carts emerge from the kitchen! lololol. Note that the cart-pushers yell out food names only in Cantonese. So if you only speak Mandarin or English, you've got some studying to do.
