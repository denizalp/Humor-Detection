Teharu is a fun place to hang out with friends and try some sushi from the conveyor belt. The sushi is nothing special, but it's not bad either. I wouldn't suggest coming here if you can't get full from eating sushi. I'm usually not full after eating here, and the bill tends to rack up pretty quickly because of all the plates you get. However, if you want to try something new and like a good variety of sushi and dessert, this is a good place to try out.
