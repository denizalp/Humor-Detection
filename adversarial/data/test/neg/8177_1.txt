Casanova brothers pizza was AMAZING. We walked in as first timers and Tony introduced himself right away and showed us the ropes to the restaurant. I was given the best customer service I've ever been given and I was only there for about 2 minutes. They have great lunch specials and great pizza. And you HAVE TO get the garlic knots and zippolis. Although I don't live close I plan on coming back here as much as possible!
