I visited with a friend to get some paperwork filled out when we were out and needed a space. This location has quite a bit of space and many people who visit are usually take outs. The only problem is the amount of parking in the parking out; it is usually packed. The service was average but what can you expect from a bubble tea store? I had the matcha latte in the hot format and it was satisfactory. Wifi is nice addition to the store features. If you need an alternative in Scarborough outside of MCD and Starbucks to get some stuff done, this is a solid option.
