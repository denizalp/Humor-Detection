Took my dog in for shots, surgery for a growth on her paw, and for teeth cleaning while under anesthesia. She was definitely in need of a visit, and had several teeth pulled. Her bill was around $800 all said and done, but everything was priced fairly. The staff was very friendly, doted on the animals that came in and out, and explained everything in a way that was easy to understand and process. Will definitely take her back for future visits!
