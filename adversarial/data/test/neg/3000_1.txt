We decided to try a new place and wanted wings so we found this place. My bf tried the wings (maple pepper and garlic rosemary). So good. I had some amazing nachos. I've been craving some good nachos and I wasn't disappointed.  Nachos were topped with yummy queso sauce, (I never find nachos with queso anymore), beef chili, jalape√±os, Ancho Chile lime sauce and onions.  We went in early at 2 on a Wednesday and it was quiet. Not a long wait for anything. Beer specials always good.
