Been here a couple of times with my friend. He always does the Blazing challenge (12 wings 6 minutes) but that is just too spicy for me. The first time we got our wings really quick but last night service was super slow... we got there at like 6:20 and didn't leave until like 8. I got the teriyaki wings. They have really good sauce and are pretty good size. Usually they are really expensive at about $1 per wing, but they are 60 cents on Tuesdays (hence why we only go Tuesdays)
