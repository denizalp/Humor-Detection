I was in town for work and wanted to try something a little different. This place was GREAT! I don't know a lot about Indian food and the girl behind the counter was so helpful with not only explaining the menu but also giving her suggestions! I ended up with the BBQ chicken meal with white rice, crispy naan and tikka masala. I added in a side salad and a ton of sauces. The spicy mango one was great on my chicken and rice and the tamarind ginger salsa was fantastic on my fresh salad. All of that food for under 15 dollars AND friendly service, I'll be back everytime I'm in town!
