I just saw the show tonight and I was hoping to give the show 5 stars after all that I read about it but sadly this is not the case.  We paid for VIP tickets (table 5 2nd row) but were treated anything but that.  For the most part the guys ignored my table (they went all the way to the back where we could barely see them).  Afterwards we were told there would be a meet an greet but only a few came out to quickly sign autographs then left (one was not even that nice about it) and the others skiped out the back door. \n\nThis is my last night in Vegas and I was hoping to end it with a bang but to my disappointment that was not to be.  My advice to the guys\/people who run the show (should they happen to read this) would be to make sure that you pay equal attention to both the front and back of the room.  It is really bad form to ignore thevpeople who paid top dollar to see you.
