I've have good and bad experiences here, but mostly bad.\n\nThey often make my drinks wrong, take longer than usual to make drinks, and one time they tried to pass off an old drink that was lying around as the drink I just ordered. I'm usually really forgiving with this stuff but when it happens regularly, I gotta take it into account.\nI still always get what I order in the end but I wish I didn't have to go through all the things I talked about to get it.
