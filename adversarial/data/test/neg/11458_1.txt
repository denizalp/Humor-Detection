Went here yesterday and all I can say is WOW! This place blew me away! Amazing customer service, clean, and very cute. I ordered the spicy bulgogi pork plate and my boyfriend ordered the bulgogi meat plate. It comes with the meat, rice, tempura, miso soup, and a salad. Great portion for only $7.99. We also ordered to share, a fresh cup shaved ice $4.95 , taro milk boba ( I believe was $3) , and spicy tuna rolls $4.99.\n\nSo happy we went here!!! The workers were so nice and very friendly. And the food was superb! We will definitely be back again :)
