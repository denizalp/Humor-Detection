Reasons I love Essence of Life:\n\nThey sell everything. Everything! Reusable dryer balls made of some sort of healthy plastic? Yup. Every type of alternative flour under the sun (cheaper than anywhere else I've seen)? Yup. Digestive enzymes, gluten-free snacks, diva cups? Yup, yup, yup. \n\nAlso, the place is really big (it has to be to house all those products) and the staff are friendly and quick. Can't go wrong.
