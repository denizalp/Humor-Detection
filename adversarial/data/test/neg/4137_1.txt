First NYC, now Vegas.  Guy is really on a roll.  And what they both have in common, they serve the best food from his best workers there.  Christina and Laura, who works at the bar, are such sweethearts.  They served me well and served with their best smiles.  And I told them bout me being a loyal customer in NYC.  They loved that so much, the manager Harvey was nice to take a pic of me eating and post it on Instagram.  The best meal I had was their Mac & Cheese Bacon Burger.  Once again, the S.S. Flavortown has set sail.  Thanks for everything and wish you Guy and everyone the best and keep on Doing Work.
