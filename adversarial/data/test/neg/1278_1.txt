So I've been here twice and the 2 times that i came here wasn't impressed the first time me and my wife came in around 12 something in the morning there was this guy working the register and the kitchen so i knew the waiting time was gonna be a factor to my order but didnt care so first of all he doesn't have a hat on his whole head and shoulders were full of dandruff that's disgusting didnt wear gloves and had like fucked up nails so we get our food mind you its was almost 30 dollars for an order of 2 sopes a drink and a lengua burrito with a drink my wife didnt like her sopes they were hard shells and couldnt even chew it my burrito was no flavor and wasnt even filling i dont understand why some restaurants have to have expensive ass food with low protions and no flavor the second i went by myself and this time there was 2 girls very greetful and nice so i ordered a torta cubana im expecting this sandwich to pack with all Types of different varieties of topping nope i was very disappointed and was also expensive and not filing i won't be going there anymore also very ghetto location who knows might happen around that area
