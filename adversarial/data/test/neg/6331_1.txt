Joe was able to make miracles happen when other companies were quoting weeks out for replacement when not cooling. He was able to arrange for a crane and a new unit within 12 hours and installed within 24 hours. I asked for cards to ensure I gave them out to friends and family and he worth more than just a yelp review but it's a start to helping a great guy and company. Even his employees were very nice and courteous. I would highly recommend him to anybody!!
