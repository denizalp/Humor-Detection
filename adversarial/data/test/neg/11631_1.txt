Good:\nKobe Beef sliders with Onion rings (Mom ordered this)\nAdobo Chicken sliders with shoestring fries (Me)\nWarm Chocolate cake - molten on the inside, anyone familiar with Finale in Boston, this dessert rivals Finale's, who has it perfect.\nOutdoor seating - Caught the Pirate show, loved the simplistic decor.\nDecent service once you get past the hostess stand.\nAlmost forgot - try the Japanese white wine.  It's a plum wine and to die for.\n\nBad-ish:\nSo-so hostesses - They weren't very welcoming, and we were seated late for our reservation.  Very annoying.\nOur waiter forgot to put in our dessert order, so we waited a lot longer than we should have.  On the plus, we got free coffee for his mistake.\n\nAt first this place looks like the type of restaurant where you would see Lauren Conrad and her posse of MTV cameras and producers.  Once you get past that first impression, it's a really nice place to eat, low key and quiet if you go early evening.  There is way more than just sushi, and the portions are a great size.  (I'm not one who adores individual portions that can feed an entire family.  Maybe the portion size is personal preference.)
