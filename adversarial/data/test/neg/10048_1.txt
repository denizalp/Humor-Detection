Best coffee in the city, in my opinion.  The Coffee Tree Roastery is far closer to me, but I come here for freshly roasted beans.  The aroma is JUST THAT GOOD!\n\nThe fact that they roast daily makes a very easily noticeable difference between Full of Beans and all the other coffee houses.  Including the other roasteries!\n\nWhen I serve ppl coffee at home, they do notice the superior taste, aroma, flavour, and smoothness of the coffee I serve them.
