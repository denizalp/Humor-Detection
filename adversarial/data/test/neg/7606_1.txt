I love this place.  They always have new exhibits and it's always something interesting. And at night it's insane. All the special events they do are nuts. I've done quite a few adult only events here and it is always sooooo much fun. I always expect to be disappointed but they always come through. Definitely not what you expect from a science center. If u haven't been you should check it out, day or night.
