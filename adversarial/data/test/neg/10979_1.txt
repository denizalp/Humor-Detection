Came here for their grand opening. I think it went pretty smoothly! I got a mix in of the fruity pebbles with fruity pebbles topping in a drip cone. It was really good! And also a strawberry matcha latte. I was a little disappointed with the latte only cause I feel like I didn't get much of the strawberry pur√©e. I love the concept though!
