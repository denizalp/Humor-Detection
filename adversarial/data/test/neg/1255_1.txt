I highly recommend The Best Detail!  Friendly staff, professionalism, great communication, and my car looked amazing afterwards!!!  They listened to my concerns and made sure I was satisified with the results. Even followed up with me the next day to ensure there were no odd smells from their chemicals (which their wasn't.) I will be using them again!!!
