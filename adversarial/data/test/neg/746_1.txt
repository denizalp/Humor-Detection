Shylize was a great server super friendly in fact I can't believe she works at an Olive Garden because she should be at some fancy steakhouse in town\n\nThe food was great as it always is I mean it's all of garden you get what you pay for and I have no complaints on today minestrone soup was tasty the salad was cold and crispy with the Getty with meat sauce was wonderful my second time ever at this location I'll definitely be back
