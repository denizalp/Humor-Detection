Found this on the recommendation of others. It's tucked away in SUMMERLIN behind PF Changs. The atmosphere was great. Tried the turkey meatballs- they were outstanding. And to my surprise, I ordered their most popular dish, the sea bass and it was really good , I'm normally not a fish person. Try mac'n cheese yumm... And the brown bag apple pie- share that with your friends  Great birthday dinner. Locally owned, go visit!! Great Service.
