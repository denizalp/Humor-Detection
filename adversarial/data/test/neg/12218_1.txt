Love this place.  I lived in Manhattan for a few years and when I moved back to Charlotte, there were a few things I really missed and ramen was one of them.  Places in Charlotte just didn't have it or did and it wasn't the same.  This restaurant is turning the tides for restaurants in South End particularly. Extra bonus is that this is walking distance from my cycling studio and it's nice to have good food in my reach instead of so much bar food and fast food restaurants.\n\nTry the rice crispy squares.  I don't love seafood or sushi, but these are awesome.  Those and the Shoyu Ramen (add spicy ground pork) are my go-to's.
