Sadly I did not have as great of an experience as past brides. I went to this studio because of the good reviews and was disappointed. I was looking for a dress that had not too much poof and was simple. No sparkle, no bling. \n\nI was worried from the start as I looked through the dresses and didn't really see anything that I thought looked like my style. I kept moving forward, however, thinking you don't really know what a dress looks like in the bag on a hanger. The attendant kept pulling dresses for me that were so completely not what I wanted it started to become almost comical. I appreciate the thought that a bride should try on a dress just in case it looks amazing but these dresses that were pulled were literally some of the most atrocious dresses I've seen. It became very clear very quickly that the attendant was not listening to anything I was saying. There was a dress I pulled that was simple and strapless- everything that I was looking for. I didn't even get to try on this dress because the attendant kept insisting the dress wouldn't fit. This may have been true but I was unclear why the attendant couldn't see that that was the style dress I was desperate to try on and didn't try and find another dress that would fit and matched that style. She was so desperate for me to try on dresses she was pulling dresses that were 5 sizes too big for me so I could see the style and insisted I could just have the dress taken in. \n\nNot every shop is going to have the style dress I am looking for and that is fine. I would have been completely happy to try on dresses at This Magic Moment, realize there was nothing I liked and carried on with my day. In fact as I was getting ready to leave, I was perfectly happy. I saw what I needed to see, tried on some dresses and decided there wasn't anything there for me. We thanked the attendant for taking the time to assist us. Probably embarrassed that they didn't have anything I liked, the attendant tried to turn things on me and claimed my budget was too low and that's why I wasn't able to find a dress. Interesting how that's possible when we had told the attendant there wasn't a budget...Again showing how little the attendant listened during our visit.  \n\nOverall, I did enjoy that the store is open only for you so you're not comparing yourself to other brides and there's less pressure. They supply you with a nice welcome sign and some wine and water so you can really make yourself at home. I can believe that other brides have been quite happy here but you have to have a very specific style in mind for your wedding.
