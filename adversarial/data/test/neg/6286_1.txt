Came with a party of 16 and our server was amazing! Probably the only reason why I would rate this buffet with 3 stars. Our drinks were never once empty, and we were constantly being asked if we needed anything. \nAs far as the food goes... eh...typical buffet food. Nothing great or mouth watering good, but it did the job.
