Horrible! Staff is super nice so it pains me to drop a 1 star, but honestly - beer was flat, beer had multiple pieces of dirt from dirty lines in bottom of my glass. The place is always empty and the bartenders stay at one end of bar chatting with servers and never check on you. I went like 10 minutes waiting to order and appetizer and finally just gave up. Take your hard earned $$ elsewhere.
