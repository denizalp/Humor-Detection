The business information keeps saying that it is closed. Not true. They are open. The place is nice and looks recently updated. There is still some work here and there some work going on.\n\nPlenty of restaurants surround the area. Multiples you can walk to. There is also a Walmart just down the street, along with a entertainment park\/mini golf place. \n\nThe new style of door\/card reader is installed. You just hold the card up to the disk on the door. \nThe room was clean and nice sized. The shower was large and the bathroom uncluttered. Unlike past places I've been, closing a door in the bathroom doesn't require you to play Mario bros around the toilet to do so. \n\nLG TV and free decent WiFi. There is a K-cup coffee maker in the bathroom area and they gave you the supplies. Thank you! The hotel also has a restaurant open until 10pm and bar open until 11pm. \n\nThe only bad thing for me, was the bed. Hard mattress. A little too much for my tastes.  Other  than that. I nice place that I would come back to if I was in that area.
