I stopped in for a manicure early on Sat morning. They were able to get me in fairly quick which was nice as they were busy. I just wanted a regular manicure no sns which seems to be a problem as they asked three times if I was sure. The lady cut my nails as I asked her to and never filed them. I told her to focus  on my cuticles as they needed help and she barely event cut those. No top coat and I was done in less than 5 min. I left and by the end of the day 2 nails peeled in the corner and I had to file the rest as they were rough from her cutting and not filing. It seems to be a good place if you want more than a regular manicure but I wasted $18 and need my nails redone. I would not recommend
