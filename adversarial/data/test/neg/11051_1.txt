I have been to the Summerlin location multiple times and decided to try out the one in Town Square due to moving across town. I've been a huge fan ever since the first time I visited a Fleming's. \n\nAs soon as I walked in, I was greeted by upbeat and helpful employees that quickly helped me find my friend whom I was meeting there. After taking a seat, I did not have to wait long at all before another well put together and positive attitude employee (Jessica Saitta) had myself and my drink order taken care of. \n\nJessica continued to help us throughout the night and provided what was BY FAR the best experience I've had at any Fleming's as well as the majority of any other dining experiences I've had. She was very attentive and truly a genuine person. She always was able to carry a fun conversation every time she checked in with us. I instantly felt like a friend rather than just another customer.\n\nI've returned to Fleming's many times for the good food, drink selections and general atmosphere\/decor BUT Jessica is the reason I will only be returning to the Town Square location from now on. I have an unlimited amount of positive things to say about this restaurant and their staff. I highly recommended it to anyone.
