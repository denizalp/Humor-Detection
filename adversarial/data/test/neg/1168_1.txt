Better than the B-spot!  First off, you don't have to pay extra for frenchfries, which by all rights is the ever-faithful and loyal sidekick to the hamburger.  The burgers are hand made and dont look like a tiny, preformed, cookic-cutter patty.  The brews on tap are decent and the food is great (especially the sloppy tots).  My only problem is its location.  Burgrers 2 Beers deserves better than a strip mall right off the interstate.
