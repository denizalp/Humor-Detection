I am super duper particular about my eyebrows so a  4 star rating is great!\nI was also obsessed with the work my esthetician in NYC did for my brows so it has taken me quite a while to find a place I felt comfortable trying in Charlotte.  I'm glad I came to Idolize.  The service was friendly and extremely quick.  Because I had let my brows grow all the way back in, the service was a little bit more painful than usual.  The lady who did my brows (and lip.... yes I must get that taken care of.... ) was very pleasant and made conversation (maybe a diversion tactic from the pain). I was in a rush, and so was she, with three customers waiting, so she got right to it.\nAs I said, I let my brows grow completely in so I was hoping for a nice shape.  I had a lot to work with!  The arch wasn't perfect.  I am not holding it against her because quite frankly, I was in a rush and there were people waiting, and it was good enough, definitely better than when I came in and I will certainly be back.  \n\nThe price is fair and the work is quick....win win in my book!
