Came here to pick up sod we were told would be here in the morning.  The gentleman that we spoke with said no problem it will be here.  He never stated we needed to make a reservation in addition to us telling him that we would be there first thing in the morning.  I drive an hour to get here.  When I walked in this morning they said that that  we never made a reservation and they sold the sod that they told us that they had for us because we did not make a reservation.  We were never asked to make a reservation and we were specifically told that it would be here in the morning it would be \"no problem\".  After speaking with the gentleman he now states we need to make a reservation two days in advance.  Perhaps his own rules confused him.  He also said since we only needed 200sqft he sold it.  I understand it is a small quantity.  That is why we called in advance.   We made arrangements with no ambiguity telling him we would be here first thing in the morning when they opened. The implication of that statement implies a reservation made on my part.  The definition of reservation is  to keep back or set aside, esp for future use or contingency; withhold.  I could not physically reserve the sod so that would require action on their part.  Failing to understand that stating a time and quantity is in fact requesting a reservation.  Telling me that said product would be her is an acknowledgment of a reservation.  No customer service and they need to purchase a dictionary!  I do not recommend doing business with these individuals.
