So disappointed. I came here based on the great reviews and it's proximity to my grandma's house. I ordered the R.H.G. Wrap and a cup of their famous soup. We came around 1pm on a Wednesday. There were not many people there. I did bring my 2 year old and 2 month old. My grandma, mother-in-law, and husband were also with me. The wrap was so-so. The chili soup was way too spicy. \n\nThe main thing that irritated me is, they locked the doors at 2pm! My husband went to take my two year old outside for fresh air and it was locked with the keys hanging from the keyhole! Multiple customers had issues getting out because the hostess\/waitress kept opening and locking different doors. Hostess' response to this was \"We're closing soon.\" In an hour?!? Food and service not worth the price. Bummer.
