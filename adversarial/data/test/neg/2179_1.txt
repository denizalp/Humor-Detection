Glad we tried this place.  It was delicious and the burgers were juicy. \nWe got the philly burger, the garlic melt, cheese fries and chicken nugget kids meal. Everything was Cooked to perfection. Very large selection of crafted sodas glad they came to the neighborhood and looking forward to coming back.  Only suggestion I do have is to offer a gluten free bun.
