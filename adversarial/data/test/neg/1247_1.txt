My sister introduced me to this place on Saturday night after a few too many bevies! I didn't even know what a \"Shawarma\" was until this night! I have since been back three times!! Holy YUMMM!!\n\nIt's an average, strip mall, type joint with the most delicious food!! They are open super late and the guys working are a tone of fun! I have been in the middle of the day and the middle of the night and I'm totally in love. I'll be back a million times over!\n\nAnd you can make it kinda healthy! Perfect!!
