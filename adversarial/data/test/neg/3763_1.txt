It's doubtful that anyone who Yelps would ever be in a position to have to live in this place, but I figured I'd review it anyhow-  as a public service.\n\nThis was my first experience with Phoenix apartments, and as a green boy in Phoenix I thought it was a good deal, initially (The best part was that a 6 month lease was available). While not the worst possible neighborhood in Phoenix (32nd St.\/Indian School), if you are afraid of your wife getting raped (dude down the hall basically begged her to sleep with him) and random and very pushy homeless people are not your cup of coffee, I'd say stay off.\n\nAnyway, the management is a parody of Asian stereotypes: an older Korean couple who are very cheap and mostly argumentative about repairs and things of that nature; though they did do some roof renovations and were generally pretty good about service calls for clogged drains and what-have-you. They just rubbed me the wrong way. A Christmas gift of a couple of pieces of homemade pie to the lady for her and her hubby was immediately thrown in the dumpster right in front of my wife. Not out of spite, just weirdness. She said, as she was doing it, \"Oh, I don't like sweets.\" Jeez, let us keep it, then. \n\nOther than that, the ridiculous bill we received in lieu of a refund of our deposit was typical slumlord fare; it claimed we owed THEM $10 because of not only the basic cleaning they had to do when tenants move out, but that a window screen that was never in existence while we were there was missing. I've never gotten a handwritten bill from any apartment place seriously asking me to pay for someone vacuuming.\n\nThe apartments themselves are old. Some have been fixed-up, with new carpets and cabinets, some not. They're all the same price, and if we had not hated the original apartment we had showed us, she would have let us live in that rat hole. Either way, roaches and especially crickets are a problem. \n\nIt's just not worth it, man. So glad we're outta that place, the apartments and the doodoo neighborhood.
