One of, if not the best, restaurant experiences we've ever had. My husband and I came to Scottsdale for our babymoon, we're expecting our first child. We walked into Olive & Ivy, no reservations, and were told that the wait inside was 2 hours but they could sit us in the patio. We took their offer and glad we did. Our server, Miranda, was attentive from the moment we sat down. She got our drinks right away. I asked if their feta was pasteurized & explained how there are certain cheeses I can't have since I'm pregnant. So we ordered the hummus for an app but no feta to be safe since she wasn't sure. Miranda still followed up with the kitchen to ask about their cheeses being pasteurized or not (which most are), and then we ordered the \"Natural Chicken\" and their ravioli. Radom servers would walk by to refill our waters when needed, food came out quick. My husband went and ordered a mojito, my favorite drink and I joked about how he's torturing me, but she offered a virgin mojito and took her up on it! My husband said it was the best mojito he's ever had and the virgin drink tasted almost identical. \nToward the end of our meal, Miranda brought dessert menus and said, \"Dessert is on me, pick what you'd like!\" We were floored. We ordered the caramelized cake (AMAZING). At first we didn't understand why, and when the dessert came out, it said \"Congratulations!\" with a pink and blue candle. We so impressed with the food and service we asked for the manager, Jimmy. He was hospitable, respected by his employees by the way they interacted with him, and even had me try two of his favorite gelatos. \nSuffice to say our dinner experience was incredible. Both my husband and I were servers for a number of years, so for us to have great service from the hosts, bussers, and other servers, was pretty great.
