To my surprise, the turkey club sandwich I bought at Kokopeli Deli located at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Aiport (Terminal 3) was quite tasty!  Aside from a good amount of turkey, it came with tomato, lettuce, crispy bacon and mayonnaise on wheat bread.  The turkey tasted well with the warm crispy bacon and juicy tomato slices.  The downside, as all food sold at airports, the price for the turkey club sandwich was a bit high at $7.50 with a soft drink bottle at $2.70!
