Lunch on a Saturday afternoon, with 2 small kids? No problem. Monty's provided chalk outside for use while you waited (15 min was quoted, actual wait time was...well...who pays attention to the clock when you're busy chalking?). \n\nKids menus and cups were also provided, and the waiter didn't bat an eye at the mess the kids made. \n\nThe menu is varied - breakfast, entrees, sammiches - but steps outside of the 'normal' fare to throw a few curveballs. My spinach\/feta burger tasted fresh and not mass-produced. \n\nOnly downside is that the place is loud - but then, that turns into a positive when you're with a hungry 11month old. :)
