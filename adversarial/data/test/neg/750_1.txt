Wahoo! is right! This place is cheap, delicious, has great customer service, and has a fun atmosphere... What more could a little Yelper need?\n\nThis place has two main attractions, dining room and the bar.\n\nThe dining room is set up in a seat yourself fashion. You first order, then you pick a place to sit, then they deliver your food to you by name.\n\nI ordered a Wahoo (ono fished) grilled burrito wet. Both of the enchilada sauces are delightful. I asked to sample each and they let me get both (half and half). My food came out quickly and it was fresh.\n\nThe house salsa was lack luster. Nice veggie taste, but nothing special or memorable.  Mr. Lee's sauce was the business: sweet and spicy and thick. (I swear there is teriyaki in there). Get it! You'll thank me later. \n\nThe bar has great beer specials. They have a variety (Mexican and American) on tap and they are around $2.11 a piece and half that during happy hour.\n\nIf you're a single gal, this is a great place to go surfing for dudes.\n\nI'm pretty WAHOO for Wahoo's!
