This 2 star rating is for the service. Although we were waited on promptly and the food came out in a timely manner, the waitress was extremely rude.  We were visiting with family after we had paid for our meal when she came over and told us people were waiting for a table.  She wasn't even pleasant about it. It had only been a few minutes since we had paid.  I have never been asked to leave a table.  Although we were happy with our meals I don't think I could ever go back, that kind of treatment is unacceptable.
