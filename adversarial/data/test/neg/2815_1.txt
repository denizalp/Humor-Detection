Eating here is like being invited to a dear friend's home for dinner, only your pal in the kitchen is a masterful chef.  I really respect what Chef Christopher does with his tiny workspace and limited support staff.  You generally get a choice of two tasty entrees - that's it.  But you can expect both dishes to be fresh, tasty, complex and atypical. I appreciate the BYOB concept, with the unbelievably cheap $10 corking fee.   If you're looking for a vast menu, or a hurried meal, or a place that accepts credit cards, look no further than Cheesecake Factory. If you view every meal as your last as I do, treat yourself to an exceptional dining experience with your bestie or partner at Cafe Monarch.
