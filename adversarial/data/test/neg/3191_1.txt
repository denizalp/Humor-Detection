I came to RTM for dyno tests on my Subaru BRZ and came here in need of a baseline and wanted to know my gains after installing a turbo. I was actually surprised how friendly and welcoming everyone here was and absolutely do not regret coming here for their dyno services. With RTM specializing in German vehicles, I was a little hesitant to bring my \"JDM\" car here but after doing business with them and looking at their shop, I would not hesitate to come here for any of their services. If only they would support the Ecutek tuning platform, I would've allowed them to tune my vehicle instead of only a dyno test.\n\nI also asked Ales to look over the tune I received to make sure everything was in order and he happily obliged.\n\nI highly recommend their dyno services!
