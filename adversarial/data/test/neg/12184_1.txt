Location; Dunlap just south of central. Older in wear and tear dining and bar area separated. Oddly when walking in the bar area felt cool in air temperature but when we sat in the dining area air temperature was definitely more warm wish we would have sat in bar area. \n\nWe came in for lunch, and have mixed reviews on dishes!\n\nFood; I got the shredded beef Chalupa and it was delicious- the masa was cooked to perfection and meat was yummy.  My daughter got the Pollo Fundido she couldn't eat it - now beware it does not come with white chicken so feel if it was the meat cut she liked it looks like it may have been delicious. \n\nService; super friendly and apologized for daughter not able to eat her dish - we didn't ask but she removed the dish from our bill.  \n\nI'd try it again soon to update review.
