Place is awesome! From the food to the service to the ambiance. It is like you are sitting at home in your living room. Everyone is so friendly and accommodating and makes you feel so welcome.  My fianc√© and I started out with the meatballs, which were by far the best in town! Then moved on to the Milano and the white stone pizza.  As I sat there I just couldn't believe how good everything was from start to finish.  The vibe was exactly what i was looking for.  I could see us having a date night there or even bringing friends to celebrate. It seemed like they had a little bit of everyone there. The games were playing behind the bar which also was a nice touch for me.  I could definitely see going there to sit at the bar and watch a game. Bartenders were nice, servers knew the menu and recommended menu choices and when the manager came over I failed to tell him how wonderful everything was( hence, why I am here).  I applaud the owners for getting it right for once. Great job!  We will be back weekly...
