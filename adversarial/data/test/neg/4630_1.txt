Small, friendly sushi restaurant in Downtown. We got the eel & avocado roll, ichiban roll, and two salmon rolls. The rolls are huge (especially the ichiban roll)! So worth the price, not that they are even that expensive. They were decent, although I thought the ichiban roll lacked some flavor. \n\nService here is fantastic. I ordered takeout and was greeted warmly. Felt no rush to order as the lady told me to take my time. After placing my order, she called me by my first name every time she spoke to me. After waiting for just a couple minutes, one of the sushi chefs came over to me to tell me that it'll be another few minutes before my sushi is done because they wanted to use fresher ingredients. The lady told me to take a seat as I waited and, five seconds later, brought me a bowl of hot miso soup to enjoy. How sweet! When my order was ready, she even took the extra step to clean the sauce that was stuck to the bottom of the styrofoam box before putting it into the bag. She and the sushi chef both apologized for the wait and thanked me for waiting, even though it only took about 10-12 minutes. Really was not expecting such great service for just ordering takeout. Imagine the service you'd get if you ate in! \n\nTaste | 3\nAtmosphere | 3.5\nPresentation | 3\nService | 5 \nOVERALL | 3.5
