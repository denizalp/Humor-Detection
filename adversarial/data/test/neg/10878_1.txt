My fiance and my favorite ramen place in town. Everything is always delicious, perfectly made z and very well priced. We both have tried all of the different broth types and they were all amazing. We go about once a week and always tell our friends that are looking for good ramen places. \n\nAmazing ramen, less busy than other places, and great staff.
