If I could give this place negative stars, I would. It was the absolute worst experience I have ever had in my entire life. DON'T DO IT!!!!!! Avoid Budget at all costs!!!! I warned you. Horrendous wait times, rude staff, treated with absolute zero empathy or respect. I felt like just a number. I'm currently in a dispute with them over a charge for a car I never picked up because the customer service was so bad when I went to pick it up. Please stay away from Budget!
