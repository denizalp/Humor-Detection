The caf√© has been open for maybe a year or so in my girlfriend's neighborhood and she wanted to try it out on a quiet afternoon.\n\nIt may not look like much on the outside, however the interior has lots of space and is well laid out with a cafe area at the front and a restaurant area with tables in the back section. They serve coffee, tea, beer, wine, sandwiches, lovely small desserts and a small but tasty menu (that I'm assuming changes up depending on the season given their 'organic' focus from what I read on their website).\n\nBoth our coffees\/cappuccinos were tasty and the small strawberry dessert I ordered hit the spot with just the right amount of custard to go with. My girlfriend ordered a croissant that was heated up in the kitchen. Rather than simply serve my dessert and then bring the croissant after it was heated, she waited and brought both at the same time. Excellent service in that regard.\n\n I'd be happy to venture back and spend an afternoon there working given their free wi-fi and also because its likely the best cafe option in the area.
