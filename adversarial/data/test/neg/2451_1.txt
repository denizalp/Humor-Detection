I hate to post a bad review but this is based solely on the service we recieved as we didn't make it to ordering food. First, the host's up front was short with us and seemed over worked. She told us the wait time was 1 hour to 45 min. I tried to clarify as it sounded like she said an 1 hour and 45 mins but she was too dead to respond to me. She did give us a option to sit in the lounge area if there is any available seats which there wasnt so we walked around. After we walked around the casino we returned to the restaurant. \n  We checked in with the host's again where she was like zombie and said nothing to us. We found an open seat in the lounge so we took a seat. After we sat down it took awhile to get a menu; we did ask a waitress for one who said \"she's coming around\"....kind of rude. Our waitress dropped off some menus and didnt say much but asked if we wanted water or drinks. My friend ask for 2 waters with lemons. While waiting for the waters we looked at the menu and only saw brunch items which was a little werid because it was 230 pm on a Monday. Upon receiving our waters our waitress asked if we would like anything from the menu. We ask if there was another menu with more lunch options and she explained that they are only using the brunch menu but we can get a burger that's not on the menu, werid but okay. My friend noticed there weren't any lemons in our waters, not a huge deal but we are at upscale restaurant and we plan on spending lot on a good meal there. My friend asked nicely for lemons which our waitress said no problem. During the time of waiting for our lemons which was awhile, we made a decision to leave. \n  Bottom line this restaurant is expensive which is fine but I expected to be treated with good service which did not happen from the very beginning. They were not even crazy busy and it was just ridiculous. We were really treated like less then and it was oblivious. I saw the Yelp reviews and pictures of good food but it was not even close to a 4 and 1\/2 star experience for me.
