Best Club Experience on my Bday\/Anniversary Weekend!!\n\nCame on Saturday night through \"Sin City Club Crawl $45\" Place was packed. There were dancers want to say go go dancers but there far more than that they put on several performances. Confetti Canons, C02 Canons popping off througout the night Light sticks thrown about. Music on Saturday was EDM, DJ was on point had the crowd going wild. I loved it so much I decided to come back on my birthday the next day for hip hop night. Equally fun, the bouncers are respectful, the guys working the restrooms are really cool offering several items in there. The club is bigger than most. The rear of the club offers a beautiful setting of the pool and views of the strip. \n\nPromoter got me in free on Sunday even gave the ladies free drink tickets +++\n\nCome here you will not be dissapointed.
