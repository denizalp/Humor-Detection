I have taken my 2011 Toyota Avalon to Right Toyota ever since I purchased it.  I will not use your services anymore.  I had to get a new rack and pinion (after only 56,000 miles) and was initially quoted $1875 by Bob Marthaler.  I immediately looked that repair up on line and saw that the cost ranged from $980 to $1325.  When I asked Bob about that, he said he would see what he could do.  He returned with a quote of $1550 and said the on-line quote did not include the alignment or the steering fluid flush.  However, it did include those items.  I got a quote from another Toyota service shop of $1225, including everything.  For $325 you have lost my business forever!  I don't like being gouged or told lies!  This post will also go on Yelp and wherever else I can post it.
