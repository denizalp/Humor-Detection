A nice casual local pub in the heart of Little Italy with decent food offerings and good varied selection of beers including many local craft beers.\n\nService was friendly and quite attentive, but not overbearing.  Since it was a slow night, servers were able to chat more than usual which I don't normally mind. Definitely a place for service with a smile and the comfort of a local friendly pub.\n\nMenu prices are quite reasonable with portion sizes a bit on the small scale, but daily menu specials are probably the best bet.  Probably not the best tasting food I had, but for a pub, it works great for me.\n\nDaily tacos 3 for $10, oysters galore ($1.50 each on Thursday) and they have drink specials as well, just look at the blackboard or wait until a server informs you.\n\nIf you want a no fuss type of place with a variety of food selections and beer choices, then this place is for you.  Bonus if you love oysters because they're not too bad.
