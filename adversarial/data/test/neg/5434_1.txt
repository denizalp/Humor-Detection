I stumbled upon this place on my way to the farmer's market in Market Square.  I love sushi and was excited to discover an option within walking distance from my North Shore office location.\n\nThey have daily lunch specials that range from $7-$10 and include soup or salad and sushi options.  There is also a decently large menu featuring the traditional rolls and pieces and also many specialty rolls.  There was quite a line when I ordered, but they hustle and really get orders out to you quickly.  Everything was very fresh and tasty.  There was just the right amount of sauces and the flavors on my roll complimented each other perfectly.\n\nThere is seating inside, but there were so many people waiting for food (at least during the lunch rush) that you are probably better off getting your food to go rather than enduring the crowds.\n\nA great experience with extremely tasty and fresh food.  I will be back.
