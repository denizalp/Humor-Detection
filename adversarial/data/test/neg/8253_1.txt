I've been to Canteen now twice since it opened and its pretty good.  I was psyched to hear and read about it prior to opening and I don't think it disappointed, it just has some improvements to make.  The decor and space are both very inviting and festive.  It is limited by an awkward shape and crowded but those are not bad things!!  The first time I came I had a margarita, guac\/chips, carnitas, fried cauliflower, and fish tacos.  They were all pretty good but the fried stuff (cauliflower and fish) were heavily breaded and not hot enough so both felt a little heavy.  I would love to see a fish taco option that was not fried.  The guac is delicious...and the margaritas were good...but nothing special.  I'd love to see a spicy margarita option and just some more options in general.  \n\nI went again last night and had the carne asada and farmers cheese taco....these were not great.  The farmers cheese just isn't my thing so my fault for a bad order.  But the carne asada needs to reduce the chipotle\/smoke flavor a bit- it takes over.  Also, all 3 of my tacos last night had cold filling so that didn't help.\n\nI will be back again in the hopes that its heading on up!
