I like it. I have been to a few good life's and this one is huge and spacious and does not feel crowded.  They have a women's section thats the biggest and best supplied that I have experienced.  The place is very clean. Too bad the members don't put the weights back where they belong. The staff is amazing and friendly and so upbeat! Love it here.
