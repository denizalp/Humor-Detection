Mixed reviews about this place. Food can be a hit or miss here, so careful what you order! The lobster and crab soup is really great, comes with some warm bread baked on top of the plate. The soup doesn't have chunky pieces of lobster or crab or anything. The meats largely just in the broth. But don't be fooled by that last sentence, you can taste the lobster and crab in every spoonful. Really yummy! The paella was less than mediocre; the mussels and lobster weren't as meaty. I've tried better paella that's for sure! \n\nThe ambience is really nice and the waiter was extremely pleasant. I just feel like there's better restaurants in the area you can go to. I would only come back here for that soup. And maybe to have a few glasses of wine.
