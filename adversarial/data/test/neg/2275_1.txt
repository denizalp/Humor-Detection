I give this place 2 stars not because of food but because of service. Our server never once smiled and we waited 10-15 mins before she ever greeted the table which should have been a sign of things to come. She walked to the table and never introduced herself and just said what would you like to order. Never asked about drinks or anything. We ordered drinks and an app and got our app before the drink as we watched the drink sit at the side of the bar. We had to ask for napkins and silverware from another server because ours never came around once after she finally dropped our drinks off. Once we got our food from the bartender the server again didn't ask how everything was but the bartender did. The only time the server was on it was time to bring the check. We again sat waiting for her to pick up the check and she never did and we had to walk to the bar as she stood there talking with other co workers. We also witnessed her other table get up and go to the bar and have to ask for things like a refill\/box\/etc. The food was good and cocktail was awesome however when you pay $100 for lunch and service is terrible it makes you never want to go back and encourage others not to as well.
