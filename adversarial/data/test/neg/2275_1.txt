took my daughter here last year to watch some football and to get some wings.  service was great, wings were great.  i normally dont do desert but my daughter ended up ordering something with fried tortias sprinkled with cinamon and chocolate syrup and there were some hot fried cheescake balls that went perfect with the vanilla ice cream it came with.  probably the best desert i ever had.  sorry i dont know the name of the desert, just describe it to them, they'll know.
