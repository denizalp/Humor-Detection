I usually do not write reviews but as a culinary professional. Table service only touched our table once. No thank you, and cold in the approach to customer service. I went in at 2 pm and was forced to wait for a table when the service room was 95% empty. Great atmosphere and great potential, but bar food with poor service. One operator to another retrain your staff.
