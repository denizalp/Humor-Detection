Very crowded local's place in Oakmont with an intimate setting if you want to come out for date night -- I recommend making reservations, even during the week night because of this restaurant's popularity with the locals, it fills up quickly during the week AND weekends.  \nThe Gorgonzola Apple salad was excellent!  The pasta dish with white sauce was excellent!  \nService was excellent!  \nNice restaurant! \nCrowded!  \nWhat would make it a 10:  Tables seem a little too close together with the wait staff and customers coming a little too close at times.  Need a little bit more elbow room. It was winter time and alot of people were carrying their big coats.  \nOverall Score: 9 out of 10
