Hunters Canine is the best!  Our boxer had such high energy we just knew we needed a lot of help!  A year later he is the best companion and the most fun family member!  Many thanks to Chad, Andrew and George!  Kato loves to visit and we just don't do it often enough.  When he returns from boarding it is a reminder of how terrific they are.  Everyone we have talked with at this facility is so informative and we love their calm energy that they bring to this wild member of our family!  Their facilities are bar none, the very best.  Immaculate and comfortable accommodations for Kato when we need to leave him while traveling.  And it is so nice to continue our training during this time.  When it cools we will have to sign up and continue to the next level.  This group is worth every $ that they charged us. Our first visit just watching how calm he was, while they explained their program, was very impressive.  He responded to their calm, gentle way of doing things immediately.  We were so impressed!  We were really relieved to leave him and like most canine parents, scared!  We really overact with our darlings!  Can't wait until the weather heat leaves us and we can sign up for more classes. \nAwesome training and boarding facility. #1
