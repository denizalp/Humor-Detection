Colby was great. He was attentive and made sure we were happy! He is the only reason for this 5 star. The chicken and waffles won at our table. The lamb burger was good not great. And the steak with mushroom salad, our mid rare steak was cooked properly but the arugula didn't do the plate justice ( also the portion of greens was off for the price.)
