I've been here 4 times now and they have been unable to get my order right even one of those times. It's really unfortunate because I was excited that A&W was coming to my neighbourhood, and  I really couldn't be more clear in what I'm ordering... I've expressly described each topping that I want each time and they still somehow manage to get it wrong!! \n\nI'm at a loss. But it's so annoying to get all the way home and see the order made wrong time after time...
