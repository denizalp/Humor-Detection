Visited here while on a weekend trip to Toronto. YUM! Perfect brunch...Would definitely go back!! Had the ham and cheese brioche which was amazing and my husband had eggs with smoked salmon and caviar.   My mouth is watering, just at the thought.   Who cares that they write the menu on a blackboard, the food is amazing!
