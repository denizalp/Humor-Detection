Overall, I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. It was close enough to downtown and the stadium for walking. The staff were very accommodating and the look of the room was very clean, modern and bright. I was not thrilled that the most inexpensive option for parking was $12 per day. One minor thing that was a real pain was the lighting. There are two light switches in the room, one which is for the bathroom and operates a loud fan, the other for the whole room. If you are sharing a room with someone, and you need to use the rest room at night, your only options are to wake them up with the fan, or wake them up by flipping the switch lighting the entire room. Also, one day my hot water was warm at best, but the second day was much better.
