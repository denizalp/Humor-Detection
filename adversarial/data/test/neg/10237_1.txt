I had the Masala burger.  The burger itself was fresh and toppings also fresh.   But the bilun was huge compared to the burger.  Do you remember the old Wendy's commercial?   \"Where's the beef?\"   If they are going to keep the burger size then they need to reduce the bun size.   $10.50 for the burger, fries and a can of pop is a pretty solid value.  Fries were very fresh and home cut.
