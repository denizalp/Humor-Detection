Well I usually like coming to this place but the manager who's working doesn't know how to talk to his employees and it kinda made me not even wanna eat here anymore. He was just being rude to his employees and you can tell that everyone is getting frustrated. I'm pretty sure the mangers name is Brandon but he really doesn't know how to talk to his employees and I literally left outta the restaurant with out my food because they were sticking their fingers in the pizza with no gloves on they do not how to treat their customers.\n\nUpdate review:Brandon actually reached out to me and he offered me a pizza on the House I do greatly appreciate it I guess sometimes people are having bad days
