Pete, the manager, and the technicians spent a good chunk of time diagnosing my car and preparing an estimate for work.  I was all set to do the work, only to then realize that my warranty was not going to cover the work unless I brought the car to a dealership.  Pete didn't charge me anything for the time spent on the car, and was very positive about the whole thing despite my having taken quite a bit of time that morning.  They demonstrated that their concern was for my car.  I had even put the deposit down which would have given him an opportunity to charge a percentage for the refund, but he fully refunded my on the spot which I very much appreciated.
