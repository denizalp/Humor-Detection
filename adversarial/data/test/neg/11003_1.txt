Little gem tucked into a horrible shopping centre. I loved that they had the roasting equipment and fresh beans out in the open, as proof they roast their own coffee. They had plenty of roasts on offer as well as some home made treats in the case. \nI got an iced mocha and a mini cinnamon roll - both were very good. The coffee was very smooth and rich in flavour, not overpowered by milk or chocolate like some espressos can be.\nFor locally sourced, freshly roasted, the prices are your pretty standard Starbucks prices which is great - I'd honestly expect higher. Definitely recommend if you find yourself in the area.
