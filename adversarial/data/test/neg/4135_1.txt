I liked it. Good food. Good beers. Great feeling patio. Really like that they accomodate groups and outings so well in a catered setting. \n\nWe sat on the patio. It was a warm summer night. The sun was in the midst of setting but taking its good 'ol time. I had a lot of food. Started off with a Southern Tier Pumking brew, Chick Paprikash Soup, then some lamb sliders. All very delish. \n\nWe will definitely return for additional dining experiences both inside, outside and at the bar. Cheers!
