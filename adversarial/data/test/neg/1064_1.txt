Met a college buddy today for lunch at the bar!\nHe ordered the shrimp tacos, I did the fish. We then traded each other one. \nThis fish was moist, topped with a nice slaw and creamy guacamole. \nThe shrimp, a bit spicy but tasty. They too had a nice slaw topping. \nBoth were served with black beans, a cilantro rice and spanish rice. Both rices were very flavorful. \nSpeaking of flavor, the trio of sauces and chips they serve you before hand are delicious. The green sauce... I could drink by the gallon! \nService was great and quick... \nDefinitely a place to reccommend to friends who are staying at Mandalay Bay. \nFor locals, its not the easiet place to get into...
