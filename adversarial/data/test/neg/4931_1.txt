Stopped in at 11:45 am on a Tuesday. One person . Empty restaurant. Asked for a booth or table and was told I could only get seating at the bar because the lunch rush was coming. I said I didn't want to sit at the bar. Even though it was empty I was told that was the only seating available for solo patrons. So I left.
