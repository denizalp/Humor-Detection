We stopped in for lunch yesterday and ordered the cedar burger with sweet potato fries and it was terrific. A very nice and friendly bartender took our orders as well as a few Samuel Adams taps. \n\nA great place to visit if visiting Johnson and Wales which is right next door and the double tree hotel in which we stayed.
