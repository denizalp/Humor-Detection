I go here once a week to get my head shaved and my sideburns and goatee lined up. This shop is as good as it gets. I've been to many shops on the west coast while I was in the Navy, and this one is the best shop I have been to. Jackie and Will are skilled, and I mean skilled with the clippers and the straight razors. They are skilled with all types of hair.  They are great people, great atmosphere in the shop and they care. I'm proud to say that this is my barbershop of choice!
