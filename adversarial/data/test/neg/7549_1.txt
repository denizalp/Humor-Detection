I went to have my nails done by Carina and she is an amazing nail technician with a bubbly personality. It's always nice to see her. However when I was paying for the service... they tacked on a hidden fee that they never told me about... shellac removal is $15 so that everyone here knows and is not surprised because it doesn't say that anywhere on their menu. I won't be going back but I thank Carina for beautiful nails.
