I have to start this by saying, I love Starbucks and make the trek down the street almost daily for an afternoon latte. Until today I had no issues with this location however, by the time I walked down the street, I had to use the ladies room and was disgusted by what all I encountered. I have been in bathrooms at concerts and gas stations that were more sanitary. There was urine and feces all over the toilet, the toilet paper rolls were on the floor, the sink was clogged and filled with water, the floors were disgusting and clearly nobody has swept or mopped in there since the place opened. I can only imagine what the back areas look like...
