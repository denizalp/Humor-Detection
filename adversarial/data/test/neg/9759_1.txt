Great location with super friendly staff! Personally served by the Manager, Billy who was very attentive with our food and service! We ordered a cup of the Chicken Potato Soup which was creamy,  chunky, and flavorful. We followed up our meal with the \" most popular item on the menu,\" the Fish and Chips! The three large battered pieces of fish were fresh, very flavorful, and were served on a bed of steak fries with tartar sauce and a lemon Wedge! Such a large portion for the price that I could only eat a third of it but, took the rest home to enjoy later.
