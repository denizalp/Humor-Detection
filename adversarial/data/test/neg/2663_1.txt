Had dinner with some friends went to the bar to get a drink from the bartender and he would not serve us . So the other bartender got our drinks and it was just 2 beer . How hard is 2 beers. We didn't feel welcome what so ever. We waited 15 minutes to get a table. The dinner was good. Spinach & Queso was delicious but it did take a while( 45 minutes) to get our meal.
