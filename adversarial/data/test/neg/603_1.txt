This is pretty nice venue. The back row seats on the bottom level are a bit far from the stage - more of a build out than build up venue. Not much to it inside the theatre itself. Sound quality seemed fine. The outer part of the venue is typical Cosmo style. There's a couple of bars with ok offerings. One the night we were here, there were girls passing out free shots when you walked in.
