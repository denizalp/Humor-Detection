I liked it. A lot.  \nMy husband thought it was little better than Chi Chi's.\nNice family owned and operated business. \nSeating outside. Quiet.  \nGreat margarita.  \nThe best tasting pico de Gallo ever.   I can usually resist chips, but c'mon!  This was awesome.  \nMy fish tacos were delicious. No complaints at all.  Hubs had the mini combo.  It all looked good, but he thought it was just so-so.\nThe price is right,band you can get in without a reservation.
