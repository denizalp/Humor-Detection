The service is quick. \nServers know the menu. \nThe prices are fare. \nStore is very clean and employees as well. \nThe food was right the first time, served in a short time. \nTry the pie! Can't get enough of the cherry. \nI have read plenty of negative posts about this place and they must have read them as well because my experience was not like theirs. \nWill visit this store again.
