I was feeling a little down in the dumps & made an appointment for Reset to come do their thing at my house. I was more than pleased with my experience. My nurse was Christa, she's such a doll. Very knowledgeable & experienced. She answered all my questions & explained everything she was doing as she did it. I will definitely be requesting her when I make another appt with reset.
