well worth the wait. \n\ni had the great fortune to arrive yesterday and discover that they had completely overhauled the menu.  Flavour combinations so thought out that one is left to wonder how many hours, days, and weeks of toil were put into each dish, as each aspect of the meal seemed to easily embrace the other.  Whether the goal was contrast or harmony, it all came together with each bite.\n\nService staff went above and beyond and kept in pace with the wonderful food that was presented to us.  Each member of Ici has a clear goal and that is to ensure that the customer has the dinner experience they came in expecting.  I can't wait to go back.
