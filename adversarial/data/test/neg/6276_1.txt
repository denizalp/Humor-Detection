Aloha! Seriously, If east can meet west all the time, the world would be a better place. \n\nI've heard nothing but awesome things about this place had plans to try it out. And then I saw a $20 Groupon for $40 worth of food. You better believe that I got on that faster than Speedy Gonzalez! Be aware though, If you are using a Groupon, you can't use it on happy hour items! Full priced menu items only. But the menu items are decently priced and you'll leave with a full and happy belly for $40 worth. \n\nService is outstanding here. Our server always checked up on us to see if we needed anything else. There was a gentleman that always checked up on us too, I think he is the owner. He told the sushi chef to fix my boyfriend and me Tensai Hamachi Shooters on the house! The hamachi is mixed with a spicy ponzu sauce and some truffle oil. Win!\n\nIt was cold outside so we ordered some hot tea. You have a choice from the green, apple and mint. My boyfriend had the hot apple tea. Aroma of this one is fantastic and it tastes just like granny smith apples. \n\nAnd now, the food. Oh my my my my! \n\n- Spicy Tuna Crackers: Ahi tuna in a special sauce on wasabi rice crackers. The crackers were quite interesting. A zing from the wasabi is a nice touch to the tuna.\n- Yellowtail jalapeno: 5 pieces of thick yellowtail sashimi in a yuzu cilantro sauce. Garnished with a jalapeno and a sliver of cucumber. The sauce didn't overpower the fish. The jalapenos were really spicy when we went. But nonetheless, this was yummy. \n- 808 Tapas Nasu Fries: Panko crusted eggplant with wasabi lime dipping sauce. I can have 10 orders of these to myself! Thick eggplant slices, they don't skimp out. Piping hot and the cooling sauce is the perfect combination. My new guilty pleasure for sure. \n-Fish tacos: Panko crusted tilapia with blood orange slaw. The are $2 a piece during happy hour! Delicious. Slaw is tangy and the fish is perfectly cooked. \n-808 Tapas Crab Stack: veggies, mango and snow crab in a ginger lime dressing. This was super refreshing. I loved the sweetness of the mango and the crunchiness of the veggies. The server brought this out as a literal stack - all the ingredients were in a tower-like form. The server then mashed our stack into a mixed salad.\n- Saikyo Zuke: Broiled black cod that has been marinated in miso for 2 days. So flavorful and succulent! \n- Green Tea Tempura Ice Cream. Deep fried ball of green tea goodness! Served with whipped cream and a raspberry garnish. Perfect note to end the meal. \n\nI can't wait to go back! Everything about this place is so good, it makes me want to do the hula!
