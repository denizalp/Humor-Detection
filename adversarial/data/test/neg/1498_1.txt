Great experience, good service, chill atmosphere. Staff was very attentive, made sure our hookah was just right. Have just tried the hookah, but will have to try the food options next time. Very nice evening, not too loud or crowded. Impressed by the professionalism of the staff and the cleanliness of the venue. Have been looking for the best option in Vegas for a while, and this seems to be it.
