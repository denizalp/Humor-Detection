Don't be mislead but the unattractive exterior of this place.  It's a solid stop for Mexican food.  I've been here a few times and really can't say a bad thing about it other than it's a bit tough to get in and out of from the parking lot since it is situation at a light on a rather busy South Boulevard.\n\nThe service is always good and they have solid menu choices.  The whole place is very similar to any other middle of the road Mexican joint you've been to.  My suggestion is go in without any real high expectations and you'll be fine.
