I have been looking into treatments to better my skin for my wedding. LaserAway (Scottsdale) was an amazing start to my journey. Ashely was kind, helpful and understanding while I explained my needs. After my first treatment I am seeing results and will absolutely be scheduling more sessions. The other staff were wonderful! They answered any questions I had, and walked me step by step through my treatment. Go visit! It is worth it!
