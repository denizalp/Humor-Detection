Dr. Weingarten and his staff are great!  Came in for a tumor in my throat and he diagnosed and performed the removal in about two weeks time.  I've been dealing with this for almost 8 years and in two weeks he was doing something about it.  I'm thankful for him being able to remove it when he did.  If I would have waited it would have been worse then what it was. Would recommend to anyone.
