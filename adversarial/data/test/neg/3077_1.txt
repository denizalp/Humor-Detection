Had my aftermarket exhaust put on here. Leslie and his crew are a legit bunch of guys that know their BMWS and pretty much all cars like the back of their hands. \n\nVery clean shop, very knowledgable staff and very quick and clean work. \n\nWould recommend these guys as reputable, honest shop. \n\nWill use them again in my future car endeavours!
