They have a lot of gluten free options!!!  The pizza is very good, we got a larger and still had leftovers. We also got French from that had cheese and bacon on them. The cheese was actual cheese and not the junk nacho cheese. Very god service!  And they have a lot of beer selections some of which at gluten free and they carry Gluutney's baked goods for dessert. I will be going back if not they deliver!
