I had brake service done at a different shop that was in this location, so when I had problems 10 months later, imagine my disgust when I found out that the other shop was gone.  No ability to get things straightened out or solved when I learned that I paid for services not received (new rotors).  Luckily for me, however, Meineke and Frank helped me through the difficult situation.\n\nFrank worked with me on solutions, and even was able to track down where my brake pads were purchased from by the other shop and get them covered under warranty.  I felt he went above and beyond, showed me clearly what the charges would be for the work needed (new rotors for real this time!) and never pressured me.  My car was well taken care of and the work was finished when promised.  \n\nAs a woman, it's tough sometimes with auto shops because you always feel like you might be taken advantage of.  I can honestly say that this place has earned my business and I will be a repeat customer.\n\nTip: Make sure you check out the website in advance for coupons and special offers.
