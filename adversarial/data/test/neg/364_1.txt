Enjoyed dinner with wife and daughter before watching KA. Favorites were rock shrimp tempura, chef\"s choice tempura, and kinako tiramisu (reinvented and delicious). We also tried and loved the tentaka kuni sake...I would love to buy some for home!. Shibuya roll and and Fish and Chips were both good, but not as stellar as the other items.\nService was truly excellent, with all wait staff addressing me by name.
