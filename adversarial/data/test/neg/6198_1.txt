This attorney is the reason we lost the case! My son is forced to be with his abusive father because Emily did not fight for us! Her office was nice but she did not know what she was doing!!! I do not recommend anyone hire this person. She over bills and has her associates work on cases and double bills! How does she have a license to practice law? This cereal box attorney will take you for everything you own and you will still lose your case.\n\n\nUpdate since last post: This attorney clearly can't even recognize when her clients are unhappy with her services. I don't know who Jennifer is but this attorney seems to think I am her.
