Right now  I am eating the best pita I have ever had in my entire life. It's still warm from the oven, fluffy inside and slightly crunchy outside. I'm dipping it in some of Momo's smoky home made babaganouj (forget that eggplant-flavoured mayonnaise crap they sell in supermarkets) and some fresh tabouli.\n\nMost people know Momo's for the restaurant out front, but around the corner on Robert, they've just opened up a teensy bakery and grocery store that's packed to the rafters with delicious homemade Lebanese food and fresh-baked bread, pastries and pies. They have takeaway containers of dishes like lamb curry, chicken molokhia (chicken cooked in a sauce made of a spinach-like vegetable), beef and veggie stew, fresh yogurt, lentil rice, dips... everything you could want for a lunchtime feast or a healthy takeaway dinner. Plus it's cheap: I got a chicken molokhia (large enough for two with some sides), a tub of babaganouj, tub of tabouli, a fresh pita and a Middle Eastern soft drink for around $12. They also sell all kinds of imported Lebanese products, jars of pickles, sauces, etc etc etc. The place is a GOLDMINE. I work nearby and used to be restricted to a Subway, two crappy pizza places, or a spectacularly bad Chinese for my lunch options. No longer! I am thrilled about Momo's bakery and grocery--long may they prosper!
