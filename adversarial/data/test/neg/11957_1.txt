Just went her for the first time Sunday. I added a salad bar plate to go with my meal and it was $4.01. That's crazy. The salad bar wasn't stocked and the lettuce was brownish. Even if I wanted more salad or to get my $4 dollars worth they only give you one small plate.  Definitely not worth it. The kids chicken fingers were all breading and really dry and my burger wasn't anything special.
