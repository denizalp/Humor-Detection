Another review site had this as the top restaurant in town so we decided to try it.  It is very good.  It is very expensive.  The waitress pushed the alcohol consistently, but politely.  We don't drink so it was wasted effort -- I should have been blunt that we don't drink so she was save her effort.  \n\nI'd go here again if it were a special occasional and I'm ok dropping $50 per person.
