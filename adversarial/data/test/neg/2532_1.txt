I had a really good experience with Bexx. She is completely transforming my tattoo  rework. It is a large piece and she is really moving along quickly and creating a tattoo worth showing off. Bexx also is light handed and doesn't grind the needle to the skin. It still hurts but leaves little to no blood or swelling. She also was very personable. She kept the conversation going enough to keep me distracted from the pain but also was very professional. I am looking forward to my next appointment with her and would recommend anyone to her shop.
