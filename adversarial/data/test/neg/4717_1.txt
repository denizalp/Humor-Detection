Pizza isn't bad. I mean we all know what we're getting when we go to little Caesars. But the reality is this is a decent pizza at an affordable price. \n\nI gave three stars for two reasons. One:  I ordered onions added to this and there were none. And B:  the cut of the pizza really off target. \n\nWait time was about 10 minutes. Not a big deal. \n\nI see a lot of comments about having to wait for a hot n ready but I I do t think waiting a short bit is a terrible thing. It was hot and fresh. I'm ok with waiting for that.
