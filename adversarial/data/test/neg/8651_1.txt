BEWARE UNREAKiFiX!!! I wish I could rate this place 0 Stars I received the most horrible experience here. I brought my Galaxy S6 in to this location for a cracked LCD Repair. They quoted me $234 which was pretty outrageous but I needed the phone fixed so I went ahead with it. I went to pick it up 4 hours later and immediately noticed that the outer frame of the phone had a lot of dings and scratches on it, which was odd because when I brought it into the store it was absolutely flawless, considering it's only about a month old and has always been kept in a case. I proceeded to tell the manager my problem but he insisted that the phone was that way when I brought it in, as if I didn't know my own cell phone! After arguing with the manager for about 15 minutes it came down to basic he said\/she said situation (the managers words) so I paid for the phone and left very angry and unsatisfied which they didn't seem to care! This was not the end of my problems either, once I got home I plugged the phone into the charger and it would no longer charge so I then began to inspect the cellphone more carefully which is when I noticed that they also did not even put the screen back on properly! I was able to put my fingernail between the frame of the phone and the actual screen. Needless to say I ended up with a way more broken phone than i did previous to it being in their possession. So i ended up getting my money back & their LCD part removed. I expected a way better job for $200+ and way better customer service than I received. As a warning take my advice & take your business and money elsewhere. If you do decide to use this company take pictures of your device before handing it over to these people.
