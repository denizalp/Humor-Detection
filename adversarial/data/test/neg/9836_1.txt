Wow so many beers! We went for dinner one night and were impressed at how gorgeous and huge the space is inside. We were overwhelmed at how many beer choices there were.\n\n  For food I highly recommend the pretzel appetizer and the shrimp po'boy served in Challah bread. Absolutely delicious, food is made with attention to detail! Great food,  friendly and quirky staff and beautiful belgian bike decor. Nice work bringing it to Madison Milwaukee!
