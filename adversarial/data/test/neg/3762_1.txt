It's great finally finding a personal trainer who truly believes in me & my goals. I'm so glad that personal trainer is Angela!  I love that she cares about my progress & ensures that I stay on track. She pushes me out of my comfort zone each workout which helps build on my confidence & I truly appreciate her for that. The atmosphere at Mint Body is friendly & welcoming.  I have a new found for Mint!
