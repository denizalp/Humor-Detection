Not good dim sum and worst service in GTA. The steam carrot cake was very rubbery like it was reheat\/left-over food...etc.In terms of service, four of us with a baby were seated in the centre of the room. After sitting down, we were told to squeenze cause we blocked dim sum carts. They could'd hv guided us to a corner table insead of a closet table. Also, not everything on the menu was avaible. They wouldn't tell you what was not available when you ordered. Once ordered, they simply told you they couldn't cancel the order and forced you to order something else . Felt like we were ripped off. Never gonna come back again
