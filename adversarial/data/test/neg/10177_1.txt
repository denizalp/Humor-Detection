I'm taking 2 stars off. The BF loves the Honey layer cake and dropped by to pick some up on the way home from work. \n\nHe started eating one, and it had EGGSHELL. You should never be that careless to have it get into the food. It was a small piece, but big enough to see. He didn't eat the rest of it. \n\nWe still had a few so he thought to try another one. It was off tasting when he took a bite. I tried and it was spoiled.\n\nI ate the last one which he would not touch, I found a Eggshell in mine too. \n\nI notice their bags are Providence Bakery. I have seen this at L'Epidor Bakery inside Greenland too.....so I'm assuming they're all affiliated? One disappointing connection- we also found eggshell in the honey layer cake. WHAT THE HELL. \n\nThats his favorite thing and the reason why we kept coming back is that it was good here....\n\nNow we are unsure about Crown.
