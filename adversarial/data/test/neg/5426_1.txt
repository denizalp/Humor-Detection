I've only been here once but I must say it was a delicious experience! Although I felt they put wayyy tooo much mustard on my pastrami sandwich, my little sister loved their bbq philly, and the garlic fries were divine!\n\nI'll definitely be going back to try something new on the menu...we'll see if my review changes ;)
