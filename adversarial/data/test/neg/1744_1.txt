I really love smiths fuel centers everywhere. Smiths gives great incentives for shopping at their grocery stores by offering huge discounts on gas. When shopping for a family of six I can easily get a dollar off each gallon in the month. Also, often times I can just pull up and buy simple items that I don't want to stand in line inside the grocery store for like chips, waters, and even wood for the fire pit. Or sometimes automotive related items like oil, wiper fluid or antifreeze! I highly recommend this place,a real neighborhood favorite!
