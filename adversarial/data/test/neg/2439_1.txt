Great spot in a part of town that you wouldn't expect to find a great spot. They have a lot of specialty nights, including comedy, poetry, games, karaoke. My favorite cocktail was the Kamakazee. It's also a good place if you're into hard-to-find Japanese whisky such as Nikka.\n\nUpdate: our locked bikes were stolen outside the bar. Obviously, not the bar's fault. But the part of town it's in still needs to clean itself up.
