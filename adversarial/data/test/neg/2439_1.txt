I have been a fan of Coquette on Facebook for some time but had yet to try them until a month ago. They are located in the new Triangle\/MOCA area, which as undergone serious revitalization in the last 2 years. The space has its own parking lot, which is a major plus in that area.\n\nThe best part is that beyond the amazing confections they also offer beverages, focusing on two of my faves - French champagne and Belgian beer! It's great that you can sample high-end Champagne by the glass at a reasonable price, which usually would require buying an entire bottle for the experience.\n\nThis was the perfect place to grab a treat on a Sunday afternoon, but I would love to return here for desert on a weekend evening. Would be a wonderful place to meet up with girlfriends, too!
