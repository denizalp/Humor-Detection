In college there was an UNO Pizzeria not far from campus. I have fond memories of amazing pizzas and the famed chocolate chip cookie in a deep dish pan. UNO was the best, especially since Old Chicago put too much whipped cream in places it didn't need to be. \n\nHowever, if this is the state of UNO, I can see why it has closed in multiple cities. The spinach artichoke dip was mediocre at best. The signature UNO pizza was lacking in toppings and size. AND the signature birthday cookie is no longer! Now, the birthday treat is one of their mini desserts and I could find a better brownie in the Hostess aisle at Target.\n\nBesides the food, service was really great! They were attentive and friendly. If only the food hasn't had me wishing we had chosen Old Chicago instead.
