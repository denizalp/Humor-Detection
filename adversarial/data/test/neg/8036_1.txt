Good wings. But be prepared to pay extra for ranch celery...really anything sloppy ex sauce.anything custom. Service..ok. Close early so not a place to chill after like 1030. And owners are always hovering over the bartenders so if you have more than a couple drinks you will be cut off. Good points....it's clean. Food is good. Andre is awesome.  Tonya is amazing to her customers.
