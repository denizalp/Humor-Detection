First time Home Buyer here, and was recommended to work with Will M. by my outstanding realtors. Will took the time to show me what all he's looking for, what looks right and what doesn't. He explained how to identify things that could start to be going bad, how to fix items before they become an issue and numerous other preventative maintenance items to help save my family money. \n\nBeing in the military, having a fellow veteran show me the ropes was very comforting and seeing the commitment he still has for his job left me knowing nothing had been missed. I recommend Home Pride Inspections to anyone who needs an inspection done right and efficiently the first time!
