Such a cuteeeeee cafe that makes me feel right at home! Love the wooden decor, plants placement and booth seats where friends can just chat and catch up and forget about the time. This place reallllly has a \"homey\" vibe... To put that into perspective for you, The table next to us were actually painting their nails! I know right! Lol. I'm actually kind of glad that sweet o clock next door didn't have the green tea shaved ice available (because the girl that knows how to make it is on vacation... Wtf?) so I was able to discover this place. We ordered the rice cake shaved ice and green tea Oreo shaved ice. Both were really tasty and not overly sweet. HOWEVER, the ice was not fluffy and snowy enough. They were chunky and I actually felt like I was eating chunks of ice... Not good :( When you are near the end of the dessert, there's not much flavour to it left! Wish they could've drenched the ice in condensed milk or something! I mean, I know I'm eating an ice dessert but I actually don't like the feeling of eating crunchy ice! Having said that, I would still come back to try their other Korean style desserts.
