Total wait time in the lobby was about an hour. Staff was nice. Once I was actually seen, the doctor is yelling in another language on the phone in one of the rooms. (Did not put me at ease.)After 30 minutes in my \"waiting room\" The Dr. barges in and was aggressive when answering my questions. He didn't really seem to take in what I was saying. And based off asking me my previous experience just prescribed me something similar? Not sure if I was properly helped like I could have been. I won't be coming back to this location.
