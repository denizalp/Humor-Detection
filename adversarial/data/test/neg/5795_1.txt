Whenever I am in Arizona I always make it a point to stop here for dinner. Granite I always thought it was called Lincoln Louies so I still call it that haha. I do not recommend the chicken pad Thai but everything else is fantastic. They always have great drink options... And have a great pour. Try the Japanese whiskey it's fantastic. Here are some points to remember:\n\n- pad Thai no bueno\n- General lings was good; yum; very good! \n- plain chicken and rice is a good choice\n- vegan plate was okay \n- lettuce wraps are great\n- kikori whiskey is white (weird)\n- uncle fu is okay\n- Fried rice with ginger garlic soy is the way to go (get a side next time)
