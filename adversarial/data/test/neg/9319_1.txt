I happened upon this place via UberEats one Saturday night. Ordered the fajitas and was pleasantly surprised by how good they were. The vegetables were good perfectly and the entree had a nice charred flavor that I like. \n\nI have ordered a few additional times through UberEats, but only after I called to ask them to become available on the app. I would continue ordering from them, but I'm not going to keep calling to ask them to turn on the app.
