Indian food has quickly become one of my favorite foods, but I have to say I was somewhat disappointed in Tamarind Savoring India.  I have been to Tamarind in Oakland numerous times and it has always been delicious so I was excited to try the Tamarind in Greentree.  The Tikki Masala I ordered was not spicy and the sauce was way too watery.  Also I was disappointed in the portion size, there were probably 4-5 pieces of chicken.  Where they redeemed themselves was in the naan, the garlic naan was superb!\n\nOverall, it wasn't a terrible experience, but it did not live up to the expectations I have from going to Tamarind in Oakland so for now I will stay in Oakland when I am craving indian.
