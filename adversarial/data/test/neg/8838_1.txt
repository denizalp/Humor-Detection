I had lunch alone here last week.  It was a tasty chicken pesto lasagna.  I returned with three coworkers today.  We enjoyed our meal but the whole group nearly walked out when we saw on the menu that they do not split bills - one bill per table.  We discussed this with our server but she only would agree to two equally split bills.  The four of us were on a business trip, the company covers our meals if we use the company credit card.  Only two of us had any cash.  Anyway, we each teamed up to pay for one coworker's bill, knowing we would have trouble getting our company to reimburse us.   It was a real downer that ruined what should have been a nice lunch.  We could have sat at separate tables to get around this silly and unfriendly policy, but that would be like adding insult to injury.
