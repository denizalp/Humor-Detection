Every cabby we spoke to suggested The Peppermill, the food was awesome and our experience was something we will never forget! From the super awkward, host who seemed to be on something to the super adorable busser, David we had a blast even before our food came. I ordered the chicken fried steak which was great but too heavy to eat in 100 degree weather, and my friend ordered the sirloin with the garlic mushrooms. I thought she messed up for a minute, I would never ever order steak in a diner but it was amazing! Perfectly cooked and seasoned, I was green with\nfood envy. Then it got real interesting, an older couple was sat in the booth in front of us, and the gentlemen was dressed kinda like a thug. Aka thug nasty... was the highlight of our trip. A year later we still talk and laugh about him like we know him, if anyone does know him can you tell him I'm looking for him?! I just want him to be real with us.
