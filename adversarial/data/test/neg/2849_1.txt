Had high expectations from the reviews here. Left feeling extremely underwhelmed. We got the uni shooter (not much uni taste), yuzu roll (it was alright), uni, hotate and o-toro nigiri (meh) and the $50 omakase (not worth it at all). Felt like I could just go to an ayce and leave with the same feeling. Apparently they're the same owners as Japango which I enjoyed more. \n\nThey give you boxed uni in the omakase but fresh uni when you order a la carte (which was much better). Overall, I would not return.
