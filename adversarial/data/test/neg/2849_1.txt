I have to say right off the bat...the service was BAD. I even felt bad, because it was just a mess. Very nice wait staff though. \n\nThe food was very nice.  Our appetizer was the salon sampler.  I'm new to eating fish, but I enjoyed each item. For my main course, I had the 8oz New Zealand filet with blue cheese topping. Yum! Also a side of creamy mashed potatoes and a wonderful wedge salad that was very fresh! \n\nI had to try the bread pudding for dessert...it was good, but I didn't want to finish it. It was very delicate and refined. I was hoping for something a bit more classic. \n\nThe food was moderately priced for a steakhouse and pretty decent quality. The drinks really bumped the bill up at our table by quite a bit (6 cocktails total). I'd recommend sharing a bottle or two at the table rather than pricey cocktails.
