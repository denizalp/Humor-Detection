Not happy. We could not see from our seats not to mention people standing. The venue was not good for a showcase big time dancer like her. There were no screens with this large of a venue which makes it hard to see anything unless you have super close seats. I suggest if you go, bring binoculars or get seats in the center close to the stage. I did enjoy the lobby of jlos clothes. This is a venue I would never go to again in order to be able to see and enjoy a concert. Super sad. I hope her team realizes this and  understands. Love to Jlo and her team
