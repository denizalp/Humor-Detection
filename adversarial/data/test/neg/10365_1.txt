This is one of my fav spots! All the staff is friendly and I always get great service.. Prices are really reasonable so I don't quite understand the person who said it was expensive. I also think Tammy is awesome. This is the second place I have been where she worked and have always had a great experience with her! \nThe burning roll is awesome!
