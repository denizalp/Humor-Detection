Barrio catered the wedding rehearsal for our daughter and son-in-law in June.  FABULOUS.  It was a tough call as to what was better and every dish was practically licked clean.  Best, absolute best, guacamole I have ever tasted.  \n\nThe young man that came and set up was very very nice, did a great job, made sure everything was properly arranged and made a point to tell us that he had already received his tip and wouldn't take the additional tip I tried offering him.
