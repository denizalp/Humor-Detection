We live in fountain hills, and our favorite place to go. We sit at the bar but when people are in town, and get a table, the service is slow. Went to their DC ranch location and got their OMG chicken sandwich. No where near the same!! We were so disappointed! Food not the same!  Don't put the same veggies in and sauce not the same! We will stick with ASG here in town. You ROCK!!
