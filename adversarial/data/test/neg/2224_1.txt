Loved the food ( lots of variety) would give 5 stars for the food...but the service was bad...the waitress literally threw the plates on our table when we were sitting...smiling at customers may be too far a reach but can avoid showing rude faces.. I mean we pay to eat good food...\nNever coming back again due to bad service.. Would not recommend...
