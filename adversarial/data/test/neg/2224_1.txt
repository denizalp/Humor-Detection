The customer service here is terrible. Slow in the restaurant, slow in the drive thru. Half the time they don't have a featured menu item. My family and I have tried this Panera three times and it only seems to get worse. This place recently opened so clearly there is a leadership issue. Upper management should consider replacing the GM. I really wish Paradise Bakery didn't sell out.
