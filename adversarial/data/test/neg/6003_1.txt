Visiting Toronto as a tourist from the States and love to try local coffee shops. This place is gold on my tourist treasure map! Comic book store espresso bar. Quiet on a Tuesday morning - genuinely friendly staff, great decor, great people watching and really different drinks. I love places that don't take themselves too seriously. I got The Donkey Kong - hot coconut mocha latte. On point!
