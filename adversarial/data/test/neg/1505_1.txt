Sustainable seafood restaurant. In Vegas. Yes we can! Very proud and honored to go to this place at Mandalay Bay from time to time. Rick Moonen is a great chef, with a respectable philosophy about what he's doing. I had the chance to attend a meeting where he spoke about the way he works, and believe me, I could hear him talk for hours.\nAnd the food is amazing. I mean, all of it. And if you go there, do not miss the upper bar \"RX Boiler Room\", where mixology is brought to an art.
