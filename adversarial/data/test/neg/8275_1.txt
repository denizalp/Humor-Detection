I came here wanting to eat Dim sum for brunch. Nothing really stood out to me to be different from any other dim sum place that I've gone to. However I did love their coconut pudding for dessert. The dishes are somewhat overpriced, but what do you expect, IT'S VEGAS! The service was always great though, I would recommend making a reservation because there is the occasional line that I've run into a couple of times. I would say that the portions are somewhat small so if you expect to be stuffed after your meal, you might want to look to eat somewhere else. Overall, my experience at RED 8 has never failed. What I expected is what i got. Nothing bad, but nothing like oh this restaurant deserves the James Beard Award.
