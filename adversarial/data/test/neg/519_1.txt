The ambiance is what I envision old Las Vegas to be - very casual\/relaxed! We had the focaccia sandwich and the peppermill burger, and both were great! I highly recommend either. We also came a bit later in the evening so that we could enjoy their 9-11 happy hour, which has many options for food and drinks.\n\nThe staff was very friendly and helpful! I highly recommend stopping by if you're in the Las Vegas area.
