Big disappointment and I would even say a scam... We paid a LOT of money and he basically doesn't show up. He was good with the dog when he was there.. However the second we pre-paid for a \"6 month program\" that he aggressively sold us on promising \"an amazing dog\" he disappears, doesn't respond, comes up with a lot of excuses and overall drama. We have never gotten a refund of the money. It's been many months now..just empty promises. When we talked to other dog trainers to find a new one two of them actually independently (and without us mentioning K9 Dojo\/him) asked if it happened to be K9 Dojo we were dealing with as they had other clients now with exactly the same experience as us!
