This actually deserves zero stars because this repair shop did not do any repairs. I took a pair boots where the insoles were coming lose to glue them back. When I picked the boots up I checked and both insoles were still peeling. The man said there was nothing he could do and so now I have to find a new shop to fix my boots. The only good thing is that he had the decency not to charge me. Seriously though? How hard is it to put some glue on the bottom of a pair of insoles. Ridiculous!
