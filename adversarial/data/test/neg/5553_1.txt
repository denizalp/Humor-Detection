Best sushi in Toronto by far.  I'd been wanting to come by over a year and we finally made it for my birthday.  We got the $120 omakase that includes sashimi.  The dining experience was a very relaxed and intimate 2 hours.  We started with the beautiful sashimi platter.  We loved the crab and lobster, both were so sweet.  Next was an appetizer that I really enjoyed, salmon roe on top of some rice with two kinds of uni.  Then rare seasonal blue firefly squid in miso with seaweed was so delectable and delicious and tender!  The roe were like boba bursting with juice.  The unis were both delicious.  Then the 15 pieces of sushi.  Standouts among the amazing selection were the Hokkaido scallop, ocean trout (so oily and good!), there was a smoked fish that was delicious.  Man so many delicious pieces I could eat this over and over.  It ended with tamago and some green tea matcha ice cream with red beans.  We hadn't had an omakase like this since Nakazawa in NYC two years ago.  We were very full at the end (and I'm a big eater).  I'd go again in a heartbeat!
