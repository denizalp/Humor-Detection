From reading all the reviews here before I went, I wasn't sure what to expect regarding the many donut flavors. To clarify for others who might have share this confusion, here's how it works: they appear to have three daily donut flavors that rotate through (and are constantly being replenished throughout the day), plus a cinnamon roll thing (which may or may not be a staple).  When I visited, the daily flavors were ginger, citron, and orange sugar.  Naturally, we had to try all three.  They have a brilliant pricing scheme such that the donuts get progressively less expensive the more you buy (1 for $1.75, 2 for $3, 6 for $8).  Six donuts it is! We weren't able to agree on which one was our favorite, but of the three, only the ginger one wasn't impressive (it wasn't bad, its flavor just wasn't very strong).  \n\nMy friends spoke well of the little cinnamon rolls too.  I tried one of the hot dogs (all of which are quite reasonably priced at 1 for $4.75 or 2 for $9), the \"bon ami \/ bahn mi\" with pickled daikon, fish caramel sauce, a red sauce and cilantro).  There is a veggie hot dog option too, plus a smoked meat one (3 choices total).\n\nThe only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is the chai latte. As others here have mentioned, it's unimpressive (and I would even say disappointing): for $4, you get a small french-press type cylinder of tea that is barely spiced.  When you could have a hot dog for $4.75, or several donuts for that price, paying $4 for a little not-too-flavorful tea is a bummer.\n\nAs others have also mentioned, the ambiance is really cool. There are old school traincar-style leather booths, a tool box of donuts, and really friendly staff.  I'll be back!
