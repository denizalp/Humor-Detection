Went for a fancy dinner here with a friend. The food was top notch.  I had the drunken chicken with gnocchi, which was out of this world flavourful. My friend had the sea scallops and risotto, which was also great. They have a great selection of specialty cocktails that are a little pricey but delicious.  The raspberry and basil martini was on point. The decor is very vintage and elegant. My only complaint was the service was very slow. We waited forever to get a second drink and later our bill, though our server was nice just not attentive. Overall,  I would definitely come here again. Great food and ambiance, well worth the price.
