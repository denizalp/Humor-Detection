I love Juicy Couture and the sales people at this store are super friendly.  We came in when they were closing and the urged us to stay until we were done shopping: \"take your time, really!\"  I felt like such a movie star. :-)  I hurried regardless because these people need to go home.  I had a sort of personal shopper who walked with me and radioed the back when I wanted to try on this or that in my size.  I got a few items and as usual I'm super happy with them (pretty and great quality).
