Oh Holy Deliciousness!  This charming little place has made it to my favorites list with just one visit! The atmosphere is lively and comfortable as well as romantic and a little elegant. Think candlelit dining room and bar, chandeliers, and comfy chairs. There is a nice outdoor dining patio as well. We had dinner at the bar which we enjoyed even better than if we had a table in the dining room. The customer service from the minute you walk in the door was phenomenal! The bartenders were very knowledgeable in their trade as well as the restaurant's menu items. Keith was a master at directing us on the house specialties for drinks as well as food.  For the meal itself, we decided to do several of the small plates rather than two entrees. \n\nOur meal: \nBuratta with truffle oil - delishly rich\nPork Belly with Kimchi and udon noodle - the combination of flavors was amazing\nShort Ribs on a biscuit - (yes, we had pork belly and biscuits in the same sitting - don't judge!) this dish was devine\nApple upside down cake with pistachio ice cream - my husband says this is the best dessert he's had in a while\n\nI can't wait to go back for some of the items I didn't get to....we'll opt for the bar again, it was so much more fun!
