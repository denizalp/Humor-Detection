Waitresses were dressed in small underoos which was a little much but whatever. The margaritas were delicious and strong, especially the one with the upsidedown brewski. I also had the skinny margarita and it was alright. They have a good happy hour menu. Atmosphere is meant to look badass with black paint and skulls. We sat on patio and people watched everyone on busy Mill Street. Some punk tried to smoke a cig next to us and it was blowing my way. I had to tell him to book it. Overall though, enjoyable place filled with college aged students and adults alike. If I lived in Tempe, I'd be back again and again.
