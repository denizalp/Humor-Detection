Great food and good service. The fries with aji were awesome. Carne asada tacos were good. Neat little trendy spot to meet up with friends and where else can you get tacos and pancakes in one place so a great place to go if you have little ones. Would be better if they served a variety of hot sauces to go with the tacos.
