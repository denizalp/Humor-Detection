Not impressed. First visit was last night and food was delivered at a tepid temperature. The cauliflower was actually cold to the touch. My dinner was delivered first and then we waited for my 2 companion meals to be brought to the table. Didn't have too long of a wait but there were no other customers even in the restaurant so really no excuses for not serving entire table at one time and the timing in the kitchen should have been better. Not impressed. Won't be back.
