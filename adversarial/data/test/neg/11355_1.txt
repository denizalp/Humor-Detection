Ive been to this bakery\/ restaurant about 30 times. I love the concept of a French bakery.The quiche and croissants are five stars.Anything I ate was five stars. So if you're hungry I suggest the Quiche or another daily special. One friend likes the grits. On a lighter appetite, the croissant or an amazing muffin. \n\nThe coffee.....well, I am not happy with the flavor. Too bitter. I enjoy espresso,cappuccino, drip coffees, and usually the strong flavors. I have tried their cappuccino, americano, drip and decaf cappuccino,drip and pour overs. Nothing makes me warm and fuzzy. Granted, I am a coffee snob, so take my judgement with a grain of salt. Please try this wonderful place!
