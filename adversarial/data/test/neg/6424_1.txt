I've been going to above all for the past four years, and nowhere else.  I don't even live in Wexford anymore, but I wait until I'm home on my breaks to get my hair done here because it's the best experience I've ever had.  I'm really picky about how my hair is done, and since I've been going here, I've never had one problem...in fact, my hair dresser goes above and beyond what I expect, it's almost like she can read my mind! I've gotten many services done here, including hair cut and color, waxing, and spray tans. All of them have been exceptional. Prices may be kind of expensive but you definitely get above and beyond what you pay for here. I no longer trust anyone else with my hair and I strongly recommend checking this place out. It's amazing.
