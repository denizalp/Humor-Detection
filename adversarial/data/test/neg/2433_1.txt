Omgosh this place is so so good. The food is delicious! And the staff is so friendly and they honestly appreciate their customers. I've been coming here for the past year, and I've never had a bad experience. Definitely try the spicy orange chicken especially for lunch, they have awesome lunch and dinner specials.
