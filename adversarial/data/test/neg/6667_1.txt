I originally scheduled an eye exam with Visionworks but being the yelper I am, I figured that I should search more in depth for a place that stood out. In my opinion, J Crimi stood out with averaging of 5 stars across the board. So I called to schedule an eye appointment, Jim scheduled it on the phone and he was able to fit me in within the next day. \n\nIt is in a small shopping center right next to US Bank and as I walked in the environment was beautiful, the couches and display of the numerous variety of frames stood out to me. A lady walked in before I did and although Jim (the owner) was talking with her he greeted me instantly and told me he'd get started with my paperwork to start my eye exam with Dr. Helmick - an independent Optometrist. I filled out paperwork and Jim was very kind enough to offer my fiance, and I a bottled of water. I waited for less than 5 minutes and Dr. Helmick took me in for my exam. He was very nice and calm with me because I have very sensitive eyes so testing the pressure of my eyes and aligning my face so he could take a closer look of my eyes took a while. I really appreciated the patience! Dr. Helmick explained step-by-step what he was doing and why he was doing it. I guess he seen how concentrated I tried to be when reading the letters on the wall and he ended up reminding me to relax, and to not strain myself in trying to read the letters. If I felt like the letters were too blurry then he'd continue to test out multiple lenses until I was very much comfortable with my vision. After taking down notes and diagnosing my eye results he gave me the opportunity to ask him questions. From there he gave the paperwork to Jim and Jim helped me pick the frames I felt comfortable with. \n\nMy total was about $187 for my lenses, frames, and eye exam - eye exam being $75 of that total. They do not accept insurance so it is not a bad price for an eye exam. However, I strongly feel like the amount I paid is worth every single penny, Jim promises repairs for free without any hesitation. WE NEED MORE BUSINESS OWNERS LIKE JIM! \n\nJim said he would be able to finish my glasses by the next day, which was quick! Usually some places do not have your glasses ready until two weeks after the exam day. My fiance had bought multiple frames from J Crimi for the past two years and he loves it, and I am happy to experience a consistent service from this place. It is rare to find an eyewear shop that genuinely cares for your needs. Jim and Dr. Helmick you just respectfully earned yourself a customer for life! I highly recommend this place. I refuse to attend any other place except here at J Crimi.
