Horrible business practice. I had booked an appointment for  last week. I had to call last week and reschedule it for 11:30am today due to a death in my family last week. I called at 9am today to confirm the time with them after waiting on hold for almost 10 minutes they told me that their computers were down and to try calling back later because they could not tell me what time it was. The reason for me calling was because I had never got a confirmation call on my appointment a few days before. As I was on my way to my appt, I called again to confirm. I was due to arrive at 11:07am and my appointment was at 11:30am. I talked with them at 10:59am and they told me that I couldn't come because I had to be there at 11:00am for paperwork. I was NEVER told this information when I had rescheduled this appointment. I was not even late to my appt. 23 minutes would have been more than enough time to complete the 5 pages of paperwork on time. I actually tried to print out the paperwork to complete it before I came but it did not give me the option to print it. The office manager Michelle Sheets, would not let me come to my appointment  even though this was THEIR mistake! I took the entire day off work and  heard great things about this office from referrals from my friends who go there. I have never heard of a doctor's office basically saying they don't want my business. I'm seriously in shock right now and plan to write a letter to the doctor and make sure everyone knows about this office's bad business practices.
