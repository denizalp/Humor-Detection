The bread here is delicious. I enjoyed Kneaders before I went Vegan. Now that I am, it is a bit difficult finding things I can eat. Based on a previous review, I was able to concoct this Veggie Avocado Sandwich with cucumbers and cranberry sauce. It was delicious and filling. I wish there were more options available and that the things that are vegan\/vegetarian friendly were more clearly marked. That's the only reason for the three stars.
