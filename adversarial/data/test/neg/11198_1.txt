Family owned, and the staff is super friendly and really cares about the food they put out.  I moved into this neighborhood 5 yrs ago, and happened to go in my first week after moving in, didn't go back for a couple months because of the holidays crazyness, and they remembered my name!  They have every time since as well, whether I call in, or walk in.  Food is excellent, huge portions, and generous w\/the meat.  I swear there is a pound of bacon on their BLT.
