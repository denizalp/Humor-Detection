I seriously love this place. I would be here every other day if I didn't live a bit too far away. (Which is probably a good thing!)\n\nIt's a small, neat little shop with some tables, booths, and bar-type seating. The traffic seems variable; sometimes I've been in there for lunch and was the only one there, other times it's been packed. That being said, they bring out your food relatively quickly, so the tables are turned fairly quickly as well.\n\nThe food is just. so. tasty. I stick to the Yokohama Style (with an extra egg, of course), but the Nishikawa Black and the Shio are also supremely good. I've also had the gyoza, spring rolls, and takoyaki and loved them, which is unfortunate seeing as I'm physically incapable of eating a bowl of ramen and 3 appetizers on my own.\n\nThe staff is always very kind and helpful, and are especially quick on the water refills (which is important here in AZ!) which is appreciated. \n\nI love this place and you should definitely go here because you'll love it too.
