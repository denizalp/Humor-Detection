We went to this place on a recommendation.  It was on the opposite end of the strip (by Circus Circus) from where we were staying, but it was worth the trip.  The place looks a little skeptical from the outside, like an old Denny's that they \"jazzed\" up...but the food was good and the portions were large.  I like the \"cheesey\" decor on the inside as well as the cheesey waitress uniforms.  Definitely seems like something you should experience in Vegas.
