Stopped here for lunch when we got into town. We were seated quickly and the waitress was really fast to get our drink order. They had a good variety of lunch specials, and their food and sushi menu was very extensive. Seemed to have almost every kind of seafood, even some things I have not heard of before. \n\nOur orders were brought out quickly and the waitress was really nice. The food we got was ok, it wasn't bad by no means, but it wasn't that great either. Although their sushi and rolls looked like they are delicious. \n\nIf I ever find myself back here I am definitely gonna try sushi next time.
