I work in the neighborhood, and it's part of my routine to give Stumpy's a visit every Monday.  It's good enough to keep me coming back every time.\n\nThey have a wide selection of toppings for pizza and a good variety of sandwiches if that's your thing (I'm a pizza guy, myself).  It's made fresh right in front of you with quality ingredients.  I'm somewhat of a pizza aficionado, and I always recommend Stumpy's to anyone who enjoys a slice now and then.
