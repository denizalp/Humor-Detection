I came here for dinner with my boyfriend on a Groupon deal. The Groupon deal was for a dinner for two people. We each got an appetizer, an entree, and a desert. We each ordered the shrimp and vegetable tempera. I ordered the salmon teriyaki and my boyfriend ordered one of their jumbo maki rolls. For desert, we both ordered the ginger ice cream (not every Japanese restaurants offers ginger ice cream). The service at this restaurant is pretty good. The server was friendly and attentive. Although, it wasn't busy today in the restaurant so I am not sure how it would be like if the restaurant is busy. The food was average en par with other Japanese restaurants in the same price range. Overall, my experience here was good.
