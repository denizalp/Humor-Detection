The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars is because they do have some cute clothes. However, returning anything is an absolute nightmare. I made a return on 5\/1 & my card still has not been credited back after almost a month. According to there accounting department, it can take up to 30 days. I've called & emailed several times for an update but they just tell me I have to wait the 30 days before they can do anything more. I've never had an issue with any other businesses issuing my refund within days of the return. So, now they have my returned merchandise & I have yet to see a dime back.  My advice if you shop here, be very sure you want to keep whatever you purchased or you may be out the clothes & your money just like me.
