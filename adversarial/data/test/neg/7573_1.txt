This place had great portions of food and prices were excellent. Ordered the Fajitas for 2 and was able to share it with plenty of leftovers. We tried the queso dip which was very tasty. I liked how they bring out chips and 2 different salsas and retried beans. Also and added extra: all the dishes you order come with a fideo soup which was a nice touch! Overall very happy with the food and service, I'll definitely be back!
