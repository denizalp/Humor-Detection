I was skeptical to eat here since most of the reviews have at least one negative comment in them, but very glad I decided to!  Our service was great, two different gentlemen waited on us and both were polite and attentive.  I had the egg rolls appetizer and Basil Chicken and my companion had the fried dumplings and Red Curry with Squid.  All of our food was hot and tasty.  I loved the basil chicken, it had lots and lots of flavor and a little spice.  Serving size was generous and I brought enough home for lunch today. The egg rolls were crispy and piping hot when they arrived.  I tasted my dining partners curry and it had great heat and the flavor was yummy.  The place is clean and I really don't have a bad thing to say except there are so many items on the menu it is hard to choose just one item!  I will definitely go back to try a few more things.  If you were disappointed with your first visit, maybe give them another try?
