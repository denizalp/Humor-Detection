Let me start with, our server was great.  Spot on with refills and giving plenty of time to talk and look at the menu.  The place is smaller and very nicely decorated.\nEveryone enjoyed their steaks.\nI didn't go that route and had soup and salad.  The soup was good...nothing over the top and the salad was just a disgrace for $10.50.  It was the Fleming Salad and it seriously had two small pieces of walnuts and a few cranberry's.  You expect just a shade better for that price in that kind of restaurant.  \nUnless someone else is paying....not worth the price in this town.  So many better steak houses in Las Vegas than Flemings.\n\n2\/29\/16  Mr. Godfrey from Flemings reached out to me and asked me to contact him in regards to my dinning experience.\nThat shows great customer service.  Will give them a second chance in the future.
