I have been going here for about a month. I signed up for the Groupon and did the 10 classes inside of 2 and a half weeks because I loved it so much. Im now signed up for the monthly unlimited plan. The instructors are supportive and offer feedback the whole class. The women who attend are also helpful. I have never felt judged,  only supported. I have already told multiple people how great it is!
