The venue appeared somewhat questionable but when the comedians began their acts you forgot all about that. The headliner Lisa Landry was hilarious and her warm up acts were great too. We had our tickets through Vegas.com which saved us having to buy drinks.  This show was way better than the big name we saw earlier in the week who appeared bored and detached during his act.
