This is hands down the best Thai food I've had. We've gone to a lot of thai places all over the valley and the flavors and quality of the food here is the best. Yes, the ambiance isn't much to look at but who cares with great dishes like the Phad thai, mango curry and vegetable rama.. three of my all time favorites. They are very reasonably priced and you get huge portions. We usually get two meals and a snack out of one order. If you're uptight about little dive locations, this may not be the place for you, but if you want great food, Papaya thai rocks.  We've taken my Aunt who lived in Asia for 35 years there and she thought it was the most authentic she's had since being back in the states. Love it!
