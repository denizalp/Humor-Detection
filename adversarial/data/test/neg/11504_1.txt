I've been to 5 different Cheesecake Factory locations and this one became my 6th!\n\nOverall, it was pretty good!\nWe still had to wait about 35 minutes for weekday's lunch, but the buzzer and the accurately estimated waiting time given to us allowed some freedom to walk around and do shopping. The buzzer actually worked when I was behind Victoria's Secret. \n\nOther than the fried calamari and Taco shells, everything we got was delicious.  The calamari only had tiny thin tentacles, no rings. When the plate got to us, the plate looked full of calamari, but it was exaggerated by batter and gaps since no ring parts were used.  So felt like we are just eating fried batter. \n\nThe price was rather high.  Affordable and big portion was what we liked from the US restaurants, but here it costed over $30 a person with 1 appetizer and 2 soft drinks. \nPlus, $9 for a slice of cheesecake that isn't that special.  \n\nTheir service was great! \nWill visit again if we don't have to stand in line.\n\nEdit: looked through some photos. Other people got the fried calamari rings. Why did we only get heavily battered tentacles? Thought that was odd. I guess we got someone's unwanted dish. :\/
