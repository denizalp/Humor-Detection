Was in Phoenix for a wedding and wanted to get some good celebratory cigars. Maddie and Joe hoped with some great cigars, hooked me up with great travel humidor and spent more time than necessary looking at cutters. I'll be back for sure and would send anyone looking for a great place to enjoy a good cigar.
