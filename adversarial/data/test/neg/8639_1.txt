Just walked in tonight, it wasn't busy at all which was good. Thought I can use their thingy right here on yelp but the guy working there told me they don't use those anymore so okay. Haircut is just $13 plus if you want shampoo, it's gonna be $3 more. It wasn't pricey at all. The lady who cut my hair was really nice, she asked me some questions and really listened to all the things that I had to say. She suggested me this and that too. Over all, she made a great job on my hair. I really liked it!
