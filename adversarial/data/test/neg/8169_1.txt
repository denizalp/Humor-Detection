Another awesome pedicure & fill today. Tammy is the best!  She knows exactly how to treat my feet! I'm very sensitive and she is so gentle but gets everything just right. \nEveryone there is so nice! Today there was a lady getting her nails done who was so ridiculously picky and was telling the technician how to do her nails and was very rude in my book.  But they were so kind to her. This is the best place ever!!!
