Coming from Los Angeles, I'm completely spoiled with awesome dim sum places, so maybe you should take my review with a grain of salt. \n\nFirst off, the seating procedure is absolutely terrible. You wait in a line with a bunch of other people, whose parties can range from a small group of two to a large group of eight. Yet no one comes to sort out these groups and so because that group of eight is going to wait forever, you're waiting forever with them. \n\nWhen you're finally seated, you notice that there are two different rooms. If you're lucky, you'll be in the room near the kitchen, and you'll get your food. If not, you'll be waiting forever only to realize that those ladies with the carts are only going around the first room. \n\nHowever, I will say that their food is pretty good. Of all the dim sum I've tried in Vegas, this is probably the best one. They have a pretty good selection of dim sum, although I would say that their tripe is not that great. But I do really like their other dishes.\n\nAll in all, a good place for the food but you're going to have to suffer through the terrible service.
