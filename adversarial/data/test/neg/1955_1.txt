Lucille's Smokehouse Bar-B-Que is one of the best ones out here in Vegas located at Red Rock Hotel and Casino. Their happy hour is simply amazing and the variety is much better than the one in Green Valley. I do have to say though the only thing that this location likes is space in the bar area where happy hour does take place I think they need to add any more seats in order for more people to enjoy the happy hour in this location.
