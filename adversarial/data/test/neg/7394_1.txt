Best place in Old Town for playing games on an outdoor patio. Staff is fun and there is plenty of room for bringing a big group. That said I've come to watch a game by myself and ended up making several friends at the bar. It has that local hangout kind of vibe that makes it my go to spot for a casual beer.The crowd is pretty mixed and friendly. Wednesday night is county night and a lot of fun. There is live music occasionally with pretty talented musicians. Somehow ended up here on a Saturday night and the ENTIRE bar was singing Michael Jackson songs for some sort of retro night while dancing. Two other times a random pub crawl rolled through in costumes. Seems to always be something fun going on here. Oh, the Pork Belly BLT is AWESOME. Staff is great and seem to know everyone too.
