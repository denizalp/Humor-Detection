UPDATE: \n\nI previously gave this place 1- star but let me tell you have things changed. I believe that if you give a crappy review and the place has turned around you should inform people that you have had a change of heart. After my first post the manager got in contact with me and I answered some of his questions. He genuinely wanted to know about my last few experiences, and how he could make up for them. I was just appreciative that he saw a problem and wanted to make his establishment better. I went in a couple of nights ago because grad school is frying my brain, and I needed a burger. When I went in Jessica was there and she greeted me and was extremely kind and helpful. I went back again and I got the same service :attentive, and welcoming, AND My order was correct. \n\n This place found a problem and made a change. I haven't been in when Jessica isn't working so I cannot speak for all of the staff, but it was enough to make me not want to cringe about the thought of going back. \n\n  --------------------------------------------------
