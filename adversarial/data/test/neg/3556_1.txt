This place is amazing and I'm absolutely addicted! My husband and I have gone here twice in the last two weeks. I usually get the chicken enchiladas but everything we have tried on the menu is great. So far, great service, amazing food, fun atmosphere. I recommend this place to all of my friends and family members.
