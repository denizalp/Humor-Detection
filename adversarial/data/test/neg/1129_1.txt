Red Herring makes a good alternative to the other local restaurants on the Nevada-Oregon circuit (for instance, when the Bread Company closes their hot grill way too early in the afternoon, or when the oil from Basil Thai begins to taste a little too old). It's a good getaway from the office, being subterranean and far from formal, with the best-dressed (which is to say, most interestingly-dressed) kids on campus running the kitchen and counter.\n\nI'm enjoying the new drink selection and the new set menu, though perhaps wiping the boards of menus past would be nice! (There are too many places to look otherwise for conflicting ordering information.) I don't always think the food is fabulous --for some reason, the lentils are always undercooked no matter the dish-- but there's lots of it, and it feels good for you in a way that greasy fare from down the block never will.
