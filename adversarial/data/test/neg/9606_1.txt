I called last night to see if I could get a whole lemon meringue pie. The lady told me they were out of whole lemon meringue pies but they could make me one and it would be ready in about 40 minutes. She even put me on hold to check the wait time... I then proceeded to wander around Target for 40 minutes before heading to Eat N Park. When I arrived, a man apologized and told me they still had to make the pie and it would be another 20 minutes. I agree to wait so he goes in the back to \"confirm\" the wait time and comes back and tells me it would be anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour....  If you don't want to make the pie, just tell me when I call the first time instead of wasting my time! I ended up driving to the BJ's behind Eat N Park and found lemon meringue pies for $6.99. Next time I am skipping Eat N Park and going to BJ's.
