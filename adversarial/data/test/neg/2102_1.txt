I have a feeling that a place like the one Huntersville Family Restaurant aspires to be must be seasoned over many years.  There are local restaurants that have grown into the role, like Lupies down the street and The Cook House and Acropolis in Cornelius.\n\nThe food is intended and designed to be plain and predictable.  It seeks to be the essence of a \"home cooked meal,\" and so nothing trendy or exotic should ever appear on the menu.  Ingredients might be fresh, but then again they might be canned or frozen, because they are defiantly not cooked for sophisticated palates.  \n\nI had lunch here once, and chose the popcorn shrimp.  The shrimp were piled on top of a bed of french fries, with 4 or 5 large hush puppies off to the side, and in most places would be enough food for 2 or 3 lunches, but hearty portions are of course part of the expectations.\n\nFor what it was, my lunch was quite good.  The service was good.  The place is clean, if a little old looking.  It will be interesting to see how it fares.
