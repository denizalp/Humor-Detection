Love going to Piper's for Premier League matches and the Irish breakfast. Great selection of beers and the every meal I've ordered from there has been over the top. The serving sizes are not lacking by any means, always have to get a to-go box. If you like pubs with a good atmosphere then Piper's is a must.
