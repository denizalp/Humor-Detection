I've went here for the last 5 years because I live in the area and after a lot of left downs this place is now a huge 1\/5 Star. The specialty pizzas are alright if you feel like spending more - a lot more for what you can get downtown. I ordered Mac and cheese, paid $2 extra for broccoli (doing it to try and make myself feel maybe a little more  healthy. Got home  - no broccoli, normal me ok darn but $2 extra and then to be short changed - Not ok. $9 regular Mac and cheese and then $11 get real.) This isn't the first instance of dissatisfied service I have had here. If you're going to charge this much for pizzas in the suburbs you need to at least follow through with what you charge for and then make up for it in service. Such a waste. Avoid this place there are a lot better restaurants in a half mile radius.
