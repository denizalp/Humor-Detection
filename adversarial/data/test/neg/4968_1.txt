I heard this place was good and it didn't disappoint. Great atmosphere and wonderful service. Everyone was very attentive and helpful since it was my first time. I really like the ordering style also - you walk up and order while they setup a table for you - very clever. Burger was amazingly delicious and truffle fries were yummy! I definitely recommend this place and plan to go back soon.
