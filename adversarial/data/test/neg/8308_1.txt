Choice Home Warranty assigned this company to fix my dishwasher. The technician came out and took my $65 visit fee and told me he had to order a part to repair the dishwasher. Waited a full week and never heard back from them, so I gave them a call. I was told that Choice Home Warrenty had not authorized for them to order the part. My issue is that I was never called to be informed of this nor did they follow up with Choice Home Warranty, I had to do that myself. \n\nI was told by Choice Home Warranty that this company had not responded to their repeated tries to get a part number from them. I had to be assigned a new company to get my issue resolved. I don't think that they ever intended to repair my dishwasher and just wanted to collect the $65 in cash.
