I was never really all that interested in going to Roy's and only went because I had a gift card from a friend. \n\nWe were all set to order the summer prix fixe menu until our server recommended the Lobster Pot Stickers, Heirloom Tomato & Mozzarella Salad, Hibachi Salmon, Macadamia NutCrusted Mahi Mahi & Misoyaki Butterfish & the Hawaii Kai Style Beef Short Ribs.  SOLD. \nIt was all great and our server was great. \n\nNice atmosphere, & no wait.\nReally glad I had the gift card to make me go.  I will definitely go again.
