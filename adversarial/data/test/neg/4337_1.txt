Great night we had yesterday at Bottiglia Italian restaurant at green valley ranch.\nThe service was great especially Doug the bar render, he was very nice and knowledgable of the menu.\nWe had meat ball, and zucchini flower for appetizer they were the best I ever had, and the pasta bolognese and the short ribs cavatelli out of this world.\nDefinitely I'll come back.
