I have eaten at Vitner Grill a handful of times and they always deliver. Love the atmosphere, staff, wine selection and food. This is a great strip alternative out in the Summerlin area. I love there cheese plate selection, always a good way to try several new types of cheese. Last night I ordered the rib eye and it was amazing. The hash that it is served with was solid. Great outdoor seating area. You have to check this place out.
