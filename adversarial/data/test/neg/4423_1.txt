We had an amazing 45th wedding anniversary celebration dinner. Chris, the bartender,  & Natalie, our server, were amazing. We started out with the flash fried Brussels sprout leaves. They were great. Next I had the French onion soup. It was wonderful. I had the scallops and my husband had the bouellabaisse. This was an amazing celebration. We'll be back.
