Since I work a block away, I am in Bow Valley Square on a daily basis and go to Choices at least once a month. I usually order the lemongrass chicken. It's really good. Their crispy spring rolls are some of my favorites around.\n\nThe service at lunch is always quick even if there's a big lineup. I've tried a few other items on the menu and have only been disappointed once. I had the spicy chicken from their buffet which was too sweet and not spicy enough. I'm not a Pho fan so I can't comment on that but if the rest of the menu is any indication, it'll probably be good. I'll continue to come here time and time again as it's good value and fast service.
