This isn't authentic Vietnamese food. More like Chinese\/Vietnamese fusion. They have some dishes that can almost pass as being from Congee Queen.\n\nTheir service was decent, not overly attentive and kind, but you quickly get served when you are hungry.\n\nThey get plus marks for their humongous portions. Probably can feed two people with one of those noodle dishes. I didn't like the chicken they used for the salad we ordered to share, it was gooey.
