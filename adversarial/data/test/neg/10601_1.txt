Fancy Franks is a win!\n\nMy first encounter with the tasty Fancies was at the Yelp 99 Sudbury event where we got to try the delicious Aano which featured prosciutto and arugula. \nA few weeks later I decided to visit the HQ with a friend from New York, and Fancy did not disappoint. Aside from the solid 'Dog we were greeted by very friendly staff, and were also introduced to their delicious miniature donuts! We had a dozen each of the classic and the Nutella\/Biscotti treats and they really did not disappoint. The warm, fluffy, and flavourful little fellas are a bargain at ~$5\/dozen and will definitely lead me back to this corner of College St.
