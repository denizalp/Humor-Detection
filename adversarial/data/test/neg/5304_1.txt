The pho is subpar. I ordered their plain vanilla pho combination.  They had very small portion of noodle and meat. \nThe price was higher than most other pho places. I will never come back for pho. But a footnote, the place did say \"Sub & Grill\".\nIt is a small place runs by a 2 people. I didn't try any of their other entre on the menu.
