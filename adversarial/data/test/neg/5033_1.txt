Whenever there is a birthday or celebration, I ALWAYS get my cakes here. Cakes are excellent and they are always on time and I've never had any issues with their cakes. They never mess up the spelling or message. I've gotten cakes from here at least 10 times and each time is was worth it!\n\nI can't comment on the breads or sandwiches as I've never had them.
