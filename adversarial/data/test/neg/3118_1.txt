What a place . They never answer the phone. Went to get pizza and the internet did not let me put the code in for taking the survey. Counter girl said she would let me slide. This place is a joke . Will find another place to get a simple pizza. Don't take the survey because it is a waste of time you don't get a 10$ credit on specials . A lot of other places that make pizza
