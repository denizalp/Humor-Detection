I love this library, my family loves this library. \nIt is such a beautiful building inside and out. \nThey always have all the new released movies out on blu ray and dvd and if they don't have what you're looking for you can have them order books and movies from other locations and you will be able to pick them up fairly quick, I get text whenever my books are in. Super easy and simple and always have what I'm looking for.
