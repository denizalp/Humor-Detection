My family and I were so impressed by our service given by our waiter, Sy. He was tentative and patient. He blew our expectations out of the park and his joyful attitude made the experience that much better. We were truly blown away and my grandmother had said she \"wished service was like that everywhere\". Thank you!\n\nOn another note, the food was DELICIOUS. The calamari was so much better than many places, it was super flavorful. The Shrimp, Crab and Lobster Club was so yummy as well and super rich in flavor. Those are definitely worth ordering. Oh and you would think the strawberry lemonade was good based on its $8 price, but it's not all that great. lol don't waste your money on it. Other than that, great experience!!
