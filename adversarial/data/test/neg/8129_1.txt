Very disappointed. My wife loved their hot dog sliders. By the way this is a very unique item. The hot dogs seemed to be of better quality then most and I've never seen hot dog sliders on any menu before. This item has bounced around from menu to menu to no menu and no they're not available.  Sorry to say but this gives us one less choice when we go to happy hour.
