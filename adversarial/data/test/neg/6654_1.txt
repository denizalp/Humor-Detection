I threw out my boba. I THREW OUT MY BOBA. I guess there's a first time for everything. Their house black milk tea was disappointing, to say the least. My kids weren't crazy about their popcorn chicken either. My son, who up until this point loved all things fried chicken, made it clear to me that their chicken wasn't that good. (I actually thought it tasted ok.) Their chicken banh mi was nothing memorable, and the chicken was a bit dry.
