Never stay at this location!! I was trying to book a room for a cheep price and got exactly that.... the carpet is sticky in all the rooms and smells like a middle school locker room. My room had dead cockroaches near the wall AC unit, and The hotel clerk was far from friendly or helpful, and my bed came with free pub hairs. Needless to say  sometimes you get what you pay for.... next time I'll spend the extra $15!!
