Me and a colleague stopped there because the place was full with locals and vibrant.  The service was excellent and so was the authentic French food.  The wine and drinks were very good, although by no means top shelf; however, the staff was attentive and suggested an excellent food-wine pairing.  \n\nNote, that if you are looking for a good place to enjoy the food, drinks and cigars on the patio with the locals this is a great place to go.  On the other hand, if you cannot stand people smoking around you this may not be the best choice.
