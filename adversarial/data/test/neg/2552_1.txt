While on our Mom's weekend away, we stayed at the Paris Hotel.  Some of the moms were in line for the buffet at the hotel and texted us to meet them there.  When I saw the line, I told them I am not going to wait over an hour for eggs.  My roommate and a couple of other moms decided to head out.  Just outside the hotel and I think it is part of it is The Sugar Factory, besides having a big candy store, they have a restaurant attached to it.  We were seated immediately and we texted the other moms who joined us.  The menu looks like a smaller version of the Cheesecake Factory one.  Our server was so nice, she was from New Zealand and one of the moms in our group is from Australia, so they had a little chat.  The food is ok, nothing to blow your mind, but in a pinch it will do.  I had the egg white omelet with spinach and mushroom.  It came with potatoes and toast.  Some of the drinks looked so good, but it was too early to start drinking.  All in all I had a very good experience here.
