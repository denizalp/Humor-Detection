We were referred to Kennedy Tile by our home inspector. We spoke and dealt with Brian who always returned phone calls, texts and emails right away. He was very helpful in helping us pick out tile and with ideas. He went out of his way to keep costs down and was upfront with everything. His staff was on-time and cleaned up everything. We gave them a key and they were off to work. The job was finished on time and there was no drama. Our tile floors look AMAZING and we can't wait to be able to have Brian and his crew out again for redoing our bathrooms when the budget allows. We already referred someone to Kennedy Tile and hope you choose them too! All the pricing and photos are on their website, so there's no guessing on the price and quiality of work. HIGHLY RECOMMENED!
