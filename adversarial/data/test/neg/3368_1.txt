I just recently moved here from Las Vegas... the Mecca of all hair salons you can imagine coasting from the valley to the infamous Las Vegas Blvd. I can confidently say that Jenny is the best hair stylist I've ever encountered, not only is she sweet but extremely knowledgeable and naturally talented. Snapdragon Salon is very well designed and has a positive atmosphere especially with Nicole as the Manager... very patient and professional! I have obnoxiously long, black, thick hair...  wanted to go Carmel Ombre... I'm preaching that it looks so perfect and exactly how I described to Jenny! I've been receiving compliments all day and every person I highly recommended to go this salon. Go here, it's beyond worth it!
