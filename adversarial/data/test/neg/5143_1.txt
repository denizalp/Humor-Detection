I would rate more stars if I could! Chris is the best. He told us exactly what needed to be done to our car and they actually showed me what the problem was with our catalytic converters. They even gave us a ride home in Chris's personal truck. We even came back today because of a rattle in the exhaust and Chris and Walt realigned the exhaust pipes which fixed the issue and sent us on our way no questions asked. Walt, Bart and the other guys are great. We will be taking our T-Bird there from now on. They are honest, upfront, understanding and helpful! \nWe highly recommend these guys!!
