Love Hurricane Grill & Wings! They have so many sauce options for my husband, nothing is ever hot enough for him, but the top one was wonderful and he loves it. I love the fact that since I cannot eat poultry, there are a lot of other options for me on the menu! Not like other places we have went to for sure. Their happy hour is terrific and when the band is playing we always have a good time! Highly recommend :)
