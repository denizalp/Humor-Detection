Excellent sushi especially for an all you can eat.  I lean more towards the traditional rolls that highlight the ingredients (fish being the main of course) and Sushi Koma delivers.  We all know how sushi places can be hit and miss but this place is a hit for sure.  Also just a heads up you can get the rolls as half rolls so you can try more.
