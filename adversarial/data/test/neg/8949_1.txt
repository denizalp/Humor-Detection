Made an order 20 minutes prior to arrival on the app, was declined 5 minutes before closing because all employees were all sitting down at the table eating food. I was told \"we're closed\", I mentioned that they weren't and employee responded with \"we're out of food\". So either restock on food to where it is available all day up until it actually closes, or don't allow giant dinners before closing that includes every employee.
