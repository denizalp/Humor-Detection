I was told there would be no installation fee then I get my first bill and there is a $250.00 installation fee on it. I call and they would not budge. So trying to get that paid plus my monthly fee in January I had made 2 payments of $200.00 and I still owed under $50.00 and they turned off my service I called to get it reconnected to make payment arrangement they said we do not allow for payment arrangement. I only wanted to put the payment off till the next day and still get my service restored. This company is awful they will not work with you and anytime you are late the service gets cut. I signed a two year contract but i am still going to cancel because I do not want to deal with them, Plus i signed to be able to save money from my prior service and they promise you a low rate but when you get your bill there is all these extra charges so it ends up to be more expensive.
