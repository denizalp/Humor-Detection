Most incredible breads and pastries. \n\nMy favourite are the croissants: matcha pastry cream, salted egg yolk, peanut butter and chocolate hazelnut! So delicious every single one of them. \n\nMy only suggestion is if you're not eating it the same day, crisp it up in the oven at 425 for about 5 minutes!
