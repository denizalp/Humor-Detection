Very helpful staff I couldn't leave happier.  It's refreshing to see great customer service once in awhile.  \n\nCame in with a picture of the tree I wanted from another location (bring a SKU # it helps!).  \nShe was nice enough to look it up, and bring it out from the back room once we confirmed there were none on the floor.  \n\nI almost wanted to cry tears of joy honestly because I couldn't have been happier to find the better quality tree for my budget.  \n\nGlad it's close to home I will prefer this location next to none.
