One of my go to places when in Vegas.  I've been to this place a couple of times now and really enjoy it every time.  I love the heirloom tomato salad which is not what I expect in a sushi place, the dressing is very tasty.  I thought the El Topo was different and delicious and the Asevichado was light and fresh tasting.  We finished our meal with the chocolate banana cake which was rich but tasty.
