After living in Madison for 11 years, I finally got around to eating at Smoky Jon's. I think it's pretty safe to say that it won't be that long before I come back. \n\nMy wife and I each had the shredded pork, mine by itself and her in a sandwich. Both of us loved it. The sauce is smoky and a little spicy. We also got a side of onion rings. Those seemed to be extra greasy, but they were crispy and tasted fine. \n\nOnly styrofoam and paper platters with plastic utensils. I think it's due to a lack of room in the back, but overall, really good!
