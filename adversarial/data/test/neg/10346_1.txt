Decent place not much changed from CBCb that was here before. Draft selection was average. Hope they rotate the taps often. Food seemed a bit high priced for a sports bar, so I had high expectations. They did not live up to those. Nothing spectacular. I ordered the club and was informed by server that it only comes with one meat. That surprised me cause then out is just a ham or turkey sandwich. I asked for ham but got turkey.  Server apologized and offered tho replace. Fries as side were awful. Not warm and were mushy after id asked for extra crispy. \n\nService was great and atmosphere was perfect for watching a game or socializing. Great patio. Food needs to greatly improve or prices need to come down a bit.
