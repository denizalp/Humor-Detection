Still not sure what I got, but not what I had ordered - I think?\n\nOrdered kung pao chicken. Got a small scoop of fried rice that was good, but after that - I'm not sure what I got. Had kung pao sauce with a BOATLOAD of chopped up carrots, celery, and peanuts, with little, and I mean little pieces of chicken. Like the size of marbels.\n\nThis place used to be great, but save the time and money and go to Imperial Wok across the tracks in the old KFC\/Papa Johns locations.
