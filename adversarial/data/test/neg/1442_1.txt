Buffet style restaurant.\n\nThe taste is ok on some of the items but out of ten items on the buffet only 2 were good. \n\nThe spicy eggplant dish was actually really good and the curry chicken was ok!\n\nThe place is run down and not the cleanest place. \n\nI would suggest not bringing a date here!\n\nAnd for the price $15 for lunch on Saturday the value for what you get is not worth it. \n\nI can't  say that I would rush back but I would try quite a few restaurants around first! \n\nOverall not the best but if your adventuress, go for it!
