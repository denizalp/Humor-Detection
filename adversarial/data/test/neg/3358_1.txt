Menu far too confusing. My boyfriend was very upset with how many options they had yet nothing simple and clear. We just wanted a classic banana split. The gent that helped us was very eager to answer any questions we had and convinced us to try their chocolate soda which was less than satisfying. Overall spent 25 bucks on two banana splits and a soda. Also not a traditional bar counter. Could work on aesthetic. Banana was good though.
