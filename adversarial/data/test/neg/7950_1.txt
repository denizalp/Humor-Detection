Huge selection of buns for about $2 and some other little eats such as curry fish balls and chow mein . The buns were super cute and affordable but they weren't super tasty. I definitely ordered one cause they were adorable. Still worth it for the ig lol!   I ordered the hello kitty one which was custard filled and my bf got the angry birds one which was chocolate filled. Note they only take cash and debit cards like most of stores and restaurants in Chinatown. Be sure to bring cash when visiting Chinatown
