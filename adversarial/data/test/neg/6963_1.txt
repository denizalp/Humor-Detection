Ever since leaving Tucson, I've been looking for a place that had authentic Japanese food. Not just sushi, but different types of ramen and udon, as well as bento boxes. I think this is my place to go in the valley! \n\nI really wish Yelp would let you give half stars. There are places that are better than 3 stars, but aren't quite at a 4 star level... that's where I'd put Nagasaki Grill Toh Zan. \n\nMy partner and I took our kids, which is always an experience because they generally don't like anything that isn't processed and full of sugar and crap. It's always a crap shoot when we take them out to eat. We lucked out!\n\nThe place totally looks closed from the outside, but inside it's clean, albeit a little plain Jane. I'm thinking that they didn't put a lot of money into remodeling the place, but it's ok. We sat in a small booth, while a larger group came in and took up a big table by the wall. \n\nThe gentleman sat us, handed us menus and suggested that we hurry up and order before the group did, so we weren't sitting around waiting for their orders to be completed. When it comes to bedside manner, no, he wasn't the sweetest, softest guy around, but considering it's only him and his wife running the place I could cut him some slack. Besides, having lived in Asia most of my life, i'm used to the more brusque manner. It didn't bother me, especially if the food was good. \n\nThe boys both ordered ramen; one got the miso broth, the other got a different broth (I don't remember which). I got the Ka-ri (curry) udon, and my partner got the teriaki chicken don. All the noodles came with inari sushi, which the boys loved... go figure! Decent sized bowls, piping hot, fresh. I think both of them were lifting the bowls up to make sure they got every last bit of broth. My curry udon was great, flavourful and filling. My biggest issue with it is that it really had no protein in it. I would love it if they could do a seafood curry udon, which is my go-to when I'm in Tucson. I would pay a few bucks more for a larger bowl, with a protein of some sort. \n\nMy partner's teriyaki chicken was ok, but not the best I've had. The potstickers that came with it were excellent, however. The chicken was a little dry and the sauce was a little sweet for my taste. But I'm not writing the bento boxes off completely. I plan on going back and trying some of the others, including the Unagi bento. \n\nThe honey lemonade was just sweet enough and refreshing, but the highlight as far as the drinks go were the strawberry boba milk tea. Soooo good! It was like actual strawberry puree in smoothie form, poured over ice and topped with milk. A little unconventional as far as boba teas go, but it was so incredibly yummy! \n\nSo, in a nutshell, I'll be going back, especially since the boys really liked it, and that's a huge plus. There were a few missteps, but honestly, for a restaurant that has a staff of 2, you can't always expect perfection. It's obvious that they put their blood, sweat and tears into this venture, and I'm happy to support a local business like this.
