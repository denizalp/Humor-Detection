My boyfriend and I tried the Gaucho, with bacon added and he also added turkey sausage to his. The sandwich was delicious. The wagyu was super tender, the egg was perfectly done, and the chimichurri complimented it all. I'm hooked. But only giving 4 stars because they were out of the coddled egg over potato pur√©e in a jar- and that's why we stood in line for 20 minutes to begin with.
