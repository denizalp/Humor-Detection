great clam chowder, nice sized oysters that were so big i could barely add any tabasco and lemon to the shell without it dripping off. oysters rockefellers were good after i sprinkled crushed crackers on top, but i am biased because i've had pappadeaux rockefeller trio. def want to come back to try lobster grilled cheese!
