This is probably our favorite place in the area for breakfast. Be prepared for a wait before being seated. Most of the items on the menu are pretty good. Service has declined a little over the last few years. The wait staff is a little pushy and outspoken- especially the one with neck tattoos. They could use to leave sweeteners on the table. Those are the only two reasons that I didn't give this place 5 stars. Otherwise, we love going here and we would recommend it to anyone who lives close by!
