I regret not taking a photo of the menu as it is different from the one posted here in photos. Note that they do not take credit, but debit is accepted.\n\nCeviche - 4.5\/5. White fish and shrimp ceviche was the special for that night. Mmmm, it sure was tasty. Note that the ceviche comes with a serving of guac on top of it. I was surprised to see the guac when the plate came to the table as our server didn't mention it when describing the dish.\n\nI have an avocado sensitivity so I avoid avocado when possible. I asked for all the tacos to be made without any avocado or their avocado crema. I ended up pushing off the guac that came on top of our ceviche.\n\nWe tried a variety of tacos including the chorizo, lamb, bistek, chicken, and carne asada. Our server recommended 2-3 tacos per person. \n\nTop picks - lamb and the bistek tacos were delicious. So flavourful and moist. 4\/5 to 4.5\/5\n\nDisappointing - carne asada. I found it lacked flavour (maybe because I asked for no avocado?). 2.5\/5\n\nDessert - flan. 3\/5. This was a very dense flan with dulce de leche on top. If you enjoy creamy and very sweet desserts, this would be right up your alley. Unfortunately, it wasn't to my taste.\n\nService - 4\/5. Servers were all very nice and accommodating. \n\nAmbiance - 3.5\/5. Maybe it was because we were in the back room, but it was pretty cold and half way through our meal our server came by to set up a space heater to help warm up the room.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the food, even without avocado! :) That is sometimes a challenge when eating Mexican. I really encourage you to drop by this place if you haven't already!
