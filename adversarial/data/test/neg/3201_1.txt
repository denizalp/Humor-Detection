Decent sandwich especially for Arizona. Can do hoagie or bread.  I have had both, both good. \nThey mainly use Boars Head but this does not always guarantee a great sandwich. Sandwiches Have a decent amount of cold cuts, veggies were fresh. Comes with a 1\/4 lb of salad, Mac, potato, cole slaw etc. \nRefreshing take instead of Subway or Jimmy Johns where it's a bread sandwich. Im from New York and this tries to be authentic, but you can't get the bread here that's like NY
