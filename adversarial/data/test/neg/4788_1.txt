We had a great experience here. We both had a tea tree wrap and massage. Rebecca  was my therapist and she was very professional and took time to let me know what was going on. The entire experience was just as extravagant as one of the hotel spa's i have been to in the past. \n\nThe decor of the spa is a rock and roll music them, which is not your norm for a spa but yet i really enjoyed the memorabilia . it does have the old Vegas vibe which we both loved.
