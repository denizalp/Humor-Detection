As a homeowner, you try to save your budget by tackling simple fixes yourself. However, sometimes the simplest fix can get complex and when that fix involves electricity. I am a firm believer that you should call in a pro to make sure it is done correctly, so your home is safe. \n\nI have called the team at Dodge on two occasions where a home repair made me a bit uncomfortable and each time they came out and rectified the problem properly and at a great rate. I have found their techs to be honest, knowledgeable, friendly, clean, and properly priced. \n\nI will surely use them again and encourage you to try them out.
