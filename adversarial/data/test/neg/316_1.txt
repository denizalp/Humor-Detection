Amazing describes my dinner with my husband. We pretty much had little to no wait time and are at the bar. The bartender was super nice. Good was affordable, fast, and filling. The octopus was to die for and the passion fruit cheesecake is a great way to finish the meal. I am dreaming about it as I wrote now.
