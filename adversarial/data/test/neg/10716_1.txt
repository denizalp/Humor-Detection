We had issued with front door gate always got stuck & locked us behind the door.    \n\nWe found & contacted Valley Gate Refinishing (Mr. Chance) as he got a 5 stars review on Yelp!!!    He responded to my request right the way via text message & showed up in 15-20 min. to look at the issue.  Provided a  quote to repair issue as well as an option to remove an old outdated wood panels & replace with durable wood-like composite panel material. \n\nThe next morning at 8:30am, he showed up on time to repair the gate stuck issue as well as replace the new panel for a reasonable price.\n\nIf you are looking for a prompt, quality & reasonable services, give Valley Gate Refinishing, Mr. Chance a chance.   You will not be disappointed!! \n\nWe are very happy with updated door & best of all, we will not be locked out anymore:)  Yeah!\n\nThank you Chance!
