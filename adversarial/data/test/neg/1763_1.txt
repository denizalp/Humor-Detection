Food AWESOME!!! Service is terrible!  Waitress came to the table one time and then one more to \"drop off the check\".  Not sure if the reason for such poor service is because they are all unionized.  The get paid.  Too bad for guy...another tarnish on his name.  NY and now Vegas....maybe guy needs to open a restaurant in a right to work state.
