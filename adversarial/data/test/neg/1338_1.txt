I stop by my local QT for a latte, better price then those other places. My cashier was Gabby, the customer in front of me had challenges (let's leave it at that). She asked Gabby to help her add something to her drink. Looked like lemon in a small package similar to a ketchup package. Instead of telling the customer no Gabby took the time to help her. Those darn packages can be tough to open, even Gabby struggled with it. \nWhen she was finally done, it took a few minutes, Gabby apologized to me for the wait. I told her what she did was exceptional and I appreciated her taking the time to help the customer. That brought a smile to Gabby's face. She said \"that's what we do\". \nWe all know some do and most don't. \nSometimes it takes more time to be nice and helpful to someone then it is to be rude and dismissive but in the end it's worth the extra time and effort. \nWay to Gabby you did the right thing and I'm glad you did.
