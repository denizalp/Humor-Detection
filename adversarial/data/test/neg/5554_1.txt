Not being from the east valley I wasn't sure what we would find. I have a favorite up in north Phoenix and spent some time in San Fran enjoying a lot of the Indian food around Union Square and other areas.  So when someone suggested we come here to a buffet I was a little worried.  I don't care for Indian buffet's.  They are usually tasteless and bland.   We tried it.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The flavors and the spices where amazing for a buffet.  I would really like to come back and order off the menu when I have time.
