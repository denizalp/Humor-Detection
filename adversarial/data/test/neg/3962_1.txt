If I had to describe this place overall, it would be \"meh\". The place looks nice and all but the quality of the food is pretty mediocre. The pizza was mediocre and the pasta was too cooked. The one meatball which you have to pay extra for to have on your pasta tasted like it had been pre-cooked and frozen. Unlikely to recommend.
