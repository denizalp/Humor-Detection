This was about exactly what I expected. Good, quick, inexpensive food. Not incredibly authentic but extremely enjoyable.  I got the chickpea masala. There were a solid handful of non-meat options. He got the lamb meatball barbecue. I got samosas, he got naan. We bot ate for less than 20 dollars. \n\nThe samosas were great. Crispy, flakey crust, flakey interior. His naan was also excellent--bubbly, buttery and chewy. He enjoyed his lamb. I made the mistake of underestimating the sauce on my chick peas and rice. I added a bunch of hot sauce. Still delicious, just with a little more sweating than I originally signed up for. \n\nDelicious.  I will be back again, probably for lunch after a morning of grocery shopping.
