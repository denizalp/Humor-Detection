I've been here a few times and it's typically good service but today I went in for lunch and was not greeted for 10 minutes. I watched the server walk around on her cell phone. I was patient and waited and finally got menus. When I ordered I asked for bbq sauce. Once the food was delivered I had to ask 4 more times for the sauce. During this time my server was at a table on her cell phone hanging out with other employees... An employee was dancing on my server while I continued to wait for the bbq sauce. \n\nI had to get up and go to the table of employees to ask for me check. The server replied that she was now off and I had a new server because she was in a \" social media meeting \"  unfortunately I never was introduced to this new server and they never checked on my table. Customer service was extremely poor.
