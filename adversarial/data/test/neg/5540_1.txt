I had a 60 minute massage with Maxfield. It felt like a very slow, focused massage that pinpointed troubled areas. He would very gradually push my muscles until I felt all the tension well up in one point which was very intense but only for a short time. I think he's very knowledgeable and told me about what he felt was going on in my back when I asked. I think I will feel great for the next week with none of the soreness of a rougher massage. Also, the place seems very nice, comfortable, and a little fancy.
