Easily my favorite hotel in Vegas.\n\nA lot of people go to Vegas looking for gambling and entertainment, but I go there to relax. For my purposes, the Venetian is perfect since I can spend all my time in a beautiful hotel and an extremely comfortable room for not that much money.\n\nLast I was there, they also had an art exhibit going on which I partook in (love the art).
