Came here for brunch today with my fiancé. We sat down was asked what we wanted to drink. I ordered the chicken fried steak and she ordered the salmon Benny. When the food came I seriously thought the chicken fried steak was going to be dry but I was wrong. My fiancé's food was good too. Our waiter was very attentive and was always checking on us. I like this location better than the southern highlands location.
