Walking around downtown Phoenix encouraged me to try this place. The vibes were poppin with a big crowd. We were fortunate that there was no wait, seated quickly and in a booth, without a reservation. Unfortunately, the menu wasn't anything special.  It was all simple American food. I shared the ribs with French fries. It was decent. I mean it's no Texas BBQ (I haven't really had that yet but I plan to, haha). \n\nThe waitress treated us as if we weren't from phoenix (which we aren't)...it wasn't mean, but I felt that it was implied. I really wanted to try a restaurant that wasn't in San Diego. I'm glad I was able to go, but it really is just one of those simple restaurants with a fun name.
