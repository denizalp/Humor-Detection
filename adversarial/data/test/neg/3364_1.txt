Had lunch here with my mom today. There was no wait, which was a nice surprise. The server was friendly and attentive. We ordered the original burger and fries to split and so glad we did because it was huge! The burger was amazing. Definitely one of the best, if not the best, burger we've ever had! Highly recommend it!
