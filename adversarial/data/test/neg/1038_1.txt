The tortillas are so big and taste so fresh! The burritos are pretty good especially the machaca green chile burrito with potatoes. Sadly, they have shrunk in size in the past few years. I remember their burritos being bigger and more flavorful. The chicken flautas are pretty good except I wish they had more meat. Don't be stingy!\n\nThis place is the spot that me and my family get together at for reunion's.
