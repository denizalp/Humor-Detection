James called within an hour of finding MSW on HomeAdvisor. He came out the next morning and did an estimate, the pricing was much better than I expected. I needed my home's foam roof patched and resprayed with protective coating, they also did my shed. Everything was completed within four days of first contacting them. James did an excellent job, very professional and my dog liked him. He provided before and after photos and I have a 4 yr warranty.  I trust him and was happy with every aspect of the service. I would highly recommend James and MSW as a company for roofing (and they do house painting too).
