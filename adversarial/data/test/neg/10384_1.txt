So I don't leave a whole lot of Yelp reviews but this place is an amazing little local bar. The staff is always incredibly efficient and nice! The food is also stellar. The Grille Burger is by far the best burger I've had in Pittsburgh. Easily beats all of these fancy burger joints that are popping up around town (and better priced too!!). Everything I have ever had at the Tavern is awesome. Oh and their bloody mary's are stellar!
