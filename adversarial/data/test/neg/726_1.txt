One of three or four really great record shops operating in the Valley.  I've been a customer of Stinkweeds since the 80s and have watched what has always been a really great store get better over the years.  Great selection of popular and rock music.  More of an emphasis on import and indie music than your average record shop.  Normally used records are in excellent condition and prices are fair.
