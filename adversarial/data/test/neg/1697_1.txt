I don't know if it is the hot weather or people having a difficult time coping with life working for this company but I know one one thing is for sure, their customer service is among the worst. If you do not want to work at this store and make drinks, leave. Just leave. We can see it on your face when you do not take pride in your work or appreciate the customers that come in. I had a horrible experience with what appeared to be over-worked employees who just wanted a check and the last minute of their shift to end.
