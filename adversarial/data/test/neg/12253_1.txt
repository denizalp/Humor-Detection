Every time I go into this location they seem to be rude. Not wanting to help or anything. I tried to trade in a game unopened and the guy said they don't take unopened games. He Told me I can't open it on the spot either because the camera will see and told me to come back tomorrow or drive to another location and open it along the way. That doesn't make much sense to me as the game would be in perfect condition if I opened it on the spot and the company would be making money on a an unused game. seems to me the guy didn't want to do his job and is just trying to waste my time by making me come back tomorrow or drive 5 more miles to another location. I'm not buying or trading any games from GameStop again as they always make things difficult when I go in there
