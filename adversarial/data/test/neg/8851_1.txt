Cool little dive cafe in the heart of Vegas.  Beach\/Surf shop theme yada yada.\n\nA buddy of mine and i shared an order of Sliders with Waffle Fries aka Crisscut Fries and a Grilled Chicken Sammich with a side of a fruit bowl.  I was given the impression that this was supposed to be a healthier alternative than most eatery given they served wraps, salads, smoothies, and stuff.  So I was quite let down when i held the CK sandwich and my fingers were all greasy and oily.  Wish they would slice up their grilled chicken too because that first bite took out one of the two piece of CK i had in the sandwich.  It's loaded with Mayo, Avocado, lettuce, and tomato.\nThe sliders came in 4 but it was pretty small and dainty.  Forgot if it had caramelized onions, but it at least had some sort of cheese. The Waffle Fries are good but who doesn't like Waffle Fries?  \n\nService was standard, and i hear they have good brownies.  But then again it's from my friend that raved enough about it to take me here. Soooo.. I need a second opinion before I ever come back.  Maybe I'm being harsh but my experienced was almost like eating at an EDR rather than spending money on food I want to eat.  It gets the job done.
