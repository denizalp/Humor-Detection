The ultimate professional!  Took  two  25 year old LazyBoys for work and they returned looking better than they did originally.  A large selection of upholstery fabric is available but he will also work with fabric you purchase elsewhere.  Costs are reasonable and customer service is an A+.  Seams are nice and smooth and detailing is impeccable.  He does work for many designers whose names he gave me for references.  Eddie and Chris will come to the house, assess the work, and give you the time and cost immediately.  Pickup and delivery is free.  My project included arm and head caps and he created, at my request,  a couple of \"neck\" pillows in just the right size and fill for watching TV from my comfortable new LazyBoys.  I intend to have them re-upholster my dining set and would, unquestionably, recommend them for your job.  I checked bids with 4 other establishments and Eddie beat them on all points of concern.  Call him first and save yourself time.
