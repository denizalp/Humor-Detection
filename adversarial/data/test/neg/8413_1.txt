Every time Im in town, this is my go to place.  Friendly staff, clean and well maintained.  Weights and machines are in great working order and magically always put back where they belong; which makes me feel like I caught a unicorn.  Serious gym with positive and encouraging atmosphere.  Keep it up all!
