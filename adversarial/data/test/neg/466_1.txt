Friend and I had the shredded beef Chimichanga plates with rice and beans.  Very run of the mill Mexican food, not bad, but nothing to get excited about.  The rice is very good and the beans are just so-so.  The guacamole however, is plain awesome!  The beef had little flavor so it was just something to fill up on.  I've definitely had better Mexican food.  The restaurant and our table were very clean and the service was good.  Nice place for a decent meal with no surprises.
