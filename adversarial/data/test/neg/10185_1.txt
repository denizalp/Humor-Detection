Having read the reviews, I was leery renting from these guys.  I am a regular, high status renter with several major rental agencies and actually double booked my reservation in case it was too much hassle. \n\nThe check in was smooth and fast, return was a breeze and the cost was nearly half.  The Hyundai Sonata was new, clean with just a few minor smudges of the paint.  Just note any damage and you won't be held to it. \n\nI would definitely rent again
