This place is pretty good. Prices seem a little high, but you get a good amount of food. I like the i think its called the \"valley plate\" or something like that. Its pancit, lumpia, and that purple rice. Good stuff 8 dollars. \n\nIf they happen to be at a place i am at i will stop by (like Glendale Glitters) or Wednesday farmers market downtown
