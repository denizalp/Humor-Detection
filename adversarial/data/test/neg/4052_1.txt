I took my little pup in to get groomed at this place for the first time today. My first impression was that the facility was clean and well kept. I was greeted by Marnie and Allison who were both friendly and welcoming to me and my dog. They took extra care with her, as she was previously abused and very timid in new situations. They were patient with my requests and also didn't charge me to keep her for awhile while I was driving back from across town.  When I picked up my dog, they were reassuring about how well my pup did and she looked absolutely perfect! Great service and great attitudes. Thank you ladies. I will definitely be coming back!
