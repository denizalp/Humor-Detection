This place is awesome great atmosphere and great food! I love sushi and my fianc√© does not but when we came to imperio 667 there was lots of mariscos for him to choose from that were not sushi, he had the fried fish and I could enjoy my sushi   ordered several rolls to share with friends and everyone loved them. Also the drinks are amazing!!! Definitely worth trying
