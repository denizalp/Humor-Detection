After living in DC for years, we became Mexican food snobs...this is superior to the best Mexican we've ever loved. Nearly everything is freshly made in house daily and you can taste the difference! Our server, Marcela, earned a 25% tip--she is lovely, efficient, attentive--outstanding service! We can't wait to return!
