In town for business and stopped in for lunch and was well pleased. \n\nLocation-near downtown and inside was very nice. \n\nService-Amazing waitress, she brought our group drinks without us asking and was very attentive to us. \n\nFood-smoked wings were very good. Bacon vinaigrette was fantastic and will order again.
