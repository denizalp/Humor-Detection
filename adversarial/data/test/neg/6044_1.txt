The two stars given to this particular (3rd) review of mine is only because of this one experience. Normally, I go in, everyone's friendly, I get what I need, and I leave happy.. albeit about $20-40 lighter. Well, since I've been noticing how much I spend here, I finally remembered to bring along one of the coupons they send out every week. It was a $3 off when spending $30 or more. Seems easy enough, right? Well..\n\nSo, I wandered around not finding much that I needed, but the boyfriend had a basket full of items he felt we needed. Realizing that mine alone is only going to cost about $10, I offered to combine our stuff and pay for it. The total before the coupon, but with sales tax was $33.03. The guy at the front of the store saw that I was having a lot of trouble with their little Bag-Your-Own-Stuff machines and did nothing. Then, a second person working (not a regular one) walked past me and again.. no one did anything. \n\nFinally, guy 1 comes over and explains that I needed to spend another dollar since the sales tax was causing the problem (like I knew that--nowhere on the coupon did it say this) and so I grabbed the nearest item- gum- and got the discount. This is the one and only time I've been at this location and couldn't wait to leave.\n\nWill I be back? Of course, there's not a closer Fresh & Easy by my house. Will I attempt to save money here again? No.
