OMG!!  This place is the best, best, best BBQ I have ever had!  My friend and I were looking for a place to eat after moving her back into her place.  We were not looking for anything in particular.  So I used Yelp to look for a place near her when I stumbled up on this little gem!  She said she had just heard that the place was one of the best in the whole U.S. and they did not disappoint.  We purchased a meal and some meat by the pound (pulled pork and ribs -ribs are only sold by the pound). I regret being there late that day (we got there at around 2 pm, I believe) because they were out of a lot of meats.  The service was super friendly and prompt!  The place is very unassuming, but don't let that full you.  It is worth the price, the trip, and the wait (yes, there is usually a line out the door).  I want to go back soon for some delish meats (wanna try the Brisket next!) . Little Miss BBQ, Thank you for existing in my lifetime! :)
