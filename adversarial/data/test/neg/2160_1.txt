I've come here about three years ago when this Dick's was brand new.  I knew what this place offered.  It was a football Sunday and the sports book was super crowded so we stopped in here to get some food and drinks while watching ten football games at once.\n\nOur server was pretty cool.  He brought paper for the tablecloth and threw napkins in our direction.  Yep they do have attitude here and any customer who can throw had better be ready to get it back.  They also do those paper hats with funny sayings on there.  They no longer have menus but a menu posted on the wall.  Those who are too far have to walk over to the wall to read it...any other place this sort of thing wouldn't do...but here at Dick's...hilarious!\n\nOne good redeeming thing about the food is their onion rings.  They were perfectly cooked with the right amount of crispiness.  Whoever did that batch, I bow to your skill.  The brisket sandwich I got was OK and the chicken tenders and fries that my friend got was not so hot.  Did I mention that most of this food was $12 and up?  $14 for chicken strips and fries?  Ridiculous!  AND, the beer selection has magically shrank since I last came here.  They used to have over 15 types of beer on tap here now all they got are the sad macrobrews that the gamblers get served outside plus Blue Moon(ran out that day) and Guinness.  I got a Guinness from them and it set me back $14!  Beer pricing also not shown when I ordered.\n\nI don't think I can describe how disappointed I am with all this Dick's has gone downhill since I was last here.  Please bring back the draft beer selection like Newcastle, Sam Adams, or Anchor Steam.  People come into your restaurant to have drinks that they can't get while gambling so if you have overpriced food plus minimal beer selection, then that's a recipe for disaster.
