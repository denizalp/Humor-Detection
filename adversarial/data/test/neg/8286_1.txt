My wife and I used Celebrity tux and tails for our wedding this past weekend: 2 fathers, 7 groomsmen, and a 6 year old all traveling from across the country. They delivered the tuxes on time as scheduled at the venue, and made necessary alterations on the spot when necessary. \n\nI'd definitely recommend this company to anyone getting married. The tuxes we received we're really high quality, and everyone in the group looked absolutely amazing. This company does really great work.
