Booked Specture Media for my 30th birthday. We had so much fun with the photobooth! The photo strips perfectly matched my luau theme. George showed up early, stayed a little over time and was polite and professional from booking til the very end. We're looking forward to getting our pictures in the mail! So glad I picked this business put of the multitude of options in town. \n\nWould definitely recommend. And will also be a return customer when I have another event.
