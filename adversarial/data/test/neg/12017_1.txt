This hidden gem is well worth the drive with many delicious offerings from eggs made any way you wish, 20 fresh bagel choices as well as various cream cheeses, fresh lox, amazing deli sandwiches and fresh toppings, matzo soup, etc. Menu is huge, there are options for everyone- it was 107* so we didn't risk it but we will be back for the desserts and those pecan bars!
