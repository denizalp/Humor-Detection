I really wanted to like this place. I've been here at least four times but quality of service is never consistent. The nail techs are always in such a rush - The last time the guy slopped through my manicure and a pedicure in under 40 minutes. I looked at my watch and the Massage that I was really looking forward to was less than 1 Min 30 sec. And after I sat at the dryer, he raced over to sit down and look at his iPhone!! Done coming here. I complained to the\nOwner and he acted like all the sudden he couldn't understand English.
