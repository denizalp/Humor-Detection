Huge fenced dog park on the east side! There's 2 entrances...one off Sycamore which has a double gate and parking lot, and one accessible from Pulley Dr. (street parking). There are tons of poop bags provided if you did not bring your own. This dog park used to be a landfill, so it is basically a giant hill. There are picnic tables at the top of the hill and near the Sycamore entrance where you can sit and watch your dog. Great for running around with your dog and meeting other dog owners. One thing to watch out for: make sure your dog doesn't drink out of the puddles there...could be leachate from the landfill.
