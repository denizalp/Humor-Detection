Friendly staff. Food not particularly spectacular but is up to standard for authentic korean cuisine. Side dishes use some room for improvement. My boy friend and I together ordered the bulgogi on sizzling plate with rice, vegetable soon tofu, and shared a seafood pancake. All came to a total of $40 with tips and tax. Reasonably priced for relatively good food! Sadly we forgot to take pictures in the presence of good food...next time!
