I've been going to Sammy's forever. Particularly at the Sahara location because they have a bar with gaming which is 24 hours.\nWhen I can go to a Bar and get good food rather than \"bar food\" it's always a plus for me. I've always ordered the duck tacos or a chopped chicken salad. Some other things I'd recommend are the Kobe beef sliders , A Pizza or the shrimp scampi. They do half orders on their salads which I recommend for 1 person since they are fairly large.
