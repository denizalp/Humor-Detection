If I could give them no stars I would. The girls who answer the phone are quite possibly the worst I have ever encountered. One in particular was completely rude and unprofessional to me from the time I answered the phone and they were returning my call. From that point forward every time I had phone interaction with her she was the same completely rude, and I would like to put some more descriptive obscenities here about her (the C word), which I NEVER use, but she was. Only because the warranty we have was forcing us to use them did we continue with the process. Fortunately I was able to get the warranty company to switch us to a GE factory guy. Seriously DO NOT USE ALL DESERT APPLIANCES THEY HAVE A TERRIBLE REPUTATION. They also have been given a D rating by the Better Business Bureau, so do not take a chance on these people.
