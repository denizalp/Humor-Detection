The portions were large and the presentation of the food was great :)!  I tried the House Hash \"Fresh Mushroom, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato, and fresh spinach.\"  Ultimately, I thought it was all good - but just to add one small complaint, the mushrooms seemed kind of funny - as if they weren't quite fresh... everything else was good though!
