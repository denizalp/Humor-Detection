Excellent food ! The service and ambience was great . The kudidehs (both chicken and beef) were excellent .. I have been to many Persian places in US, And Dubai but this is one of the best so far .. I would highly recommend anyone looking for Persian food .. One of the best thing is that they serve alcohol !! They do have nice collection ..
