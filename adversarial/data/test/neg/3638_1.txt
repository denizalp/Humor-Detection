I purchased a mountain bike from Bike Depot in Pickering July 2017.  This summer, I took it to another location for servicing and warranty work. They could not figure out what the problem was and after the 3rd failed attempt to fix it, they sent me back to the Pickering location to figure it out. Needless to say, I was getting frustrated with all the back and forth, but am extremely happy with the outcome. The guys at the Pickering location quickly figured out what the issue was and took care of it. The bike is now working like new. These guys really took the time to diagnose & resolve the problem correctly so I wouldn't have to return again!  They were incredibly professionally and competent!
