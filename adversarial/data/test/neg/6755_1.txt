I went into this place expecting the usual; some stylist or barber that didn't care what kind of experience I had or mess they left my hair in. To be up front, I hate getting my hair cut. I was not only surprised, but blown away. This place was great. I went in, ordered a Guiness and waited for a short amount of time before I was called. Normally the stylist wants to get me in, and get me out as fast as possible. That wasn't the case here, they took the time and care to give me what I was looking for, I didn't feel rushed or like I was imposing on them - quite the contrary I had a great conversation and a great time while getting my hair cut, which ended up being the best hair cut I have ever had.\n\nThen there was the bar. Come on, you can't argue with 2 dollar beers AND incredibly cheap warm and good quality sake. I went in with low expectations, came out with a great hair cut and to top it all off had a great time at their bar. \n\nThis place brings back customer service and the social aspect of getting your hair cut in a new and modern way. I have and will suggest this to everyone who will listen. Customer service, value and quality of product outshine their competition. This is truly a gem.
