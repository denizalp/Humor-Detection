Awful experience!  The burrito is small for the price you pay, and the sauces amd cheese all cost extra.  Your single burrito could cost you $15!  I had the steak burrito and the steak was so tough.\n\nThe worst part of this experience was they had problems with their soda machine and failed to tell us that prior to selling us a $3.50 soda.  When I asked for a refund, the woman said that she couldn't because she is not authorized to do a refund until her manager shows up! \n\nWarning!  Stay away!
