Mmmmmmm I love this little kabob JOINT! \nI'm Italian so it's a little tricky for me to type out\/say what I ordered lol, But you must try the MARINATED olives mmmm and the Yogurt cucumber dip with bread . I always order the BARG kebob, hudge portions (steak kabob with rice) \nGreat service, clean , adorable atmosphere
