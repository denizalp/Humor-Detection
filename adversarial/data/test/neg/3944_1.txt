Upon entering the restaurant, the initial thought was that it was nicely decorated and had a cool concept...went downhill from there.  There were no definitive system for customers to line up in and the employees were far from being friendly...they were unfriendly and rude - no greetings or even a 'how can I help you?'.  Yes, the signs do say 'line 1 al pastor', 'line 2 carnitas...', and so forth but customers around us didn't have a clue hat the process was, line formation interferes with the salsa bar, and if you're up - you proceed to the 'line' that is open even if you don't want the meat that is in that line and can't proceed to said line to order a different meat from a different line.  I specifically ordered al pastor tacos with onion and cilantro ONLY - I got everything on it and the employee proceeded to tell me it is what I wanted pushing the plate towards me and rudely told me if I don't want it he can probably make it again...  I just told him no as it felt like I was already inconveniencing him, he proceeded to wrap my plate up while talking about me to another employee in Spanish.  One, I understand Spanish and two, even if I didn't, it's obvious when someone is talking badly about someone else.  Paying for our food, was not a different story either.  $2.25 for a taco about half the size of an appetizer paper plate is still expensive.  Two stars, for concept, decor, bar option, food item varieties, and flavor of food.
