Camera Repair Services has been my 'go to' store for everything I need to enhance my photography.  From buying new lenses to full on repair; this place is great.  A wonderful, locally owned and operated store with steep ties in the community.  Every time I've gone in, everyone has taken the time to help ensure I'm good to go and my answers resolved.\n\nRecently, I had to drop off my Nikon D300S to get the CF Card Slot repaired after bending a few of pins.   Not only did they fix the pins with a brand new part but they also took the time to clean the camera sensor.  The repair was done within the time they said including cleaning all my lenses.\n\nI highly recommend this store to anyone in the Pittsburgh area.
