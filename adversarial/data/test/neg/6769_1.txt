went with a friend, we ordered tacos and some guacamole for an appetizer. The tacos came out first, pretty tasty. We sit for a while and drink our drinks, and then the waitress brings the check. When we asked about the guacamole, she went to the kitchen to check. She came back and said the cooks didn't make it, and now the kitchen was closed, but she'd take it off our check and bring the new bill. Except she walked off, leaving the original check with us, which only listed the tacos. So actually, she just never entered the order in for guacamole. Which is an acceptable mistake...what's not acceptable is lying to the customer and blaming another staff member.
