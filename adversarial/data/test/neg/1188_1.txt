Can someone please point out the reasons why anyone would frequent this place? Definitely not planning to come back. Maybe it was the indifferent yet holier-than-thou barista. Maybe it was the shitty coffee and food. Maybe it was the 3 millimeter thick film of filth covering every surface in the place. \n\nIn summary: Kiva Han is a dirty hipster dive.
