I can't even thank Dr Deka enough for being the wonderful OB that she is. A few years ago, a friend recommended Dr Deka (her medical assistant Gray, she's awesome) and after trying numerous OBs and not finding the right fit and no one knowing what to do about a health issue I had, I made an appointment with Deka. Deka is the kindest soul I've ever met! When I found out I was pregnant, I continued my care with Deka even though it was not close to my house (it's worth the drive if you're far!) my entire pregnancy Deka was able to answer all my questions as a first time mom and first pregnancy. She is so knowledgeable and makes wonderful recommendations for pregnancy issues. I was induced at 36 weeks because of preeclampsia and Deka truly cared about the health of me and my daughter. She is also amazing in the delivery room because she cheers you on and makes you determined to push that baby out!! LOL I would recommend Deka to anyone and will continue seeing her for future pregnancies! I also loved the office staff! The front desk girls are sweethearts! Always knew me by name when I came in & never had any issues with any medical assistants. Overall PV OBGYN gave me wonderful experiences and I know will continue to do so!
