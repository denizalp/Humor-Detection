A return trip to the Hofbr√§uhaus   Food seemed much better on our previous visit. While I realize this is a big operation so they are mass producing in the kitchen, I do expect the food to be good, not great. Two in our party got the sauerbraten and it was very tough. The schnitzel was as I would expect-good, not great.  Sauerkraut balls and onion rings were average at best. \n\nService was very good and our server very attentive. \n\nOverall, the service better than food. An added plus is the overall enthusiasm and upbeat ambience of the place.
