If I could give zero stars, I would. My husband and I recently bought a home that Finesse remodeled and we moved in a month ago. Since then, we have had nothing but problems with the horrible quality of work they did. Less than a week after moving in the towel rack in our bathroom started to fall out of the wall and when we contacted Finesse they said it was from \"wear and tear\" and wanted to charge us $250 to fix it! Basically saying that their work can't withstand a WEEK of usage! This week after a month in the House our bathroom shelf fell out of the wall... with nothing on it! If that wasn't enough, yesterday our entire spare bathroom and living room flooded from a blockage in the sewer system that a plumber said came from someone flushing caulking and drywall pieces down the toilet! I would not recommended this company to my worst enemy.
