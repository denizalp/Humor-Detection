I am in town for a couple of days and needed to get a mani\/pedi. I searched yelp for a place to go and found this nail spa had the most and best reviews.... I walked in and Donna was there to greet me. She took me right in and made sure I was comfortable as soon as I sat down. \n\nI had a wonderful manicure and pedicure and would recommend this spa, specifically, Donna.\n\nThank you , Donna!
