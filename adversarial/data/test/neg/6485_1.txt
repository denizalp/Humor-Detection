I went there last night on my way to a show at the Visulite. I was in a hurry which I made clear to my waiter so I didn't have time to get the restaurant week fest. Instead, I got two appetizers, the curry with a roti and a steamed eggroll type thing. I LOVED the curry, and the roti was perfect. The flavor of the curry was great, but i wish it had a little more consistency to it. since it was mainly liquid with maybe two small pieces of potato in it. Since it was served with a roti, I would have preferred a little more to grab rather than just dip. I also had a piece of sushi, the bobcat roll. Not the best piece of sushi I have ever had, but very good. I would go back here in a minute, but I think I will get the chicken curry next time!
