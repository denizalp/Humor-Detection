I loooooove Melt!!! It is such a fun and classic downtown Phoenix spot and an absolute can't miss on first Fridays!\n\nWhat's great about melt is their selection of flavors - it's ever-changing and totally takes advantage of seasonal produce. My favorite is the Cookie Monster, which is a blue cookie batter ice cream with Oreos, mills wafers, and chips ahoy! Their sorbets are also delicious - I love the lavender strawberry when they have it! Today I got the green tea, which was new to me but probably one of the best flavors I've had there. \n\nYou can get your scoop in a cute Chinese takeout box complete with a fortune cookie, or on a come (sometimes they can even shape it into a flower!) They have other toppings as well. \n\nThey also have candies and other snacks so be sure to bring your sweet tooth and your appetite when you stop by!
