A bit out of the way  to get to if you are visiting on the strip, but if you are a hard-core Raw Foodie, it is worth the drive. the menu is quite limited, but what is there is very well prepared and flavored. I think it's one of the best raw food friendly eateries in the valley.\nGenerally they will offer you a free sample of anything before you buy! That shows they stand behind their food, as they should.\n\nThey also have a little shop with a few things to buy.
