Light. Fresh. Cool. Delicious. Rita's Ice Custard is my kryptonite during the summer, especially the Pear and the Wild Black Cherry (though I have yet to not like a flavor).They are generous with their samples and the service is always friendly. The environment is clean and friendly. Loooovvvveee me some Rita's!
