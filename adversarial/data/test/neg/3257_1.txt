Purple rice on your sushi!! Yes purple so unique and it tastes delicious. They actually use black rice instead of white rice and i think it's a great idea. I'm glad i found this little spot in Downtown Phoenix. From what i saw it is only sushi so if you're not a sushi person just come prepared to not have the side dishes that typical spots have. However my friend that doesn't have sushi had the veggie rolls and she loved them! I had the Las Vegas roll and holy cow it was delicious. I can't wait to go back and try their other rolls
