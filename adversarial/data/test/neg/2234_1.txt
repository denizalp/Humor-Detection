I have been seeing my nail artist Chau (pronounced like \"chow\") for almost 3 years, and have followed her to this salon. She always provides AMAZING service, and can do basically any design in gel manicures or S&S powder mani's - I wouldn't see anyone else, and people always ask me where I get my nails done. Call and ask for her specifically, you'll love her and your nails!
