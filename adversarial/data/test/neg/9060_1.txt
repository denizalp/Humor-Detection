The new facility is MUCH better and I definitely think families will feel more comfortable here. Check out my pictures! There is a uni-sex locker room with individual showers and stalls for changing. I think this is a huge improvement. \n\nMy daughter still begs to swim every week so there is no way we are ever leaving Water Wings. The staff is getting much better with customer service as well! I'm assuming this is because there has been some promotions within. I know their check-in system is a bit complicated (for no reason I'm sure) but I've seen more and more training with this aspect so they are definitely working on known issues. I had a class change recently but was also booking makeups and Rebecca was spot-on with my changes and provided superb customer service. She really made me feel confident that the changes were done correctly. This obviously saved me time and heartache. \n\nAs always the instructors are great, just to name a few, Victoria, Andrew and Adam have all been wonderful to my little munchkin. Thanks to all. \n\nI would always recommend Water Wings and am their biggest advocate!
