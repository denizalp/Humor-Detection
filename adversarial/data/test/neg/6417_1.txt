The first time I came to HH I had a wonderful and beautiful bowl of oatmeal so I was looking forward to coming back and trying another creation.  After a 20 min wait,  yes open tables everywhere. ..it doesn't seem like it would be hard to figure out that the resturant needs extra staff during the world series of poker. ..but who knows...we were finally seated. We asked the hostess  if we could sit in the booth, there were two open at the end of a bank of six. .no!  She rudely said.  That section is closed.  Who the hell divides a section on the middle of a bank of booths?  And seriously that doesn't make sense to a customer who sees booths open and is offered a crappy table. Ok.  Fine crappy table.  Then the people in line behind us were seated next to us at another crappy table. ..however they had a waitress. ..ours didn't make an appearance.  They got coffee,  we got coffee. ..they had their order taken and when they said to their waitress that we were first in line and if she could take our order she said that's  not my section. She takes their order and left us to our own freaking twilight zone section.  Finally I had to get up and ask the hostess to please send someone to take or order since 10 mins had now passed. And once the waiter did arrive he was very nice,  making recommendations. .etc...but there is something wonky in a system where waists disappear for so long.  Then my dish came out and I can honestly say it was a little disgusting.  The nice smoked salmon was actually a big chunk of fatty grossness...an inch thick salmon fat steak on a biscuit. Ick.  So between the wait,  the rough start and the questionable quality ingredients (ps, a cup of coffee is $3.99..and I don't know if they're just taking the farmhouse theme a little too far but it is burned, dirty and truly not worth the investment) I'm going to say...don't waste your time on this place.
