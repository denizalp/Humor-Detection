So... I have visited this place twice in the past two weeks. \n\nThe first go, boyfriend and I walk in... We've been here before. We know the food is good. So it was a bit of a surprise when the girl that was supposed to seat us told us there's a wait and there's open tables. We sit down at a bench waiting. It was 9:30 or 10:00 and it wasn't crazy busy. The front girl sits a couple of military men that showed up the moments before us.  The girl stands around, three or four groups of people leave after eating and we waited about 8 minutes. The manager came over grabbed some menus, told us to follow him, tossed the menus on the table and walked away, telling the front girl that there shouldn't be people waiting with open tables. He doesn't tell us that someone will be with us or anything. We sit there at a booth waiting for another 10 minutes before a waitress even acknowledges us. So, obviously we're already frustrated. We decided to leave. And chalk it up to a bad day for service there. \n\nThis time... We walk in we're seated immediately and with a smile. So we think everything is back to normal. And a waitress comes over to take the order from another table right next to us. At this point it's been 7 minutes before she acknowledges us... That's okay, maybe she'll get our drink order or tell us she'll  be right with us and actually do it. No. She says she'll be with us, and walks away. Puts that other order in and hangs out talking to another waitress for a bit and disappears. We wait for a total of 12 minutes.\n\nNormally we have more patience. But I think we were sour from the last time and just expected better from Lumberjacks. \n\nIt's not a one star because I know the food is good... When the service exists. \n\nTl;Dr -  bad service, waited too long for service. Left.
