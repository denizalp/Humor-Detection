Great Hot Sauce if you like it (HOT)!....I have eaten here more than half a dozen times and what I have eaten is good, but you are made to sit and then order from a waitress who once has served you doesn't seem to know you are still a guest.  It seems from my experience that you are only made to sit down instead of go to the counter to order is so you will feel like you need to leave a tip before you leave. The problem is however the atmosphere feels more like some of the other BETTER MEXICAN food places to choose from in the area where you can order at the counter and then are able to eat in or take your food out.  \n\nFor a so called sit down restaurant where atmosphere and service should but are not part of the deal, this place gets about  1\/2 a star from me.  I will add that for food quality alone I could go as high as four stars but for the reasons already stated along with the higher prices one has to pay for what this place has to offer by comparison to so many better choices this place overall gets just 2 STARS from me.
