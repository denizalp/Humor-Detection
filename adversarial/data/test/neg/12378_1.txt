The food is ok, not authentic. I was a regular customer until the lady who sits at the counter was rude to me. I pointed that out politely and she said that they receive too many customers and they cant speak politely to everyone. So, if you are looking for an example of how to turn away regular customers, this is your place. Will never go back, ever.
