The Aruba Hotel gets four stars NOT for the rooms, I have never personally lay ed my head on any pillows there. However, that being said I have spent enough time here to give it a rating. Their bar is so fun and unpretentious. They have swing lessons on Fridays and they always have some great exhibition of local art hanging. With good drink prices and a seedy lowbrow location, this place is a great place to hang and relax.
