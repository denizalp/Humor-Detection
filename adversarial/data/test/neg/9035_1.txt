The service was excellent and the food was fantastic.  They started by giving us complimentary biscuits with chicken and it was delicious.   Then I ordered the 1\/2 Fried chicken and it was juicy and tasty.  Then for desert I went for the Peach Cobbler which was probably one of the best deserts I have had in a while.  I recommend this place for anybody in Vegas looking for a fun and laid back place to eat.
