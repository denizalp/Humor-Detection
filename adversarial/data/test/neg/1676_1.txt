Melanie was amazing today. I was there with my 11 year old son and his 2 friends. We had never had it before and she was so patient and helpful and kind. She made me a customer for life!!! This place is not a sno cone. It's better.  And the flavors.  Definitely something for everyone. Thanks Melanie and Bahama Bucks.  You guys are awesome!!!
