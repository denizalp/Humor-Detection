If I could give this place no stars I would. I checked in for two nights at this horrible place. They charged me $692 which was only supposed to be $131 plus the $100 deposit. I called to the front desk to discuss the issue he was COMPLETELY RUDE and even HUNG UP ON ME. I went down there to explain that they charged me $131 4x and he said they only charged it 3 times. However on my bank statement it shows 4 time! He would not even let me speak even started yelling at me when I was trying to show him. I have never had an experience like this in my life! STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. You will have a better room and service at a motel 6!
