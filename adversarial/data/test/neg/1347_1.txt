While on vacation in Mesa our Jeep's air conditioning system stopped working properly...it would not shut down.  In addition the automatic function of our headlights stopped working at the same time.  If you've ever experienced a problem with your vehicle while on vacation away from home then you know the problem of finding a good, honest and knowledgeable mechanic.   \n\nThe area of Mesa we were staying in has a lot of auto repair shops within a few blocks.  As I was driving by on a Sunday afternoon scouting the area for a repair shop I noticed that the doors to the AC DC shop were open so I stopped and found the owner, Ernie Arrieta, working in the office.  I'm a fairly good judge of character and after describing the issue to Ernie he was confident that he could determine the problem and fix it and I judged him to be trustworthy and honest.   \n\nI made an appointment for first thing the next morning and less than 2-hrs after dropping off my Jeep he called to tell me that the problem had  been located and fixed (basically the on-board computer had to be reset) and as a bonus he offered to show me how to reset the computer myself should the problem recur.  \n\nMy instinct to trust Ernie and AC DC automotive repair was right so I can enthusiastically recommend AC DC Automotive Repair.  \n\nThe shop is located towards the back of a small plaza (The Los Alamos Plaza) containing other auto repair businesses on the south side of Main Street about 1\/4 mile east of Lindsay in Mesa AZ.  He also operates a mobile repair van which will come to you if you can't come to him.
