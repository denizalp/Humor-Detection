This is hands down my favorite HT in the area.  Huge, clean, great selection and most importantly always has everything in stock.  Prepared meal options range from salad and asian bars, handmade pizza, subs and sushi.  There are always loads of samples to try as you shop.  And the cashier's are always super friendly.  It is always packed but has plenty of parking.  As their jingle goes, \"my harris teeter\"
