I came to Zero Degrees with my fiancé just to try something new and was pleasantly surprised. The food was not only instagram worthy but it was also delicious! We got an order of HotCheeto fries which are thin crispy fries drizzled with melted cheese and piled high with a layer of what seems to be ground up Hot Cheetos. The fires were fantastic and only $5 for an extremely generous serving. As another meal option we got the garlic butter siracha wings. These wings were cooked to perfection they were so rich and moist inside and had a beautifully crispy exterior that was coated in the most delectable buttery glaze. We got ranch with these for only 25 cents but didn't use it as the wings didn't need any help with flavor at all and it seemed almost a sin to dip them because of how good they were. We got two different beverages, my fiancé got a spicy watermelon slushy which was extremely refreshing in the Vegas heat. The flavor of the slushy was a very fresh cut watermelon and a subtle but present spice that was not overwhelming but a well placed flavor enhancer. I got a strawberry mojito which was alcohol free. It was a very pleasant combination of muddled strawberries and mint with crushed ice. The mojito also had a mango tower which was perfectly ripened and half coated with chamoy and Tajín. The mango was so fresh and had such a wonderful flavor. Overall we would definitely recommend this place and will likely come again in the future! It was well worth the 30min drive it took us to get there.
