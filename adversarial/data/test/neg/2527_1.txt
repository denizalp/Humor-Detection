I've been to this taco Bell twice through the drive thru and both times I sat waiting for 10 mins before I even got to the area where you place your order as they take forever! Once you place your order it takes another 10 mins to get your food!  Thought the first time it happened was just a fluke,  but seems like the staff is high on something because of their demeanor. .. Very slow and \"heavy eyed\" never going to this location again.
