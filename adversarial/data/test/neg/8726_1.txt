Went here on a Sunday to try their Sandwich of the Month, the Chicken Gobbler! Its like the Bobbi at Cap's but with chicken and mashed potatoes instead of turkey and mayo. The sandwich was yummy, everything works well together. My only criticism is that the sandwich was very messy to eat even after slicing it in half and I think a big reason why is because they put mashed potatoes w\/gravy both on top of the chicken strips and underneath. \n\nI didn't order any fries, but one of the managers was kind enough to bring some with my meal which I greatly appreciated! I forgot what brand of soda they use but I like the change from Pepsi and Coke and that they use cane sugar vs corn syrup. \n\nAnother thing I liked was their silver trash compactors although when I put my food in it it didn't seem to compact. Either way, it impressed me as trash is usually an afterthought and companies will get the same designs we see over and over.
