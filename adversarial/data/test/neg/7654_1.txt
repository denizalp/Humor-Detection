My friend and I were walking around and we saw a sign saying French macaroons! These are my favorite so we decided to go in. The location was closed so we were looking in the window to check it out. Then Aunt Abby came and unlocked the door.. An hour after it had closed! She and her pastry chef were so welcoming and let me in my friend come in and look. They had every flavor of macaroons that you could imagine! They gave us multiple samples and every single one was mouth watering delicious! These macaroons are seriously the best I've ever had! Thanks Aunt Abby! I found my new favorite place!
