Gotta say, I wanted to dislike this place based on a friends experience and some of the reviews.  HOWEVER, this placed rocked with many dishes with subtle flavors and those with complexity.     \n\nYes, you're going to drop some change and yes, the portions are not Red Lobster all you can eat chow down.  This place is about elegant food in an elegant environment.  \n\nIt might not be for all, so really check yourself before going as to what really pleases you.  \n\nIf you're all about cheap quantity, move on.  If you're about experiencing fine food as artistry, then go and go quickly.
