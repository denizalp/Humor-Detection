This place blew me away. I really enjoy comfortable, dark pubs & not only was it comfortable, but it was romantic as well. The flowers & dim candle light make for an excellent casual date night. \n\nThe food. Oh my gosh! I & my boyfriend were in heaven. The Lamb Pops with the cherry sauce was like crack topped with sprinkles. (I've never smoked crack, but you get the point) Even something as simple as green beans is taken to a whole new delicious level at the DM. (It goes down in the DM ;) ) Our service was excellent! She really went above & beyond to make our evening special.I love when places leave the cute pitchers of water on the table, because we drink A TON of water. \n\nIt's within walking distance to the Knights Stadium. A suggestion to the fellas: Take your girl to a Knights game, afterwards treat her to casual yet amazing dinner at the Dandelion Market. You will be super glad you took my advice.
