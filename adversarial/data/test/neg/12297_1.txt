I have stopped in to this subway several\nSunday's over the past few months.   Each time they were out of several key ingredients.   This last Sunday the 13th they were completely out of coins.  Standing in line I overheard several grumbly customers as they were told over and over that the items they wanted were not available.  The reason for the 3 stars that I awarded them was the charming smiling girl on the line named Hannah.  Wow what an asset this girl is even in the face of the store setting her up to fail by not having what she needs to make the guests happy this young lady continued to be calm and polite and friendly.  Her coworker Kaitlyn was also smiling and friendly and Subway it is your job to set them up for success.  Imagine what an awesome experience it would be to have these great kids wait on you and to be able to eat what you want not just what they have!!!
