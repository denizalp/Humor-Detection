Just moved to NC from SoCal with my fam, and have been carefully researching a place to find some good BBQ but at the same time, a nice place to take the wifey. After hearing many locals talk about Smoke, we decided on our \"date night\" we would give it a shot!\nNice place in terms of ambiance. We were first sat at a bar table which was a little odd as it wasn't very busy and there was tons of open, cozy booths. After asking if we could be switched, we had a nice cozy booth and a really nice waiter who greeted us with a little background on the smoking style and history of the reataraunt. REALLY nice guy who was accomadating and helpful with menu selection\/choices.\nAfter that, things went a little sour. To start, I was given the wrong salad with the wrong dressing. No biggie as it's just a salad, and the salad I got was pretty good. No big whoop. Entrees came. I decided on the burndt ends w\/ Korean BBQ sauce which was quite good. Good smokey flavor with a nice carmelazation and delicious sauce. Wifey went with the salmon, and we both opted for the Mac n cheese as many said in reviews it was delicious. \nMy wife's salmon was raw in the middle. I don't mean like a little pink, I mean like sashimi-raw! On top of that, her Mac n cheese was gooey\/creamy and good, while mine was bone-dry and covered in hard cheese.\nI really wanted to fall in love with this place. The potential was there, but the inconsistency will likely hold us back from returning.\nFor what it's worth. They cooked my wife a brand new piece of salmon, along with another Mac n cheese that was even more gooey-delicious than the other two! Both were delicious, and they even let me sample their \"smoke-slaw\" before ordering which was also fantastic! Our waiter was super cool, and despite the errors and inconsistency, they were quick to fix everything, and the chef even walked us out 2 free appetizer cards himself and apologized! \nThis woulda easily been a 5 star, but just have to be brutally honest!
