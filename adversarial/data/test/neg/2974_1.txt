This review is based on the last time I ate here which was last year and I have not been back here since. \n\nThe food here is ok, I have definitely had better elsewhere, but what put me off the most about this place was the glass that was given to you to drink out of, it smelled so bad, like dirty wet towels left to dry in a dark moist area, the glass did not seem like it was glass to how cloudy it was. The silverware had watermarks on it. To top it off whilst we were trying to eat our meals there were flies lingering around. \n\nTo end in something positive our server at that time was very nice and the service was good.
