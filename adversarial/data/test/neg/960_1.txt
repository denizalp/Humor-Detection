I love the seasonal pedicures! They give you a themed cocktail that changes each month. My fav was chocolate in December! Jacqueline does my manis and pedis and is amazing at nail art! Felicia does my facials and spray tans. She does awesome work too. My skin and nails always look great thanks to these ladies. Everyone is really nice and they provide great customer service.  The membership program gives you discounts on products and services. I can't imagine going anywhere else. I've referred several people and they love it too.
