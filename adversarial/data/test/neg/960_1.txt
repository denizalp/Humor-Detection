My wife and I have been coming to Juan's ever since it opened a little over a year ago. We have always had great food and are so happy to have another really good Mexican restaurant close to home. We've taken many of our guests here as well and they have all enjoyed the food and the excellent service. Juan and his staff have always provided prompt, friendly service and work as a team. We usually go for lunch and most times opt for the \"flaming fajitas\" as they are our favorites.
