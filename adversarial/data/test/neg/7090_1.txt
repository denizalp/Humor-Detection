So this is a late review as we ate at Yardbird on the 30th of May.\nWe were seated early and had the BEST service and food. The new front of the house young man was very attentive and friendly and was nice enough to bye our dessert. Our server was great as well he knew when to show up, was friendly and informative but not overly, which is nice. The food is really good! Would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great laid back eatery.
