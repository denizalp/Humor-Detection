Great experience! Farida is very sweet and calming. My eyebrows came out great! I've had some negative experiences with threading before but she did such a good job. She recognized that I was a student and even offered me the student discount! I feel comfortable highly recommending her to anyone and everyone looking for affordable quality eyebrow therapy:)
