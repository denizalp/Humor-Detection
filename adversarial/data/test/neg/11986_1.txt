Awesome magician, comedian, and all-around performer! My fianc√© and I definitely left the show with a big goofy smile on our faces. You're able to take pictures or get autographs after the show with him. Very nice man. I definitely recommend this family-friendly show to everyone for someone looking for something to do in the afternoon!
