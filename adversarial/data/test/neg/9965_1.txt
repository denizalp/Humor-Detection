I've been to this restaurant a few times but for pickup only and that was many years ago... but recently I went there for dine in at 3am with a few friends. We walked in and was seated at a table that looked a little cray cray, cause the cups and dishes weren't neatly placed on the table...We decided what we wanted to order and was ready to tell the server but he said \"write it down\" and then left.. the service there was okay ... as we waited we poured tea  one of the cups had food or something strange on it . We asked them for a new one, which they asked why and we said it was dirty. So the server got one from the next table. The food came and it smelled very good, it tasted good also. I would go back one day, but for pickup only. ***sorry I don't remember the names of the food, but it was  yummy***
