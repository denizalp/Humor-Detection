The Fox Restaurant folks know how to run restaurants.  They are all similar versions of one another, each with it's own twist on various cuisines.  We've only dined there once as we don't normally travel downtown just to dine out, but the food was excellent, service was great, and the atmosphere was very welcoming.  It has to be nearly perfect for me to give 5 stars so this 4 star rating is as good as it gets for most really good restaurants.
