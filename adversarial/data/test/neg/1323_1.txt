Went there with my boyfriend and didn't know what to expect since I've heard mixed reviews. We got there at 8:30 and their reverse happy hour was during that time. We ordered crab puffs, 2 Vegas rolls and 2 crunchy California rolls and also got miso soup. It was high quality sushi and I was more than satisfied. All together our total came to 26 dollars or so which is not bad at all, taking into consideration how sushi can be expensive. I will definitely be returning!
