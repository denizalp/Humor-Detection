We stopped here before we headed back home and we are glad we did as the restaurant holds up to its reputation.  My husband had fish and chips and I had the Reuben.  Both were excellent and huge servings.  Our server was very friendly and attentive.  The restaurant was built in the early 70s and has a retro disco like atmosphere that includes stained glass chandeliers with flamingos on them .  Be sure to check out the bar too, which has comfy sofas and fire pits to sip drinks around.  We loved this place and will be sure to make it our Vegas tradition.
