I have been getting my hair done by Sara B. for about 4 years now. She does an amazing job, and my hair has only become healthier and healthier as the years pass. She knows exactly what I want even if I'm not up front about it. Cuts, color, and style, Sara knows exactly how to make hair fit every unique face! I have been offered free color, cuts, and styles in the past, but Sara is the only person I truly can trust with my hair.... 4 year and going strong!!! Thanks Sara!!!!
