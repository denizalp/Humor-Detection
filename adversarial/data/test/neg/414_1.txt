Well, I tried the Brown Sugar BLT because I like bacon and brown sugar and the picture looked really good. It was not good, at all.  It looked nothing like the picture, the bacon was totally crispy and crumbled all over the table, there was a thick layer of brown sugar coating the bacon which was so sweet it was like eating spoon fulls of brown sugar right out of the box.  You have to try it to believe it, but i wouldn't waste the money.  Now, their smokehouse sandwitches are good.  So are their club sandwitches.
