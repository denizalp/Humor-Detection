This place is magically.\n\nI spent several hours looking for a quiet place with good food that was OFF the strip.  I'm am in Vegas visiting while my boyfriend works.  I'm pretty big into fitness and eating REAL FOOD which (if you've ever visited Vegas before you know) it's pretty hard to find along the strip.  \n\nHoney Salt is an adorable place hidden in the corner of a shopping mall in a nice part of town.  They have an awesome hipster vibe with a gorgeous brick wall on one side and a wall with mirrors of different sizes scatted around.\n\nWe started with the salt and pepper fries.  They are just regular fries, nothing too crazy about them (they are good).  I know this is weird, but my boyfriend and I dipped them in the honey butter that they serve with the bread.  So good having a mix of salt and sweet!\n\nI had the special that day, braised lamb with chickpeas and carrots.  Simply amazing.  A perfect blend of flavor and spices.  My boyfriend had the Ahi Tuna entree. It looked delish, but a little small.\n\nFinishing the night out we had the peach pie with coffee. Can't say enough about it.  Fresh, yummy... you've gotta try it!\n\nScott was our server and he was seriously amazing. He called a cab for us and made our experience even better.\n\nI think this is the longest Yelp review I've ever written, but I can't say it enough...you HAVE to go check out Honey Salt!
