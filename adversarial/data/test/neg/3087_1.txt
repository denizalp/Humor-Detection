For those of us who aspire to become a rock star of the next Canadian Idol...well, Ducky's is a great place to go...\n\nFor those of us who just like watching people try to be the next rock star or Canadian Idol (aka me)...well, Ducky's is a great place to go...\n\nI used to live a block away so I've been there a few times. I've only ever sang once (Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen) and I'm pretty sure the dj turned the volume way down on us - could have been the fact that my friend and I were talking during the song asking each other if we were good or not. Ahhhh liquid courage :)\n\nIt's a super chill spot - there's a pool table and once you've had fun here, you can move on to any number of bars and pubs that are close by.\n\nDucky's is something different than your average pub...so go check it out sometime!
