The service is the AWFUL!  I've been trying to get help purchasing a chandelier for 5 days.  The store manager Marie is very unprofessional and when I tried to ask a different sales person for help his response was \"Oki-Doki\".  Hopefully corporate sees all these terrible reviews and can make some changes.
