The pretzel fondue is terrific! Also recommend the turkey bbq sandwich.\n\nI've been to this restaurant a few times and the only concern I have is that it gets too busy.  While it's great to see a business thrive, I find the staff sometimes doesn't know how to handle the amount of business it has.  More help might do the trick.
