Very cute bakery when we visited champaign. Nice decor, vintage and welcoming when you walk in. Cupcakes on tiered platters, pastel colors around. A bit pricey, but good cupcakes. Would definitely go back next time we are in town. Seems to be a favorite in town. Located in an area with other small shops and restaurants.
