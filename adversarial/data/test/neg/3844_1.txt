The program far exceeded my expectations. I didn't have a ton of weight to lose but I lost much more rapidly than I expected to (20#s in about 28 days). I have also had good success keeping the weight off in the last month since finishing the program and am learning to eat consistently better. As long as you are committed to following the protocols it will be worth it!
