I've always lived over 15 min away from Line Thai and I will always drive to this place if I am wanting Thai food. \n\nWe have gotten many dishes from them but our favorite is between their Pad Thai or Pad See Yew! Oh they are both so good! The other dish is their Pannang (peanut curry) which has always been my favorite Thai dish. They have the perfect spice and amazing flavor in all of their foods and the owners are very professional and kind.\n\nIf you are dining in, you will get a nice feel of their culture and good service. \n\nYummy food and worth it!
