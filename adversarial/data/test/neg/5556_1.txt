I used to frequently visit the Panera Bread on Fort Apache and Tropicana. I loved the casual setting and even more so was satisfied with the food. \n\nWhen I found out that a Panera Bread was opening up in Boca Park, I was ecstatic! Another option on the list for a hang out\/eatery in the area made me a happy gal. I went on a lazy Sunday late afternoon to meet and dine with a friend. The restaurant itself is huge with lots of seating. Lots and lots of it, it's twice the size of the one on Fort Apache and Tropicana. They also have an outside patio area for customers to use. \n\nI always get the You Pick Two deal which include any two from their soups, half a salad or half a sandwich. Depending on the salad or the sandwich, this deal will run you about $8-$10. I got their Spinach Power salad (mushrooms, egg, onions, bacon and spinach in an onion vinaigrette) and French Onion Soup with a side of bread. Portions were good and tasted delicious. \n\nThis place has free wifi! So if you're looking for a hangout spot, a study spot, a grub spot, or just a spot to sit and stare, this is the place! I really appreciate that this place popped up here because there are a lot of instances where I would have to turn away from Sambalatte because there wouldn't be anywhere to sit to get some work done! I'm not saying Panera is my second option to Sambalatte, but I'm glad I now have another option.
