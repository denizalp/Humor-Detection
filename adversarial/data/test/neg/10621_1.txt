I thought I would try again, seeing as I was in the area. $30 for lunch and I left still hungry. I had a ceviche as an appetizer, which looks much better on the menu. It was good, not for $9.75. For the main I had the Chirizo Hueracha, which is about the size of a bruschetta appetizer. Again, another $9.75. It was thin in both substance and taste. I kept adding the ceviche to beef up the flavour. Add a coke and a small side of guac and I was just south of $30. \n\nNope...
