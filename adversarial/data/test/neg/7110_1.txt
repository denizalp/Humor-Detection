Staff is polite. Not all aspects of treatment cost and payment up front was explained in consult but it was clear at front desk. Treatment scheduling very easy. Little nervous hearing staff telling callers that Dr Rostan on leave and \"they are pretty sure she'll be back mid month but have not talked to her this week\".
