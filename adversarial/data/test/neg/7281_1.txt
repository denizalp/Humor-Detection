I was optimistic when I saw the reviews on TA touting the great hotel.  Yes, the location and physical structure is nice and new, but I found the people\/service part of the hotel experience to be lacking.  I got to the hotel about noon and fully expected to need to wait for a room.  The female agent said 3pm, and she also said they were sold out last night and that night as well.  She took down my telephone number and \"promised\" to call me when ready to check in.  5 pm rolled around with no call from the hotel, so I decided to make my way back for check in.  Brent assisted me and confirmed my Marriott Rewards gold status match because I have SPG gold.  I don't know the Marriott elite travel perks or benefits and Brent never mentioned a single one of them to me, but did make sure to tell me about the hotel bar, restaurant, happy hour, etc.  I got to the room (average), low floor with no free bottled water that SPG members are used to having when checking in.  At check out, I asked the agent what do Marriott gold members receive and she told me, along with anything I wanted to take from the adjacent pantry!  Thanks for being clued in, Brent!  I know Marriott is the new owner of Starwood and their SPG program.  I also know Marriott doesn't reward their loyal guests like Starwood did.  This was my first Marriott stay since the program was taken over and I am definitely looking around to the other loyalty programs:  Hilton Honors or IHG Rewards Club.
