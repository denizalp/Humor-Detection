Okayyyy so I used to LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.\n\nup until my last vist 10\/14-10\/17\n\n1. no robes\n2. broken phone\n3. locked out of our room 4 times because the keys didnt work \n(took 45 min to get help.still the staff couldnt figure it out so they took apart the door)\n4. valet took 45 min\n5.customer service was an ass\n\nnever never never booking with them again. 5 times is a charm i guess.\n\npay 800 for 2 nights and get shitty service..NO THANK YOU!
