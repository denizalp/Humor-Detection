This places rules! The food is BOMB. Highly recommend anything with the short ribs in it OR the waffle battered wings. The wings will honestly change your life. The vibe here is exactly what you are looking for 100% of the time. You would be cheating yourself if you didn't come check out this lovely neighborhood bar! The secret weapon is Christina. She was such a delight and gives some of the best service I have seen in the Phoenix area. Cheers to Christina and keeping The Porch alive and well! Xo
