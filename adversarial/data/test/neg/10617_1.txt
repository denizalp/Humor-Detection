I have been going to Biketek for almost 6 years over which time I have bought quite a few bikes (from my daughter's cruiser to mtb to carbon race and triathlon bikes).  I continue to return to Biketek despite living on the other side of town where it is more convenient to go to another shop.  Their friendly, enthusiastic and professional staff offer outstanding service.  I appreciate their honesty and integrity.  They recommend what is right for you, and not necessarily what will bring them the most profit from a sale. (If you have every been to a bike shop and felt like you were buying a used car, you know what I mean).  I cannot offer a higher recommendation for a bike shop.  I will go no where else. Frank and his staff are the best!
