Food was typical Chili's which is what you expect when you go there, but terrible service, sat at the bar and the bartender was never behind the bar the entire time we had lunch. Never refilled out tea and had to ask for a beer. Then had to flag someone for our check. Restaurant had a horrible cleaned my smell as well. Choose someplace different, Chili's just isn't the same for a quick bite and a beer.
