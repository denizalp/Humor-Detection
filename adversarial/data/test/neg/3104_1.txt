Amazing service, amazing food, amazing beer, did I mention that everything was just great? Keep in mind that on Friday their kitchen opens at 5pm while bar opens at 4pm. Every single dish was amazing. The wheat beer we tried was tasty and refreshing. We had squid, snails, salmon and my personal favourite - pork belly! Every dish we had I would order again! Amazing. Will defined be back.
