It is a very conveniently located breakfast place but the service needs to be improved. We ordered a breakfast sandwich and they told us it will take about 5 minutes. After a minute or so they put out a breakfast sandwich and my son grabbed it thinking was his. Thank God, I pay attention to my surroundings there's a lady who is browsing near the beverages and I told my son that should be her's. We asked her and she said yes. As part of the customer service, the store staff should know who ordered what and who get first. They didn't say a word while we sorted out our own. I hope Westin management team will look into this because this is one of the best resorts I ever stayed.
