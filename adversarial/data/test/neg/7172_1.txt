If I could give ten stars for customer service and making it right Nicole gets my utmost respect. She promptly replied to my post and apologized.  We both agreed that what I was looking for in color was something they do not do being that they stick to their model of excellence in providing the most natural color service as possible. Nicole went above and beyond to make me feel heard and validated, she even provided me referral she thought would meet my needs.  I would definitely highly recommend Snapdragon Salon, in fact I am going to see about getting my daughter in for a back to school cut and color.  Please disregard my previous review. I should have been woman enough to speak to them directly.
