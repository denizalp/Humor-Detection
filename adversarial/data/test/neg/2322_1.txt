The Gelato here is better than all others I have tried in this area.  Most notably, the texture of their Gelato is perfect, which most other places screw up.  Also, the flavors are full and delicious. \n\nIf you go during the day or before 5pm, there is rarely a line. But later in the evening you may end up waiting 20 to 30 minutes.
