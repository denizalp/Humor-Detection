Awesome! I've never heard of this place before, and we found it through Yelp! It's a small place to sit and watch, but the personalities are not small at all! The improv group was hilarious, a little crude, a little rude, but all funny. I would totally recommend it, grab a drink at Wet Willies and some fries and enjoy the show. For the improv group, it was $10 cash. You can reserve a spot online, and I did (just to see if it were necessary). It wasn't reaaaally necessary. But if you have a big group, I would reserve your spot online so you can get a comfy couch.\n\nIt's in the back of Wet Willies, NOT the Comedy Zone. It was a little confusing when we got there.
