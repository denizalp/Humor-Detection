We are new to the area and couldn't get our garage door openers to match to our cars.  We also had a keypad on the outside that we couldn't program.  We called Parker Doors as the previous homeowner had left their card.  While waiting for our appointment we discovered one of our neighbors garage opener was now opening our doors!  Anthony arrived as scheduled and was very professional and courteous.  As our openers were vintage 1990 it was difficult to get them to match our cars. Given the issue with our neighbor opening our doors we decided to go for an upgrade for more current technology in an opener.  We had the new openers in by the next day.  Very happy with the service and relieved to know our doors won't be magically opening without our knowledge!
