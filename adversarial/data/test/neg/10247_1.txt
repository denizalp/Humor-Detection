It's the worst experience I've ever had, I took my son today for his appointment and when they call him we're supposed to go with him but they hold us and took my son who's 9 years old inside so we're waiting for him and when I ask what they're doing front desk told me their doing cleaning, which we don't even know and they did X-ray without us knowing it. Then telling us what's the copay coz they will  pull my son teeth because they put that gap silver thing on my son now the teeth are coming out on top of his gum
