We went with Kevin because of these Yelp reviews and were not at all disappointed. We were grateful. First of all, his response time to my initial inquiry was outstanding! Right then I knew this was definitely going to a positive experience. Kevin did such a thorough job. He showed up early and went over everything in detail with us after the inspection was complete. We walked away from the inspection with a really good idea of what our new home needed. We have been 100% satisfied with PrimeSpec Consulting, LLC and you will be too!
