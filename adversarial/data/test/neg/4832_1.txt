Heard about this ice cream shop from Pinterest and i am floored.The milkshake was the perfect consistency and wasn't overly sweet. Only thing i did not enjoy was not having a lid for my milkshake but it was only because i opted for the edible rim. I thoroughly enjoyed this cute little shop and definitely will be going back on my next trip to Charlotte!
