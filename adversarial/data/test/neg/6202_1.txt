I love this place! All through high school I would come here on Friday afternoons. They have this amazing deal with two slices and a drink for something like $5. It's amazing! The pizza comes out hot and fresh and the staff always comes and chats with us for a while too! A large group of teen boys is not welcome with such open arms to many places but pizza heaven will always be my pizza home
