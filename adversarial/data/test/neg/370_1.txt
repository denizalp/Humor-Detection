This place has such a cute interior!  There's plenty of parking and plenty of indoor seating.  \n\nThere's many dessert options here, as well as refreshments.  They include gelato (10 different flavors that you can sample), organic teas, bread boxes, waffles and more.\n\nMy girlfriend and I ordered the Strawberry Latte, which came out looking amazing.  The cream on top was delicious, very creamy and tasted like marshmallows.  Very sweet, but very good.  After stirring the contents below the cream, the drink tasted like strawberry milk.\n\nService was very good.  The gentleman working was very kind and helpful and answered all of the questions we had in regard to the menu.  He even threw out some suggestions to us.\n\nI would come back to try the rest of the menu!
