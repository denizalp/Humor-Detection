Really really good place. Reminds me of my childhood!  I got the bool dak which is a fish stick soup with radish and pineapple soju. Great combination with friends! My friend got the japchae,  a glass noodle dish paired with his bool dak, which is chicken with cheese. All in all the staff was attentive to our needs, even when it's late at night (we came at 2pm and it was still packed!). Highly recommended! GFRIEND FOREVER
