This is the best bbq I've ever had, hands down.  We first experienced it at Yelp's Burgh Bash, when Hootie graced our tastebuds with a generous portion of smoked mac-and-cheese and a drumstick.  After nearly blacking out from overwhelming my neurotransmitters with flavor, I was hooked.  Lucky for me, Blowfish sets up shop outside of The Brew Gentleman on a regular basis, where I have easy access to this habit-forming bbq.\n\nAs a quick run-down of menu items:\n\nSmoked mac - smoky win\nChicken drumsticks - meaty win\nRedskin potatoes - starchy win\nBrisket - beefy win\nCole Slaw - secret spicy cayenne win\nOther items - I haven't tried them...potential, strike that, probable win.\n\nYou can't go wrong with a combo plate and your choice of brisket or chicken.  Step up to pro-level and upgrade your platter with mac and potatoes for a few dollars more.  Not to say the slaw isn't good, but the mac and potatoes edge it out ever so slightly.\n\nI really hope to see him continue to do well and hopefully he'll open his own restaurant one day.  Until then, I'll keep my eyes on the twitter feed @blowfishbbq and secretly stalk his next move so I can pounce on some bbq before the crowds arrive.
