Until today, I was a loyal customer of Chapala's.  Guacamole is the best!  However, the customer service we've received lately has been sucky & shameful!  We normally have the same 2 servers. A female or Mr. Potato Head (sorry, but that is exactly who he looks like).  He had been a little rude on occasion, but we overlooked it.  The last straw was when my co-worker and I went there for lunch and Mr. Potato Head, the female server, the owner, and the cashier were standing at the cashier's counter when we walked in.  When we walked in everyone at the counter looked at us. Maybe a minute went by then the female server gestured to Mr. Potato Head to seat us.  He would not turn around, he kept talking to his coworker and said something in Spanish to the female server.  You could tell by the expression on the female server's face that whatever the comment was by Mr. Potato Head wasn't nice because it made her facial expression change.  She then grabbed 2 menus and gestured as if to say \"come on, I'll seat you.\"  We sat for a couple of minutes, Mr. Potato Head passed our table, kept walking and did not acknowledge us.  He later came back and asked what would we like and we ordered.  YES!, I felt some kind of way about it and so did my co-worker. They should appreciate their customers. This experience, coupled with the other times of rudeness made it all too obvious to us that he did not welcome or want our business.  So.....bottom line, there are far too many other places that would appreciate our patronage and where we would have a more enjoyable dining experience.  Hasta la vista baby!!                                                               Jalisco, Taco y Taco, here we come!!!
