I'm 70 years old and see an eye specialist for eyecare, but when I want a pair of glasses I make an appointment at Dynamic Eye Care. I have been coming here for four or five years. The staff and doctors are excellant. If its an eye exam or just refilling lens cleaner the staff is always courteous and friendly.
