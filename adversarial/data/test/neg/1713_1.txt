The Masonic Auditorium is an interesting venue with an already-nostalgic vibe upon first entry. The steps leading lobby allow for a slow reveal of rounded architecture - very few corners or any sort (arches, domes). The seating design is also heavily rounded, wrapping very near the edges of the stage. \n\nThere does not appear to have been many modern updates. The upholstery on the seats looks at least 50 years old and the lighting seams to be original. Most critically, there is no air conditioning. I saw a lecture in late July, and it was distractingly hot. \n\nAs others have said, the stage is low and intimate. In Spring and Fall, concerts would be cool at this venue. I would not return with the temperature is over 80.
