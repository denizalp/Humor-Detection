Love that we found our friend Rudy just down the street!  Loved his food at Ventano and thrilled to find him in his own restaurant right by our house! \n\nShrimp bruschetta delicious! Our favorite, rack of lamb on a hot stone with wasabi dip Devine, and the surprise, Filipino Lumpia atop butter lettuce drizzled with wasabi glaze simply wonderful. My chicken piccata was spot on. daughter adored her first dish of lasagna and hubby's definition of great Italian is their eggplant parmigiana . He gave it two thumbs up!!!  We ordered too much but it was delicious the next day!!!!!\n\nThank you, Rudy! We're so happy you're near us!!!!!
