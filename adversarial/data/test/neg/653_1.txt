Just wanted to take a minute to give our new bug guy a couple of kudos!!!! HOWIE ROCKS!!!!! He was thorough and took the time to listen to my concerns with regard to our pest problems and worries! He had a good sense of humor and was very personable! He also threw in some ideas for a couple of home improvement projects I am working on! I appreciate this level of thoughtfulness and dedication to customer service! Thank you so much for sending HOWIE to our house today! HOWIE ROCKS!!!!
