Parallax.  A displacement or difference in the apparent position of an object viewed along two different lines of sight.  Intriguing, but ultimately, as my first dining experience here, I'm not sure that it worked.\n\nThe building housing the restaurant is like a lot of older buildings in the area, which belies the sleek and minimalist interior.  The bar area was buzzing, with 2 giant flat screen TVs blasting a sports game.  Is this the bar of a fancy restaurant, or do I spot drunken revelers yelling at the TV?  Ugh.  Once seated, we were presented with a metal clipboard, with about 8 pages of paper on it.  I've been to other restaurants that use clipboards for the menu, but 8 pages?  The main theme of the dishes seemed to be Asian fusion, with a bit of Southern and Latin fusion thrown in.  There were also 2 pages of sushi and related items available at any sushi restaurant.  Our waitress was friendly, and service overall was efficient.  When we asked for more bread, the bread guy appeared right away.\n\nI started with the Laughing Bird Shrimp with Watermelon, Tomato, and Cucumber Salad in a lemon-herb vinaigrette.  It is a big salad.  The shrimp were very sweet.  The combination of watermelon and tomato let me hang on to summer, even though this was one of the colder Labor Day weekends in memory.  For my entr√©e, I had Trout stuffed with Thai Flavors with Bamboo Rice.  This was a good take on traditional Thai angel wings.  The stuffing, mainly glass noodles and crab flavored with lemongrass, was good.  The texture was a little on the soft side.  Combine that with the tender trout, it got a little mushy as I continued to eat the dish.  For dessert, I had the peach ice cream.  This was my biggest disappointment of the evening.  It mainly just tasted of cream and sugar.  There was nothing to show that it was peach, except for the color, which was hard to see under dim lighting.\n\nWhy 3 stars?  This is a 2 1\/2 if there were half stars.  I think Parallax is ok, and definitely a top choice for the area.  It lacked a bit of soul perhaps.  With all the sleekness it exuded, it needed some warmth to balance it.  The food is good, but the menu is a tad unfocused.  I get it that it's full-on Asian fusion.  And if they want to offer straight sushi, that's fine too.  But somehow I got the feeling that I was at 2 different restaurants.  Now, is that intentional?
