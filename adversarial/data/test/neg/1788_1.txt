Horrible!  I would never recommend this company to even my worst enemy. Our loan person seemed to be genuine in the beginning but it wasn't until our sales agent called him cause we hadn't heard anything about our loan and while on speaker, he says he's spoken with me a number times which was a bunch of crap. He full out lied and probably wasn't aware he was on speaker. The next day we moved lenders. We went with New American Funding - Vicky Liu. She is the best. If you're reading this, you may want to do your homework on this company. Even our new neighbors encountered issues and unfortunately their loan wasn't closed on time and they ended up paying a best penalty because of it.
