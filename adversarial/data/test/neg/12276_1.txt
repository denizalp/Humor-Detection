This Café includes a super nice outdoor patio with string lights and a wall of ivy on the building next door.  It's nice place to grab a beer and enjoy the evening in the walled off courtyard.  We tried the Reuben and the Meatloaf for dinner.  I really liked the Reuben and the fries were done nicely.  The meatloaf could easily serve two - it's a huge chunk of meaty goodness a little heavy on the garlic but enjoyable nonetheless.  Our server, Nicole, was very nice and kept up with our needs by stopping by every so often.  The Café is a nice addition to the strip.
