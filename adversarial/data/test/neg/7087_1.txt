Business lunch on Friday and the place was empty. It is a sign of poor quality - NO. Food was great, service quick. Chef came out checking on us. Had their special of the day. It was plenty of food and tasted very good. Hopefully they'll extend their hours soon so it will be good place for dinner as well.
