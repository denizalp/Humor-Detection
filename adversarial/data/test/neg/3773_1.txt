This place is a small, diner style restaurant that my husband and I stumbled upon while still dating.  What a find!  This is the best breakfast in Pittsburgh.  It's cheap, and delicious.  You won't need to eat lunch!  Unless you get there at the same time as the church crowd on a sunday, seating is usually not a problem.  I recommed the Bob's Breakfast and the Raspberry stuffed French Toast.  Their bacon is always done perfectly. They are a family run business, and if you go two times or more, they will remember you, and sometimes even your name..!  They have moved locations recently- (just across the street) to accommodate more customers, and they have become non-smoking!  Yeay!
