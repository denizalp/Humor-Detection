Ordered a regular salmon bowl and a small tuna bowl on Uber Eats. It didn't look big but was quite filling for two people. The bowls came with rice (though you can choose from a few bases), taro chips, seaweed salad, avocado and fish. Everything was fresh and the flavours were really good. The fish comes in a nice sauce that isn't overpowering. I'll definitely try this place again.
