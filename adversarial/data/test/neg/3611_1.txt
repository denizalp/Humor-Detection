Been here three times and first time getting food on Wednesday night. Firstly I live their music selection ! Also I love the interior and darker lighting. The servers are friendly and unpretentious like some \"hipstery\" bars staff can be. They're always so smiley and joke around patient and overall seem happy in their jobs. Refreshing ! The location is close walk from many offices. We had amazing escargot starter on bread with onions and bacon. To die for ! I have never had them made in this way as a topper no shell. We also had oysters and my stomach turned when my date ordered them as I have generally had a disliking to them at other places but damn these were delicious and no salty slimy nastiness. The toppings were amazing. Comes with three different sauces and cheese and lemon. Slide easily out of the shell. No chewiness. Just an overall great experience. Highly recommend and will remain a loyal customer ;) \nSpecials for food and drinks every night of the week. Extensive brew list. Well known for craft beers (I'm not a beer drinker hence g n t )
