What's really cool about Tottie's is that all the various Asian influences are on one menu. It's not fusion as in the dishes themselves are mixed, but more that the menu is. They have sushi, Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese dishes all in the same restaurant. Could be great for groups with difference tastes. You could also go family style and get a blend of different flavors to satisfy all your cravings at once.\n\nThe food itself is extremely good. I wasn't dissapointed in any of the dishes they brought us. We tried a Thai dish, the house rolls for an appetizer and a Chinese shrimp dish. All of it was fantastic and we left stuffed for sure.\n\nThe service was equally great. And the atmosphere is picture perfect. Definitely recommended!
