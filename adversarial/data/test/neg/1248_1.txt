Waste of time. 40 minute appetizer times. Over 90 minutes for a pizza. Are you kidding me? There were 4 our 5 empty tables so it wasn't crippling busy. The server quickly blamed the kitchen but our empty glasses were barely recognized. Just a complete waste of money. I recommend avoiding this establishment in the Flats. Hopefully it will be replaced with something better in the future.
