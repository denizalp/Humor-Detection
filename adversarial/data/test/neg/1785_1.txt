This place has very good burgers. I tried the stuffed burger with pepper jack and jalapenos. It was very good and tasty. I did not need any ketchup or mustard or anything. The fried are good, but they don't come with the burgers so you have to add them on. This makes it fairly expensive in my opinion. It would be worth it if burgers came with fries for the relative same price. \n\nThe beer I ordered was too expensive also :)  We'll go back again, but I'll get a coupon first.
