Great girls night out at this restaurant! The ambiance is great for groups and the seating was comfortable and inviting. Most of our group had pasta dishes which were fresh, delicious and large portions. We were given a variety of breads for the table, accompanied by a sweet butter. The pricing for the dishes were reasonable and everyone left feeling full and satisfied. We will be back for sure...
