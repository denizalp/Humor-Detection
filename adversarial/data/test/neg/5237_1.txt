This actually is impressive tasting food. The noodles were good. Had Singapore noodles, Beef Chow Fun, Crispy Chicken Wings, Shrimp Fried rice. All were very delicious. Yes, it is expensive, but really a good choice if you don't want to venture very far from the casino or from your hotel and have a craving for some good Chinese. Because most of the dishes are family style, this is great for groups.
