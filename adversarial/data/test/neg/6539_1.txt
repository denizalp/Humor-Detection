Not the best top notch buffet, but it will do for the money. I always like to eat on a budget. Food was pretty good. If your looking to eat a fancy casino buffet, this isn't the place. If your looking to just eat a fast good meal; than I recommend this place. Nice price and pretty good food for the money.
