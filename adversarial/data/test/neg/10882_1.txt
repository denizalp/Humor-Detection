Hands down the best filipino restaurant in town. My family and a few friends went on a wekend trip to Las Vegas and craved for filipino food at one point. We heard this place was good so we decided to try it and it definitely did not disappoint. The cebuchon is to-die-for and all their desserts are a must have. will definitely come back for more to try try out the other scrumptious items on the menu.
