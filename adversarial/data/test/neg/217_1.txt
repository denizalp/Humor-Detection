We came here for a casual Sunday brunch and really loved the ambiance of the outdoor patio area. While service was a a bit slow, the food was delicious! There is an amazing coffee and gelato bar that your can carry out but I really loved the lattes and baked goods. Plenty of vegetarian options and a great place for big groups. The complimentary bread and fresh pesto was delicious and definitely made our salads a bit yummier!
