let me start with the positives: \nthe burgers are awesome and cooked fresh\nthe fries are like fair fries and really good.\nthey have gluten free bun as an option\n never had the dogz.\n the toppings are a great choice but dont waste your time with the seasonings bc you cant taste them (they have cajun seasoning etc to put on burger but never enough to make a difference in taste from what ive found in two times weve been there)\n\nthe cons:\neven with only two tables filled on a sunday, two burgers with two fries took 30 minutes to get.\nwhen we went in there with a full house it took 50 min to get our food.\nthe prices are kind of steep for a burger joint. 28 bucks for 2 burgers and two fries. \nwe only go there if we have a groupon coupon \npeople are nice but with these cons we will generally pick five guys burgers over these burgerz and dogz.
