There's so much competition in the breakfast-lunch market in this area, that I had lived in Vegas for two years before trying this one. I think the other breakfast-lunch places have lost my business. I haven't found anything else that even comes close.\n\nPortions are filling, but not ridiculously overdone. If you order fruit as a side, you get actual large slices of a mixed variety of fruits. The banana nut muffins are good as homemade. (I won't say \"better than\", because I make great muffins.)\n\nI've ordered the eggs and pancake combination, and the Eggs Benedict today. Both very good, although surprisingly, I liked the platter better. \n\nService is both efficient and friendly. The wait staff acts like they enjoy their jobs, and their customers. Nice to get smiles and helpfulness!\n\nHighly recommended!
