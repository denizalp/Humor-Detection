I'm sitting here, finishing up my pho. Let me start off with, this is by far one of the best places in town to get pho! We love this place, it's our go to spot that never ever has a long wait for food, at a decent price, and it is extremely delicious! Unfortunately, today, my experience wasn't like it always is when we come! We came in around 6:30ish, and right now the place is packed, so we knew we'd wait a little bit. Our food came, delicious, like always. It hit the spot, but halfway into our meal, my baby brother and my fiancée ran out of water in their cups. I glanced over at the servers who were standing Around to try and get their attention, and nothing. A couple minutes later, I saw one of them grab the pitcher of water, oh wait, no for us! It was a refill for the biggest group, then again for people who got here after us. No big deal, so my fiancée tried to suck on his straw and make it obvious we needed water while one of the servers was refilling the waters of the table in front of us, but NOTHING. I finally got up, and asked for the manager. She was extremely nice, and she even saw how all the tables but ours had fresh cups of waters. The gentlemen who brought water over apologized, but the damage is done. Right now, our bill is 10% less 'cause of the inconvenience. We don't mind paying full price for what we ordered, the food is extremely worth it, but at a spot where is my first choice to eat out versus any other place, I'd like to at least be acknowledged. I work with customers in business dining, I know to at least pretend to enjoy people's company when they're around me, and I know to keep an eye out for WHOEVER needs my help! Please work on that! Other than that, I'm dragging my fiancée back, I love this place too much!!!!!\n\n\nOk- update; brought my dad here and the staff was a lot better than our last experience! The manager right away recognized us, and was very accommodating and friendly! Here are some pics, give this place a chance!
