I am fully aware that this is a fast food restaurant, but I'm not ashamed to say that I'm obsessed with this place. While in town for TIFF, I always stop in here (twice during the last trip, as a matter of fact) for a quick meal to shovel into my face while waiting on line for a movie. \n\nOn my most recent visits, I ordered bowls with spring greens as a base, peppers, edamame, sweet potatoes and tofu. I tried 2 different sauces- the classic peanut (excellent) and sweet chili lime, which although it was only 1 flame, nearly set my face on fire. It sure was tasty though! I chose pickled veggies, herbs and sriracha pumpkin seeds as toppings, and those were a really nice touch. The herbs really elevated it to the next level for me. \n\nAll of the ingredients (although I can't personally speak for the meats) are high quality and gluten free so unlike most Asian restaurants, I don't have to worry about soy sauce hiding in everything. It's been busy the times that I've stopped in, but the employees are friendly but also efficient, so the line has moved quickly. It's a little bit pricey, but the quality and quantity make it worth it in my opinion. Now who do I have to contact to get a location near me??!!
