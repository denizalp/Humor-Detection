I don't know why I decided to give this carwash another chance and it was a bust I use to love this carwash so much and it was my go-to for years and years but over the past couple years it's horrible. They literally don't even try to\nClean your car. The cup holders weren't even vacuumed out, they didn't wipe anything down and 2 of the inside windows were still super smudged. I always get the Mega star which includes all the bells and whistles... I just don't get it. I hate  that is not the same
