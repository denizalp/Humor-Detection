This was our first time in Ohio. We had heard about melt from a friend. He didn't do this place justice. I couldn't describe this chain with any of the stereotypes you'd use with chains. \nThe beer selection was astounding. The menu sounded too simple but the selections were ridiculous. the jalape√±o popper was great and my boyfriend's dude abides ( think meatball sub with mozzarella wedges) was fantastic.\n\nEven for a Monday night it was busy but a three minute wait we were seated. food took maybe ten minutes. as if that were not enough the waiter gave us a banana bread a-la-mod as a welcome to Cleveland. If you come to Ohio, eat here!
