I decided to search for restaurants near my hotel that were open for lunch. Fuego was one and after reading the reviews I decided to try it! It wasn't busy for lunch and the wait staff is friendly and the food is amazing! The tacos were awesome.  I usually don't like rice and beans from most Mexican restaurants but fuego's were fantastic.  They actually had a great flavor.  I would definitely come here again!
