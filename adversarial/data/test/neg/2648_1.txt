THIS PLACE IS A MUST GO!  (had to put that first just in case you didn't feel like reading a whole review)\n\nParking is the only drawback...The selection of chicken salads is pretty extensive.  I had the Curry and the Walnut\/Cranberry.  Both were OUTSTANDING.  \n\nThis place is a converted house and is really cozy.  \n\nThe service is prompt and very friendly.  \n\n2 scoops is a pretty good amount, not like Subway scoops! \n\nThis will be a regular place for me and I can't wait to go back.  I strongly recommend trying Mayobird!!!!!
