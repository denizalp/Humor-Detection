Yay! I'm a fan.\n\nSo I found myself in a situation that one can only find in first world countries.  I just moved into the area, but I wouldn't see all my belonging for about a month.  So after the novelty wore off from using a sleeping bag on my living room floor like I was five years old again, I had basically two options.  One was to buy an inflatable mattress until my bedroom furniture arrived.  The other was to finally ditch all the hand-me-down stuff I've collected since moving out of my parent's place over a decade ago.  Despite still working on the whole being an adult always and forever, I wanted to own my first bit of real furniture.  So let's start with the bedroom, and let's start at Ashley's.\n\nI've had one prior experience with Ashley's (not this one), and it was generally an okay one.  Their selection is mostly found online, so the store experience was relatively brief.  What I remembered though was the quality of products for the price.  They do have the usual fair that can be found just about anywhere for more or less the same price, but if you want something with style that will last, there's no solution other than going to the seller, like Ashley's, itself.\n\nThis time around, I wanted to be able to have a better idea of what I was getting, and as amazing as the internet is, it pales in ability to convey the size and depth of physical items.  This time I also didn't have a terribly good sense of what I wanted, so luckily they have a very experienced staff here with each have decades in the furniture business even before working at Ashley's.  The gentleman knew the exact questions to refine my search, and about knew before I did that I just needed to at one point wander and think to myself.  It was about as perfect a shopping experience as it can get.  At the end, we deduced that I have more expensive tastes than I was ready for, so we departed on the terms that I needed to more time think about it.\n\nI returned some time after realizing that in all the furniture considerations, I never gave enough thought to mattress selection.  The first gentleman was not available at that hour.  Oh, did I mention they have awesome hours for the working class citizen?  Yeah, huge kudos there.  While I did kind of have to start all over with a new gentleman, I quickly learned that he too was quite experienced -- better yet, in a slightly different way.  He also asked me exact questions to refine my search even further.  He also went through an interesting, and strangely scientific, exercise to help choose the best level of firmness in a mattress for me.  Unfortunately, it went slightly contradictory to what I had always thought, and while he encouraged me to go with what I feel rather than what he concluded, I again decided to depart to do yet more thinking.\n\nTruth is: I wanted to make sure I talked to the first gentleman again.  They have a neat system for commission at Ashley's.  Employees are able to designate percentages of commission from a sale amongst all those involved.  While it was the second gentleman who explained this system, I still felt it necessary for my own edification to talk to the first.  I ended up glad I did for other reasons too.  While I went with the second's recommendations, the first had a better idea of my financial concerns.  After a little discussion that I would hardly call haggling, we came to a mutually respectable conclusion.  We strap the mattress to the top of my car so I have something to sleep on while I wait for the rest of my furniture to arrive, and at this point I am one happy camper.\n\nA weekend goes by, and I realize I want to change my order slightly to better fit my living needs.  Despite that it ends up refunding some of my money, I received zero hassle and expedient service.  Unfortunately the manager, who are among the only ones authorized to make such changes, failed miserably to tell me this would change the delivery date.  Sadly this very human mistake made me wonder on a particular day where the hell my stuff was at.  After expressing my disappointment, that manager called me back the following day to apologize.\n\nMany moons later, I finally get my furniture.  At first, they will schedule you for a whole day to receive your delivery, but a day or so before the actual date, they will call you back to 1) confirm delivery & directions, and 2) to narrow the delivery window for you from the whole day down to four hours.  With 45 mins left in the window, truck shows up with a couple guys strong and smart enough for the job.  I say that because I opted for a traditional, solid wood theme, which requires a lot more strength and skill to set up.  Worse for them: they have to take it all up a narrow set of stairs with tight landings -- without a single bump or scratch.  They assembled and placed all the pieces (even the mattress I already had) to my specifications.  Without a doubt, my bedroom is now the nicest looking room in all my house -- all thanks to Ashley's.
