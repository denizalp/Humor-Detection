I stopped in this store for a new phone mine wasnt charging well Kris F. was my customer service rep she figured out it was not my phone but the charging cord {why do cats like to chew on charging cords} and i was happy cuz i love my phone and then she takes a look at my monthly plan and puts me on the promo plan and saves me 70 bucks a month wow Thanks Kris
