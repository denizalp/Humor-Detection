This place is super under-rated! They make their ice cream fresh and the flavours are so good. Favourites were: sesame and mango. Legit ingredients and none of the fillers \/ definitely not loaded with sugar. The red bean ice cream waffles were filled to the brim and such a good deal for $6 :) You can mix and match any flavours.
