I was in the emergency room on Monday night for 22HOURS before being admitted. I spent 20 of those hours in a chair or on a stretcher in the hallway. When i arrived I was in severe pain and when i asked to see the dr again because of the pain  the charge nurse told me they could not contact the dr. She said there was nothing she could do for me for my pain. They had given me something 4 hours ago and I was not due for 2 more hrs & she could not check with the dr. The pain was unbearable, I was in tears. She spoke to me like I was just looking for drugs when i was in fact in SEVERE pain. She was also busy and she complained to me very loudly about that. My care shouldnt be compromised because they are busy. I also asked to speak with someone else, another nurse maybe, and she refused that. After a few hours I was moved to the hallway under the care of another nurse, who was at least helpful.  I was still in the hallway with people all around me, in pain, no privacy for hours & hours. After 20hrs I finally ended up in a small room with a nurse who doesn't typically work the e\/r but was the nicest nurse I had seen in my almost 24hrs in the er. The whole experience was terrible. Once I got to my room the difference in care was amazing. The people working on the floor are so nice, friendly, and sympathetic. The difference is night and day! Unfortunately, I have been to this e\/r many times. I've NEVER had to wait this long to go upstairs and i NEVER had a charge nurse speak to me the way that this one did. The thought of ever having to go back to this e\/r worries me. Ill dread the thought of 20 hrs in a hallway and  I'll be afraid if I'm in pain they will not help me.
