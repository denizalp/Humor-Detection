Always fast and friendly. Our go to spot if we can't decide on dinner in the area. Have been here multiple times for happy hour, endless apps and many other promos and got our orders in a reasonable amount of time. \nNot sure what everyone is complaining about with wait times, terrible good or rude servers. \nWe've come with just two of us to at least 5 and seemed to be no difference in quality of anything.
