What can I say. Sitting in the gazebo looking out over the river is so...so.....great. We dock our boat here and have seen a few restaurants come and go but Nelly Belly is one of the best. \n\nThe personal sized pizza is tasty and the crust baked in their wood oven is amazing. The quarter pound burgers are impressive and the choice of toppings make them even more delicious. You get juicy, flavorful, all beef burgers every time. They have grilled chicken, veggie burgers and other deli sandwiches to choose from, but what we love the best on a hot summer day is one of their delicious salads. I get the COBB salad, full of turkey, ham, bacon, Swiss, tomatoes, onions, avocado, eggs and croutons. It is very filling. \n\nThey have a limited beer and wine selection, and you can drink alcohol outside on the restaurant's patios. You can also make any order a platter, which adds a drink (16 oz. beverage, not beer or wine) and side for only $3.00. Their sides include crinkle-cut fries, sweet potato fries, onion rings, hush puppies, fruit cup, side salad, cup of chowder, dirty chips or pretzels. All good selections. \n\nThe prices are average compared to most bar type food, but what is so....so....great and sets this restaurant apart is the atmosphere. It's sitting by the water having a drink and eating great food with friends, and every Friday in the summer they have free entertainment. \nLIFE IS GOOD! \n \nThe only down can be the long lines at high ordering times like lunch and dinner. Only one spot to order with only one register.  But, you order and pay all at once and they bring it to your table. Can't beat that.
