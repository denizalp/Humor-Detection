*Update: I'm not sure if it's the change in season, but I was unhappily smacked across the face today with the realization that the toppings are stale and the service is cold. On top of which, the froyo here manages to be much more calorie dense than others I've seen. All quite unfortunate, since the froyo here is very (!!) tasty.\n\nI will be back if I crave froyo in Y&E area... but with slightly less anticipation.
