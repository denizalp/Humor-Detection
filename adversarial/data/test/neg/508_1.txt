Being new to town, I stopped here on my lunch hour.  For one, the parking is awful.  Two, you need binoculars to read their menu.  The print is SO SMALL.  The lady at the counter was very helpful, I must say.  She wasn't impatient, just listed the sandwiches.  I decided on a ham and cheese on multi-grain.  I asked for it to be heated.  Service was fast, and I was out of there in less than 10 minutes, I think.\nNow for the sandwich.  I had to take two bites before I hit the meat, and if I hadn't opened the sandwich, I would have thought they forgot the cheese.  VERY skimpy on the meat and cheese portions.  The bread was okay, but I've had much better at Blimpies and Port-o-Sub.  Not to mention both put a LOT more meat and cheese on their sandwiches.  Not worth the money, not going back.  Sorry, Cousins.
