Fabulous food by a rising star chef, who is cooking at a James Beard dinner in New York in February. Starting with the papadum, the meal was excellent. Everyone at a table of 8 raved about their food. I had the lamb kabob appetizer, which had just a hint of ginger which took it far beyond most kabobs, which can be dry. The chef recommended the long-cooked lamb shank,which none of us had, but we saw it as a nearby table and it looked fork-fall-apart. Also had the chef's version of eggplant bharta, which they call \"pressed eggplant\" as a side. It was a little too hot, probably my fault because I asked for spicy. All told, a wonderful value. Make sure you try the Monte sauvignon blanc from Chile, a steal.
