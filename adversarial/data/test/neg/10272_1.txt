Convenient due to the fact it is on my way too and from work. I don't like that the prices are pretty high for certain items like cat treats. I can get a much better price at the grocery store for treats and cat litter. I do appreciate the cat nip refills available there as well as the cleanliness. I cannot comment on the grooming services as I only have used this store to buy food and some toys. Cashiers can be a little short. Last time I checked out the cashier was actually texting on her phone during my transactions an I had to interrupt her to continue processing my order!
