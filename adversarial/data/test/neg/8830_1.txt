Our group did Bloodthirst (back in October) Such an amazing room. Probably our 2nd or 3rd favorite room we've ever done in the valley. Very cool props in that room and 1 or 2 very tricky clues. Just the right amount of difficulty. \n\nThe staff was very nice, the guy at the front desk was very personable and seemed to love his job. We enjoy the enthusiasm from our game masters. \n\nDefinitely recommend Bloodthirst. We can't wait to come back to try their Rogue Agent room.
