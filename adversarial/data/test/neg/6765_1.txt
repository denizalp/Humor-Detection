So my husband and I went shopping all sale associates we're very helpful we knew what we wanted for our kids bedrooms but undecided on our living room set it took us 3 day to make up our mind on it but we did .Kids furniture would come in 1 week our living room set would take 5to 6 week we said that fine. So when kid furniture came a dresser was damaged so I refuse it and I called customer service to let them know what happened the girl on the phone told me they had no more in stock but will order it n have it deliver in a week i said ok that's fine so I call back a week later the girl never reorder .I'm  so up set they guys who delivered it the first time wrote exchange on the paper now i have to go in and reorder it and they still wanted to charge me a delivery fee .This is very bad communication on their part and very poor training in  customer service This is a big inconveniences for my husband and I after this experience we won't be going back.
