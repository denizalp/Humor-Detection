Mixed emotions about this place. A Lyft driver told us about them so we gave it a whirl. It wasn't really close to our hotel but the yelp pictures we saw made it seem so much more elegant than it was. The outside of the building looked pretty outdated, but I didn't want to judge a book by it's cover. At first glance it reminded me of a cheap diner. We walked in and told it was a 30 min wait for a table of 3. In the meantime, we went to the lounge to wait which is what really lost me. It was super dark, the tables were dirty as well as the velvet like booths. It just looked dingy and dirty, but the fire they had going was beautiful! Our waiter came and asked us what we wanted\/clean the table as soon as we sat down... Of course we didn't know what we wanted as we had just gotten there. Probably took her 20mins to come back and right after we ordered our name was mentioned over the intercom. After getting our table she closed our tab and we moved over to the dining area. \n\nAfter all that, why am I giving a 4 star? Because the food was great! Big portions, and amazing tasting food. We got the platter for the appetizer so we could taste a little bit of everything and it was all good! After that I was full so I just did the turkey sandwich which was also amazing. Although the decor and the dresscode through me off, I'd still return.
