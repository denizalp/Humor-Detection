Excellent gas station, with plenty of pumps, many of which are frequently open, and perhaps most importantly, they often have some of the best prices around, which makes it even better. The only bad thing is the parking lot of this place. What is it with lots in the greater Charlotte area that makes it so difficult?\n\nIt seems like there are a dozen entrances\/exits into this lot, and signage is horrible, so make sure you pay close attention, or someone intent on getting their McRib is going to plow into you. The best thing to do is likely to stop for a lunch special somewhere, then on your way out, fill up for gas - also a good idea because the pumps here can run slow at times.
