We have been withbout telephone service for one whole week.  The company keeps telling us everyday that our service will be back by 8 pm, but still no service.  Last night a technician finally showed up , and did not have a clue where the phone boxes were.  I would not recommend this company for any of it's services.\n\nHey Hey
