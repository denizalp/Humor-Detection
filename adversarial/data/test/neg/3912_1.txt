Today I had 6 ceiling fans installed in my new home by Robert S. of Lamps Plus. It was singularly the best vendor installation I've had in the year since the house was built. Robert was extremely courteous, very efficient and fastidious; without asking he slipped on blue booties once inside and used his own drop cloth to catch debris. He also answered my plethora of questions about direction of blades, offered best method for operating the fans to prolong the motor life, and so forth. His customer service was beyond expectation. Great Job!
