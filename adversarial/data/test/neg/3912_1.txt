NIce little Mexican restaurant.  \nSeats about 20.\nNice selection of some traditional Mexican food.  \nSelected the lunch special. The Sopa de Verdure (Veggie soup) is not your mothers veggie soup, due to the cilantro.  It was tasty with lots of veggies.  The agua fresca horchata was very refreshing. The empanada and enchilada were good but the endhilada was on the cold side.
