This is our 2nd time to Upstairs Jazz Bar & Grill. The first time we got in really late after we had dinner elsewhere so we only caught the end of a show. This time we made sure we made reservations for dinner so that we could relax with a couple of drinks for the show.\n\nThis is a very cozy place and great for listening to live jazz. The line up of artists are pretty extensive and the acoustics are good enough to drown out talking from the other tables. Even though there are signs on the tables and they remind the audience before each set to keep silent during the performance, it seems this is a concept some people can't grasp! RUDE!\n\nWe made reservations for a Friday night at 7:30pm, hoping to get some snacks and drinks before the performance started at 8:30pm, at which time we would order dinner. By 8pm it was completely packed!\n\nThe food is pretty good. My wife had the zarzuela and I had the steak et frites. Hers was nicely flavoured and my steak was prepared perfectly; tender and juicy. We had a pitcher of white sangria which was tasty. The service was great! Our server came around often to check on us, our water was constantly filled, and table was cleaned after each dish. He was super nice, letting us know that because we paid for the early performance we could stay all night at no extra cost if we wanted to. We finished our drinks and decided to leave. I felt a little guilty about staying because there was a lineup of about 16 people waiting to get in for the 10pm show.\n\nOverall, we had a good time. Your main reason for coming should be the jazz, but the food holds its own pretty well!
