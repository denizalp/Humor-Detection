Located in Socorro, and myself still on the hunt for the best New Mexican style restaurant, I'd thought I try this spot in Ahwatukee out. So far I have found 2 places in Phx that do not disappointed. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. My wife and I sat at the bar on a Friday evening for drinks and dinner. The bartender they had seemed overwhelmed, and unable to keep up with the service (Nice guy though). Drinks took about 10 minutes, drink order was wrong, and the wait to get his attention to order food was also pretty long. Food was pretty good, I ordered Frank's Enchiladas, but kinda small portions of sides though (3-4 spoonfuls of rice and beans?). Really looked forward to the sopapillas, but when I asked for them I was told they'd come out after dinner--uh oh, red flag. Being from NM, I was hoping for puffy\/crispy sopapillas with the dinner so I could create my own stuffed ones. After all, the #9 is a Stuffed Sopa plate. I was brought the flat ones, which is okay; except they were undone & doughy. After waiting 15 minutes for the sopapillas to come out, my food was also now cold. I kind of just stopped there and asked for the check, which took another 15 minutes. It could have been a one-off night, I know the restaurant is still new, but that's probably my last visit. On a positive note, the drinks were made well, staff is friendly, and chips and salsa was pretty good.
