So the 2 for 1 deal for dining at TI buffet was pointless, since the front desk told me it is valid after 11am. It was 9am and I wanted to eat before I head on out to the airport. $15 a person wasn't so bad coming from a buffet that I thought it was average. Average price, average quality for TI buffet. I noticed how it looked nice and clean inside for an average buffet. Right when we were seated, our server served us our drinks and he was occupied somewhere else without checking up on us. There was fresh made omelette and side dishes on the side near by (french toast, pancakes, sausages, hash brown). The omelette was good, but not as much as I enjoyed at the Lago Buffet at Caesar's Palace. I remember the french toast was very plain in taste. The parfait was really good (plain yogurt at the based topped with cantaloupe and melon and granola bits). There was also a small sushi section, but I thought most sushi from buffets tastes similar to each other. There were also a pastry section with mini donuts! As I was getting full, I just had to get at least one mini donut. It was just so cute in its size, but perfect and good for me to end my meal! This is a place that I would consider average, but I disagree how others think it's so horrible when it's not that bad.
