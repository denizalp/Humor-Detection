Don't understand why this place would get unfavorable reviews, as my clothes are always cleaned immaculately & lady at the counter is always so nice. Very organized place, unlike other Cleaners I've gone to. \n\nI recommend this place. Your clothes get cleaned in 24 hours. And the prices are reasonable.
