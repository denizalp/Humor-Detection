Great wings, creative sauces, inventive dips, fresh fresh food and the prices are much better than other wing competitors. The service was awesome. We were shocked a small joint provided such attentive service while dining in. They just added boneless wings which are smaller than the chicken fingers and they were great and were meaty and not all breading unlike another wing giant COUGH Bdubs COUGH. I recommend the Carolina Bbq and Tropical habanero (not just sweet but actually spicy) and the honey siracha or hickory ranch for your dips. This place breaks out of the mold and you'll enjoy it.
