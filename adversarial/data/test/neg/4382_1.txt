My husband, myself & our 4 yo went here to do an absolute ton of spring cleaning laundry yesterday (it gets back logged like this periodically because we don't have laundry at our house & usually do laundry at my dad's). OMG this is BY FAR the cleanest nicest friendliest best laundromat in Union County. First of all, only 1 machine in the entire place was out of order (for comparison, in every laundromat in Monroe, at least half the machines are broken, the rest eat your change or barely work), all the machines were clean, obviously well maintained, very reasonably priced (giant $6 washer holds 3 big blue ikea bags full of clothes FYI). They have nice touches like arcade games (my kid was enthralled by Ms Pac Man), vending machines. \n\nBut by far, the best part was the outstanding service from Robin, the owner's new bride. Such a sweet heart! She was so incredibly helpful and kind. What a nice place, they blow the competition away!
