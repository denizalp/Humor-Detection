These guys rock! Of all the dealerships I have been too this staff is full of all stars! I frequently pop in from time to time as I have not yet made my purchase and am in the beginning stages but I know when I do this will be the place. Ive had the chance to interact with Oscar at the parts counter who is a enjoyable young man, Tim when they were showing me the service department is a really nice guy and knows his bikes. Erik and Ed have both helped me and have not griped like most sales people do when a customer speaks to a different salesmen.They just want to find you the right bike and make sure it fits and its going to suit your needs. I also met with Ryan who is the sales manager, he also informed me that it did not matter that I was just looking around and wanted to make sure when the time was right I got the right bike and felt comfortable I also got a chance to speak to Jim the parts\/service manager who has been around the block and knows all the accessories and knows his classic bikes. If you are in the market for new\/used bike see these guys! You wont be disappointed!
