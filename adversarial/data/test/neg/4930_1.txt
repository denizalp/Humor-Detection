My thoughts and comments:\nAgreed with all the 1 start comments with our experience with Baker Wee.  We have purchased many items from here, special ordered cakes and cookies.  Recommended to other people and saw great results.  But this last time, and I mean last time my sons cake was the saddest cake I ever saw.  (Please see photo)  This place can make beautiful cakes we see them every time we go in, we have had beautiful desserts made for us.  It is simply baffling how you can go from Great to terrible in weeks.  Must be dependent on the baker you get.  Also agreed about no cake book just the one ipad.  All I can say is get it together Baker Wee you have wonderful potential just poor execution.  \n\nAdding my wife's thoughts, be glade this is not 2, 1 Star reviews\n\nI have been a customer since 2014 and have always loved Baker Wee and recommended them to others. My previous cake orders have been great, so I was very disappointed to see my son's $70 birthday cake. No border on top, awful lettering, and obviously what I communicated about the photoscan placement did not translate properly. I asked that the photoscan not take the whole cake because it'd be nice to have room to place toys and write Happy Birthday... the order form said \"make photoscan kinda small,\" geeze I wish I noticed that she wrote that. Even so, if the lettering and bordering was done nicely- it would have looked so much nicer. I feel like I got the trainees working on my cake. I'm sorry, but trainees should start in the grocery stores (which I have bought cakes from many times and am much less critical cause I know what I'm paying for), when I order from a baker, I am expecting a professional. \nThe sad part is, we expressed our disappointment when we picked it up- they did add a border (which was sloppy) on top, but that was it, no attempt to fix the lettering, no apology, nothing. Maybe a manager was not around, but employees should be trained to express \"I am so sorry, we will have a manager contact you\" to an unhappy customer. I'm so disappointed. \n\nTo say the least we had a terrible experience no one apologized.\n\n***Bakery Wee it is up to YOU to contact US to make this right, not for us to contact you.  We were in the store and expressed our dissatisfaction and YOU did NOTHING.
