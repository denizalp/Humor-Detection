Reviews are totally right about this place. I'm going to keep it simple here cause that's the kind of place Fuego Taco Shop is. Came a little after 6 on a Monday evening, a few people in there, not slammed but not dead either. As the people ahead of me in line were finishing up I was trying to decide between all the amazing sounding things on their menu. Decided to stick with a classic, carne asada burrito and was not disappointed. Way better than your standard \"bertos\" carne asada and miles ahead of something like Taco Bell. There is a salsa bar off to the side with a few really good house made salsas. Price was definitely reasonable and the food came out fast. Not much to mention in regards to service, it was just a counter joint, they took my order and got me my food promptly, don't think anything else is needed at a place like this.\n\nWill definitely be returning.
