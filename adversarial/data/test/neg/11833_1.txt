This review is specifically for the young lady managing the self-checkout lines around 3:30pm this afternoon. I believe her name is Jaclyn. She had the best customer service while helping everyone check out. Her bubbly personality and conversational skills with the customers is so refreshing. It really is nice to see someone so upbeat at their place of work. Thank you for being funny, yet professional all at once.
