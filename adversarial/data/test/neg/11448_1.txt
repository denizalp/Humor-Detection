For food courts, I don't expect much but I had better noodle dishes in other (Chinese) malls. I was initially interested since it was a new Asian noodle stall in the Urban Eatery other than Teriyaki and Thai Express, Shanghai 360 and Szechuan Express. Service is nothing spectacular. I gave it a few chances in four separate occasions in which I ordered the Japanese beef curry, Tonkotsu ramen (x2) and bacon udon carbonara.\n\nThe beef curry was pretty meh and a bit too mild, but still passable.\n\nThe Tonkotsu ramen noodles were nothing special but the broth felt too salty. For some reason, when I had the ramen again, I felt queasy for a few hours during the night. Luckily, that did not hold me back from watching X-Men: Days of Future Past in theatres then. If you want good ramen around Yonge-Dundas area, I would recommend Sansotei although the lines are long and the place is rather small.\n\nI tried the udon out of curiosity but I was not impressed by the combination of udon, bacon, red cabbage, edaname, onions and Parmesan cheese sauce. Personally, I found the portion to be rather small and too salty. Felt that I could have spent my money on another meal, but sometimes you don't know until you try.\n\nInteresting menu options, but I can't say the same about the final dishes. Needless to say, I would not return.
