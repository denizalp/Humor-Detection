Not that great. The tuna sashimi came out a bit warm which was concerning, the restaurant itself is a bit on the warmer side, the sushi is ok and the last 2 times I've been there they have sat us at the last table in the back right next to the storage\/supply boxes. There were clearly many open tables both nights and this really shouldn't even be considered a table. Overall, I wouldn't waste my date night here again.
