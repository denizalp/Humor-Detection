Decent com (rice) dishes including their noodle soups (bun bo hue & pho). Digging their banh hoi with the grilled beef wrapped shrimps, it's a thinly square rice noodle (thinner than vermicelli). The bomb!  The plate was full of veggies\/herbs. The com is plateful and very fresh & good. Pho is pho. bun bo hue is pretty clean cut here in vegas.  I believe that pho Saigon 8 have the best bun bo so far.  Banh mi is not supreme, but it's pretty crunchy & good to eat also.  Friendly servicers and the foods comes out pretty fast. The durian & avocado smoothies are serve here, love those smoothies.  A bit water down tho,  but still heavenly good.  Will be back whenever I'm around the area for sure.
