great neighborhood bar and as for the smoking- who cares!  your drinking anyway! and if your a smoker than its even better. they usually have live music which is awesome, and they even have a upstairs patio deck which is awesome in the summer. good bar food also i ordered the fries and they were delicious. this place is usually packed on the weekends its hard to find a spot on the street to park. bartenders are usually nice and you never have to worry about a drink not strong enough!
