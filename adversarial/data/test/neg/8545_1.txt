Based only on the food:\n\nNot great. Weird tiny tacos. Meats seem like they are precooked and delivered frozen by a distributor, warmed and served. Salsa from a jar: boring. No gual, no sour cream, no pico.\n\nRice and beans were on offer, but weren't the fluffy nice rice and rich beans that you're willing to break your daily carb limits for. Presentation was enough for me to pass.\n\nChips were good. Fresh.\nThe plates, utensils, and napkins were generous.
