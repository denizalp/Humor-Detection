Alton at Seven Palms is the best! Reasonable prices, prompt and thorough service, convenient location... In other words, everything I could want in an auto mechanic. He even showed us the parts that he replaced as a 'verification' for our peace of mind. My Jetta is running good as new, and we will certainly be bringing our vehicles here in the future. Car trouble is never enjoyable, but with Alton at Seven Palms, its as close as you can get. Highly recommended!
