Jordan's repaired, sandblasted and powder coated a 1930's wrought iron table and chairs. To say that I'm happy is understatement. The work they did exceeded my expectations. The table and chairs look brand new. There were several weld repairs and the decorative piece on one chairs was broken out. All the repairs look fantastic and the paint is beautiful. I'm very happy!!
