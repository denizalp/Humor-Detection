I found Rumor Boutique looking for a dog friendly hotel. My girlfriend and I were getting ready to go on our first road-trip from California to Utah, and we wanted to spend a not so expensive night out in Vegas. They had an amazing discount going on Valentines Day weekend, which I was amazed with it being a 3-day weekend.  On top of the decent room prices, If you book directly you get even better deals.   I was surprised with the decor and fabulous feeling that I received from booking my one night stay.  Once I arrived, it was a beautiful establishment.  Even my lovely Princess Dior (dog) feel in love.  I bet you wouldn't believe that they have a butler service available for your pet!  I wasn't able to get my Princess this service this trip, due to it being more of a frugal trip - but I definitely promised her the butler service next time! \n\nFront Desk was polite and helpful.   There were some slight issues that we did come across.  The wifi never worked.  Our room did not have a remote control and when we requested one it sort of took a while and we just canceled the request.  Now, since we didn't have a remote we did have to deal with an annoying issue of the cable channel going in and out (requesting some sort of code to continue watching it) and that repeated all night.  \n\nThe Room: The room was gorgeous!  Everything about it was beyond beautiful.  The big jacuzzi tub was a bit out dated with chipped paint.  You really didn't want to enjoy it because of that, but it was so tempting!  The steam shower was amazing and you definitely did not want to get out of it. We stayed in a view room of the lights on the strip and it was pretty decent.  Our balcony was a decent size a great escape to have your breakfast, lunch or dinner at while people watching.  There were some stains on the carpet, and some slight trash left on the floor from cleaning.  Nothing too much to make you turn your nose up.  \n\nOverall: It was a great experience.  Decent price on my pockets with a pet, beautiful courtyard with a pool (which I hear in the summers allow topless beauties) a play yard for your pet, and a fabulous room to brag about!  PERFECT FOR SELFIES!! \n\nMy family, pet and I definitely can not wait to return to Vegas and stay at the Rumor Boutique.
