Get the desert called Desire.  It is out of this world.  It is perfect balance between sweet, tart and savory.  My wife and I have been here over 10 times and it is our favorite desert place in mississauga.  We tried other items and they were pretty good, but ask for desire.  You will be pleasantly surprised.
