The Pie Commission is my go to quick dinner for when I don't have time to make food prior to class and they haven't disappointed me so far.\n\nMy go to order is the braised beef pie with a side of fries or salad. I find meat pies are very easy to mess up especially when the fillings begin getting more complex. \n\nHowever, this place has it on point. The pie looks small but it's actually quite filling. The crust\/pie itself is very soft and buttery and each bite tastes amazing. The salad and fries are nothing to write home about though and you could probably go without. \n\nFor some though, the pie might be too small of portion and the main complaint I've seen my friends make that it seems small for what you pay (~ 8 dollars).\n\nI can't wait to check this place out again and try some of the other pies.
