From the outside, it looks just to be a dive off of the main drag. Bad stereotype. The food is very good and the service is always excellent. Affordable prices. Lots of TV's. And big bar. Been here many times and always in restaurant part. No complaints. Actually have our networking group use this establishment during weekdays lunchtime.
