A co worker recommended this place to me about a year ago. I walked in and love the atmosphere. It kind of feels like a tattoo shop. They greeted me and asked if I would like a water bottle. I waited maybe 5 minutes for the first available and got lucky with Kristopher R. I have been going back to him for a year now. He gives a great cut. I am getting Salon cuts at Barber prices. I love being able to go to the website to see his schedule and call for a appointment. I am always in and out in less than 30 minutes.
