This is a FANTASTIC coffee house! Their specialty drinks are definitely on the sweet side, but I've also had their straight espresso, which I loved. They have white espresso as well! Which they offer for their sweet drinks since it has a milder flavor than the reg espresso.\n\nHad their pumpkin Horchata this weekend and it was the BEST!\n\nThis is a \"treat yo'self\" place for me since it's not the cheapest cup of coffee. However, it's worth it. Everyone who works there is friendly and goes above and beyond to make sure you're happy. It's small, so you are forced to share space with people. But everyone is so happy, it doesn't matter. They have live music and a DJ some days and the weekends always look like a party. There is an outdoor space where you can sip and people watch. \n\nThis is a family owned business and the sense of community is strong here. I always feel welcomed and am met with a smile no matter the time of day. I cannot wait for my next cup!
