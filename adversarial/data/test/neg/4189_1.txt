Came in for my friend and I's first piercings and it was such a quick, easy, painless experience! Paul was super chill yet professional. He kept conversation while preparing everything to keep us calm. Told us to breathe in, breathe out and it was done just like that! For both my ear lobes I paid $45. Would definitely recommend Paul for any piercing!!
