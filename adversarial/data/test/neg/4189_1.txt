Lazar is an excellent Portuguese bakery\/deli located in the Mississauga City Centre. Having lived in the area for over 17 years, I've been to the bakery too many times to count. They offer great options for pretty much any situation, so I'll just describe the things that make Lazar great.\n\n1) Sandwiches: They also make fresh deli sandwiches, with nearly endless meat options. It's not explicitly stated, but to have a sandwich made for you, you pick up one of the fresh buns in the back of the bakery, bring it to the counter, and choose your meat(s). They'll serve the sandwich to you in their seating section, so you can watch TV while you wait.  \n\n2) Desserts and baked goods: Try the traditional Portuguese tarts. The original custard is their classic, but I prefer the one drizzled and stuffed with white\/milk chocolate. Their cakes and donuts are also among my favourites. \n\n3) Hot food: They have a hot food section in the back right corner of the bakery. They offer a rotation of Portuguese dishes, made fresh daily. \n\n4) Grocery store: It's more than just a bakery\/deli - they also have a wide variety of Portuguese goods for sale.\n\nMy favourites:\nSandwiches: Prosciutto San Daniela, veal\nDesserts and baked goods: chocolate custard tart, donut, mocha caramel cake\nHot food: shrimp patties
