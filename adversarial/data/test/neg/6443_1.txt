I keep seeing the ten spot all over the city, and I haven't gotten the chance to check one out.  I was excited, I went to their website, also, checked out some of the videos on youtube.  I booked an apt to one that just opened up at don mills...and honestly, my experience was extremely disappointing.\n\nFirst off, Ive been to many many nail salons in my life so this review comes from someone who has had a lot of high end, mid end, and low end nail services.  With that said, when I first walked in, the greeting was a tad below average.  But that's fine.  After that I went to sit down, and I felt so cramped next to the person beside me.  People come in to unwind, and take a 'moment for themselves\" and here you are, sitting so damn close to the person next to you.  Awkward. \n\nI hate to sound like I'm ranting, but I'm really not liking the files they use they don't feel so great on your feet and strangely enough that's never something I've ever really complained about.  In terms of my nail practitioner, she seemed alright in terms of skill but when I'm paying 120$.....that just doesn't cut it.... it lacked technical execution for the price charged. When I moved from getting my pedicure to my mani, same thing, you might as well be sitting at a lunch table with 10 people.  There was a point when the girl who worked there had to clean her tools, and there was like a 10 minute wait time in between.  Sure it's cool they want to be clean and sterile but at the end of the day, do I really want to sit there for 10 minutes while you prepare your tools?  Like why is this not all ready..to go or do they not have back stock or something?!  Another thing that pissed me off is there shellac Blue machine that lights up wasn't working properly....and that was extremely annoying.  When you're opening a new store why are things like that...not..checked to ensure they work properly.\n\nMaybe it sounds like I'm being harsh on this review.  But at the end of the day for 110$ gel mani and pedi (with a discount because she could see show disappointed i was) I can say I will never come ever back.  I thought that the other nail salon nearby was expensive, but now that I see their quality and prices and comfortable tranquil atmosphere with massage chairs and high end feel....in comparison to the 10 spot, I will never come back here.  I don't see the value.
