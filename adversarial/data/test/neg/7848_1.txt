Took my wife's car in 3 years ago and they treated us extremely well. Did small repairs as requested and actually went above and beyond what we expected. So pleased that when it came time for a complete clutch kit installation I took her Tracker back to them for the work. Ralph and Drew alway listen and make suggestions if needed. They replaced the clutch and found a couple seals that I knew were leaking and called me to make suggestion on replacing them. I gave them approval to do so. \nWe are extremely pleased at the quality of work, the honesty of the family and mechanics. They truly do treat their customers like family.
