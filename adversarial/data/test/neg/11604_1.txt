We had our daughters rehearsal dinner here. It was such a great experience! The managers did everything to accommodate our needs before the event, including gluten free options for a few guests. Any questions that I emailed to them were answered promptly. And I have to say, this was not the case with other places.\nWe had the upstairs and our own bar.\nThe food was hot, abundant, and wonderful!!\nIf you have a large party,this is the place to go. The price was great too!
