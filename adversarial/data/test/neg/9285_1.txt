Steakhouse on one side and Italian on the other.\n\n- Dim lights.\n- romantic setting.\n- not cheap eating.\n- very elegant inside.\n- should dress nice, we didn't.\n- very friendly waiter.\n\nCome up: Prime rib - med well (38.ish)\n\nPrime rib came out in like 5 minutes of ordering...sort of odd.  The meat was warm - not sure why.  I thought the meat was a bit on the dry side...ugh.  Definitely not the best Prime Rib I've ever eaten - I expected much better...sorry.  I'll stick with the Rib eye next time I guess.\n\nWould come back.
