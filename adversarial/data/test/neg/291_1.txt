Nenita of Aloha Cakes makes the best yummy guava, passion fruit or coconut flavor cakes and more! Her Macadamia nut chocolate cake is amazing!  Everyone at my party just loved her whip cream frosting with moist sponge cakes that is flavorful yet not too sweet!\nShe makes gourmet cupcakes too.  I found her thru word of mouth. See her website to see her beautiful work of art!
