I come here occasionally and try all different foods they provide.  Today, I came in specifically for soju. The Lee's by my place has been out of the grapefruit flavor, so I came here because I know they have it.  I did end up getting a couple other flavors I haven't seen before, Apple and grape.  I thought that grapefruit was the best, but after trying the Apple, I know I was wrong!  I just wish they had it for the same price.   Lee's price for the same soju is only $2 bit here it's over $4.  \n\nI have eaten at the good court just up front and had purchased the bakery goods up front as well.  They do have a wide variety of food and korean home goods as well.
