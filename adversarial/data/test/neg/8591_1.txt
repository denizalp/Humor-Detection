AMAZING!! I would highly, highly recommend this law office. Attorney Cordova and his team are wonderful! Yuliana was an amazing paralegal and always kept me informed of the steps that were happening on my case. Lorraine is an awesome attorney who worked hard to get me the best possible settlement offer. Kendall did an amazing job working to reduce the amount I had to reimburse my health insurance and the result was unexpected! Overall they all did a fantastic job on my case from beginning to end. I would recommend all of my family and friends to give them a call if they are ever injured anywhere in Arizona, not just those who live in the Phoenix area. Thank you!!
