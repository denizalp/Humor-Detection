We only went to the casino to eat at Don Shula's Steak house. We had reservations for 7:45, however, they were running about 15mins behind and we had  to wait.  Our wait was well worth it as the dinner was awesome!  The menu is written on a football , which is different. The wait staff wheel a presentation cart to show you the cut and quality of the beef. We both had a filet and crab legs. Very high quality beef!  The  staff was very attentive. The only reason I did not give five stars is the noise level was a little high. A semi-circular room will reflect the sound around the room louder!  We will definitely go back!
