My daughter and I ordered from China Tango with their WONDERFUL online ordering system. We even made substitutions and everything arrived perfect and our last request was that it arrive hot, not cold. \n\nWOW! The food was fresh, excellent, hot upon arrival and we are now BIG FANS! We ordered Vegetable fried rice (perfect - no mushy vegetables). Egg rolls that were not greasy or soggy. Crisp and light. Pork Chow Mein and it could not have been better! Kung Pao Chicken with a substitution for snow peas. OMG -- we had enough left overs for another full meal+.  And so close to home. What a treasure to find China Tango!
