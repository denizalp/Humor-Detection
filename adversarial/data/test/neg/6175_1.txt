Super B is kinda like a cross between Roberto's and Chipotle. The ingredients are higher-quality (like a Chipotle), but it seems more local and is frequented by actual Mexican people (like Roberto's). To add to the authenticity, the menu is in both Spanish and English, and they have Spanish music playing over the radio.\nMy hsuband and I both got the Super Burrito - his in carne asada, mine in chicken, and they were good. The Super Burrito comes with beans, meat, pico de gallo, guacamole, and sour cream. The meat was good, but the highlights for me were the fresh, chewy tortilla, and the pinto beans. They tasted like the ones your friend's nana would always be making in the kitchen back in middle school. (if you had friends like mine). Price was around $6.50 for a super burrito and a few chips. Note that despite the name, the burrito is not huge Chipotle size. \nSince they have notices about 'nor-cal's best' and other similar claims on the windows, I thought this might be a transplanted California chain, but best I can tell, Super B is unique to Vegas (don't quote me, my research is not extensive).
