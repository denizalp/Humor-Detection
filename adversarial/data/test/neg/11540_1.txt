It's been about 14 months since we have been there so we decided to\nhave dinner at the bar. While I still can't stand  the multi gender bathroom, the food and service have improved nicely. Monday night and it was packed. While I still think that there are at least 3 better Italian restaurants very close by,if you are at the casino to play and want a quick bit or a nice dinner, it would be perfect. Caution,some  drinks ( non happy hour) are way over priced. The menu is also pricy for certain entrees. Ciao
