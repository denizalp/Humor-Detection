Tommy guns on 4th Found them great to start with, Staff were great loved the cut they gave me etc...\n within the last two days I have been turned away, bearing in mind that I had been there an hour in advance of the closing time and they didn't seem that busy both evenings. They must have a great business when they can turn away a paying customer.
