I always enjoy my drinks when I order, and the breakfast sandwich a friend ordered looked great with the fresh fruit. My complaint is the drinks are priced like any other chain, (large blended with whip is $6.50+) and the drinks that do not normally come with whip cream they charge an extra 50 cents. They also have a stamp card which is great when you remember!
