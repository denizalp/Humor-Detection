Convenient location and spacious seating. My friend recommended that I try out this place especially for the snow ice which ironically I didn't try out this time. I had the milk tea with grass jelly (less sugar) ~$5 and sesame brick toast ~$4 which were pretty decent prices. My friend got the $9.99 combo with fried chicken, salted eggs and rice with a side of green apple green tea drink. \n\nService was great, staff were pretty quick and most of all they were friendly unlike many other bbt places which was such a great change. Would definitely be back and always try to come here earlier to avoid meal rushes. When we left at around 8pm, there was massive wait queued at the entrance.
