Sampled spicy & sweet varieties. Purchased a bag of teriyaki jerky. I loved the spicy but we settled on the teriyaki because my 3 year old LOVED IT. NO Preservatives, high protein, & something I can get him to eat. That's a winner for me!!! & something I feel good about. \n\nLove shopping local & supporting small businesses like this. Lots of care in their products!
