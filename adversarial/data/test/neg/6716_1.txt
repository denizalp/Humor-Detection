We went here after eating at the rio buffet for several years in a row on our other trips. Our friends had gotten married and everyone went after. We were late and after catching up on some sleep made it over.. It was a weekend so it was like $10 more.. Never again. It may have been all the \"gourmet\" food but no thank you!! I'm easy, good quality sea food (hot or warm crab legs not cold or iced) and traditional buffet foods. This was not. It was all very good quality but to damn fancy for me. I tried caviar for the first and last time.. Three different kinds. I'm sure that may have been worth the $39 we paid per person but as for me it was way way over priced.\n\nThe desert section was awesome! Gotta love bananas foster!
