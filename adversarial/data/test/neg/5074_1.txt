This is currently my favourite bubble tea shop because they actually take the time to steep the black tea or rose tea. It tastes really good even without any sugar! My only suggestion is if they can make the tapioca balls or aloe vera jelly smaller in size as it currently exceeds the diameter of the straw, making it a little difficult. I agree that the service is slow as others has mentioned, but I didn't mind waiting around (lots of seating to hang out).
