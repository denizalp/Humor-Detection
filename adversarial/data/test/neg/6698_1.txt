I ate breakfast here the other day and wasn't impressed with the food. The potatoes had that freezer-burn taste. You could definitely tell it wasn't fresh. The country fried steak, which took longer because they didn't have any ready, was very grizzly and tasted warm inside as if it weren't cooked thoroughly. The service was OK, but I wouldn't want to eat here again.
