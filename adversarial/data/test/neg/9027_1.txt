My husband and I love Fibbers. We can walk there, and we have historically loved the food, drinks, people, and atmosphere. We went there today and the menu had changed, removing a couple of my favorite items, which was disappointing. We ordered a new item for an appetizer, the Brussels sprouts and were thoroughly disappointed. They were definitely nowhere close to \"pan roasted\" as described, were terribly underseasoned and undercooked. My husband ordered another new menu item as a meal, the 4 cheese and spinach flatbread. He was unimpressed, but did eat it. I ordered the peppercorn burger with potato crisps. The burger did not have the peppercorn sauce or onion strips as advertised, but was flavorful and cooked as ordered. Instead of potato crisps, which I was weirdly really excited about, I got champ. It was mediocre at best, and again, disappointing because I really wanted the crisps (needed some salty crunch). We have never had this type of experience at Fibbers, and were really upset about how it turned out. We love the staff, the love music, and the happy hour deals. However, the menu change is a huge bummer, as was the complete disregard for our correct order tonight. Might need to find a new watering hole!  :(
