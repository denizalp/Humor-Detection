Went in to tan last night with my daughter and the tan was great it's a great salon & will hopefully be returning soon! But as I reviewed the salon on here before I saw some people questioning the front desk ladies and honestly they're the reason for me not leaving a 5 star review. The two girls seemed to know nothing and gossiped more then helping while we were waiting..  I recommend upgrading the staff or at least the girls who were working last night now that I see there was another complaint.. maybe they were off their game or something but yeah definitely not a great touch to the salon. But tanning wise it is clean and taken care of!!
