Ok, first off this place was a hidden gem in that it was so hidden I walked past it twice before I found it. The decor was your contemporary modern vintage design with the beloved theatre sign as their menu top picks. \n\nThe food was good although a fair warning that it was quite spicy! I would definitely go for the spicy sizzling plate if you are with a group. The only thing kind of put us off was that their server felt like she was rushing us the time we were there. \n\nWhile I love a good seared mackerel, their portion was surprisingly small and so if you are ordering it, make it for one!
