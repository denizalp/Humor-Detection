I am from LA, and my favorite peruvian restaurants there are Mario's and El Rocoto. Those are the best peruvian restaurants in LA. So when I came upon Mi Peru, I just had to try it. I am proud to say I have found a place in Las Vegas, my second home, that satisfies my LOMO SALTADO with lots of AJI (green sauce) cravings. I can't wait to go back, and try the rest of the things on their menu. I'm a tough critic when it comes to peruvian food, especially since my boyfriend is peruvian. I learned from the best :)
