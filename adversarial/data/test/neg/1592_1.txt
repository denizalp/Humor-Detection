Went there on a Monday night, very quiet (not even any music). Food quality was great, but portion sizes were small even for a tapas restaurant. The draft beer system was down, so there was only one draft option. We sat on the patio, but had to move inside due to a big mosquito problem. My wife has 18 mosquito bites from our short stay on the patio.  Overall it was just ok, not great.  Had the facility been better shape, I would have rated it higher.
