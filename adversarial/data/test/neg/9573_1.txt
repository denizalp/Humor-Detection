Love this place, have been coming here for years! So sad when the one closest to my house closed, but this location is great! Waitress always remembers us and has for years. Food menu is available 24\/7 through the attached bar so if you're out late its perfect. You can sit outside near the fire pit or plenty of inside seating also. My favorite food items include the Lebni app and the goat cheese pizza, but I've honestly never had anything bad here. Wish they would open up on the north side!
