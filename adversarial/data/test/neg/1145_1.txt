When i started going there I liked it,  the salon is clean and had a good service and price. However the more I went I started to really dislike the place, no matter how many times you've been there they just treat you like they never met you before, unfriendly and some staff really don't know what they are doing including eyelashes.  Even when they made a mistake with my eyelash, took forever with lashes glued, the girl didn't even apologize.
