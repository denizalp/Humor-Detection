I go to Applebee's quite a bit and I've been to a couple different ones and this one by far is the best they always get my food right everyone there is nice it's always clean the service is great the food comes out fast and it's definitely my preferred one and I will always choose to go to this one been going there quite a bit lately for the half-price apps all the food tastes really good can't wait to go back to this one
