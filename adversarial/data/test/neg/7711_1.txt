I recently attended a convention here. The room was nice and clean and housekeeping was super friendly. They did forget things like replenishing toilet paper but they were easy to find in the hallway. The free breakfast was also very nice. My only complaint was the restaurant. They were supposed to be open until 2, we went at about 1 and waited and waited only to be told that the restaurant was already closed and going to the bar was the only option. There was nowhere to sit at the bar or any easy way to get it to go. It seemed they were grossly unprepared for a large convention when it came to food. Room service isn't available until dinner so that wasn't an option either. I would stay there again for a convention as the center itself is nicely set up but would be prepared to either go out to eat or bring my own food.
