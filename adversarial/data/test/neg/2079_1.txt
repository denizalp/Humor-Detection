Food is good and get alot of it, I did love the re fried beans that they serve. Two taco plate will fill you up for sure. \n\nServes was slow but it was a Friday and place was busy when we first got there, but then sorta emptied after that first dinner rush. \n\nBest part of the whole experience was a young man that worked there Jeffery was so nice and really took to talking to our daughter. But just watching him he seemed to work so much harder then the rest of the staff and I hope he gets rewarded for the way he treats customers and his customer service.
