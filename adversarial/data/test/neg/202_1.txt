I had a basketball game east of the strip and needed something cool and sweet to tide me over after eating at Oyster Bar and found this Mexican Dessert Shop. They've got all sort of unique flavors of ice cream, popsicles, and drinks.\n\nI got the Guava ice cream, which was a bit more grainy in texture than i would want in ice cream, and a tamarind popsicle which was good, but just too much to eat at one time for myself. At least its all cheap so i don't feel so bad not finishing them both.
