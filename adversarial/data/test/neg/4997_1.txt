I've driven by this place numerous times and never even noticed it but what a find!\n\nI came for brunch and it's a small place but the owners are lovely. They let us wait in the comfort of our car and called us when our table was ready. Service was slow but given the quality of food and that the place is run by a small family, its understandable.\n\nThe food was completely worth the wait. I ordered the chicken cordon bleu omelet which is made with a whopping six eggs. Comes with toast, potatoes, and a massive pancake. The omelet was filled with generous chunks of chicken and asparagus and they are seriously liberal with the hollandaise and cheese.\n\nThe rest of the menu looks absolutely delicious and I will definitely be going back. Don't be surprised when the adorable owners ask you to doggy bag the rest of your food (because you will definitely not be able to finish it). The wife (server) and husband (cook) duo definitely take the time to chat with you and they actually remember who you are.\n\nGreat experience.\n\nOh yes, and they get busy on weekends so be prepared to wait. It's worth it.
