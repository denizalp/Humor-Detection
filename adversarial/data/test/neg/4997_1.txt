Bryttny was a fantastic server. Ask for her when you come in her. Her recommendations are impeccable. Brussels sprouts, lamb neck, beet tartare, umami butter, hamachi, and lost in the woods Cocktail. All of it were amazing. Kudos the the staff and Bryttny for treating my NYC guests and I to a fantastic experience.
