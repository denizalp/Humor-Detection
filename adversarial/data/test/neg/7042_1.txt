Another reason to love Yorkdale.  I was stupid enough one day to leave a jewelry purchase on one of their displays while trying on a pair of shoes.  I left the store for quite some time and was lucky enough that the staff had set it aside.  Pretty cool, and I haven't even mentioned the second pair of shoes I have purchased at one of the numerous sales offered at Softmoc.  Awesome location.
