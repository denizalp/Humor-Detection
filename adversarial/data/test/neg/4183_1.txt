A hidden gem for all the Japanese car enthusiasts. The owner, Mori, is very knowledgeable and does great work. He helped me keep my old '95 Subaru Outback in good running shape and installed Forester suspension on it to lift it. Since I've upgraded to a '13 WRX he has put in an Exedy clutch with lightened flywheel, and a Kartboy short shifter kit that I didn't have time to install myself. He's very friendly and his turn around time is usually pretty quick. There have been multiple times where he would keep working past closing time to get my car finished.\n\nIf all of that isn't enough to convince you, just go and check out his shop yourself. It's always jam packed with all sorts of interesting cars which speaks volumes on the quality of work he does. Mori loves what he does and it shows in his work.
