Ordered thru yelp\/eatstreet.. Over and hour and a half and no food.. Called them to cancel my order.. Girl that answered the phone said they couldn't find the order even though I received an email confirmation and they charged my card.. She didn't apologize not one time or try to make the situation right and directed me to eatstreet to call and get my money back.. I called eatstreet who actually offered an apology even though it wasn't their fault and refunded my money... Eatstreet told me Gino's had confirmed my order.. If you are the owner and read this at least teach ur employees to apologize and make a situation right... Smh
