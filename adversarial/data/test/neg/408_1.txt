So much better than Starbucks.\nThe coffee selections are great and there's a small selection of pre-prepared food...hard boiled eggs, pastries, sandwiches, etc.  The service is always quick and friendly.  I guess I've sort of become a regular as one of the baristas ses me and knows what my husband and I want.  Either that or we are REALLY stuck in a rut!\nAll in all, great.  I'd suggest it instead of Starbucks down the mall.
