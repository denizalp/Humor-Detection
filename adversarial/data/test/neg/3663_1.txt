I'll start off by saying that this place really impressed me with their dishes. The taste and presentation of everything was just superb!\n\nI ordered the eggs benedict with roast pork. The cornbread was crunchy, seasoned and delicious. I usually don't like runny eggs but they tasted great with everything else on my plate. Hubby ordered the rainbow salad and that was amazing. The size was generous and it included papaya chunks, mango slices, chickpeas, pickled pink onion, crunchy shallots on top, avocado and more! It really did look like a tropical rainbow and there wasn't any cheese, croutons or heavy dressing to ruin it. We finished everything super quickly. The prices are high here.\n\nWe went on a Sunday and stopped unexpectedly for brunch without any expectations. I will say it's actually a bigger place than most other restaurants in the Strip District. The owner had to move us to another table and there was a change and delay in being served but for the trouble, she offered us a free drink on the menu. I had the lime grapefruit margarita and it was so strong! Presentation was beautiful but I could not finish it ;). \nThe only downside was the slowness of our server. Since we changed tables, we had to wait an additional 8-10 min for someone to notice us and assign us a new server. Other than that, they were friendly enough. I would definitely come back to try their weekday menu!
