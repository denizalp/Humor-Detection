I am a fan of this Panera. I am occasionally sent to work at a location that is near this particular one, and I remember when it was closed for the transition between Paradise Bakery into Panera. They have always had good customer service in my eyes, and adding the 5 Kiosks to the front is very efficient when you want to skip the line. I've never had a problem with their food either.
