A good old fashion screwing from these jokers. Asked me if I wanted to upgrade at no extra charge after waiting in an annoying line for 1 hour. I said sure, like a fool, and when I saw the total bill was $200 more, He said, Oh that will come off. It didnt and it was $150 more on my credit card. Go to Hertz, Budget and someone reputable. This outfit is a scam.
