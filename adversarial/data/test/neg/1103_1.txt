Great lunch specials that I just have to rave about.  The Thurs. lamb special is my fav but the naan is fresh, hot delicious and great with any meal.  I've always had good service, the decor is comfortable with some exotic Indian touches. But mostly it's always yummy and a good quick lunch to share with friends.
