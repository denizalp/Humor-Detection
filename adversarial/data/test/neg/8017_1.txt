I had a car stereo installed about four months ago, and I couldn't be happier with the job they did.  The price is very reasonable; it actually was less than they initially quoted me because they ended up not needing one of the parts.  I know next to nothing about car stereos and I wouldn't have known the difference, but they were honest and took the part off my bill.  The staff are great people and they were very understanding when my schedule changed that day and messed up my pick-up and drop-off times.  The service was professional and fast, and I've been very pleased with the job they did.  Highly recommended!
