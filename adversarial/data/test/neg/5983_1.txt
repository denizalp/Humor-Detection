Although this shop is located in downtown Champaign, it does not sit directly on the strip that gets the bulk of foot traffic, and thus it might be easily overlooked.  The first time I stopped in, I couldn't help but feel instinctively that this was one of those magical curiosity shops from my childhood books: all crowded aisles and dusty shelves piled to the ceiling with colorful fare.\n\nThe primary product sold here is tea (of course), and they've got plenty of it in all brands, flavors, and forms.  Thankfully, they carry Traditional Medicinals, a set of herbal teas that are invaluable for getting me through the cold\/flu season.  Many of the big brand teas (Harrisons and Crosfield, Twinings, Stash, Republic of Tea, etc.) are available in both loose-leaf and teabag form.  Reluctant about paying $10 for a box of tea that you might not like?  You can make up your own variety pack by buying from their stock of individual tea bags (usually less than $0.50 per bag).  \n\nIf you're a novice and just want to sample different kinds of tea, there is also the route of buying some of their self-serve bulk tea.  In the winters, I am a big fan of the Seattle Market Spice; for summers, I usually pick a mild fruity tea (like black currant) for brewing ice tea.  I do question their storage method (left in transparent glass jars on open shelves) as I'm pretty sure tea is supposed to be kept somewhere dark and dry to maintain freshness.\n\nAside from a variety of teas, they also carry bulk spices, bulk coffee, tea cakes\/biscuits, jams, chocolates, and soup mixes.  The shop owner will help grind your coffee upon request.  Most of the candy and snacks sold here are quality items produced by small or foreign companies not commonly found in regular grocery stores.\n\nShopping for a gift?  You can find teapots and teacups (both classic European-style ceramic and some of the Asian variety), as well as other tea-time accessories (including strainers, spoons, cloth napkins, etc.).  Some of the teas are sold in old-fashioned, decorative tins--these make charming presents for a tea-lover you may know.\n\nFor the total foodie maniac, this place may not be all that impressive in the products they carry, but it's still more than adequate for a town like Champaign.
