As Tim J. said, Zach did a product photo shoot for our bakery. Everything went great- he is professional and talented. The images turned out so great that i'm thinking about framing some of them. Seriously. \n\nIf you're looking for an excellent photographer, look no further than MelonFish Photo. You will not be disappointed.
