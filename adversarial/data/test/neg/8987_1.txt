YUM! What a suprise! Two a.m. and starving after a long flight. I am expecting crumbly dry stringy chicken tacos from anyplace to fill the void. Very amazed. Freshly made light flaky crunchy shells with juicy hand carved chicken! ...and adobo seasoned al pastor style pork with lots of achiote flavors. Wow! Served americano style with lettuce and shredded cheese. Coulda asked for cilantro...make sure you ask for the spicy tomatillo salsa. Best green sauce I have ever had. Large portions here too. About 2.80 a taco I could have easily stopped at two and one would have made a nice light 10 oz meal. Warning, the soft drinks are expensive but really mixed well...the diet coke was sweeter than yoo hoo...not a bad thing. Ice water with limes and lemons free from the salsa bar for the non-soda drinkers.
