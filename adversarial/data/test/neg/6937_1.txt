I came here with low expectations. I really can't stand this new trend of Neapolitan pizza... they are usually very doughy and unnecessarily heavy. I prefer a crust that is on the thinner side, not too soft and not too many toppings that you can't taste the deliciousness of the actual pizza dough. I usually stick to Napoletana (Montreal Little Italy) for thin crust and Taglio di Roma (Laval) for pizza al taglio. \nAnyways, I went to Arthur Nosh, next to Adamo, to pick up pancakes for my mother. I decided to give Adamo a try. I had the rapini and ricotta slice and the fior di latte and basil slice. Absolutely fantastic. I know I will be a regular... at least when I am in the area.\nI love that they created something new, without copying anyone else. It's fresh and the quality of the ingredients stands out. Well done!\nBravi!
