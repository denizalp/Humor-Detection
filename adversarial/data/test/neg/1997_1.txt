Great food!  We really loved the food, my burger cousin Oliver and fries was just the right size.  I am not a pickle fan and usually ask for them to be removed.  The pickles that came on my burger were fantastic, crisp and delicious. I would have liked the fries to be crispier though I like the concept of making them in the oven.  My wife had a quinoa bowl and enjoyed it.  The kids had a burger and he chicken sandwich.  The kids meal had a good amount of food.  Both kids liked there food and were stuffed without finishing.  \n\nWe arrived around 11:30 and there was one order ahead of us.  The food took longer than we expected.  Maybe that is because it is made fresh?   My burger was cooked perfectly and the bun was not soggy so they got it right.  We liked the drink selection and seating.  No major concerns.  BGood is a great addition to the area!
