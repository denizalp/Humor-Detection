Now a gaming establishment, which is kinda surprising. They have 5 machines at the bar. \nI hadn't been here since they opened, so I headed there to investigate the gaming situation.  There is a gaming flyer and menu at every machine, which is helpful and appreciated. When this place was Gordon Biersch, I always said they should have gaming. \nThey have the prestige of being associated with successful ventures as mentioned on their Web site- \"....Teresi's previous renowned ventures, including Bradley Ogden, Sugar Factory and Gordon Ramsay Steak without the hassles of the Strip.\"\n\nThe restaurant is huge, and the entire back area was empty while I was there. The patio is probably the better area for dining. The overall space is nice, and having the cooking area out in the open is kinda cool.  As for the bar, they have a decent draft selection, and many bottles as well. I went with a tropical Sam Adams bottle, which was excellent. The bartender was nice, & suggested a cool drink I've not come across- Guinness with coconut vodka! Bravo!
