This place repaired my 3 favorite pair of jeans for a reasonable price. They are also very friendly and will definitely come back if my jeans ever rip again which is more than likely. The place is a little hard to find, its on the 2nd floor of this plaza and its joined with another business. If you need any repairs or alterations to your jeans this is the place to go!
