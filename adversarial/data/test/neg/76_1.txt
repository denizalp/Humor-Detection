Southern-style food and southern hospitality. The service here is amazing. Our server, Paula, was a rockstar. Thank you so much for the incredible cocktails and delicious mango salad!! The Southern Revival is absolutely delish, I could drink them all day, every day. Thank you all for such a great experience.
