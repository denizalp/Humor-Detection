I loved the atmosphere and decorations  of this place. Everything almost seemed mismatched yet it all seemed to go together. Its a huge open space so I am sure even if they were crowded it wouldn't seem that way.  Had a house salad for appetizer and the jambalaya  for an entree.  Good service here as well. Be sure to read what's in the house salad before ordering! It was great. I appreciate  the attentiveness  of the waiter to be sure that I was okay with it. As it isn't your ordinary house salad. For one thing it comes dressed, with grapes and apples. Which I loved since plain salads are so boring. Had the amethyst  cocktail  which was nice fruity I wish I could have ordered it in a tall glass! Jambalaya  was good as well but I wish I had some more shrimp! Lol I love shrimp!
