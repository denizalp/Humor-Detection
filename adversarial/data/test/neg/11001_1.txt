Echo Sushi is officially added to my list of great sushi restaurants in this great city we all call Toronto!\n\nI had my first experience at this restaurant tonight but I was very impressed with the freshness and quality of the fish and veggies in the sushi rolls I hungrily devoured.\n\nMy friend and I decided to go for the ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI option, but what makes Echo Sushi so smart is that they offer 4 different levels of ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI so you are able to either pay a cheap rate for amazing sushi or go a level or two higher to get insane stuff like octopus.\n\nI selected the first level (BUFFET A) and I had a ton of things to choose from.\n\nIn the end, I ordered with my friend the following rolls, which were delicious:\n\n- Rainbow Roll\n- Catepillar Veggie Roll\n- Spicy Salmon Roll\n- Fire and Ice Roll\n- Firecracker Roll\n- Red Dragon Roll\n\nIn addition to the large selection, you can get any roll in hand roll or sushi roll format. \n\nAs well, they offer up a ton of appetizers like warming miso soup, crunchy green salad and tons of green tea and water to go around.\n\nThe total cost for my meal tonight was $13.99.\n\nThis is what I call AMAZING for sushi that was delicious and for a menu that had pages of options to pick from.
