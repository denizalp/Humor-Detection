Most amazing Trash Can Nachos I have ever tasted and the freshest Caesar salad ever!\nWe were with a group of 9 and each needed to pay separately knowing they still needed to add gratuity into each of our bills for the 9 people. I would have given this restaurant a 5 but the waitress was the rudest person we have had while in Vegas. She almost ruined what was a great meal. She bit our heads off saying she isn't allowed to split tickets and then after splitting tickets she slammed everyone's bill down and was extremely rude. Young, brunette with attitude equals No Bueno!!
