Amazing burgers. I really like the choice you have for buns, and they are really nice as well. The burgers are organic free-run and all that healthy stuff, so people on paleo diet like me could appreciate this more. The patties are not so greasy but juicy nonetheless.\n\nThe place is kinda noisy on weekends, i guess that's expected of a place like this in downtown. Seating arrangement and service is good. In all, the environment is OK, i guess I prefer quiet places.\n\nSo, great food, OK environment, heart of downtown, not-so-expensive burgers.\n\nIt's worth a try if you are in downtown, or a burger lover.
