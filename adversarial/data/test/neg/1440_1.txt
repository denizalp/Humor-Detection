Ok. So, the food is great. The portions are huge. Those are the only positives. It took 25 mins to get our order taken by a guy that seemed stoned. The food seemed to take a long time to come out, but I'm not sure when he actually put the order in. Be prepared to share food or box half of it up. My 4 yr old ordered the snores pancakes off the kids menu- it would be too much for 2 grown adults to eat. That's not bad because we brought it home. My toast arrived after I was done eating and right before the bill. The set up made it hard to talk while we were at the table. Everyone kept bumping into us. All in all, not a great visit.
