Our service really made for the 5 star experience. We sat at the chefs bar, and Leanne (pretty sure that was her name?) was just fabulous. Very attentive and friendly. \nWe ordered the cold seafood plate (oysters, clams, prawns, king crab and lobster tail- which is prepared right there). \nI live very near some of the best local seafood spots (IMO) on the west coast so I'm always hesitant to eat seafood in the desert (yes, I know about refrigerated planes and trucks), but it was great! Everything tasted fresh and flavorful and not fishy. I was pretty full after this, but did try some Manhattan clam chowder which was very good as well. We ate here twice, and between the 3 of us the chowder was ordered 4 times. The bread basket comes with 3 different breads as well. Didn't sample much else of the menu, but what we had was great and everything else coming out looked and smelled great too.
