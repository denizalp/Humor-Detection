I rarely give 5 stars to a restaurant but my experience at Earth tonight was superb. As good as it gets! I came here with a groupon that offered a 4 course meal for $39.  Unlike some prix fixed menus I've had, this one did not skimp on portions or quality.\n\nFirst off, the ambience is lovely. Gorgeous light fixtures  and dark wood. Also spacious so we didn't feel like we were sitting with the table next to us.\n\nMy friend and I shared the appetizer plate which was toasted sesame rolled goat cheese and octopus salad and this delightful, refreshing salad that i think was fennel. \nAll were very tasty.\n\nWe then had the mushroom soup, which was pureed mushrooms -- unlike anything I've had before and absolutely delicious. Our server let us know it was non dairy without us even asking, which was very thoughtful.\n\nWe had the trout for our main, which was also delicious. Large portion, and served in pureed parsnip with dried apricots - YUM.\n\nI was full at this point, but desert came with our meal so we had the sticky toffee pudding and the cheese board. The cheese board was small, but to be honest we were stuffed. The cheese was fantastic, garnished with walnuts, crustini and some type of  dried berry.  The sticky toffee was so good that I'm actually still thinking about it now and I'm not even a big fan of desert. \n\nThe service was excellent. Super friendly, non intrusive staff made our night beautiful. \n\nI know I'll be coming back here. Earth is out of this world! (had to do it...)
