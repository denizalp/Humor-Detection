My iPhone 6 screen cracked. No problem. Caught Uber from hotel on strip got there in less than 10 minutes. Fixed less than 15 minute. Price was good. They took my CC. Excellent \n\nUpdate: A little over a week on 7\/31 my screen begin having vertical blue ghost like lines for no apparent reason. Called the shop spoke to Randy \nHe indicated that it  sounds like a defective screen  told to bring in and they will replace but here's the thing I'm no longer in Vegas I was on vacation. So I have no recourse but to take to the Apple Store in my city this Friday. Randy stated he is willing to work with me on some sort of compensation. Moral of story don't get your phone repaired away from home.   Stay tuned for further update.
