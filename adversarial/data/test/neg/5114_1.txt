I have a love\\hate relationship with this place.  I love the food here. I hate that they seem to have so little concern for their customers, that they make you wait over 30 minutes for a seat when half the restaurant is empty.  I love the prices but I hate the dirty looking floors.  Still I go because the sushi is good and the prices are right.  I recommend the Rainbow Roll, Hawaiian Roll, and the Haru Sushi. The Baked Scallop Roll is pretty good too.  If you don't see what you want, just ask. They seem happy enough to custom make you something.
