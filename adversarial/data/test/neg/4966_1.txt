I needed to install new lights in my condo and when I tried to do it myself the electricity went down in the whole room.\nI am very happy about Waz's service, he was available very quickly and fixed my issue in no time!! He even fixed some plugs that were not working for a longtime!\nI definitely recommend him if you need a quick fix and for small electrical issues. He is honest, efficient and cheaper than big companies.\n5 stars for me for sure!!
