Had an intense craving for Korean food when my friends and I came for a music festival. \n\nComing from SD, we have a decent selection of Korean restaurants but not much as far as late night snacks.\n\nWe got the tteokbokki or spicy rice cakes. I don't remember if I knew it had cheese or not but I do remember being overly happy when I saw it came with cheese. \n\nFor someone with a bad spice tolerance, I endured the pain and kept eating the rice cakes. I'm missing them right now, as I right this review.\n\nMy girlfriend and I were planning to get the bulgogi pizza on the drive back but they're not open. When my friends and I came to Vegas, I hyped it up but ended up realizing it was closed .\n\nI'll eventually get the bulgogi pizza some day but I definitely recommend the spicy rice cakes.
