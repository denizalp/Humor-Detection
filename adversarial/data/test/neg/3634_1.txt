Ordered the super burrito with carne asada, cheese enchiladas, and a super flour quesadilla.\n\nStaff was friendly, and order was made pretty quick and accurate.\n\nThe burrito was SUPER SMALL for the price, and overall was average, the meat was seasoned not bland like some places.\n\nThe cheese enchiladas were pretty good, loved the sauce was really good. The rice was alright, and the beans were really bland, no flavor\n\nThe super quesadilla was also small, but was pretty fat, it was alright, nothing special\n\nOverall, I pass this place all the time, but i mean unless i have a serious craving for cheese enchiladas i will continue to pass it by
