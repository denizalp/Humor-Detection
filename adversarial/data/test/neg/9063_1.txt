This place sure is pretty. Definitely one of the nicest looking clubs I've been to in Vegas. That earns it a four star rating for sure. \n\nThis place is popular so try and get on a guest list or something so you don't have to wait on line. Luckily we met a promoter that let us in right away. There is an area for dancing which gets packed! Only head over there if you are in the mood to be dry humped by random strangers. \n\nThe rest of the place is huge. Plenty of space for you and your group to hang out without being bumped into every five seconds. There is a bar behind the pool which wasn't crowded at all. \n\nSure the drinks are ridiculously priced but this is Vegas and you're not in a dive bar. Don't you know the rules? Drink in your hotel before heading here that way you only have to buy one beer.
