This place is great!  My friend who works in construction who is an absolute master of his trade in commercial overhead doors told me about McFadden Dale about a year ago. This place has everything you can't find at your local Home Depot or Ace Hardware. These guys are polite, friendly and helpful and they stock everything!  My new favorite place to go for construction related materials, tools, etc!  Check them out you won't regret it. Worth the drive from any part of town but conveniently located on Decatur north of the 215 near Russell.
