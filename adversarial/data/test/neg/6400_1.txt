I really enjoyed my meal. I didn't read any reviews before I ate there so I didn't know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised. They have a really good social hour menu with cheaper prices which is why I decided to try them in the first place. We ordered about 6 items and liked them all.  I recommend it.
