I've been here twice now and this place is as cute and fresh as it can be. First visit I had the eggs benedict with potatoes. The eggs benny were delicious, the orange juice was fresh and cold, but the potatoes were average. Second visit I had the pear omelette and a little bran muffin. That may not sound good to some, but this was absolutely delicious. Great taste and presentation. The service is very friendly here and though it's crowded, it's super-clean. I wouldn't hesitate to visit again. Might skip the potatoes though.
