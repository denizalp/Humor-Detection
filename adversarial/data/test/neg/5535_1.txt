Pretty good cheeseburger. Toppings were fresh and the burger tasted good. Fries were good, but not worth the price. They are potatoes after all not truffles. I would suggest they up the price and include the fries.\n\nGreat beer selection no doubt. If you want a decent burger and a good beer I would try this place. Not a place to seek out from a distance, but if you are in the area I would recommend it.\n\nThe waiter was a nice guy, but not a very good waiter. Never stopped by after I received my food nor could I get a check. I had to flag him down. Maybe he was new to being a waiter.\n\nThey did have a  nice sports TV setup.
