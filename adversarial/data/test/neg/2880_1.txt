I've been to a few Los Dos Molinos and this one is just as good as any of them.  Maybe even with better service.  If you don't like spicy food this is not the place for you.  To come here and think you can order non spicy food is possible but it would be similar to going to a Sushi restaurant and ordering a hamburger.  If on the other hand you love heat and the more the better then Los Dos is for you.\n\nI usually get the carne adovada which is cooked overnight and absolutely phenomenal.  Sometimes I will get the blue tamales or the enchilada platter or tacos.  They are also really good but nothing is better than the adovada in my book.\n\nThe green salsa and the red salsa are both very hot and delicious.  The rice and beans are also both well done.  Fluffy soft rice and flavorful beans.  Many Mexican restaurants seem to forget to make solid sides.  Los Dos does them both well.\n\nThe sopapillas are excellent too.  They come with four huge fluffy pieces sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon with a side of honey to dip them in.\n\nRecommend to any spicy food lover.
