One of the best places I have ever eaten. I had the wild mushroom enchiladas and they were absolutely delicious. The fresh chips came with spicy salsa and guacamole that was freshly made. I can't wait to go back, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to find an excellent Mexican restaurant in Phoenix.
