Some of the best BBQ I've had, period! \n\nWe got here on a Friday around lunch time, straight from the airport. \nThe line was about 25 - 30 minutes deep. That is considered a short wait from my understanding. They were already out of one meat option. \n\nWhile we waited, we got a glimpse and whiff of all the smokers. That made an already hungry Tim even hungrier.   \n\nI got the brisket, ribs, beans, and grits. Every bite of the food was delicious and TOP quality. \n\nNot sure when I will be in Phoenix again but this place is worth leaving the airport during a long enough layover at PHX. Since they are only a 5 - 10 minute drive away.
