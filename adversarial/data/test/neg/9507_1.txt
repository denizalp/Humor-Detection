We started going to Pleasant based on a recommendation from a family friend, in the 5 years we've been going, haven't regretted it once. \n\nFriendly staff, clean office, plenty of activities for the kids to partake in while waiting and they do a great job explaining everything. Very thankful for the dentists and staff members here!
