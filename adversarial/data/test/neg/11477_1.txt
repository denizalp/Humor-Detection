I started going to Step Up Styles after my dad has been there for years and figured I'd try it. I started getting my hair done by Danielle and I'm so happy I did! Very nice Salon in a convenient area for me. I love the atmosphere of it and the stylists are so nice. They even gave me a reusable shopping bag for Christmas! I look forward to getting my hair done at Step Up Styles!
