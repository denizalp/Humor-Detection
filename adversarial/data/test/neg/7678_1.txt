Disorganized chaos. \n\nWe like this place and try and go frequently, but the disorganized service is killing it. We will give it a few more times, but notice more than that. \n\nThis morning we ended up at a table in no mans land. To our knowledge, we never had a server. After 10 minutes of sitting there we grabbed someone and put in a drink order. 10 minutes after that we grabbed someone else and finally *got* our drinks. Eventually we put in an order, which clearly made a quick run to some nearby city before it made it to the kitchen. \n\nWe *almost* got a water refill, which was cool. Almost. \n\nOur meals were also *almost* correct. Only a few items missing we later managed to get removed from the bill. \n\nEveryone was friendly, but they need to take a hard look at how poorly they run the front of house. This isn't the first time we've had an experience like this, and they didn't look all the under staffed. \n\nWe had our kids which didn't help since they subsisted in a liquid diet until the food showed up- then didn't eat.
