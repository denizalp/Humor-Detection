Went here last winter, and I am just getting around to writing this review.  The food pissed me off so badly, I am still angry about it.  We went in there after my brother recommended it for the burgers.  We sat at the bar, and the bartender ignored us for fifteen minutes.  We were 2 of a total of 4 people sitting at the bar, so this is unacceptable!  They had my favorite beer on tap (Southern Tier Pumking), so we ordered 2 and asked for a menu.  We each ordered a different burger, and both asked for them medium rare.  We also got an order of the mild wings.  The burgers came out with extremely thin \"Plank Fries\".  They were ridiculously salty and pretty much inedible.   The mild wings, were almost tasteless, with only a hint of spice, and very feeble in size.  The burgers were an abomination to the word.  They were overcooked, and fell apart when we bit into them.  There was obviously no binding agent put into the burgers.  They weren't seasoned and the bun was soggy, which was strange since the burgers were not juicy.  We will not ever be returning to this establishment, which is unfortunate considering how nice the inside looks.
