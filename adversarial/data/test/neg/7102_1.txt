I got my haircut here for the first time today. It was done exactly how I wanted with little need for direction. This lady knew what she was doing. A good barber should be able to do a precise job using only scissors and a comb and without using water. I hate wet haircuts. Saki used only scissors and a did a dry cut using clippers sparingly. No unnecessary conversation or banter. Just focused on the haircut and got it done efficiently and precisely. They also shampoo your hair afterwards. The total was $17 which is reasonable. The location is a couple blocks from the Bathurst subway station. Make sure you bring cash. They don't take credit\/debit cards.
