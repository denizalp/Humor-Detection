We bought a Cahaya Dresser from Zenporium about a month ago - and I am finally getting around to thank everyone who helped us out. From the friendly sales team who were very dynamic in helping out with all the adjustments made to our order and customized the dresser to fit our specific dimensions to the delivery guys that made sure not only they deliver the dresser but also help us in rearranging the furniture so that the dresser fits exactly in the right place. Awesome product in repurposing an old wooden boat into a modern dresser!!! Highly recommend your company!!!
