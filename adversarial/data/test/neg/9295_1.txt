Stopped by on a Friday night, the place was fairly empty.  I can tell the waitress is new, they got our order wrong.  Brought us food without utensils or wasabi.  I had to ask for it upon her return to bring us soup and salad.  Food was okay.  Teriyaki is not brown as expected, and it was on the sweet side.  Sushi was alright, nothing special.
