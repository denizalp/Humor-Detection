Perhaps one of the most underrated and anonymous high-end restaurants in all of Las Vegas, Bradley Ogden focuses on farm fresh, seasonal New American cuisine.  \n\nService was OK, but I don't necessarily think that was our server's fault, per se.  The table next to ours had at least 12 people, mostly of the high-maintenance (read: stupid) variety and needed a lot of help.  They were also loud and annoying, but that happens sometimes in the big V.\n\nThe food, though, more than made up for that.  Mentioned in many reviews here, the blue cheese souffle is otherworldly.  I'm not a huge fan of the ribeye cut (often find it too fatty), but here it was rich, buttery and delicious.\n\nNext time I go back to Vegas, I'm returning to Bradley Ogden and having the hamburger.  Numerous sources, both on Yelp and in print, have deemed it one of the finest available.  We shall see.
