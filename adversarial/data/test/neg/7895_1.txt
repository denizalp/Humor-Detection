Horrible!!! DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY! \n\nI booked two limos one week in advance, and they charged my card 2 1\/2 x the price of EACH limo (which I said we'd pay in cash) the next day - before their services were even used. ($500 charge on my card, which was only supposed to be used to hold the cars, not to pay for them - this was explicitly stated.) \n\nWhen I called to find out why, they sent my call to voicemail. No apologies, and certainly no customer service. These people are criminals - watch out!!!
