Absolutely five stars!!! My massage therapist, Lindsey (I hope I'm spelling her name right) was awesome! I get massages a few times a month on average, and I'm very picky. I need someone who can really get in there with the deep tissue and she absolutely delivered. Better than most hotel massages I've had.\n\nThe decor is rad and the customer service is top notch as well, but when it comes to rating a place, as long as it's clean I really only care about the massage itself. Seriously, there's not one suggestion for improvement that I can think of to offer. Wish I lived closer, I'll be back next Vegas trip for sure!!!!
