If you haven't tried this place, I highly recommend you do! WOW!!! Staff members are courteous and quick, but the food is what keeps me and my family going back! I typically order the gringo enchiladas and my husband likes the flaming fajitas. We've eaten here several times and only once was our order wrong. The staff was quick to fix it and made it right immediately. Our glasses are never empty and always leave with our bellies full.
