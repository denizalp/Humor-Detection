Found the place to be average at best. Pancakes were not very good. They tasted like they were made from a mix, mushy in the middle, and they came with powdered sugar which I don't like (wish the server told me beforehand). Average wait time to be seated and for food to arrive. OJ was pretty bad as well- like the cheap stuff you get from the grocery store. I like the fact the place is not a chain, and I'd be up for trying other food there, but from my experience the pancakes do not live up to the hype.
