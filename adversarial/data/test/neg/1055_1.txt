I live in south Florida and train with a trainer regularly, I needed a place to go when I went to Cleveland, I am so grateful I went to core fitness. Dan trained me the last nine days and he was amazing. He is very knowledgeable, his workouts are creative and he pushes you. I loved his training so much that my mother went in and now will be working with him regularly. Adam and the other trainers at core fitness are equally as great. You can go in and work with any of the trainers and get an amazing workout. Every time I go to Cleveland I will be training with the team at core fitness. Plus the facility is immaculate.
