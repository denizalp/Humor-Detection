I had on and off low back pain for years, triggered by sudden, unanticipated movements. Each attack would leave me hurting for days, sometimes weeks, and limited my mobility severely. I have intermittently tried some home exercises, with only modest success. Only thing that would help was lying on my back on the floor with hips and knees flexed -- not a way to live your life. Last year I lifted a compressor over a curb and was suddenly hit with severe pain again. Convinced that I slipped a disc (or worse), I reached out to AZ Alliance PT, where the therapist actually found an SI joint misalignment which she successfully repositioned with instant relief. I was very grateful and I am still pain-free now, over a year later. The office has an upscale feel, and the staff is kind, skilled, and compassionate. This is not your drive-through, high volume, assembly-line PT practice. Highly recommended!
