I would give my experience here a one star, but the hostess, bartenders, and the wait to sit wasn't bad for a game night. Now given the fact that this establishment was extremely busy and is right next to PNC park, I understand the hectic work environment and amount of patience you must have to endure working in that. So here is my review.\n   We arrived at a reasonable time to be able to get a table, around 430-5 on a game night. We put our name in, which works of a text message system, and then sat at the bar for a few beers. The place was extremely crowded, but only took a couple minutes to get our drinks. We only had to wait for 30 minutes and then were sat. \n     Now, even though there was plenty of space to spread the tables out, we were still squeezed between other tables. About 4 other table groups and we were all squashed like sardines. They seemed to have an excuse for EVERYTHING. But anyway. It took a good 5-6 minutes to get the server. We ordered the fried pickle backs, a garden salad with ranch, and the st pattys melt. The fried pickles were more like a fried pickle chopped into small pieces, mind you this was $9!! They were not very good, the sauce it came with was though. I would NOT recommend ordering this.I did inquire about the small portion to the food runner and he said it was because the owner wants them cut like that. Ooook. The salad was huge and the dressing was thick. The sandwich was alright too, but the bead was a little hard or crispy.\n   The attention we received from the server was very minimal. Once we received our check we did not see our server again. They were setting up for an event where we were seated, so it was a little uncomfortable. Feeling of being rushed and the glares the remaining tables were getting. Another server ended up having to check us out. The bottom of the receipt was hilarious to me, also a little infuriating. Another table laughed as they read it too.\n   Basically, if your going to come here on a game day, just order drinks from the bar.
