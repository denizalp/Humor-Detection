Food is decent and customer service needs a lot of work..I'll never come here again due to the fact that I got a bad case of food poisoning from this place.\n\nAt 1pm on 3\/16\/18 I ordered 2 Carne Asada Fries for food for the road and got food poisoning throughout the rest of my camping trip over the weekend. Never Again.
