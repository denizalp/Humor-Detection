Avella Pharmacy is well worth the money out of pocket.  I especially appreciate the home delivery.  I live in Surprise AZ. and Pharmacy is in Scottsdale.  The delivery costs around $5.00 but its well worth it for me.  If I was closer to one of the locations I would most likely do more business with Avella.  Jan
