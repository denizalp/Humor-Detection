I changed my two-star rating to a three-star rating because upon reflection...I really do like their teas. However, their service leaves much to be desired. Rarely do I ever feel less welcomed in a restaurant. They're lucky they have such good drinks or else I would be tempted to leave this place and NEVER LOOK BACK! Never look back, I say! The drinks are a bit pricey, but I can't really find any other milk teas around here that taste as good ;T
