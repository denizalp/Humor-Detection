Very busy usually, but for good reason.  Great variety of share-able delicious Korean-inspired food.\n\nOur faves are the O.S. wings and the Torched Mackarel.  The Loosey and Bulgogi Cheesesteak sandwiches are also good.  The rice bowls are very good, however not worth $20+ in my opinion.\n\nHas a dimly-lit, hipster atmosphere that we loved ... however my parents would probably not!
