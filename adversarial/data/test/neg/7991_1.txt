Agreed.  Best yogurt in the Annex.  I used to go to Yogurty's in Oakville fifteen years ago... was pleasantly surprised to discover it IS as good as I remembered!  Although I was initially quite dismayed that the Annex was getting yet ANOTHER yogurt shop (what we need is more sushi), I have to say, Yogurty's can stay! The flavours taste less synthetic, and the topping selection blew my mind.  I find the price about the same as Menchies (but perhaps that's 'cause I can't resist the toppings as easily).  My favorite treat is definitely the white chocolate explosion and tiramisu yogurts with crumbled skor!
