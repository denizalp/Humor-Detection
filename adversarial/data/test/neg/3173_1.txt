We normally have good experiences here but they REALLY dropped the ball this time.  The food took half an hour to come out (our friend had her meal in 10 minutes) and we had to send part of it back because they neglected a food allergy.  Told the manager, and she just told us to come back tomorrow and they'll be better.  (Not after that)\nVery expensive disappointment, and super unimpressed with the manager who didn't even offer up an apology.
