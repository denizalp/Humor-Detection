After some of the reviews on Yelp, I was a little unsure about what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised when I had to go to the ER recently. Not only was I seen quickly, every single person who aided in my treatment was helpful and personable. All of my tests were completed in a timely fashion, and Dr. Kane communicated the results clearly. She ensured I left with all questions answered and concerns addressed. I highly recommend the hospital for its quick, friendly care.
