I wish this was open later as it was next to my hotel and not much else was going on. The education about rums, their country of origins and flavor notes was as good as the food.  A definitely great find for a road warrior.  Their jerk chicken tacos were as desired for a taco lover. In particular they offer really innovative hot sauces with mango base, pineapple base, and one other i can't remember. Very different and really interesting and satisfying.
