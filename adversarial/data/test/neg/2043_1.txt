I came here FOUR times during a 3-day stay in Madison. The first two was while I was working-from-home. This place is awesome to plug in, work away at a table, and enjoy a great variety of coffee. The other two times, I brought people who wanted good coffee, and this place delivered. Awesome atmosphere. Awesome awesome awesome.
