The 1 bedroom suite is nice.  The whole facility is very homely.  It was like staying in an apartment away from home.............................................................................................. My husband and I stayed here on a Last minute vacation that my sister who owns a time share got for us.  For 6 days we spent less than $300.  Upon check in they got us with a free breakfast and promise of dinner and a show we wanted for $20 and we would get $10 back to go through a tour (I figured it was a timeshare tour).  The next morning we went to the breakfast (at South Point buffet) with our Tour guide\/Sales person, which was good.  She gave us a tour of South Point and Grandview resorts (where we were staying).  It really was no pressure but we didn't get sucked into the new presentation room since our sales person was specifically for existing time share owners.  Needless to say we had a good experience, we were not held hostage or with them all day.    We didn't feel like we were taken or had a bad experience.
