My family and were on vacation when the dreaded check engine light turned on. Before that, we heard a clicking noise that didn't sound right. We panicked and called several nearby shops. We decided to take our car to Pep Boys due to the professional manner they provided over the phone. Len and the other guys there were not only helpful but they took their time out to educate us on how to prevent problems moving forward. The service wasn't too expensive and they were fast. I'd recommend anyone to go here. Thank you!
