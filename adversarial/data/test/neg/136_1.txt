I've been visiting Hair Paradise for seven years, at least.  My stylist Julie always does my hair just right.  The mood is  light-hearted, with plenty of banter between the sisters, clients and Ken the barber.  \n\nIn addition to their excellent service, there are usually plenty of hand-made or home grown items one can purchase...jewelry, eggs, seasonal items, etc.  I like to pick up the hand knitted cotton dish cloths for my mom.\n\nThe prices are very reasonable and the service is awesome.
