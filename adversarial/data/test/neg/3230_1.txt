Really great food all around and a nice relaxed, Americana atmosphere that lets you forget the crazy mall hubbub just outside the door.  I personally love that they do not fear the cooked perfectly, medium done burger.  This place was voted best burger in Las Vegas for a reason folks.  It's simple, it's delicious, and it's what you want to eat.  Also had a great bleu cheese wedge salad and some really amazing lobster mac and cheese.  Great service combined with reasonable (for Las Vegas) prices round this place out to be a convenient and delightful lunch or dinner.
