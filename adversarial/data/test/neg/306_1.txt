I have been to this place once since their Grand Opening and definitely plan to return! I know they are under the same chain as Bosa Doughnuts but imo these are better! The glazed donuts give Krispy Kreme a run for their money and their wide assortment of other types beats any doughnut shop that I can think of. Overall a great place, customer service is good, 4 stars is the magic number on this one!
