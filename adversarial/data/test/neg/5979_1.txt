I arrived at Dos Gringos for Taco Tuesday about 9:50 PM. Our party is only five people. I waited at the bar with one other person for ten minutes to be helped. The entire restaurant probably only had 30 people. The service was absolutely terrible. We waited an hour to be served after which one member of our party went to the bar to request that a waiter take our food order. There were four people on staff and we waited more than twenty minutes and still had not been helped. Added to that, after one member of our party had already been carded and opened a tab, he was carded again and accused of being underage. None of the members of our party plan to return. Too bad we didn't get to order, the food may have partially redeemed our visit.
