To start, I specifically created an account to write this review. I came to Diamond Jim's today to sell a piece of jewelry. Not only did I get more than I anticipated, Misty and Roy went above and beyond in customer service! I walked out with a smile on my face and a check in hand to find my car battery dead.Without hesitation they gave me a jump start. THANK YOU GUYS! I highly recommend this place. Stellar service!
