Great place to go for a quick clean job! Tubs are always available and clean. Lots of shampoo and conditioner choices for all types of dogs and skin issues. We always just go with a de shedding formula- smells great. Plenty of towels and dryers ready! Always a friendly staff. And my dog always gets a bully stick :)
