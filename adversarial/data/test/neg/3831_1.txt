Moderately priced for all your Filipino goodies. And it's nearby where I live, so that is also a plus. I have been craving Filipino food for a month, so thanks to Yelp - I saw they had a little Filipino cafe in the back as well. Good food, the cook is from Pampanga, where my family is from as well. They're are also very nice, I don't speak that much Tagalog, but are very welcoming. They have a $5.99 combo for white rice, and two entrees. Portion size was decent, I was able to share my meal with my sister. Usually I like to go early afternoon, because of the tip the other yelped stated how things were cooked fresh from 9am-12pm.  So whenever you're feeling lazy to cook, it's a nice quick place to get quick Filipino food, caldereta, pinkabet, etc.
