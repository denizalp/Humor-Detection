I was referred to Rhino's Maid by a co-worker and I am so happy he did, I spoke with Maria and she was great customer service skill. Love when the girls are scheduled to come they always show up 10-15 minutes early and if not they are on time 100%. I had an issue with my last house keeper she didn't always clean what I asked her and when I brought this up to Maria she made sure to include this in my notes. The girls are so fast and very efficient they work so hard! Love that they call me the next day to make sure everything is good. Also you can beat the price it's very compatible and you for sure pay for what you get.
