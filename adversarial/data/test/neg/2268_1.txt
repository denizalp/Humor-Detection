I was pretty jetlagged when I got there. So my impressions might have been altered. I was there on a Saturday night around 9 PM. And there was almost nobody: there was like five people outside and then maybe five people in and that was it. So, I was a little disappointed. Maybe I was too early.\n\nThe beer was good. I had the \"mini IPA\": a fully hoppy beer but not as strong as a standard IPA. A little too bitter for my taste but had an amazing floral aroma.
