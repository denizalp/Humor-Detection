I was reading some threads about Streetcar and wanted to check it out. We walked in and and the fort thing we noticed was the bright colors of the place and then the smell of deep fried food. With the kitchen in the middle of the dinning area this was definitely the  culprit. Not sure if the ventilation wasn't working well but it was pretty bad. \n\nThe best part of my visit was the the service from all of the staff. We had just about every employee checking on us or bringing out our numerous selections of food. The owner herself stopped at the table and had a minute to speak with us as well. Definitely 5 stars on customer service!\nStarted with the Beneits. The kitchen made extra so the owner brought us an order. That was a pleasant treat for sure and my favorite part of the meal.\n\nWe ordered hush puppies, fried mac n cheese and onion rings as appetizers. The hush puppies were the best of the trio. The hush puppies and mac were dusted with some Cajun seasoning. Both were tasty but just average IMO.\n\nThe Steetcar was my Po-boy choice. I love all the components so it was a no brainer for me. The bread and the catfish were the hit of this Po-boy. The oysters and shrimp were just ok, nothing wow about them . Overall an decent sandwich.
