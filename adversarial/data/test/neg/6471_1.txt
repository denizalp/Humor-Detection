3.5\/5. \n\n*Snotty barista. I inquired whether they had lactose-free milk and got a \"Uh.. no why?\" response. Seriously if you don't have, just say sorry no we don't, why give me an attitude? \n*nice decor with an open space. Music was quite nice and not overbearing. \n*Other than their Japanese-style pastries, the selection of coffee\/tea is just similar to other cafe. It would be nice if they have a specialized Japanese coffee\/tea. \n*Other than chocolate and matcha roll cakes, the shop also offer seasonal flavors such as Ontario peach or raspberry. You can buy either a slice\/half\/or the entire roll cake as well.\n*they should put a sign to indicate where the washroom is as almost every customers accidentally went to the basement (office). \n\n-Ontario peach & Rosemary roll cake - $3: \nThough the roll cake wasn't as moist and airy as the one from Petite Nuage, it was still delicious! The cake itself was infused with a slight hint of rosemary and the texture was really fluffy. The cream was not too rich nor too sweet and I love how you are getting huge chunk of fresh and slightly firm peaches here. There was a slight crust on top as well which gave some crunchy texture with every bite\n\n-London Fog Latte - $4.25: \nThe tea tasted like a typical Starbucks London Fog tea, nothing special. My friend said he didn't like the coffee here and Fahrenheit was way much better.\n\n-Neo Choux - $2: \nThe neo choux is essentially a Choux Creme (or cream puff) which is filled right as you order it. The pastry was light and crispy, however I thought the inside was supposed to be hollow to fill the pastry cream in? It was incredibly messy to eat this since the pastry cream was watery, not as custard-y texture as the one from Petite Nuage.
