I have always said that I prefer to drop a quarter into a pinball machine and have some fun rather than waste it in a slot machine.  This is the place to do it!  They have so many vintage pinball machines and \"newer\" ones from my own teen years, and most of them are playable.  Basically, if it lights up, you can play it, and they start at a quarter a game, some games being 75 cents for the newer ones.  And it's not just pinball.  There are a few vintage video games, and some older items like an arm wrestling machine, a love tester, a basketball game, and even a nickelodeon from 1921.  They all take real money, not tokens, so you only spend exactly as much as you want.  I spent a couple hours here and only spent about ten dollars.  I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Las Vegas.
