Good food! Cheap price compared! Did not bring jelly with toast! Steak not smooth, to hard and hard to eat!\nBathrooms need to be restock with soap and fix doors.  Your staff needs to have clean hands when serving and cooking. Bathroom size for restaurant is to small... I see has a health issue... I was giving out wipes for people waiting in line to use the bathrooms...
