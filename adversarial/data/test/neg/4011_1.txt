I have lived in this complex since 1998 and have been through a number of management companies. Current Management has been underwhelming to say the least. They have changed the front gate entrance from card keys to a numerical code and everyone has the exact same code, not very secure. They have made the process of picking up a package from the office more difficult than it needs to be and I have been waiting for maintenance to come fix the toilet in my bathroom which is unusable for almost four hours. Not holding out much hope that they will show up today.
