I have been a member 2 different times here and am pleased.  It is up to the members to clean up after themselves...face it.most of humanity is lazy which is gross,so jus wipe down equipment  before and after use...perfect pricing, especially when they have such awesone classes like yoga, zumba, spin etc etc!
