It's a nice neighborhood spot and we have been coming for a couple of years.  A bit pricey for the portion size.  I think they have kept the prices the same but decreased the sizes of our favorite dishes ( salads, cheese plate, pizza).  Recently went on a Sat. evening and it was quite busy.  We left after waiting over 1 hr. for 2 pizzas.  Caution: if you walk in and it is super busy....leave....you won't be getting your food.
