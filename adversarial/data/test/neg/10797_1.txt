Came here to get dinner after a few hours at the hospital and wished we went somewhere else. First off. After every item we ordered she tried rushing us to the window and wouldn't ask if we wanted anything else. During that, my friend went inside to use the restroom and no one acknowledged her until she noticed a kid (maybe 2 or 3 years old) running out of the kitchen. They then helped her. The food adter just did not taste right and we have been here before a few times where it tasted pretty good. The fact that my friends first meal after a few days of not eating was not only not good but the service is terrible we will most likely go somewhere else from now on. Let's hope OSHA walks in to see this.
