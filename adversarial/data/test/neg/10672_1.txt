Just had my first subzero experience. While the experience was different\/mildly entertaining,  the ice cream was beyond horrific. This was the first time in my 33 years of life that I actually threw out ice cream (I'll even endulge in months old freezer burned ice cream at home). The icing on the cake was the $6.06 it cost to have a SMALL creation, some peanut butter combo they have on the menu. I literally ran upstairs once home to brush my teeth and get rid of the horrible flavor once and for all. Worst $6 ever spent and worst ice cream I've EVER had.
