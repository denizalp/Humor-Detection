Great service. Went for lunch and ordered the lunch special sweet and sour pork, it also came with egg drop soup, eggroll, and a drink. The soup was the best eggdrop soup i have ever had in a Chinese restaurant in the many states I've lived at. However the sweet and sour pork was not the greatest, they were tiny fried pork pieces drowned in sauce. The fried rice was ok i think it lacked a little flavor but the eggroll was the nastiest, don't know what was in it but it was slimy and made me gag. Not sure if ill go back but if i do i wont get the sweet and sour anything.
