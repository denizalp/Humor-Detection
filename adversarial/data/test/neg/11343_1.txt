I'm so torn on this review. I would say the food and beverages rate a 5 but the service is barley a 2. We have gone probably 5 times since they opened and every time we've had terrible service, even when we were one on 2-3 tables and they had 5-6 staff on the floor. It normally takes forever for drinks. Many times we've seen our drinks sitting,poured and waiting for a waiter and after 10 mins we've gone and got them ourselves. At that point the beers were warm or mixed drinks had melted ice. \nEvery time get our food after a long wait then the server never asks how it is or if we need anything. We just ask for boxes and the check before anyone comes to check on us. \nWe have tried to order take out before and their phone system was totally messed up. They have you press another button to order but apparently it directs you to the bar and they don't do take out after a certain time but that was explained on the phone prompt so we sat on hold for over 20mins. I finally called over and the hostess took our order. \n\nIf the owner should consider hiring new management and staff.
