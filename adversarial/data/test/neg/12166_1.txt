This place has a lot of stuff for a little place. Very hard to find anything and when you do find it, make sure it works and the price tag is correct.  \n\nThis store is good for kids party supplies and loot bag items because you can find some pretty cheap stuff. \n\nCompared to other dollar stores, this place is near the bottom. The employees were not very friendly and just rushed us out.  We will travel the extra distance to Dollarama for the clean, organized and friendly service.
