There was a super long wait on Saturday morning. For all the hype, the food was ok, nothing crazy. The pancakes are ginormous and super dense. The sausage was really delicious, the bacon wasn't my fave. The inside felt like a darker, purpler Sizzler straight out of 1990. One more star just for having the sparkly fun and colorful rock crystal sugar in the sugar dispenser on the table.
