Used new \"Identity\" players club promotion for buffet and would not have paid $49.00 to eat here. There are some unique items on the line such as duck wings and bone marrow but overall it is average. The \"Wicked Spoon\" name may be why none of us received a spoon in our place setting. Staff said they would return with spoons but did not.
