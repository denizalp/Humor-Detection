Don't judge a book...\n\nWhen you drive into the parking lot of this restaurant, you instantly wonder if you've made a bad mistake. You haven't! This place is spectacular. It is coy and quiet, and has among the best Thai food I have ever eaten. No joke. The prices are reasonable, the service is relaxed and friendly, and the preparations of the dishes far surpass the flavor profiles of your average \"Pad Thai\" level Thai restaurant (which I also very much enjoy) by miles. Notably, the fresh spring rolls and lettuce wrap appetizers were tantalizingly flavorful. We shared a number of dishes including two of the softshell crab dishes - both perfectly prepared; several of the noodle dishes, aromatic and fragrant; and even squeezed in the duck Curry that was rich, perfectly spaced, and a bit decadent. After all this, we did manage to try two desserts - though I'm not sure how we squeezed them in. They offer a moderate beer and wine list but do not have cocktails. Overall, a truly spectacular meal and a nice setting - once you get through the front door. It's worth the drive. You won't be disappointed.  Next time I'm in Las Vegas, I will certainly go back.
