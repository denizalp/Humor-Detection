Wow so they had yelp delete my original post. Very disappointed in yelp. The customer service was horrible just that simple. They don't care about parents complaints nor do their customer service and policy allow for refunds at all. I still have not had a return phone call from  them when i started calling in January. I tried again in February and still nothing from them. If I could give then zero stars for their customer service I would. And that's why I don't hide my name with an alias I want them to know who I am and to know they have failed at customer service.
