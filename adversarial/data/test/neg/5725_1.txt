This was my first time at this Boardwalk Billy's location. I've always gone to the one up at UNCC.  This location is convenient to my home but it's a lot smaller than the university location. I went on a Sunday afternoon. (Not during football season) I think it would be a great place to go to watch sports though with ample amounts of TVs.  They have live music on Sundays after 3 pm, excluding football season.  I ordered the chicken finger basket entree and had the chicken fingers tossed in franks red hot sauce with cheese on the fries. It was delicious as always.  I always want to try something new off the menu but their chicken is so juicy and delicious I just can't say no. They have different beer specials everyday of the week as well.  It's located in the back of a shopping center so if you don't know it's there it can be tricky to find.  \nThey have some low country boils which I'd like to go back and try out sometime.  I'll probably be checking this place out again during football season to watch some Panthers games. Great food, decent prices and I believe they have cash back right now through yelp. Check it out if you haven't yet!
