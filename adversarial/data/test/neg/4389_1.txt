This place was terrible. Really. I'm not sure what everyone else is raving about, nothing was great and it wasn't even closely classified as good. I am a fan of Guy and extremely disappointed with the food. I get it, it's a BBQ place but would it be so bad to put veggie options as sides? Baked potato, something. I mean veggies make it to BBQ spots. The mac and cheese, KRAFT. So gross. The only thing I can say that was semi- good were the nachos. Down to the presentation, those were the only ok thing. The theme of the place is Go Big or Go Home...I should've stayed at home. There are so many better places to eat, I wouldn't waste my time or money...go somewhere else if you're looking for delicious food. And if you want just OK food, order room service, as I'm sure it's better than anything at Guy's.
