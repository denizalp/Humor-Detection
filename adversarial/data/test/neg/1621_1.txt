This place reminds me of my favorite breakfast place in the Bay Area. Have eaten here a few times and everything is tasty and well made! They have the nerve to have a cupcake\/dessert window to really take you over the top after you eat an amazing meal. Damn you, peach cobbler cupcake!!!! (Yeah, I ate it after having the PMS sandwich) You will want to try everything! If you love a tuna fish sandwich, you are gonna pass out on theirs. It is spicy goodness!!! I am SUPER picky about potato salad BUT I can devour theirs. One minus, the water is horrible. Has a nasty flavor. (Maybe they will switch to filtered or bottled) Other than that, good wine\/beer selection. You will enjoy anything on their menu!!!
