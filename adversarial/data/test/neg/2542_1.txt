The sales experience was especially easy and we got a good price on a new 2016 Hyundai Tucson.  I called, told them the price I wanted to pay, they agreed.  Literally in and out without an issue same day.  \n\nI only take one star away because the Hyundai has transmission issues related to a software update.  All fixed now.
