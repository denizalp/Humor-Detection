Another Food Truck Thursday and my husband decided to try Hey Joe! He ordered the Pancit (rice noodles) and a lumpia (egg roll). I was lucky enough to get to try both items (by try I mean steal off his plate). The food was freshly made to order and came out quickly. The noodles were delicious with their saucy ways. Also the vegetables were delicious. My husband enjoyed the chicken it came with as well. I particularly enjoyed the lumpia - one of the better egg rolls I've had. Super crispy and tasty. Overall, I enjoyed their food and would try again.
