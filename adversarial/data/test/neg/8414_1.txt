I've been to shooting ranges before in California but never shot anything crazy but the guns I shot here was intense!! \n\nI was originally going to Battlefield Las Vegas but their prices were ridiculous and the employees seemed stuck up. I actually Ubered to Battlefield LV and left to head over here. Gun garage offers a Groupon deal called the \"best bang for your buck\" and it covers two people for $300 with nine guns and ammo for each person. Pretty solid price for the type of guns you're shooting. If I had stuck with battlefield LV then it would have cost me over $450 per person compared to the deal I had gotten here!\n\nHonestly, the experience was a bit intimidating because I've only shot a rifle once and all the rest were hand guns but the staff made it very comfortable. You have a instructor by your side the whole time to help you. I forgot his name but our instructor was professional and knowledgeable. He helped me a lot through the process. I don't think I would have had the confidence to shoot anything on my own. The automatics were so powerful that it was hard to keep aim lol. \n\nI think this is def an experience to remember. You could easily gamble away $300 so might as well do something cool with it!
