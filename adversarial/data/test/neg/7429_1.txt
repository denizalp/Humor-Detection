We've been to Bamiyan many times and I remember it being way better. I went recently and ordered a chicken breast kabob meal and was disappointed by the taste. The food was not well seasoned and tasted bland (I'm not referring to heat\/spice). We were not impressed and don't intend to return anytime soon. The service and opening hours are fine.
