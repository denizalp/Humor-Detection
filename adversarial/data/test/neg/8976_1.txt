I was just there last night, first and LAST time. Worst customer service from the moment we walked in. The host was horrible. Our sever Nicol over charged us for a double Hennessy and only brought a single short glass and said they couldn't do a double, we asked why and she said she didn't know... Like, what the fuck? We also ordered grey goose and she rang us up for kettle one. She was rude, she took forever, I'd understand if it was busy but it was not busy at all.. We ended up leaving and asking for our tab right after our drinks, never coming back. Thank god for yard house though.
