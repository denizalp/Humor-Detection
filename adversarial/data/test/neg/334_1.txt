I went to West Town Monona Tire because I needed tires on very short notice and it was closeby, highly rated, and open on Sunday! I explained the time crunch and they were able to accommodate me even though I'd never set foot there before. I'm sure glad I went: This is a family business, and they run it as one. They don't just do tires, but any kind of car repair, regular maintenance, oil changes, etc. The people there actually smile at you; they don't just say they appreciate your business, but act like it too. I saw some soccer balls with their logo as I waited; I used to play when I was younger and mentioned that it was unusual for a small business to invest in items like this (they gave them away to kids). \n\nNot long after, I had a problem with one of my car's cylinders (on a Lexus IS 250 awd), and went back to West Town Monona Tire. They gave me a loaner vehicle while the repairs were being done, and they finished the job ahead of schedule. When I picked up the car there was a soccer ball and a handwritten thank you card on the passenger seat. They remembered! Awesome! \n\nToday I was back there for an oil change and new brakes, and another great service experience. Long-time owner Gary said he just sold the business to Brandon (also in the family) and Ted (who has worked there since he was 16). The place still runs like clockwork; they do great work, and do it with a smile. I even go out of my way to fill up with gas at their Citgo station--just to give them additional business. \n\nI've already referred a friend to West Town Monona Tire and she was delighted too. No surprise there!  Are you looking for a place you can trust for car repairs and great customer service? Not me. I already found it at West Town Monona Tire!
