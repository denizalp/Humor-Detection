Coffee is pretty good. The 8.95 breakfast special is really good though, deal wise and for the hashbrowns that are too damn tasty to neglect. Are those done with Bullseye BBQ sauce? Or is that endorsing  the wrong brand? Perhaps its a presidents choice version...Blue menu bbq, or is it from costco...simply sauce?\nIm getting off track, fact is, the food and bev. is good but its so packed, thats stupid when Iook at the design of this place I see an overly huge serving counter that takes up 3 times the amount of space it should and the same amount of room as the seating area.\nId go more often if I could sit.
