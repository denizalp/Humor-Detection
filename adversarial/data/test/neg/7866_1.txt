The sweet and spicy meatballs roasted in a sweet chili glaze are hands down some of the best I've had. They have JUST ENOUGH sauce on them too! Not too much and not too little. And pleaseeeeee don't sleep on the G.O.A.T. Parisian ham with 3 cheeses baked between local breads. My husband LOVED it! The cheese is melted on the inside as well as the out! Comfy atmosphere! The sour beer is a hit!
