Passed by this food cart one day and had to stop by to try it out. It was located on West Dayton Street, by Geology Museum! \n\nThe owner was nice and allowed me to make a combo of the Chicken Curry and Koftka (Beef Meatballs). Typically, you only order 1 of each that comes with rice. She was out of the Bolani\n(Patato or Leek Filled Turnovers) which I really wanted to try.\n\nBetween the two entree items, I liked the chicken a lot more than the Koftka. It was more flavorful and the flavor was stronger. The Kofta tasted good but not as powerful of a flavor. \n\nI assume Afghan food is not spicy but I sure wish it were. I'd stop by again if it were in a more convenient location.
