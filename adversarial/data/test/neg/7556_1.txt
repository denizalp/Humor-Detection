BEST DINING EXPERIENCE, in a very long time!\nMy boyfriend surprised me and took us to Cafe Monarch, for our weekly date night. I had never been and was shocked at how beautiful the outside seating is!  \n\nThe ambiance is perfectly romantic, with hanging lights, huge lanterns, candles and water fountains. The service is spectacular. All the servers are extremely knowledgeable and very attentive. And the valet was fast.\n\nThe menu does not have a huge selection, but you will not be disappointed. It's a four-course meal, with the pricing based on your largest and final course. The portions are on the smaller size, but after the entire meal, you feel full. The best thing on the menu is the cauliflower soup. If you go, you MUST try it.
