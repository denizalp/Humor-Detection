Very popular and fills up fast on weekends and after 5 PM on weekdays. Great wine selection and sangria. Definitely get a bruschetta board and the pretzel fondue. The sandwiches we have tried were just average, but re aforementioned goodies are amazing! Live music on weekends and a comfortable outdoor seating area that is ...well, like a living room. :-) the Sushi Room next door is owned by the same people and good, too, if you want to make a night of it.
