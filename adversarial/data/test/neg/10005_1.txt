Finally!\n\nThe long vacant Professional Building in downtown Phoenix has new life. Once the home of Valley National Bank, in the current form this 1932 deco gem houses a Hilton Garden Inn and the subject of this review: Nook.\n\nWhether you are visiting from near or far, Nook is one of the brightest spots downtown. Enter through the Hotel Lobby and you are reminded of a bygone era. One that is rarely seen in the Phoenix landscape. The hotel itself is great, but what Nook did in their corner is modern without losing the classic charm of the space, truly an exercise in class. \n\nWe were pressed for time, with a show at the Herberger. Our server Corey, was spot on. Once he knew our challenge, he helped us quickly (and under the happy hour wire!) choose items from the drink, bruschetta and pizza menus. He was efficient, friendly and quick to make sure Mom was taken care of first and foremost. (Dear Manager, he was GREAT).\n\nOur choices: \n*disclaimer, I referred to the menu to provide the ingredients.  :)\n\nFig jam, prosciutto, goat cheese and asparagus bruschetta. This was my personal favorite. The salty meat and sweet fig were a great pair. The addition of the asparagus and goat cheese kept the other tasty bits from overpowering and boring the pallet.\n \nShort rib bruschetta (with mushroom duxelle, malbec demi-reduction and cotija cheese...) was another table favorite. Before heading to Nook, I read a couple reviews and one mentioned how great this was, we were not disappointed.  \n\nOur pizza was a bianco with prosciutto. Mozzerella, parmesan, olive oil and arugula. The crust was light and entirely edible... Literally to the the crust, which in my case is often left on the plate. \n\nThough we were on a short time window, the close proximity to the theatre afforded us one more indulgence... \n\nAffogato. This incarnation has a chocolate pudding with chocolate crumbles, lemon gelato and is of course topped with espresso. In our case, the manager delivered it to the table, exclaiming \"affogato!\" as he drowned the sweets in espresso. Well played Signore!\n\nAll were exceptional choices. I can hardly wait to try everything else!\n\nWhile I hate to reveal this secret, I want it to become a downtown staple... So join me, in enjoying Nook.
