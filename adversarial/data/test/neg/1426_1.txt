I like to grab takeout from this cute neighbourhood place. It is important to know that the quality here is very high, but everything is also huge (and not because of rice overload). If you order about 2\/3 of what you would normally order at a sushi place for a meal, then that will be just right.\n\nToday was much busier than usual with it being a PA day, so it wasn't as immaculate as usual. I also noticed some pre-sliced sashimi here for the first time. Nevertheless I still had friendly service and a nice hot tea to enjoy while waiting for my takeout.\n\nI was very hungry so I ordered:\nNew spicy scallop Maki\nSalmon Sashimi (3 piece - but it seems they threw in an extra piece no charge :)\nAgedashi Tofu\n\nAs expected, quality remains very high and everything was really delicious. I am stuffed.
