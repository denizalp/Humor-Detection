What a brilliant concept. So quick and fast, and the sandwiches are not too shabby. I got the panini with ham and cheese inside, along with a side of BBQ ranch salad. It was good. \n\nThe other item ordered was the pulled pork sandwich. I was not digging the pulled pork flavors to much, and the mango salad was very refreshing and tasty! I'd come back here when I'm in a mood for a quick salad-to-go. \n\nI'm not a huge fan of either of the breads they used for the panini or the pulled pork. Nonetheless, is is worth a try.
