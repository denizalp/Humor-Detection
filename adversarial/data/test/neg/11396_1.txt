Amazing Meal.  I have to start the review off that way.  The food is an excellent value meals are about 10 dollars each. You will not be hungry after eating here.  The pork was cooked spot on.  What I noticed when I left was how close the restaurant is to West Gate.  I am a season ticket holder for the Coyotes.  My wife and I always eat at west gate because it's easy and close.  Now before the games when we eat out we will come here.  Better value, food and service. Also being from NY area I know real deal Puerto Rican food. THIS IS THE REAL DEAL.........
