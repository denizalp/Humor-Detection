I reviewed Harumi Sushi on 10\/30\/13 and said, \"...but when the word gets out how good they really are...this place will have a line out the door.\"  It's still great food, and while I haven't quite seen a line out the door, it's rare to see an empty table at dinner time.  If you haven't tried this place, you haven't had real sushi.
