These aren't your average waffles. They literally taste like \"sugar\" waffles, but I'm not complaining. They were delicious and had a thicker, almost spongier texture to them than a normal waffle. Toppings were plentiful. \n\n4 stars is due to the slow service, there's hardly any space in there and it was about 85 degrees in the store.
