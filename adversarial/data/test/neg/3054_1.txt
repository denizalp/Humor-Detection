Okay the first night my wife and I checked in we enjoyed our meal greatly. The burger was great the desert was delicious. But the day we left we were so excited to eat it again that when we got our food to go we were completely shocked at how my burger was over cooked then my wife's burger was way under cooked then the fries were way over seasoned.  I don't know what happened, I think it's just simply a hit or miss thing. If they work on consistency then it would be perfect. Other than that  the customer service was good. Just so if anyone is wondering and if these comments are actually viewed the day of the not so great service was on August 4, 2015 around 1125 am.
