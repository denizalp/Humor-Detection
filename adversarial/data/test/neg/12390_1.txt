My husband and I went here for a lovely Saturday brunch while visiting Toronto recently. We are not vegan, but were meeting a friend who is (and was also quite enthusiastic about the pancakes here). After spending some time paralyzed by all the juice choices, I started with a tart and refreshing grapefruit glow and then moved on to the pancakes. I had banana, my husband had blueberry, and our friend got them plain. These were wonderful, some of the best pancakes I've ever had. Pancakes can often get heavy, but these were anything but. I also got to try the delicious cornbread and some scrambled tofu and tempeh bacon. Service was fantastic. I don't have anything negative to say about this place except that it's nowhere near Utah!
