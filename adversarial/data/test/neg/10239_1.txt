I have only ever ordered spring rolls and pho here. This is one of two of my absolute favorite pho restaurants. The service is great, the place is clean, the soup arrives piping hot accompanied by the usual mung beans, basil, and lime. They also include the sweet dark sauce, plum sauce I think and Sriracha sauce. The broth tastes homemade and has the perfect blend of spice flavor, they are quite generous with both the noodle and meat portions. I dine in almost every week and can tell there are a number of regular customers which is a good sign. \n\nThey have different Asian cuisines to choose from so it looks like there would be something for everyone who dined there. \n\nA bowl of pho and an iced tea is about $12.
