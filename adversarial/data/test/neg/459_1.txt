I've been here quite a few times and always have a good meal. Last time I went I had the Charleston Chicken sandwich and it was delicious. I've had the nutty fried chicken a few times too and that is really good. My husband loves the shrimps and grits. Of course, the biscuits are delicious, too, nice and fluffy and I love the blueberry jam they serve with it. I don't think you can go wrong here, just go hungry!
