Since the guys rave about this place for Monday Night Football, it was time for me to go too.  We met two other people fir dinner on a Friday night. The service and getting our food was VERY slow. And the food was just ok.  I had a burger with fries.\nThe place was ok, but certainly not the place to go grab something quick to eat.
