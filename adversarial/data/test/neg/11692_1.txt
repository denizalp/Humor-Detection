The sandwich was great! My wife and her cousin had eaten at Panini before many times, and she had always come back to Lubbock and tell me about all his delicious meals. So when I came to Phoenix, I wanted to eat there and the food was fantastic and tasty! Everyone was so friendly and the owner was super! We had a super meal!  I could eat several meals every week if I lived here! You know next time we come to visit, Panini will be my favorite place to go.
