AVOID!! Extremely rude employees and average food. We have been to quite a few Indian Restaurants in Phoenix, Tempe and surrounding towns and this is by far the worst. We arrived long before they were closing for lunch and was hurried to order our food and then hurried to leave. When our food arrived they brought us a madras curry instead of chicken curry and tried to force us to have it anyway and said the kitchen was closed. We explained that wasn't what we ordered and had to ask many times for them to redo it. They also forgot to bring out our rice, when we asked for it they came back with a cold rice, I'm assuming was from a buffet. This is the worst service I have ever received, they do not know how to treat their customers.
