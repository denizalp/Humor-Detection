I went to the Women's Imaging for a routine Mammogram.  It was that time, my doctor said and I dread these exams.  Who really likes their body parts being smashed?  Not me.\n\nI arrived at for my 11:15 am appointment about 40 minutes early.  The first lady that greeted me was very nice and within a couple minutes, Brenda called me to go over insurance and other information she needed.  Brenda was very nice, personable, asking how to say my middle name which was a Chinese name.  I was hesitant to share because most people that don't speak Chinese always butcher it.\n\nBrenda did butcher my name, but she didn't know and she was so nice, so I didn't care.  Within 10 minutes or so, I got called to go with Beth who would be my technician for the mammogram.  Unfortunately I was on the phone and didn't hear all her instructions to me.  I know, how rude of me, but I really needed to answer the call.\n\nAnyway, Beth was very sensitive to me as this is somewhat of a sensitive exam.  She didn't make this mammogram as painful as prior mammograms I had, so that was a huge plus.\n\nAnd, I was finished and dressed, out the door by 11:14 am, right before my scheduled appointment.  I really LOVE when I don't have a long wait time.\n\nI was treated well by every single person I came in contact with, a couple other people I don't know their names.  They respected my time and glad everything went smoothly.  My thoughts on Mammograms now are they aren't that bad.\n\nThanks for making this a good experience for me and respecting my time.
