This is the best airport restaurant I've ever been to. The food, service and ambience allow you to forget where you are, which when in an airport during the holidays, is nothing short of a miracle. \n\nI had fruit with greek yogurt and granola. It is served deconstructed and everything was fresh and in season. It was actually a healthy breakfast! With flavor! In an airport! I also ordered a side of bacon which was clearly made to order; it was hot, crisp yet tender and melted in my mouth. The coffee is excellent too, they brew it by the cup so your refills are always fresh. \n\nMy server was friendly and knowledgeable. The next time I am at CLT I will definitely stop here.
