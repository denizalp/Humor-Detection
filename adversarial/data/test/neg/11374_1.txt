Pretty good food.  Mediocre ambience and service.  High price (both for food & drinks).\n\nWe had Chicken & Waffles, Chicken & Biscuits, and Deviled Eggs.\n\nThe Chicken & Waffles are good.  Not the best I've had and definitely the most expensive, but they're decent.  I didn't care for the watermelon, and I didn't get the butter in their picture on top of my waffles.\n\nComes with a syrup and a hot sauce.  The syrup was pretty good, but I didn't like the other sauce (and I favor spicy food).\n\nThe room was too dark for my liking, and I was out of water for quite a while.\n\nAt least it was a lot of food.  Usually exorbitant prices come with tiny portions.
