My friend and I decided to come to the Bellagio buffet since it is supposedly one of the best buffets in Vegas. Since we arrived at 7pm, and it was Easter weekend, we ended up waiting for a little over an HOUR. Yes, sounds very long especially after you did not eat all day. However, it was worth it! I'm not sure if I liked the price though... It was supposed to be around $35-38 for dinner, but it was $44-45 plus tax so it was almost $49 plus tip after dinner. However, the service was great. Our waiter was really sweet, friendly and helpful. The food was good, and they had a range of American, Chinese, Japanese, and Italian. Plus their dessert selection was huge. This is one of the biggest buffets I have been to so it was exciting to have many options! =) I would go again with my family.
