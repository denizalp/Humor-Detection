nice little lounge in Toronto.. went in a big group from our conference, as well as met some Torontonians there who recommended it\n\nwasn't too hard to get in, but we did end up getting bottle service which was for a reasonable price\n\nmusic was pretty good too on a Fri nite.. played a lot of classic 90s music\n\nbasically anywhere is fun where you have a big group and a lot of drinks.. lol.. this is prolly one of those places.. not sure what i would think of it completely sober..\n\nalso i remember it wasn't a very big place.. luckily we had our lil seating area for the 10-15 of us.. the dance floor\/bar area was shoulder to shoulder packed
