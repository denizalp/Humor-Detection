I ordered the Great Wall of Pepperoni and a side of mozzarella sticks and had them delivered to the MGM.\n\nPros:\n- The pizza was absolutely killer. I would definitely get it again. I love the blend of cheeses, it was cooked well, and the crust is soft and delicious.\n- Customer service. I ordered via Yelp and got a call right away about the delivery situation (see 'cons' below)\n- The delivery driver was fast, courteous, friendly.\n\nCons:\n- Delivery to the MGM: you cannot get delivery to your room. This is not specific to Pizza My Dear and probably true for most casino hotels.\n- Mozzarella sticks were awful. Just order more pizza instead.
