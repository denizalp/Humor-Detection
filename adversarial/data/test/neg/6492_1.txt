Don't get me started on this poorly ran car wash. It took over an hour and fifteen minutes when quoted 25m. When I went to ask about this I had to wait for the manager 15m to approach me, and I never did see him before our car was done. While we stupidly waited, others drove off due to lengthy process. Then they had to ask if we wanted a car freshmen which we had already specified!
