This is a great place to take the kiddos for a couple of hours.  It's small enough to be relaxing for the parents.  Those who complain about it have never lived in a place where there is nothing for kids.  I don't like big kids museums with tons of people.  My almost 4 year old kept busy for 2 hours and could easily do that once per week.  Buy a membership and enjoy a break from the heat!  Cute coffee place to get yourself caffeinated before going in.
