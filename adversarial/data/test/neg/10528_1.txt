This place was a pleasant surprise! Room was super clean, the gym had two ehlipticals and two treadmills along with nice tabs. Had the place to myself. The front desk and staff were very professional and kind. The pool was heated and clean. It was a very relaxing stay!  I highly recommend this hotel!
