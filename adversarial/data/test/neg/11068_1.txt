What to say about eggslut.... this is a tough one. I'm from Los Angeles and I'll tell you the location over there is much better and it's essentially for one reason and one reason only, PRICE POINT. At the same time it makes sense because we are in Vegas and the location itself is in the cosmopolitan! \n\nThe sandwich itself was extremely good. I had the sausage egg sandwiches with added avocado. The total came out to 15 dollars for the sandwich and a cup of orange juice. Nothing amazing about the juice itself but the sand which definitely hit the spot after a long night of partying. Just the right amount of applewood smoked bacon and avocado, and the ketchup was extremely good as well. \n\nAll in all I would recommend it if you have plenty of time. The line always stretches around the place itself and will take you about 30 minutes to order and get your food. Is it worth the wait? I personally don't think so. 4stars for the sandwich being good.
