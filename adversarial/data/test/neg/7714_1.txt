Atmosphere is right.  Busy, at times loud.  Excellent single malt inventory and the staff knows what they are.  I asked if they had a Balvenie Caribbean Cask, the Lass replied, instantly, \"Of course the 14 year old!\" \n\nFood was top notch. The Mrs loved the Steak and Ale Pie, I had the Haggis stack with neeps and tatties. (fresh caught that day).  Best haggis I have tasted this side of the pond... not quite up to Stornoway or MacSweens.  I would like a little more spice and a little more of that dark  organy flavor.  But as it is, it will more likely suit North American tastes.\n\nWe shared the Ardbeg house smoked salmon.... awesome and very unique with texture halfway between cold smoked and hot roasted.  The peaty-ness of the Ardbeg came through very subtle and pleasantly.  Try it it is a don't miss.
