If money and time are no object than come to the arena. You can get a 12 oz beer for $7 and a 20 oz beer for $14. We came for a concert that was supposed to start at 8pm and it's 10:21 pm and it still hasn't started. There has  been no announcements as to why. No DJ and nothing but waiting. A pretzel will cost you $8 and that's the low end of the price point. So if you have time and money to waste than it's a great spot!
