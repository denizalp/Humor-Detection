The donut shop is like a hidden gem .. my mom and were  looking for a donut shop around the house and this  place popped up ... these donuts are made fresh everyday and the owners were so nice . We had really great service ! Not to mention the donuts were delicious! They are so soft ! This is our new donut spot ! I recommend this place
