This place was fantastic. Some of the freshest fish I've ever had, which was disappointing, given that I live near San Francisco.\n\nThe Sweet Plantains were to die for. The Purple Mashed Potatoes were gorgeously displayed and tasty to boot.\n\nMy husband has Celiac disease, and didn't get sick here, and we went twice, because it was so good. We were even able to have dessert there, which is really rare, because most desserts are gluten free. \n\nThe one downside is that the prices are quite steep. However, with the frequency that hubby is able to have sushi, since most sushi rice has wheat in it to make it stick better, it was worth the 100$ check for two people.\n\nOur waiter was fantastic, and while busy gave outstanding service. He catered to both my and my husbands allergies with an outstanding attitude. Can't wait to come back to Vegas, just to go to this restaurant again.
