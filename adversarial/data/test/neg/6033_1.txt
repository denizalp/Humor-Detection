I went to this location very late one evening (past midnight) with a friend to grab a bite to eat after work (24 hour location). When we walked in, there was no host to greet us and we eventually had to walk into the restaurant to find someone. They finally sat us and our waitress came by to take our order. From then on, it was excellent service. Food came out fast and hot and was better than I had expected. We ended up staying and talking for several hours and the waitress frequently stopped by to check on us and refill coffee. The restaurant including the bathroom seemed fairly clean and it was an overall excellent experience. The improvements that could be made are: better attention to the host stand, better employee appearance, and an updated interior look. The interior look felt dated and not as welcoming. Thankfully the food and our servers service made up for it. \n\nService: 4.5\/5\nFood: 4\/5\nAtmosphere: 3\/5 \nOverall: 4\/5
