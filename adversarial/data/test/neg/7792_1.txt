Much like my recent review of the Scottsdale location, there really isn't anything I DON'T like about Go AZ Peoria. I've been here on numerous occasions now, had my Speed Triple serviced here (brake pad replacement in that case) and every time it has been a nice experience.\n\nI attended the Tacos and Test Rides event yesterday (9\/23), tested a beautiful and sexy Triumph Thruxton R, had some tacos and got the Speedy washed. As always the atmosphere was relaxed. You're always warmly greeted, whether by one of the ladies at the greeting station at the entrance or a salesperson.  There is none of the hungry sales pressure you often get from car dealerships or some bike shops.  I spoke mostly with Danny, a relatively new guy at Go AZ and he was awesome. Like all the staff he is friendly and engaging. Set me up with the test ride and just spent a lot of time chatting about bikes and general topics.  This is typical of what you get here.  You could walk in, have a look at the beautiful bikes, grab a bite or just hang out.  \n\nThe shop itself is well laid-out. Good assortment of bikes and gear amidst a snack bar area as well as an upper level lounge to spend some time if you like. Clean, upscale without being pretentious in any way. \n\nI didn't trade the Speed for the Thruxton, but did think pretty hard about it. The Speed Triple is just so great. Go AZ is definitely the only place I'll take my bike for service and my next purchase, when it happens, will be from them as well.  If you're a fan of motorcycles, do yourself a favor and take a trip to Go AZ Motorcycles Peoria. You won't regret it.
