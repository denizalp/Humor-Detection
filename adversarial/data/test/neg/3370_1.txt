We heard about the 3 course for $20.12 and decided to give it a go, and I'm glad we did! It seems like Cosmo's restaurants are really amping up the deals (we love CommeCa for lunch too). The ambience of the place is airy and sophisticated, which I really like. It's a huge restaurant with a lot of seating-- in fact, it felt sparse even though there were a good number of people at the restaurant.\n\nWe had the scallop skewer and the grilled octopus (+$10) for our appetizers. I liked both but wish my raw red onions were grilled too. I liked the lavraki a lot, and didn't even mind the tiny fish bones on the side (that the server kindly noted), and the lamp chops (+$10) only had a slight gamy taste. My dessert was a yogurt martini that was super rich, but I've never been a fan of desserts.\n\nSurprisingly, we loved the bread. It's nicely charred and comes with the most amazing citrusy olive oil. We requested seconds and thirds. We'll definitely come back and try other items on the menu.
