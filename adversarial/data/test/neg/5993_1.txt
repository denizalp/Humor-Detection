Melt has finally opened up on the West\/South-side.  My girl and I entered for a late morning treat and beat the crowd, which arrived by the time we left around noon.\nThe Menu is a bit over whelming with all its choices.  Not knowing what to pick, I went with a blackened chicken.  My girl chose Monte Cristo.  We both had a cup of buffalo chicken soup and it was delicious.\nI was a little disappointed with the chicken; it was dry and bland, although flavored on the outside of the meat. The Monte was quite the treat...in a French toast fried shell, and a fruity sauce...perfection.\nBoth dishes served with heaping piles of French fries (fresh cut) and Cole slaw.  The pommes frites were delish but the slaw lacked something.  I hope this is fixed.\nI really was anticipating a higher rating, but based on the dry meat, and flavorless slaw I rated according.  Love the atmosphere.  Will probably be back.  Price for serving size seems spot on.
