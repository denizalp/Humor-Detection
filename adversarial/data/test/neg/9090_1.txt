Love this restaurant. As a southerner living in Las Vegas, it is nice having a place to get warm biscuits, endless sweet tea and fried green tomatoes. I brought two friends for Thanksgiving lunch and we enjoyed every bit of it. We arrived about 15 minutes early for our reservation and the hostess was really accommodating, telling us to let her know when we were ready to take the table. We started out our afternoon at the bar where Amanda, who was really sweet and made us some great drinks, and gave us good food recommendations.  Lizzette (Lizetta?) was our waitress and she was amazing. Really friendly, very knowledgeable and got us everything we needed to enjoy our meal in addition to providing fresh cutlery and plates for our main courses. We shared the biscuits, fried okra, fried chicken, fried green tomatoes, collard greens deviled eggs, shrimp and grits and a turkey dinner, which came with cauliflower mash and mac and cheese. Everything was delicious, although it would have been nice for the turkey dinner to have come with a little bit more (more meat (the slices were tiny), more gravy, green beans, more cranberry sauce, maybe a couple more biscuits, it was a $32 plate and seemed a bit bare for the price). All in all, we enjoyed our meal and Lizette(ta?) packed up all of our leftovers for us, even splitting some items for us to take separately from each other. I also took a piece of the bourbon pecan pie as a late night snack for later and it did not disappoint. The atmosphere of the restaurant is also very nice. It is quietly busy, if that makes sense, and the tables are nicely spread out so you don't feel as if you are BFF with the table beside you. I love the entire layout of this restaurant. I will be leaving the country for the majority of 2018 and I know the first place I will want to eat when I return will be Yardbird! 'Til next time!
