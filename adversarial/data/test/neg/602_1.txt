Came here for brunch. Cute little restaurant in a nice area of Phoenix. Had an omelette Ava country potatoes. Really yummy.. They allow for substitutions.  Not too many options on the menu. However the options they have satisfy many taste buds. I think there's another location make sure you choose the right one.
