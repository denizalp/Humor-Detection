Food is great but the drink servers can't seem to make the time to come around and get our drinks refilled (let alone initially filled). They are mostly busy with bussing tables. Management should have dedicated bussers here. It's not the servers fault, they just are over worked. \n\nThis simple mismanagement overshadows anything else in my opinion. With buffets and restaurants all over the place in Vegas, you have to do the basics well.
