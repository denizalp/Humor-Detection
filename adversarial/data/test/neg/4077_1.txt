Had been going here for years, then stopped, it has gone downhill with the rooms being old and worn. Found a maid's clippie with a lot of long black hair near the bed and another time a huge spider web over the table that which we just ate under. How does a spider get so high up in a high rise?\nI was nice in it's hay day, but now, I just dont know.\nThe type of people that stay there are completely different now also.\nThe only good thing is that I never had to pay for the suites, they were comp and they also gave me free show tickets and free meals.\nI do recommend going to the pool with the statues at the jacuzzi's near Bouchouns. It is a must see and do, you will feel like a movie star and that is where they go.
