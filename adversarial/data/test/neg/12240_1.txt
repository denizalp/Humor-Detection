Wow!  I was on a mission for the perfect boot and the the pair I saw online seemed to be what I was looking for. They were sold out but the girl that was helping me tried to find something similar. My problem is that I have tree stumps for legs so everything was too tall for me. We ended up ordering the pair I saw online and she did everything for me. She was nice and didn't seem put out. Very helpful!!
