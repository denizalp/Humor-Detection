Overall: Delicious feel good comfort food  served with Southern Hospitality. Yum! Dined here on a fairly busy Sunday night over the Labor Day weekend. \n\nFood: 5 stars: \n-Short ribs - delicious sauce cooking and mashed potatoes.  Loved it.\n-Grits- a little bland but still enjoyed sharing them as a side.\n-Red Velvet cheesecake - Delicious but incredibly rich and a HUGE portion - more detailed  below.\n\nService: 5 stars\nOur waiter was super friendly and accommodating help with dietary restrictions in our party.\n\nPortions: 1-2 stars.\nThis goes for all Las Vegas restaurants. Cut down your portion sizes! The amount of food that must go  to  waste is unacceptable. We ordered one dessert for three of us and still couldn't finish it. At first I asked about the Butterscotch cake and our server recommended it also informing it was a large serving. I was afraid they would give us a whole cake and changed my mind. Please cut down on the sizes. Also a dessert sampler would be wonderful. There were so many I wanted to try but didn't have the stomach for.
