Had an absolutely amazing homemade flaky croissant filled with eggs, veggys, bacon and had a light tomato basil spread.  There was also a small mixed green salad with a balsamic vinaigrette on the plate.  I also had a quiche Lorraine which is easily the best quiche I have ever had.  It was so light it almost floated into my taste buds.  Try this place.  I will definitely be back.
