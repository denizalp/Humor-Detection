First experience at zero latency was great would have given them 10 stars. But I'm heated right now because some dickhead was talking to his friend from Barry's boxing while checking out girls trying to get into hakkasan. Legit ignored us in front of him for 5 min... So fuck him. He's an idiot and he just lost zero latency some customers.
