I should have listened to the other reviews and stayed away. Horrible customer service. I purchased a Groupon for $20 that expired because when I went in to spend it they had none of the things I was looking for (but that's okay because resale stores are hit-and-miss). However, when I went in later to spend my $10 (face-value of the groupon) they refused to honor it. After a full hour of standing at the counter waiting for a response from the manager (who was in the back), she begrudgingly accepted it. I will never be returning.\n\nEDIT: Management reached out to me with an apology, and I think that is worth an additional star, so I changed my review from one to two stars.
