The only reason I am giving this place 3 stars is because our waiter, Derek was fantastic. Excellent customer service and attention. \n\nOther than that the food was basic, boring and dry. The jalape√±o bread was pretty good and so were thee nachos. But, I ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich and my boyfriend ordered the steak sandwich. Both were dry, without flavor and disappointing. Most likely I will never come back. \n\nThanks to Derek for being such a great waiter!
