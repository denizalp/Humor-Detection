Just tried their Jerked Chicken lunch combo and it was delicious!  The chicken was fresh, well cooked and nicely seasoned with enough heat to make your thirsty, but not so much you couldn't gobble all of the chicken.  The rice and veggies were tasty as well and it was a substantial lunch for a good price.  I'll be coming back to try their dinner and signature dishes (Ackee and Saltfish strudel and Curry Goat)!
