I was looking for a decent place to have my husband's 70th Surprise Party. I looked into various places. Some were old, outside and inside. One place was huge. But, I wanted a smaller venue. \nWhile riding through the West End, I noticed Encore Design Studio. I got the number, called and made an appointment. I went there, met Stacey twice. The first time to see the place, the second time to decide on the decorating. \nShe had so many colors to choose from for the tabled and chairs. She took all of our ideas and put them in effect! \nThe night of the party, March 2017,\n our guess came in with their mouths open, as if they were in a wonderland!  The whole room was filled with such a beautiful aviance!  \nMy guests took her cards to keep and share. \nPlease know, it is a clean place, in a quiet neighborbood, parking is convenient!!! \nCheck out Stacey at Encore Design, you will be glad that you did!
