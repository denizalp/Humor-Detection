Way better than I ever expected! I went in last minute for color and they only had a phase one student Marylin she was fabulous! I'm extremly picky and hard to please but she did great. My color looks very good, she gives a great scalp massage when washing and you can't beat the price especially when using all Paul Mitchell products. Be prepared to be there a little longer they are students but it's worth it, Marylin just needs to be more confident she is going to be an amazing stylist when she's finished school.
