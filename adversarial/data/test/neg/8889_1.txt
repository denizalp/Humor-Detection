Finding a bakery open on a Monday in Montreal isn't easy. My girlfriend and I were leaving the next day and wanted to buy some pastries for us to take back on our trip. \n\nWe wandered in here after seeing a bunch of great reviews about the babka. We ended up ordering some chocolate babka, a cheese crown, and a chocolatine for less than $8. That was the good part.\n\nThe babka was decent, but a bit too sweet and didn't really taste like chocolate. The cheese crown was pretty good, my favorite of everything we got.  The chocolatine was not dry, stale, and not good at all. There also isn't anywhere at all to sit inside. \n\nThis place was a letdown, but the staff was friendly and the prices were cheap.
