My wife brought me here for a wonderful bday dinner last night.\nThis is a great new place in the Junction serving rustic italian that lets the flavours of the ingredients speak for themselves. Nothing is over sauced, spiced, salted, or peppered. Once you get your palate set, it is quite enjoyable.\nThe space is definitely well done. A tad sparse, but enjoyable.\nService was the best in The Junction. Not speedy, but done right. This is a place you should just relax and enjoy. \nWe started with cocktails and the charcuterie tray, followed by sharing two appetizers, and then sharing a pasta followed by a main. I would eat the same way again as it allows you to have multiple flavours. \nPrice was about right for quality food, wine, and service.
