Drinks are pretty light at this dive bar. They have a spout on the end of the bottle. Its actually less than a shot. People are all really nice. Bit of a mid 20's to mid 30's crowd on the weekends. Service has always pretty good. If you smoke, the patio is tiny. Just leave your drink, and go out front.
