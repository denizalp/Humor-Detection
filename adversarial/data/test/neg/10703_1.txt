The best local Italian deli in Scottsdale. No contest. The food is excellent and I love the atmosphere.  Very authentic neighborhood deli\/grocery.  Gourmet pizza to boot. Prices are reasonable and the quality is outstanding.  Great selection of wines and some imported beers. Patio sitting is a good choice on a beautiful Scottsdale day or evening,  inside seating is among the grocery shelves. Typical of a NY deli.you can't miss with the cheese steak sandwich,  any pasta or pizza. You won't be sorry.
