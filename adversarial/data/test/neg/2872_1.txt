Slow service once we arrived and got to our table,  thought it was going to be a experience.  \nOur server, Kenny, was ok, but wasn't able to meet our specific dietary needs.  I was frustrated! \nBrian,  the manager,  came to the rescue,  and made our experience right!  He really took care of us and turned our experience around.
