Fast, friendly and fairly priced. I will never go to UPS, FedEx or USPS when I can support a local and honest mom and pop shop. Lots of little trinkets to peruse and some local dips\/soups\/mixes to purchase. Even a kids Lego area while you wait. I came 10 minutes to close and the woman working was friendly and welcoming, even though I ended up being there past 6. I will be back!
