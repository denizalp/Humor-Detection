My experience with this scam of a company was just like everyone elses. My claim was not responded to in the timeframe noted on the website, and it was basically ignored until I placed a charge back with my CC company. Then magically I received a call right away. He tried to get me to send my phone to him for repair, but I had already done research and knew he was just trying to get a real phone. Long story short, back and forth through email, and phone messages which turned threatening and basically as unprofessional as you can get. This is 100% an illegitimate insurance company and this guy is a career criminal.
