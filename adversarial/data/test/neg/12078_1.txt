LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Great portions, reasonable pricing and great staff! It always a stop I make when I go to Vegas. I normally get pad Thai, but usually my group gets a variety of entrees and curry. Everything we order always come out tasting amazing. Super flavorful and authentic. Your food arrives in a timely manner. Show up hungry and leave happy! If you love authentic Thai food, this is the spot to dine at!
