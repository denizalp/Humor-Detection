I ordered from this company through amazon and I had the worst experience with them I've ever had with an online purchase. The item was sent to my old address and when I realized this I asked them what I could do and I was told to wait till the item was shipped back and then I would receive a refund. I waited about two weeks and called them on the 15th of November inquiring about my refund. I was told that they had not received the item and that I would have to wait until the item was shipped to them to be refunded. I accepted this and waited till January thinking the item still had not been shipped back. I eventually contacted FedEx and found out that the item had been returned to them on the 11th of November. They had the item for four days before I called them and they told me that they hadn't received the item back. I contacted amazon at this point because I was tired of being lied to. Amazon filed an A to Z claim on my behalf and the next day I got an email from the company claiming I would get my refund within 2-5 business days and asking me to withdraw my claim. I didn't withdraw it and I waited the full five business days for my refund. Needless to say the refund never came and I am now waiting for Amazon to approve my claim. Overall a terrible experience! I just wanted my bed and I was going to use the refund to repurchase, but I would never order from this company now! I advise you to never be in a situation with them where you are reliant on them to be honest because this company will scam you if given the opportunity!
