$60 for takeout and I've had better food from the #1 ChinaHouse. Portion sizes were stingy and a joke for the price - It's like there was a nationwide shortage of shrimp. $4 for mushroom flambe that consisted of 8 sliced up pieces(total rip off). Tastes were bland and non-existent - onion soup tasted like Swanson beef broth straight out of the can. Things were left out of the order no soy sauce for the California roll, no chopsticks, and total lack of service. I would expect more from a so-called 5 star Japanese Steakhouse. I work hard for my money and will never waste it again on this hype. Save your time and money and just go to Ichiban.
