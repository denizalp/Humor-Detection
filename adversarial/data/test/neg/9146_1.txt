Appears to have changed management recently and had some minor renovations to brighten up the shop.  The donut variety is not very large as they sell out by early afternoon.  They do have a large sandwich prep area for all the breakfast and lunch needs beside the regular coffee and donut.  The service is always friendly and the many regulars inside chatting away with the many tables.  There is free WiFi which is plenty fast.
