This is one of our favorite parks to play at. They play stricter has different levels with all kinds of slides. There is a sand pit, small climbing wall, walking paths and grass to play in. The splash pad is nice, it used to have more working sprayers than it does now. It can get pretty busy. The trail up the mountain is a decent hike. I've seen the BSA meet\/use the park for meets and hikes.
