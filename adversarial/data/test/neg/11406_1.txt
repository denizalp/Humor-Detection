The least helpful employees I've ever encountered. Apparently something had happened with a guy who was leaving as I was entering, however, when I approached the door the three employees standing blocking the doorway didn't open the door or greet me, they simply stared at me until I was directly in front of them and then wandered off without a word. Not one of the 6 employees standing around inside bothered to help me find what I was looking for, either. I never did find what I was looking for, or anything comparable. Left empty handed, and will not be returning.
