Common IKEA associations: Busy, Crowded, Overwhelming, Meatballs, Lingonberries, Complicated Construction... and Affordable.\n\nMe personally? I don't get overwhelmed that easy, and I really like going to IKEA. However, after our recent honeymoon to Copenhagen, we knew that the best way to hygge-fy our house was IKEA. Hygge is most commonly associated with white walls, however, our bedroom has dark walls.. and neither The Lady or I are good at interior design. Thankfully, IKEA knows this - and that's why they have awesome pre-set up showrooms that cater to every style imagineable. The Lady and I found our inspiration for dark walls and began our hunt. Everything is easy to find using their Aisle and Bin system. We now mostly go in, go up the escalators, and right back down the stairs to begin our real shopping in the retail area. If you've never been, all you have to do is go upstairs and follow the arrows projected on the floor. It's as simple as that. Yes, there will be people standing in your way, toddlers playing on couches, college newbies with their parents... but you can easily navigate around everybody and see everything. \n\nAs far as services, I really like their restaurant! Cheap food that'll fill you up and is mildly healthy. Returns are easy as well - just take a number and they'll see you and get everything checked out. And, not that we've used it, but they whole bay they have for helping people load their cars just seems efficient. \n\nAltogether, we're pretty fortunate to have this resource here in Charlotte... and if you need a kickass dark carpet, find it at Aisle 1, Bin 81. You won't regret it.
