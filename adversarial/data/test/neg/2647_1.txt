Just tried to schedule appointments for deep tissue massage for 4 people within 2 hours of each other. Despite the fact that their website showed availability for this type of massage for that many people within 2 hours, the airhead who answered the phone claimed that there was only 1 appointment available. Then all I got was a \"sorry\" and she hung up. \nNo Thanks!!
