So so good! Super friendly waitress and hostess to start our evening. The menu has a multitude of items we wanted to try and we kicked it off with the Butchers Platter which was a tasty assortments of charcuterie.  My personal favorites were the goat cheese stuffed peppers and the toasted ciabatta, garlic oil & balsamic. Then everything ordered by the group was fantastic!  Slow roasted Prime Rib, Prime Rib French Dip, Heirloom Beet Salad & Double Cut Pork Chops!  Prime Rib was soft and flavorful, French Dip was juicy and satisfying, Heirloom Beet Salad(not the nasty red thing you think of) was surprising light and flavorful and the Pork Chop had a juicy smoked like flavor. All delicious!  Then we had the salted caramel pudding and the warm peanut butter cup for dessert.  Salted caramel pudding was good, but the warm peanut butter cup was surprisingly light and delicious.  Normally you think heavy and thick for peanut butter, but this was not that.  Definitely try it!  Overall great experience and sets a high bar for Phoenix!
