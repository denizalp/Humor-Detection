We had a package from Book It.com that gave us 20% off spa services. The first day I went I was in a bit of a rush and had my eyebrows done and she did a fabulous job. Since I was getting a discount anyways I just added more to the tip for her. Then the following day my fiance' and I had a side by side couples massage. It was good and we really needed it. The spa is really small, but private. They provide lockers, showers and a separate steam room for men and women.
