THIS IS A VERY DESCRIPTIVE STORY OF MY ONE AND ONLY EXPERIENCE AT THIS NAIL SALON. TO SUM IT UP, I HAD A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE HERE AND WOULD ADVISE NO ONE TO GO HERE. \n(See pictures- I had gel nails that looked like that after 5 days and I wore them for 2 weeks). \nI don't even write reviews but I felt the need to make my first one about this salon because I'd rather people not have to experience what I did. \nIf you DO choose to go here, DONT sit in Tina Pham's chair.\n\nTwo weeks ago I decided to go to this nail shop since it was convenient for me (because I had a very eventful day and I needed to cram in a nail repair before continuing with it). I went in and one lady addressed me and I told her I needed a nail repair and a gel nail change (I initially had chrome but they didn't have it there so I had to get a gel polish change). The woman told me it would be $18 and I sat down to look at the color book to choose a color. There was literally only one person in there while I was choosing a color. I did take a while to choose one but she kept bothering me the whole time asking me if I was going to get my nails done or not. So I asked if they were closing (it was about 3:30 pm she said no so I asked why is she rushing me and her and one of her co workers spoke in their language and began to laugh. I ignored it, chose a color, and they sat me down in a lady named Tina's chair. I sat in her chair and it was literally the longest nail repair and color change that I've ever gotten. When laying down the foundation for my nails she did it very unevenly and was very harsh on my hands. When she put the polish on my nails it looked ok then I accidentally messed up the polish when I put it under the gel dryer that they have and she got upset and grabbed my hand and started wiping at my nail with a paper towel. She didn't use polish remover to wipe of the excess polish but polished over it. After she finished she told me that it would be $33 and I told her that that's not what I was told initially and that I was only paying $18 (which I shouldn't have done anyway) and apologized and asked me not to tell the woman who I spoke to when I first came in the shop. At that point I had to go and was so disappointed with the service that I paid for so I just left and went on about my day. After about 4 days I realized my gel polish began to wear off and it looks horrible (SEE THE PICTURES). Gel polish is not supposed to do that and I will never be returning to this nail shop I'd advise no one to ever go there they are very rude and some of their workers are inexperienced.
