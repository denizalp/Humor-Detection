This place is absolutely amazing. \nI stumbled upon this place about 2 weeks ago. The shop is simple and quaint, which does not reflect upon the organic magnitude of its taste. \n\nThe menu is laid out on the wall behind the register, offering panini, sandwiches, sweet crepes, savory crepes, and salads. When I first entered, I was a little indecisive. The two gentlemen behind the counter were incredibly nice & extremely helpful in describing some of their products, and what would best suit my taste. Being a panini and Nutella aficionado, the offered options were well-fitted and bore strong expectations. \n\nI first chose the Rosemary Chicken Panini; it was amazing. I've tried many sandwich establishments in Arizona- and have had a difficult time finding a sandwich to meet my East Coast standards- but this panini was fantastic and truly exceeded my expectations. It was the perfect combination of flavour, in conjunction with the perfect toast to the bread (I believe their bread is also made in-house daily?).  It was absolutely amazing, nonetheless, and it was enough to make this my go-to spot for sandwiches during my duration in Arizona. \n\nWhen I returned again, I decided to pursue my staple food item this time: Nutella Crepes. I don't know how to describe the taste sans ostentation. The nutella crepe was absolutely amazing. It was perfectly warm and perfectly sweet. Every ingredient's presence was perfect in its attendance; it was not overloaded or overbearing with sweetness. Every bit of it was well-rounded in delivering that perfect bite, every time. I have been to France quite a number of times, and have to say that these pastries come up infinitesimally close to the perfection of France's pastries. \nThere is a fridge that offers some fresh-pressed juices, to-go salads, etc. that I did not have an opportunity to try, but am sure are excellent if they match up to the experience that I've had thus far. \nIf you are looking for a new spot for juices, a sandwich\/salad lunch spot, or a place to end your night with dessert, I would highly recommend this place
