Like many of the other disappointed people in this list, it's 10:30 pm on Valentine's Day, and I have not received my flower order for my wife. On top of it all, the driver showed up to my house minutes ago, got the dog barking woke up both kids, only to find that he did not have my order with him. Oddly, when I called at 10 pm to inquire, the company did not answer, but the driver texted me 2 minutes after to say he was close, and then didn't have my flowers??? I'm worried that this is not even a real company, and am on hold with my credit card company to stop payment, and will be reporting them to bbb as well.
