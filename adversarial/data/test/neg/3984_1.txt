My wife and I ate at Barrio for the first time Sunday night. it was not a terribly busy night, but there were still plenty of people there. We were impressed with the food. We both ordered a variety of tacos and everything was excellent. The food came out fast and piping hot and everything was fresh and delicious. Our server was Sarah and she rocked. She was friendly, attentive and cool. We ended up chatting a bit at the end of our dinner. The ambiance and music were. cool too. We dug the vibe.  We will definitely be there again.
