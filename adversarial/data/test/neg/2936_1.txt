Total disappointment, again, always. I don't know why I keep trying to give Cain's another try but this time I'm done for good.  I'm not sure what the AMPED group is doing to this new venture of theirs but they need to get it together stat.  Attached is the Irish coffee I was served during brunch today. I don't even know how to describe it other than the worst tasting gritty drink I've ever had. Food also eh. Erasing this place from my mind and will never step foot in here again.
