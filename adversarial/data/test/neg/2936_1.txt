Worst flight experience I've ever had!!! The flight attendants were extremely rude and completely unprofessional! There are young kids working their first job at McDonalds who have better manners, more class, and more professionalism than these \"women.\" I now have a better appreciation for Southwest Airlines!!!!\n\nWould give 0 stars if possible.
