First time in yesterday, and I will definitely go back. I got the Chicken Pud Thai - medium spice. Next time I will go a little spicier. The chicken was a little over cooked .. otherwise I would have given them 5 stars. The service was fantastic! Always around to refill our water. Prices are reasonable. Wasn't crowded on a Thursday night. Great spot overall!
