Tried Tails A Waggin for the first time the other day and I couldn't have been more happy with the quality of service and care for our two year old GSD. Friendly staff made it a welcoming environment and the place was super clean. Our dog is not fully trained yet but that didn't seem to bother the staff. They knew how to handle our girl. We highly recommend Tails A Waggin and will be back when Remington needs another bath.
