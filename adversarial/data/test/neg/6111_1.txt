I tried the Red Sauce Topoki, the flavour had a bit of sweetness but way too spicy for me to really enjoy it. The texture of the rice cakes was good and presentation was nice. The service was just okay. \n\nI tried the flavours my friends got which were the White Sauce Topoki and the Rose Sauce Topoki and those tasted much better. We also got the fried chicken to share which was also just okay, not that good but not that bad.
