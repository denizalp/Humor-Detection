This review is strictly for the GYRO plate.\n\nIt's times like these when I question the credibility of Yelp. I came here with a craving for a gyro and with the \"great\" reviews my hopes were high.  \n\nThe short....I ordered a $14 gyro plate and got 2 large pitas with tasteless prepackaged gyro meat.  Prepackaged due to the uncanny symmetry of every piece of meat and the fact I didn't see a vertical roaster in the kitchen.\n\nCome one yelpers....5 stars for a Greek place that doesn't even have a gyro roaster!!!\n\nI'm sure other items on the menu are good, but look elsewhere for a good gyro.
