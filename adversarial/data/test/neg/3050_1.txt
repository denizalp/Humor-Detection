This is the best Japanese restaurant that I have been to in the Phoenix area. Okay, it's the only Japanese restaurant I've been to in the area, but it is as good as any that I have ever visited. Food is tasty, atmosphere is nice and the price is right. we had a lovely lunch on the patio with perfect 70Â° January weather. Got a love the winter in Phoenix. Got to hate the summers though unless you think you will enjoy hell :-)
