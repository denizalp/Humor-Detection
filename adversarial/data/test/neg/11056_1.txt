Interesting take on tacos. Nicely priced, about 3-4 dollars a taco and they can be stacked with ingredients. Follows a model of creating your own off a menu pad and golf pencils from selections. Some ingredients require an upgrade of $1, the taco shell upgrades are worth it, particularly the green goodness and stoner. It did through me off at first too that the ingredients may be cold on the taco, making it seem like it's a cold taco, but it's all based on what you order, such as the sauces and some of the lettuce. \nThey also have a huge beer selection with lots of local beers. Margaritas and other cocktails too, however I found the pitcher of regular margs to be watered down.
