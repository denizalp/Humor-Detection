My husband and I came in for dinner, it had been a while since we had tried a Chili's, the last one may have been in Texas.  Today, I ordered the fajitas triple play, which included beef, chicken, and shrimp.  It was put on top of grilled onions and green peppers.  They served it with a small plate shredded cheese, sour cream, pico de gallo and guacamole.  This was disappointing because it was so little, just about a spoonful each.\n\nWhen they bought out my plate, the shrimp was missing and our server said it was coming, by the time I had eaten everything else, they brought out the shrimp.  It was good, but I would have enjoyed it with my meal!\n\nI must admit this was an \"okay\" meal, not something I would recommend, but if had no other choice, would eat it over perhaps something else.
