Underwhelmed and disappointed. Sad because a great coal fired pizza is such a thing of beauty and delight. The service and beer at Pi were pretty terrific but that wasn't really why we came here.\n\nA coal fired oven works so quickly and should deliver bubbling delight and distinctive taste. Instead we got lukewarm & soggy with less than exciting flavor and a very large bill in comparison to the enjoyment level. \n\nThe pizzas are essentially a personal pizza priced between $7 for plain up to $13.50 with varying ingredients. I ordered the Quattro Stagioni with sauce, basil, fresh mozzarella, roasted red peppers, prosciutto, fresh mushroom & artichokes divided into four sections with 2 slices devoted to each ingredient. Unimpressed is the best way I can describe this. What I ate had to be eaten with a fork because it was so limp. The prosciutto tasted like overcooked roast beef. I've had this same pizza at Piccolo Forno and theirs blew this pizza out of the water.\n\nThe restaurant was freezing cold and ours was the table next to the pizza oven. Clearly getting this oven hot enough is an issue. It's one of those restaurants that's a 1 and done for me.
