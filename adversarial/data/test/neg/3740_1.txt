The Venetian is the epitome of luxurious Vegas hotels. I was lucky that The Venetian was selected as my hotel after booking a 5 star hotel on Hotwire. This was for my birthday weekend, and they offered to upgrade my luxury suite to the hospitality suite for a low additional cost. \n\nOur suite was twice the size of a luxury suite with a bar and double door entrance to a beautiful bathroom. My experience here definitely made my birthday weekend simply amazing! Service is always superb and staff was very friendly and attentive. I always recommend rooming here, especially if it's for a special occasion or if you just want to splurge for the luxurious experience.\n\nGreat location towards the North end of the Strip. Close to all my favorite places so cab fare is never a killjoy.\n\nAnd of course, one of the best things about The Venetian is that Grand Lux Cafe is downstairs and open 24 hours!
