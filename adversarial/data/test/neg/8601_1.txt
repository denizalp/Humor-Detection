We stayed here from M-Weds for a mini stay-cation for my moms birthday. Our stay was amazing from the check in process to valet to the bellhop to checking out and everything else in between! The young man at the front desk named Ky-something (I'm so sorry I'm horrible with names) was super helpful and went above and beyond to make sure we had an early check in and a late check out. He even saved the day by finding my toddlers missing shoe she lost lol! The housekeepers deserve my kudos too! They were very helpful, courteous, nice, and did an amazing job servicing our suite! We had an 18 month old and an 8 yr old these girls leave snack crumbs everywhere! The room was comfortable and clean and gave the kids enough space to run around and hang out when we weren't at the pool. The pool bar and grill service could've been better but the people were young and having fun we have all been there. Nothing too bad just forgetful on a couple of our drinks. The 24\/7 cafe has really good food their breakfast was one of the best I had. Their food court is ok, we enjoyed the food at 24\/7 better. Thank you WHP staff we will be back soon!
