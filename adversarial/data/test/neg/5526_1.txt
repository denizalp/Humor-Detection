The house and grounds of this historic home are in great shape. we stayed for the tour in English and our guide was very informative about the history of the family and the area of Montreal through the years.  The rooms are not restored to show furnishings from the original Ramezay family, its more set up to show artifacts from Montreal in general.\nIf you have couple of hours to kill and you like historic homes, give this place a shot.
