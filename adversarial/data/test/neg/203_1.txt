We've walked past this place a ton of times and finally decided to try it for lunch. Lunch portions are even huge. We had lots of leftovers. Caesar salad was ok, but the angel hair pasta was delicious and so were the meatballs. Would recommend large parties going here. I would go again but try different items next time.
