Very good.  had a Corporate Board dinner here in a private room.  The appetizer towers were excellent (especially the calamari and the mussels).  I had what we were told they were known for, the sea bass.  Excellent!!  Sea bass soaked in sake with a sweet broth (sorry chef, I'm getting the nomenclature all mixed up) with lobster dumplings.  Everyone should try this at least once.
