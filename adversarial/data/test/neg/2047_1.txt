Visiting a friend who insisted we come to Carolina's on my first morning in town to get a breakfast burrito To Die For.\n\nShe was totally spot-on.\n\nThese delicious hand-made tortillas are fantastic!  I wish I could take a bunch back to Seattle with me, but since they're freshly-made, I'm guessing the lack of preservatives will make that a better idea than reality.\n\nI enjoyed the chorizo, egg, and potato burrito with plenty of salsa.  I loved the spicy\/smooth combo with the sour cream in the burrito.\n\nI hope I get a chance to eat here again before leaving town!
