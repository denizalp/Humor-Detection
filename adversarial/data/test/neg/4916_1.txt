I rely on my vehicle for work, I travel a ton. So, I needed a place near where I live, had convenient scheduling and wouldn't bend me over the price. This place fits all three.\n\nThe owner who has taken care of me every time I've gone is the epitome of how an owner\/operator should run a business. Anything he's ever fixed on my car he has explained to me in detail what needs done and the ways he could do it. I like how he gives you the options and his opinion, then you decide. He puts the car up for you and show you what the problem is. He even keeps the parts he replaced to show you what the issue was and gives you a side by side of the new part.\n\nJust one little example. I took it there for an oil change and tire rotation. I mentioned that my brake warning light was on though my brakes were new and in good shape. Instead of taking advantage of me not knowing what the issue was, he diagnosed it and told me it was just a wire to the sensor was bad. He'll replace it the next time I come back for a tire rotation.\n\nThis guy has a customer until I move away.
