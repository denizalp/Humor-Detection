After walking probably 10 miles up and a down the strip, it's good to sit down to a comfy booth here in the Yardbird. We got drinks with our orders and my blackberry bouton lemonade was just what I needed. It came out in a mason jar and I loved the balance of the tea and bourbon.\n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered the deviled eggs, chilled watermelon with pepper, lemon and herbs, mama's biscuits (fried chicken, pepper jelly, pickles, and buttermilk biscuits), and the crunchy yardbird sandwich (fried chicken, bacon, buttermilk dressing with tomato and lettuce). They are famous for their fried chicken and OMG it was really amazing! My mouth is watering just thinking about the food we had.\n\nThe fried chicken was crispy on the outside but still juicy and moist on the inside, the biscuits and jelly just made it even better. I took a bite of my bf's sandwich and had to agree with his great choice. The deviled eggs were stacked! It was huge and roped with fish roe. Nice touch! And the chilled watermelon cubes were a nice finish to our dish. I loved the spice pepper with lemon it had. Mmmmm!
