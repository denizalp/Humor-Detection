Simply outstanding. The food is delicately understated with superior ambiance and service. I ordered the Milos special, which are thinly cut zucchini and eggplant with homemade tzatiki. I also had their dracon fish, flown in from the Mediterranean. I highly recommend the patio seating, which offers tremendous strip views. It is pricey, so come prepared to spend for what you receive.
