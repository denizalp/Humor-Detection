late night or anytime this restaurant host some of the best food you can eat that is reasonably priced in Las Vegas. They also have a sister restaurant up in Reno. I have been to that would many times also. So if you're on the strip and looking for a hearty breakfast dinner or lunch this is a great place to try.
