I took my daughter here for revision of tongue and lip ties when she was 3 months old. They got me in right way for the initial consult, where Dr. Cotton took pictures and gave me information about everything. She offered to do the procedure then, or let me go home and think about it so I didn't feel rushed and un-prepared. When I came back for the procedure, everyone was very nice and took great care of my baby. I liked that she uses a laser and not scissors to do the cutting. \nThe biggest complaint I have is that the patient education they sent home with me was horrible. I couldn't remember everything that Dr. Cotton told me about medicine, stretches, and activity limitations. The paper she gave me was confusing and incorrect in some places which made my husband very confused. \nOverall though a good experience, I would trust her again. She definitely took her time with me.
