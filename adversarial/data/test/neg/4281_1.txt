This place's black rice spin on our favorite rolls was a real treat.  The staff was beyond kind, and you could really tell that a lot of the other patrons were beloved regulars.  We sat next to the sushi bar, and one of the chefs handed us a giant sample of their Ahi Tuna Poke.  It was phenomenal.  The H3 roll and Shrimp Tempuras were our favorites, but everything we had was delightful.
