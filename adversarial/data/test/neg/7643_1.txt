We've been back several times for weekend breakfast and always happy with the interesting menu choices. FAVORITE is the green chili pork tostado!!!  Great portion size so you can share. Usually the hawaiin bread style French toast with bananas is another favorite, but this time it wasn't as moist and tender. Was dry as though bread didn't soak up enough of egg batter. BUT customer service was excellent and they switched it out for fluffiest cake like pancakes ever :)  Also, cappuccino and mocha lattes are coffee shop quality!
