Ambiance: a little bit confusing and that is why I can't give this restaurant a 5 star. As you enter there's two ambiances the main bar big and empty not cozy .. resembles one of many bars in vegas .. clubby feel.. however the restaurant part only opens at 6:00pm so it was frustrating as we reserved our seats for 17:00 , we expected the restaurant would be open at the time we reserved our seats.\n\nAt 18:00 no one told us we could head to the restaurant so it was a little misleading \n\nService: mediocre at first they told us we have a 2 hour window limit ... hmm very arrogant staff.\n\nAs the night went by, the staff started to cater us better maybe because we were ordering almost everything on their menu .. very hypocritical. Unfortunately, they screwed up the order, my husband has an allergy to Scallops and we told them no scallops they ended up sending out scallops 3 times .. the last time they put the scallops on the side of the plate.. wow how genius -.-\n\nFood: I have to admit if it was for the food alone I would rate it 5 stars . It was DEEEELICIOUS! Their black cod was to die for ! Dim sums were amazinggg , they had it with lobsters and chicken and salmon yummy! \n\nOverall, food is amazing , service terrible , they should improve on their service and cater to the customers needs.
