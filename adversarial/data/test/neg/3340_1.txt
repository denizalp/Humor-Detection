Fusion restaurant that is similar to spring rolls except probably a better version. It offers Asian food along with a few western food like pasta, but it is predominantly Asian food. \n\nThe biggest feature is that this place is all you can eat. With tip and tax, it comes to 25 per person for lunch. However, unlike other all you can eat place, you can order unlimited salmon sashimi which is quite rare.\n\nNot only you can eat sushi, but you can also eat dim sum. I wouldn't recommend that they have the best dim sum but at least it is a choice. They have pretty good sushi although their spicy tuna sushi is quite cheap. There is virtually no tuna.\n\nYou order your food via an iPad. Be sure to order the appetizers.
