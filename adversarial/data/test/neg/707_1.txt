This is a truly great DD!  The crew there is very professional, kind, and competent!  They deserve the highest accolades.  I still think DD coffee is the absolute best tasting!  It sure beats the stratospherically priced Starbucks blend down the street.  And I love their muffins too!  You just can't go wrong with this classic place!
