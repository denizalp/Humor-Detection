The first pretty good ice cream I saw in Las Vegas. I just love the ice cream flavors they offer. They aren't the crappy same flavors every other ice cream places offer. The wonderful flavors include Creme Brulee, Pistachio, Mango, Pineapple, etc. They all taste wonderful and are very soft and creamy. The only drawback to this place is the extremely high prices for just 2 scoops. About 7.50 for 2 is just quite expensive, but it's worth it.
