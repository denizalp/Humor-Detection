I used this park several times with my pup and usually didn't have a problem... until today. My dog found a baby pool with stagnant filthy water in it and went in and then was attacked and bitten by another dog resulting in my dog having a hole in her leg. The other dog owner not only wouldn't fess up but did not remove his dog from the park. On the way out, I warned other dog owners of the aggressive dog and we were told, yeah, it had gotten in a scruff with another dog before we got there. I will not be using this park again. Unfortunately with it being an unmanned park, there is no one there to regulate what occurs and obviously there are irresponsible pet owners that continue to bring aggressive dogs. My pup and I won't be back!
