Tried out O for lunch this week and thought it was pretty good.\nDecor is nice and the food is good.  Tried the Tombo Tuna Tartare which was nice although the presentation was slices of pan seared tuna as opposed to the tartare I was expecting.  Nevertheless, it tasted great and was presented nicely.\nPlace was busy with a wide mix of clientele...must draw nicely from the surrounding residential and nearby businesses.\nWill definitely go back on a weekend night to try out their drink and dinner menu.  Looks promising.
