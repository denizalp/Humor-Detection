I came out of this buffet feeling very full and very satisfied. Expect a wait, especially for dinner, but the line moved fairly quickly. Prices are cheaper for Monday-Thursday and lunch dining in general. \n\nThere are SO many options. Some highlights are king crab legs, prime rib, pesto mashed potatoes, their huge selection of deserts, lots of pasta options, fresh breads, roasted cauliflower, salmon, poke, and more. They also have a great salad bar, and some alright Asian cuisine options (i.e. Stir fry dishes). Everything I had was delicious. I could not even try everything I wanted to try. Everything I had was good, and the staff does a good job of cleaning up dishes, refining drinks, and restocking fresh food in a timely manner. It is a wonder how they do it all because of the sheer variety of dishes and number of people who dine here. \n\nPace yourself, and enjoy the all-you-can-eat (and all-you-can-drink if you choose that option as well)!
