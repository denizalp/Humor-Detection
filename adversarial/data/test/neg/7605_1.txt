Here's a tip: Go. To. Puff. \n\n We came in today to check it out again while waiting for Game Stop to open and never again. The customer service is just so cold and unwelcoming. The juices are flavorless and their juice bar isn't self help so it made us feel like we were bothering the girl with every one we asked to try. Overall the experience was just subpar and we are definitely sticking to Puff.
