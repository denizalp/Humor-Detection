Was in town for a ladies weekend. Booked front row tickets to Thunder from Down Under and tickets to Magic Mike, too. This show FAR exceeded that of the MM show.\n\nThere are screens to make sure you don't miss anything. The guys are pretty darned good dancers (MM dancers are better dancers - will review that horrible show when I'm done here). They are VERY attractive and put on a good show. They did a a lot of on-stage dancing and in the audience (hold onto your drinks, 'cuz they're coming to dance on your tables too!).\n\nOne of the things that struck me the most was that they were SO very respectful of the women. Both in the audience and the ones that they brought on stage. They totally catered to comfort level of the gal. One great example was Alexander, he brought an adorable young bride to be on the stage and was VERY respectful of noticing that her skirt rode up a bit, so pulled it down for her. It was so darned sweet. (there are other similar examples - including an 81 year old bride to be that also found her way to the stage and was not the least bit uncomfortable)\n\nThere's no tipping, but for $20 cash (Apr 2017) you can get your picture taken with them all after the show (there's like 6 or 7 per show). They were SUCH great sports about making sure that everyone got a photo that wanted one.\n\nThe show was probably a bit over an hour, then 1.5 hours including photo time. There is a bar in the venue, they have wait staff, and there is a restroom in the venue as well.\n\nIf you're considering this one or Magic Mike, I'd suggest this one. You can check out my MM review. That's next on my to do list.\n\n(ps - this isn't like the titty bars your male friends have been to, this is classy and well choreographed and respectful..... you won't be too embarrassed if your mother is with you)
