Having never been to vegas to drink my friends took me here and boy oh boy was I in for a treat.\n\nI'm not much of a drinker but taking the advice that the only way to really experience vegas is to constantly drink. After getting Lobster Me next door I came over here to get a yard stick\n\nthe cool thing i like about here is the samples and how they served it, how unique and their service phenomenal, being patient and informative \n\nanyways i opted for the 190 octane its kind of strong but man it was good, get it with an extra shot or maybe even two and it'll definitely be different\n\nother then that i couldn't explain the taste but all i could remember was next time i come back i guess i'll get another one
