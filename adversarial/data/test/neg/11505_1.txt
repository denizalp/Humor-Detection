This is the best Target I've been to. It's clean, huge and has a supermarket. I've never been to a Target this big or clean or one with a supermarket, so it gets extra points. \n\nThe staff is always friendly and everything is easy to find. \n\nPrices in the supermarket are great. There are always sales, so it's easy to get sidetracked with food bargains. \n\nAlways bring a list so you don't get sucked in to random sales and spend more then you want. At least that's how I roll.
