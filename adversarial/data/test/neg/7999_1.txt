I read the previous reviews, but love good sweet tea, so went here anyway. Glad we did! Our food and service was really good. We had the nachos and the club sandwich, both were nice hearty servings and tasted good. Since many of the negative reviews were more about the bathroom than their food, I thought I would check that out as well. The faucet is in bad shape, but they did have toilet paper in both stalls.... Yes I did look since it was mentioned in several reviews. They are hiring for all shifts, so I wonder if they cleaned house and now have better employees?? \nSweet Tea Rules!! :)
