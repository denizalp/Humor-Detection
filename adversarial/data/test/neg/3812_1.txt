Great place to relax. Near the gym where I work out. I like the Buzztime Trivia and I am a regular customer. The service is friendly and they have some good specials \n\nUnfortunately  i like my wings and like them grilled as they taste better and are much healthier\n\n Recently new kitchen management made a decision they will no longer grill the wings even when they are not busy  This is a real minor point but demonstrates to me their lack of consideration to their customers health and flexibility \n\nI will continue to be a guest here but when I want my grilled wings I will go to Ammacapanes
