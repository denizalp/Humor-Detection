This place is disgusting. The line is always backed up, and it's full scum bags. Drinks are super pricy, and extremely tiny. You can't hear a damn word anyone is saying, and you always have someone's sweat rubbing off on you. This bar is over crowded, and way too noisy. Oh and if you have to use the restroom, plan on waiting in like for almost 10 minutes. Can't stand El Hefe.
