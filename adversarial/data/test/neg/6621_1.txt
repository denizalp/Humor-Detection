I did so much homework on picking the right Movers.  But my budget pretty much made the decision for me.  My details sound similar to these other reviews.  I first dealt with Jack Tulane the Sale Mgr. He was very attentive in the beginning until they got their money. He called constantly. Then (I'm just gonna cut & paste from others here because it's the same that I experienced) there were no follow-up calls, rude customer service, broken belongings, missing items, double the cost and ignored calls and messages. If you want Details -  A different moving company comes to pick up my things. I just thought it was a local WA truck that would transfer my stuff to an Executive Moving Semi.  IDK.  While they are loading my thing, they tell me it's gonna cost more because I had more than they were told.  Not true.  I gave them a very detailed inventory for the estimate. They told me my estimate would be used as the final bill.  They made me pay an additional $2400.  We were told my items would arrive in 2 weeks.  When we called on furniture I found out I was given to another company and I would have to deal with them.  Now dealing with Great American Movers, they told us the contract says they have up to 20 days even though we were told on the phone before the move happened 2 weeks.  Almost 4 weeks later with no furniture, towels, clothes, etc. the truck shows up at 9 pm with only the driver. There were no other helpers.  It took him til 3 a.m to off load our stuff.  He was nice enough and we felt sorry for him so towards the end we had him just put the boxes in the garage and living rm. and we'd move it to where it had to go. Some of Our belongings were broken that we packed and also that they had wrapped themselves, I did not notice until after the truck left and I am unpacking.  Our vacuum and tool box were missing.  After numerous calls the Claims dept. was no help. Just said to file the forms.  Feeling frustrated and tired, I gave up and I am trying to put it in the past.  But I had to let consumers know how they operate.
