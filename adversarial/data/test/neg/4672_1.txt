This place was fantastic! Great food, ambiance, and the service was spot on. We came here with two kids under 8 and luckily they behaved so we could enjoy the meal.\nThe drinks are strong and tasty. The fried chicken, watermelon, and waffles was fantastic! Everything was tasty.\nThe sweet tea isn't too sweet and the yardbird old fashioned is a tidy drink. \nOrdered the ice cream butterfinger pie dessert, and it's fan-freaking-tastic!
