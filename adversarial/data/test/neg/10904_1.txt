I highly recommend for large groups! Definitely one of the most fun experiences I've had. We did two games, Noriko which we were so close to beating, and Unknown which was so crazy and amazing, I can't even describe without giving away details. You will feel an adrenaline rush for sure haha. The staff were great! You can tell they really have a passion for escape games and love what they do. I'm totally hooked and can't wait to come back! There are also board games to occupy yourself between games. I suggest you book in advance as it gets busy.
