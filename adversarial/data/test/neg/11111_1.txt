Went here for a team building work function. By far the best room escape I've been to. Escape room sets the bar. The puzzles for brilliant; the games are immaculately made by film set designers. We did two of the rooms and we have all taken cards to go back and spread the word.\n\nIf you're only likely to try one room escape, try this place. If you've done a few, try this place.
