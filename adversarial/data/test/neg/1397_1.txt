Pizza is usually good but I am beyond frustrated with this restaurant. The last three times I have used their website online ordering my order has been lost and my card charged. The previous two times I called and my order was delivered after more than two hours. Tonight I called and after explaining that I ordered and it was never delivered the person on the phone took my name and said \"we will call you back.\" I told him to cancel my order and he hung up the phone. I called back, he was flustered and apologetic, but now I have to track to make sure my card is refunded. Such a pain! I was a customer for years, I will stick to Rosati's on Durango from now on.\n\nUpdate- The manager called and apologized, and informed me they would give me a $30 credit. I appreciate the customer service on this occasion.
