What a nice surprise! Being that this place is in an airport, I was more than skeptical. \n\nI went on a Tuesday afternoon, when it was slower than normal. The restaurant and bar were nearly empty. I had the open-faced chicken sandwich. It was great: fast, fresh, and light. Service was excellent, and the menu had plenty of selections. I'm already looking forward to coming back and trying something different. \n\n\nIf this was in my neighborhood, I would go definitely go back. Definitely a good place to stop for those traveling through CLT. The best quality food you will likely find in an Airport anywhere.
