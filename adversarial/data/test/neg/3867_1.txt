I love that this isn't an AYCE- I don't feel like I have to stuff myself. \nGreat service for hotpot- always refills your soup and check up on you. \nFresh ingredients- the lamb is a good portion for what you pay. \nThe only thing that I didn't love so much were the dipping sauces, most of them were very oily. \nI also love that they give bibs so that your clothes don't get splattered on!
