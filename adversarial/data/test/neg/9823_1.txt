I'm torn between one and two stars. I've heard RAVE reviews for this food truck and was excited to try it. What came out was a sad disappointment. I got the ham and cheese, dad & little sis got the turkey bacon cheese. And each one was $8, with no sides which is pretty expensive for just a sandwich but we were willing to pay for what we thought we were getting.  I expected thick sliced french bread, a decent portion of meat, and some quality cheese. What we got was wonder bread sandwiches with cheap precut deli meat (the kind you buy prepackaged) and a cheese that was vaguely reminiscent of kraft singles. I could've made them at home for less than what one cost and tasted just as good. I'd have to agree with the guy who says this truck does not live up to the standard of \"gourmet food truck.\"
