Wow! Such a hidden gem!! Atmosphere is simple and not overdone with a easy to read, 1 page menu. Ok now about the FOOD!  \n\nI always compare the same 3 dishes, 1 soup and the thai tea when trying a new thai restaurant  (panang, spicy chicken basil, pad see u, and Tom yum soup). Panang and basil were amazing with lots of vegetables and great flavor. The pad see u (I know I spelled that wrong) is amazing and is my GF favorite. The tom yum soup surprised me here! I typically order Tom Kah soup but wow, the Tom yum is a no brainer here. Idk how to describe it but it's def a must try! (Gonna try the Tom Kah today for the 1st time).\n\nLastly, the service is top notch. The staff really cares about your satisfaction and is always quick to check on hiw everything is tasting. My 1st time here I was thanked tremendously for trying a new thai spot and was glad I did. Great food, awesome service and in a clean atmosphere!
