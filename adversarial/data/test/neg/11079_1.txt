Nice open seating near the bar with tables outside. Good selections on the menu, nice assortment of wines to choose from. After a long day of house hunting we just wanted a glass of wine and a good meal.\nI got the filet, medium rare came with a few red potatoes that were flatten underneath the steak. The steak was cooked just right, potatoes were good as were the charred asparagus.  My wife enjoyed the fillet medallions encrusted with gorgonzola and demi glace, cooked medium rare as well.\n\nService was prompt and efficient we were in and out in under an hour at back at the hotel.
