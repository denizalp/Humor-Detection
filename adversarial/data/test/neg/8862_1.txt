Yesterday I went to best buy, and without a doubt, it was the WORST experience ever. All I needed was an armband for my iPhone 4S so I asked employees where they held them and they all said, \"iPhone accessories.\" (No eye contact whatsoever.) furthermore I asked an employee whom worked in that area where they obtained them, and she directed me to the iPhone 4 accessories and she gave them a quick skim, and told me, \"weird they should be here. Um, I think iPhone 4S and the iPod 4th generation  are the same size.\" So I said, \"well I'll like to make sure it is.\" So we tried it out and it didn't fit. Then she goes on her computer to look if they had any in stock and told me, \"we have some on stock but I don't know where.  I think your best bet is to go the best buy on Maryland, they may have more in stock.\" Okay, thanks but no thanks. So I check again, in the iPhone 4S accessories and they were right f***ing there! HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I DO NOT ADVICE YOU TO GO UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT AND YOU KNOW WHERE IT'S AT.
