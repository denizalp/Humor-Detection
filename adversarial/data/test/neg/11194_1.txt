Great spot in downtown Scottsdale.  I personally despise sports bars and I feel that the majority of places around this area are just that.  Bars with tvs and waaaaay too loud of music.\nThe W is an upscale Vegas type hotel (but MUCH smaller) and it provides a more elegant spot to mix and mingle.  The first time I came to Shade the place was pretty quiet (10 pm on a Fri...but no event) which was fine by me because there was room to sit and chill (per my previous review of the W) and dance to the dj.  We went again recently and they happened to be having a large event.  Loved the vibe again, but too crowded for my taste.  Nowhere to sit or even to dance.  Literally all you could do was just stand there with a drink in hand and stare at your companions which is not my idea of a good time.  Music was still poppin and I would've enjoyed dancing but there wasn't anywhere to do so.  So we moved downstairs to the area where they have a live band.  Still crowded but by about 10:30 it was starting to clear out a little and we managed to find a spot. \nFirst, we ordered drinks at the bar (downstairs).  They managed to mix up our drinks and charged them all on 1 credit card instead of the 2 we handed them.  Honestly, this type of stuff really bugs me.  The bartenders have ONE job.  And as mentioned, it wasn't nearly as busy as upstairs.  But we were well taken care of once we were seated.  Interesting to note that the same drink that cost $10 ordered at the bar was $13 at our table.  Not sure why.\nMusic was again, really great-both the live band and the dj that followed...but again, there wasn't a dance floor.  I like to kick back and relax, chill but I like to dance too.  All in all this is a good spot for people watching more than anything!!!!  You seriously feel like you're in Vegas.
