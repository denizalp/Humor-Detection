I had a slight emergency where I got a piece of metal shaving burned into my eye. I just happened to be driving by when i noticed their office, so I stopped there instead of the E.R. So glad that I did. Dr. Rios saw me immediately and and numbed the area and within 10 mins of me being there he had the metal shaving  extracted and it was practically painless. \nI couldn't thank him enough. \nI later returned to him when I needed contacts and He and his entire staff were very pleasant to work with during my eye examination to bring patient with me in showing me how to insert my contact lenses. \nI am very past due on my annual eye exam but will be calling his office and making an appointment with him asap! I Can't say enough about them. \nThank You. \nJason Weir
