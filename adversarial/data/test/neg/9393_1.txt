I've been to the bar on my first visit to Vegas and was craving sweets, so my girls and I came here. I swear the girl working there was watching us like a hawk because she was afraid of us stealing the candy. Like uhh ok? I felt so uncomfortable even trying to look at the different candy there because she kept following us! \n\nWe did buy something so we defs weren't planning on stealing. I mean who steals candy anyway?! \n\nShe made my experience here really awkward. It is almost like I never should have decided on candy and should have gone with getting an ice cream ! there are lots of variety, but it looked too heavy and filling...and I didn't want to explode in my dress at night. \n\nThis place is over hyped though. It is super cute for a candy store though!
