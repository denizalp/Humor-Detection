I set up a meeting here because I read another yelp review, that was my mistake. The Crown Caf√© only barely had lattes, I say barely because the two \"baristas\" had to discuss what it actually was to make my order despite the item being clearly written on the board. They hadn't heard of Americanos, and I didn't see any fresh coffee, however they were fairly nice and talk to me like I was there son. Make no mistake, this is nothing more than a coffee shop inside an office building.
