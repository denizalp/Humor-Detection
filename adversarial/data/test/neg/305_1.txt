This is 1 of my favorite dollar stores. I am able to find many of my craft items, and the store is always clean and organized. The workers are helpful, but there is one sales associate that truly stands out so kind and friendly her name is SaraLynn. I go there to save a few dollars, but when you are able to still get good customer service also...Its awesome.
