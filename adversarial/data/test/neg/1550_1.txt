I like Zoe's.  It's nothing super exciting but it's healthy and tasty fast-ish food.  I typically get the chicken kabobs and went with the greek chicken pita this last time.  I'd recommend sticking to the platters\/kabobs as the pita lacked in the meat department but was still pretty good.  The desserts are solid and large enough to split.  \n\nIf you're watching calories or dining with a someone you want to make feel self-conscious there's a sub-500 calorie menu that still provides a good sized portion.
