Stopped by for a few a few drinks and a appetizer about 830 on last Saturday night\nAfter wanting to stop by for sometime I was disappointed.\nThe guy bartender with the Bow tie who was obviously gay spent the whole time \nWe were there flirting with the guy next too me and my girlfriend. After 15 minutes we got our first drink never once offered a menu so we finished our drinks wanting a second but after another 15 minutes and waiting never even was offered. I was very \nDisappointed and think it was very unprofessionalF
