While visiting the city I was excited to try this place out. So my review is as disappointing to write as it was to have personally experienced. I just really thought after reading the reviews first that this place was going to knock it out of the park. \n     After arriving, we were told that there was a large party in the back and that they were not seating people until the kitchen could get caught up. We were a party of two with no one else waiting. So ok, no problem we'll just grab some drinks at the bar and wait and she says she will come get us as soon as they start seating again.\n     Well, after 30 minutes in and watching not 1 and not 2 but 3 different groups come in and get seated in various locations we decide to go reestablish that we are indeed still waiting in case she thought we left and were told they could get us in 15 more minutes.\n      Fast forward now we are seated and have ordered. This place is so loud. I mean I get that it is what it is but my goodness, i felt like we were shouting during our entire meal and speaking of the meal. It was just so-so. One meal was the the filet mignon.....meh.. and the other was the diver scallops also meh...should have just stayed at the bar, speaking of which craft beer selection was very nice and staff very knowledgeable.
