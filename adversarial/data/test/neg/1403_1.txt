Had a Birthday party there, the kids seemed to have a good time, but I didn't think it was well organized or worth the high price tag.  They only got to play 2 games in the birthday package and they were only 10 minutes each.  They were late with the pizza and then hurried them to finish so they could start the next game which was over so fast that they were late with the cake too.
