I live close by to Chino Locos, so from time to time I would drop by to grab a bite on one of their burritos\n\nThe Pros\n- Friendly and welcoming staff \n- Great portions\n- Simple Chinese and Mexican fusion.  Burritos with egg noodles just simply amazing\n- Excellent food just under $8, $10 for the specials\n- Highly recommend the Basa fish burrito\n\n\nThe Con:\n- Biggest problem to me is one of the server, believe his name is Steven, which happens to be the only staff that I encounter to be rude, sloppy and just plain unprofessional. This happened to me twice, I placed an order with him, the staff makes it and hands it to him, he completely forgets about it and just leave it on the table until one of the other staff happen to notice it and hands it to me\nNot to mention, not once has he asked me if I want a bag with my burrito takeout, unlike the rest of the staff. \n\n4 stars.  Cheap, good eat, unfortunately they got 1 bad egg in the basket
