I love anyplace that has more then 2 varieties of good breads to choose from!\nI got the yellow fin tuna on the multigrain bread with avocado spread. \nI was really hoping for slice avocados, but a speed is better then nothing! \nThe bread was nice and toasted! \nSince I don't eat salt, for me it was a little too salty!\nNot sure if it was the tuna or the avocado spread,\nSo I only ate half of a half.\nBut it was as a nice portion. \nOh and there is a tv!
