We came here for dinner with friends and we ordered the following: roasted cauliflower croquettes which was tasty, salmon gravlax which was just ok. They served it on a rye crisp which is not home made which was disappointing. Pear & walnut salad which was pretty good. The compromise salad we asked if they can add goat cheese, which they did. This salad was disappointing, the roasted squash was diced in little cubes which was a mistake, the salad which contains spinach and arugula, the taste of roasted squash was lost in the salad, the dressing a pear vinegrette was bland could not even taste the pear due to the strong taste of arugula and spinach, the cranberries were way to dry almost hard on a few. The beef ribs were good and tender, fall off the bone with a tasty bbq sauce. The perogies were good and the sage butter was tasty. Food temp was great. All in all i will come here again but will not order the same things again.
