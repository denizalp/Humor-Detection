Really good food! The pozloe and tortas are my favorite, but the carne asada tacos are pretty amazing too. You can also go on eat24.com and place your order online and it will be ready for you to pick up shortly after your arrival.\n\nThe salsa bar here is small but delicious, and the pickled veggies are to die for. I'd run off with the whole tray if they let me!\n\nThis place isn't in the best area but the food is definitely worth it.
