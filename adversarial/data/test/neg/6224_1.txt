Pretty cheap and authentic. They offer real Mexican dishes like menudo and lengua. They also offer seafood like shrimp and fish tacos\/burritos etc. their menu is big and the service is fast. The portion sizes are very generous. I didn't finish all of my menudo. Usually I can eat till it hurts, but the portions were very generous. They have a drive thru window. The place is open till midnight every night-even on a Sunday. I'll be back to try the lengua.
