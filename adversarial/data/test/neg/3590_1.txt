First time here. Heard the tacos were good. Was shocked to see they have been beat up on Yelp. I decided to make sure I didn't let that bias get in the way of my real experience or perception. Was pleased to see free guac and chips upon my first check in. Nice to see a decent give away for a check in. The guac was great. Chip are thin like I em. Appeared to be made fresh. Ordered a steak and a chicken street taco. Not very big but about the norm for a gourmet taco. Chicken was shredded and in a type of sweet sauce. Was yummy. Both were good but not awesome. The service was was great. Was checked on by multiple people. I think they are making an effort to fix customer service issues. My visit wasn't during rush hour. So all I can say is that the service was great, atmosphere was cool, TVs were very nice and everywhere and the food was good.
