I absolutely love this place. The owner, Frank is a friendly guy who you can see occasionally serving tables and dishing out recommendations. Their food is authentic Mexican, not like those restaurant chains that claim to be. I enjoy their carnitas crunchy tacos and the chips and salsa. As a firm believer that the salsa says a lot about the food quality, you won't be disappointed. the prices are reasonable and service is great.
