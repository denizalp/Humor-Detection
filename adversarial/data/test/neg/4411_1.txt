This place offers authentic Indian food at a reasonable price. In fact, food here is better and cheaper than anywhere in the neighborhood. A great and cozy place to enjoy a nice meal. \nPlus point: The owner\/manager (his name is Kapil) is a very friendly guy and would always improvise the food to suit your taste.
