Went here yesterday (Wednesday) around 5 pm. After we perused the menu at the hostess stand and showed interest in the pizza-of-the-day, the hostess told us the pizza was only $8 in the bar because it was happy hour. Sweet! She pointed us to a table in the bar, where we sat. And sat. And sat. There were two waiters working the two tables next to us while completely ignoring us. One actually stood at the bar chatting with his friends. Seriously? After 6 minutes of being ignored, we left. There are lots of restaurants around, too bad you don't care to pay attention to us.
