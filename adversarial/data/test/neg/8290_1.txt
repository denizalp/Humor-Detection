I hobbled in to Marjon's on my crutches this week and can report no change in the great service and inventory they have to offer.  I found out they are about the only store in the area that offers what they do.  They had a competitor that isn't around any longer.  I think that's important to know.  I've been in stores where if you don't like it to bad because you almost have to go there and put up with whatever-NOT Marjon's.   Also, I have to say that the service they give on the phone is equally pleasant.  They are really one of my backups for my art work which is getting more involved.  One that seems they wlll always treat you right.\n\nGood people here.
