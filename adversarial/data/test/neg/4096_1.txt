My wife's coworker recommended this place so we tried it out on a Saturday evening. The place is small probably seats around 30. It's a quaint spot. We ordered some gyoza and basil fried rice. Wife got the chicken pho and I got the beef. Gyoza was pretty standard fair nothing out of the ordinary. The other dishes you can get tailored to your level spiciness 1 through 10. I can handle spicy food pretty well so me thinking 5 would be medium went for a 6 on my beef pho and a 5 for the fried rice. I guess I overestimated my spicy food macho-ness. Whooo boy it was spicy! My nose was running like crazy. Which is a shame because the pho was bomb! I wanted to drink up all the broth but couldn't handle the heat. Overall it was great food! We'll definitely be back. BUT we'll start off with 3's I think on the heat scale.
