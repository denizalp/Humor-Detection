Came here with a party of 25 people and they set up a long table right in the middle. As i sat down, i was quickly asked what id like to drink. And they brought water  as i looked through the drink menu. She also came to check back at a reasonable time so i wasnt forgotten or rushed. Service was amazing for such a large group of people. \n\nThe menu was extended! So many things to choose from i had a hard time deciding. They have things from dim sum to korean to thai to japanese. And hearing from everyone at the party, it sounded like everything was amzing. \n\nWhat i ordered:\nSpicy salmon rolls\nCalifornia rolls\nChicken satay skewers\nUnagi bento box \n\nThe portions were huge! I think almost everyone had leftovers and she packed it up for us. \nOverall good experience. I would come back since its in my area. But I wouldn't recommend it if youre looking for something authentic tho.
