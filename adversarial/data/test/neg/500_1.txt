If I can give them zero stars I would. Worst customer service I have ever experienced. They have workers that don't speak any English and can't even give proper service. The nail color on my toes don't match my hand and I asked to get it changed they want to charge me an extra five dollars after I just paid $55 for the whole service. They are pure money hungry. And pretty much blamed it on me for not picking out the correct color to match my hands extend that of making my experience great and satisfying my needs they rather have terrible attitudes and charged extra money. Will not be going back and will report to BBB.
