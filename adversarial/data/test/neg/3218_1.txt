Came here with my mommy friends after shopping at 4pm..no line. Sweet! We were sat down quickly and our server was on top of waters & drinks for all of us.\nWe tried so many different kinds of sushi. I could not find fault with any of them.\nEven the desserts were amazing. My only issue was our waitress disappeared around time for dessert so we had to ask another server to send her over.\nIf there would not have been such a delay..and we did wait a bit..I would have given them 5 stars.\nI will be back again soon though.
