Went with a large group of friends for a bachelor party. Although the policy of no reservation but waitlist priority had me worried, we actually sat right away and had a great meal. The portions are huge and you definitely get your moneys worth. Good selection of wine but prices were kind of on the high side. Wish there was more beer on draft. The waitstaff was very attentive especially when serving such a large group. I'd definitely recommend.
