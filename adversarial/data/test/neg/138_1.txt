Ever been to a place where you feel you belong? This place does that comfort feeling...Just like the food!\nMy husband and I were there for the holiday, and last Friday was our first time going to the restaurant. We found the place from my favorite TV show \"Hell's Kitchen\", and thought we should give it a try.\nIt started with our crappy Uber ride from the airport, then we went straight to Yardbird for dinner. Though our reservation was made for a later time, somehow they were able to accommodate us for an earlier dinner time. We ordered the chicken and waffles for our shared dinner and had the mac & cheese, as well the devil's egg. Which turned out perfect! \nWe got sat in Andy's section, he was our server for the evening, and so I made a small conversation with him, and Andy made us feel very welcome and pretty much took care of us until the end. On a later time, I got to meet Tajeh, one of the executive chef working that night. She was quickly visiting her family's table, and I just jokingly stopped her and made a small conversation. \nI must say...This place didn't feel like just your typical restaurant, it seriously felt like you're part of their family. You come, you eat, drink, then they'll feed you some more until you can't eat anymore!\nThe chefs were amazingly kind, Andy pretty much took care of us, and he even introduced us to the morning\/daytime chef. Their food is really beyond my pallets, and I've always loved the southern type of food. \nI am sure they don't get to see the same face every day and make friends with random guests. But in my case, if you know the right place to make friends and dine....It's with those folks who makes and serves your food. Yardbird is just that southern comfort, with the right type of food, great staff, and just superb service.\nThank you, Andy & Tajeh for taking care of us during our visit!!! :)\nWe will for sure be back to visit you guys, whenever we're in Vegas. \n#awesomeness #greatfood #greatservice #friendlystaff #familyoriented #greatdrinks #foodporn
