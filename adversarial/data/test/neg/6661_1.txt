Awesome.  Since I moved to AZ. from TX. I have been searching for good Mexican food and I finally found it.  Our server, Eric, was the best.  Took time to answer our questions, always with a smile.  The salsa was great and so were the tacos.  We went on Monday and the Margaritas were only $0.99 and were better than most other places.  We will be regulars here.
