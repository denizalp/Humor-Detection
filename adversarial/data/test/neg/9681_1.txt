I live in Youngtown and found this little home made ice cream shop opened in a defunct shopping plaza about a year ago. The ice cream is amazing! Hubby likes coffee milkshakes - they make them several different ways. I tried the Almond Joy ice cream and was delightful. It is family owned and are all wonderful people, very friendly and very upbeat. They also have a frequent buyer program. We are frequent patrons of this establishment and we totally support independent local businesses. A great business to put Youngtown on the map.
