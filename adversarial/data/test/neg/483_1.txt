One day it was Boston Steakhouse, the next time I checked it is Que Ling Vietnamese Cuisine. 2nd location of Que Ling Vietnamese  https:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/que-ling-restaurant-toronto \n\nHere you can still find items from Boston including their Sizzling Plates and other Hong Kong Style Cafe stables.\n\nBanh Cuon (steamed rice rolls) ($8) was A-OK. There are not too many restaurants in the area that serves banh cuon made in house. Que Ling House Pho ($8) good in portion size but some of the meat not cooked properly, especially the tendon was still hard and why there was BBQ pork in my pho?!!!\n\nGlad to see that Que Ling opens in this neighbourhood. I will be back for more banh cuon!
