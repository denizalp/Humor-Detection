definitely the best dinner buffet in vegas!  i always come here everytime im in vegas.  the food is top quality and u can taste it in every bite!  only bad side is the liquor isnt included in the buffet lol.  i was there last week with my brother and his wife, after taxes it was about $50\/person.  it was worth every penny!
