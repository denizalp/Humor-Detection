I was skeptical. I like my Indian restaurants to be a little shady, usually. This place is spotless, well-lit, quick, and flavorful. Yes, it's not all that authentic, but it's certainly enthusiastic and tasty. The samosas are a bit small, but flavorful when served as samosas chaat. The paneer cheese is quite good, too. Also, the prices are reasonable.
