After purchasing a Living Social Deal back in August, we arrived to celebrate Halloween weekend and much to our dismay, they overbooked for that weekend.  It was not just us, there were about three to four other groups waiting to either find another place or have management solve the issue. \n\nI understand it is not the front desk attendant's fault since she had to clean up someone else's planning mess, but there has to be some sort of solution when a situation like this arises.  She could only tell us that a Travel Lodge had available rooms and could not guarantee that we could get our money transferred over there. She could not even contact the manager or anyone else to help resolve the issue.  \n\nWe had to relocate somewhere else and was finally able to get a room the following day.  The room was clean and decent.  Newer furniture and it was still a decent price.  It is just the hassle of finding another place to stay after a long drive.  \n\nThe customer service itself was courteous but they were not provided the resources to find a better solution for us.  Instead, us and the other people who made reservations had to go out on their own to find another place.  As an establishment, please find reasonable solutions for people and compensate them when they have already paid.  This is just a lesson for them to be more prepared and detailed when scheduling their rooms. \n\nThis is my first time staying at this hotel and the first impression was not its greatest so I find that I do not think I will be making a return stay at this place.
