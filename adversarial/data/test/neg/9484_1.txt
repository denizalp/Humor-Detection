Never liked Chili's but saw they had a new menu so.....I decided to get take-out.  Steak and salmon combo, loaded mashed potatoes. Service and atmosphere were nice.  Even had a cool game pad. 99 cents all you can play!  \n\nFood\nSalmon-very good, really liked the sauce on the fish\nLoaded mashed potatoes-  didn't taste freshly made, not a big fan of this type anyway.\nSteak-the worst.  I've never tasted steak like this, the meat was cooked to order but had zero flavor, so odd.  I had to drown it in steak sauce just for some flavor
