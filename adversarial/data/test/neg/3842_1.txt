Paid for my parking today, and two dollars in ones one dollar in quarters as I do Monday through Friday every week.. today I came out to a sticker on my windshield and a ticket asking for $25 to continue to pay to park there..  The phone number listed does not go through and they just have a PO Box I'm tempted to call the police this is bad business..
