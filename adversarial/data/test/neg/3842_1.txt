The team at Select is wonderful. When I received my car back it looked as good as it did the day I purchased it. The team did an amazing job and kept me updated with the entire process. Their excellent customer service and phenomenal work has guaranteed my future business.\nThe best part is they used all factory O.E.M. parts and paints. Bud and his team do top quality work. If you need any type of body repair work on your vehicle, Select Auto Body is the shop to choose. Thank you for your outstanding work and getting my car back to me as quickly as you did!
