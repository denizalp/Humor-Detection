The food at this steakhouse was amazing and the service was also very good. I give it 4 stars because it's located in the Palms which, maybe it was just the weekend I went, does not have the same appeal it used to. The restaurant was not very crowded and the casino outside was basically empty. So while the food was fantastic, the trip over to the Palms seemed like a waste. I probably wouldn't take the cab ride over there again.
