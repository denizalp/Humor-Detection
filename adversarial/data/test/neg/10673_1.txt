Was here last year and enjoyed the food. Thought we would try it again and it did not disappoint. Great Mediterranean food, good service and friendly atmosphere. We enjoyed it so much decided to go back again during our stay. Food cooked to perfection and they were very accommodating making sure everything met our satisfaction.
