Terrible customer service! Have had to argue with managers and cashiers regarding the advertised price on their own flyer and displayed price on several occasions. Once they concede that they were wrong they don't change the display price and correct the mistake. They seem to operate based on an \"if customers notice\" basis. Just today i saw a manager tell an employee to change the price of an already discounted item as he deemed the discount too low.... seems like a bizarre way to run a grocery store.
