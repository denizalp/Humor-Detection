This is an amazing place to visit. It's so relaxing and there are several different themed gardens to stroll through. I visited in July and loved the Japanese and Chinese Gardens. The staff truly does a wonderful job preserving these gardens. I recommend purchasing a ticket package and visit the Biodome in the morning, which is walking distance from the Botanical Gardens, with very well-marked signs along the way. Great places to bring kids as well.
