Service to uniqueness and traditional touch of the food was amazing. I would've given you 5 stars because I thought sushi was too thin. Favourite was Tai Ochazuke - LOVED IT! Would definitely return to try your frequent change of menus. Remember to book in advance on OpenTable, been there before hoping they'd take walk-ins despite seeing lotsa vacant tables but its always booked up in advance.
