This bank needs lots of help. Wife went in ahead of me so we can open an acct. (new business for them) only 1 person handles that and she needs a lesson on customer service. They all do asst branch manager walked passed us a few times knew there was an issue (person went to lunch while in the middle of starting the acct.) unreal! \n\nI'm not going to get into details because we all know what good and bad service is an this was the very poor. \n\nWent to Wells Fargo in same shopping center and what a difference! Hate giving bad reviews but I got to keep it real.
