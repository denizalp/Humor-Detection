I am absolutely in love with this restaurant. Dinner is very pricey so I always go for the lunch special which is the best deal in town. You can't beat 3 delicious courses for $23! The food is so fresh and delicious. The tomato salad is perfection and the lavraki is always so light and grilled perfectly! The Grilled Octopus is to die for and of course the Gardener cocktail is a must! I always take people here from out of town and they fall in love. Service can be slow and inattentive depending on who you get which is unfortunate but I always see past it given how amazing and fresh the food is!! This is a don't miss!!!
