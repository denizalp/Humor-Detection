I went here today for the first time with a friend of mine and was very impressed.  The lunch special was all you can eat for $14!!! Food and service was very good. Sush and chicken fried rice was excellent and chicken pad tai was pretty good..not the best I've had though. Nice environment and will be returning this weekend with my boyfriend!
