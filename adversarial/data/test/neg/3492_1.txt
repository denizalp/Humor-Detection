Wonderful way we were greeted at the front by the Manager, so welcoming. He made us feel so at home. Seated and had wonderful red and white wine. Tried the ceviche, poutine, bacon shrimp skewers, and oysters. This place is the ultimate aphrodisiac! It was filled with friends, couples and parties. Great place. I would highly recommend for a first date. Small tapas. Excellent. Well done to the owner!
