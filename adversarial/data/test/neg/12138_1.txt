There was a point when I'd probably rate this place 4 or 5 stars, but now I'm pretty set at 3.5, and here's why:\n\nCasanova is just inconsistent, with their pizza quality and their customer service. It all really depends on who is working that day. First the pizza. It's always \"good\" at the very least, but it's also been amazing. The last two pizzas I've ordered had pretty disappointing cheese, almost like they changed the kind they've been using for years. It was also much greasier than pizzas I've ordered in the past. But even those pizzas were better than most you will find in the east valley, so don't let that deter you from hitting this place up for pizza day.\n\nIt also seems like the customer service drops considerably when it's busy. Read the reviews here, Casanova is widely regarded as having the best customer service around. So when you call in an order for pickup and they're short with you on the phone, and almost act like you're inconveniencing them when you go in to pick it up, it's definitely noticeable. This has only happened twice, so they're still batting above average in the CS department. \n\nOverall, this is a great choice for pizza in the Phoenix metro area. They just set such a high precedent over the years, and due to the increased popularity (thanks to Yelp), I just hope they can maintain their quality.
