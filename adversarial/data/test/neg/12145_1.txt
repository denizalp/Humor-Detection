This was the first place my sister-in-law brought us when we got into town, and it really set the tone! Despite being crazy busy (and from what I understand, it's usually busy but not as busy as it was), the entire staff was focused and got sandwiches done as quickly as possible.\n\nI got the Phish sandwich, which is an Asiago bagel with bacon ranch cream cheese, bacon, egg, onions, pepperjack, tomato, and avocado. It was amazing. The bagel was soft, and the cheese was melted perfectly. My only complaint was that the cream cheese was right on the cusp of being overpowering, but it wasn't quite there so I was still happy with the decision.\n\nWe are already planning on going back at least once again before we leave, and it will definitely be on our list of recommendations for people in the future.
