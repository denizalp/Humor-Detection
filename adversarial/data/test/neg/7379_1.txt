I've been here twice now for drinks and a light meal. Both times the service has been lackluster. The first time, the waitress was MIA most of the evening. On my visit this weekend, the waitress spilled my glass of red wine on my boyfriend's white button-up shirt. She was very apologetic but all she did was bring him a cup of club soda and a towel. I thought they should have offered to dry clean it, or at the very least, take something off the bill. However, we got neither.\n\nThe redeeming factors are the view and the food. It's so relaxing to sit out on the patio and take in the beautiful courtyard and views of the mountains. This last visit, my boyfriend and I shared the Wright Burger and the mac and cheese. The burger, while a little pricey, was super delicious. And the side of fries were perfectly seasoned and crisp. The mac and cheese said it was \"au gratin\" style, so I pictured it coming out baked with a nice crust on top. Instead, it came out looking like a regular bowl of mac and cheese. Fortunately, it was so tasty, I didn't mind too much. It was cheesy and creamy without feeling too heavy. We also shared a chocolate dessert, and even though I'm not a big chocolate fan, I still ate more than my fair share because it was so good.\n\nFor the value, I think you are better off eating somewhere else. But for drinks and conversation, it is the perfect place.
