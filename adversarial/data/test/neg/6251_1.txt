Me and the Mrs. both love this place..  Owner is super friendly, service has always been good to us, and obviously most importantly the food is delicious.  Lots of Mexican diners every time I've been here also, always a good sign \n\nGuacamole and homemade chips are a must.\n\nLove the carnitas and tacos al pastor with pineapple\n\nChurros for dessert are fantastic \n\nBest Mexican I've had in Peel that's for sure.  \n\nHad to take a star just because I wish the portions were a bit more generous..  But that definitely isn't a deal breaker\n\nI included lots of pictures
