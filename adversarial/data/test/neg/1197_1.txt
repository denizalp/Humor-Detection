Any time my wife and I go to this South Hills Bonefish Grille we are more than pleased.  They take reservations and that works out well and their food is excellent and we've never gotten bad service there.  We rate this place very highly.   I just cannot get enough of their pecan parmesan encrusted rainbow trout; it is soooooo delicious and the bang bang shrimp as an appetizer.  Doesn't get much better than this place.\nHighly Recommend!!
