This place used to be really good but the last 2 times I went I was disappointed,not sure if they changed the kitcheb staff but the rice was burnt, griot and bananes were reallllly dry and the sauce had a weird taste. \nIm hoping this was just bad luck and that the quality will return. \n\nPS try the ginger juice its really yummy and refreshing
