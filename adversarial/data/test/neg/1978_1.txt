I eat here regularly with my work lunch pals.  One of them is Vietnamese, so we eat here twice as often as we would otherwise.  So I've tried just about every lunch entr√©e.  The pho is a good choice if you are sick, you are not starving, or you count calories.  I usually order one of the pork items when not relying on the pho.  Our Vietnamese friend orders in a language with limited phonemes and the rest of us order by the easy to use Menu ID system.  We've tried several Vietnamese places in the city and this is the best we've found.  It gets a little busy at lunch, so come early or be prepared for a little wait.
