Kenzo is a part of my regular dine out rotations:\n\nPositive:\n1) The service is very quick and friendly\n2) This is the most consistent place I have ever been. I have been here well over 15  times. The service and food is very consistent. \n3) Very tasty! The broths are quite flavorful. \n4) More than one option for vegetarians\n\nNegative:\n1) Wish they had a slightly broader menu (more options or perhaps more appetizers for sharing); Coming here frequently, I do get a bit bored after awhile\n2) Salty; I feel like I get my sodium intake for three days in one meal, however, this is the case with most ramen!
