Very tasty food and quite spicy although I was a bit disappointed in the margaritas that I heard were excellent. They don't have mild sauces here so prepare to lick the salt and have the water handy. Although they say service is not good here I haven't had a problem and found the staff to be quite friendly and prompt. Tasty tacos just order something other than a marg to accompany your meal.
