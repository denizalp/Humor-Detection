I can't believe I live next to this place and have not tried them until recently. Both visits to this restaurant far exceeded expectations. First off the decor is stunning with plush tufted classic furniture and a giant crystal chandelier... Very nice. Both times we arrived late night and were sat in the bar area which is very inviting and open. Both times we got a man with long dark shaggy hair waiting on us, I wish I caught his name because this man truly understands customer service. Polite, courteous, and attentive are just a few ways to describe the service here. The food is excellent. The pastas are mouth watering and I can't leave without getting the salmon crustinis! This place is sure to leave you with a full stomach without breaking the bank. Give them a try!
