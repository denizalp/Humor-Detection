We have been to every single Crawfish place in Vegas; I saw this new on Yelp with raving rating, had to come try! It was a Sunday night during the Memorial Day weekend, the place wasn't busy at all when we walked in. We were seated right away.\n\nCrawfish in garlic butter, 2lbs, mild:\nPerfect level of spice for me, didn't taste much garlic in there, mostly butter and spice. The crawfish sizes were decent and mostly fresh, I found a few dead ones in there.\n\nShrimps in All Together sauce, 1lb, mild:\nWe did like the taste of the sauce; however, they put way too much butter in it, which makes it a bit greasey when eating half way. \n\nFog legs, with sweet potato fries:\nThe Fog legs were so good because they were perfectly seasoned and cooked. They gave us 4 legs per order, the size of them was huge! Just the way I liked it. The sweet potato was just alright, somewhat mushy; we only ate a few and pretty much left the entire order there.\n\nService:\nWe were greeted and served by Billy. Now, we did like Billy, he was nice, friendly, talkative. However, when specifically asked if we can order the Fog Leg a-la-carte, because we didn't want to have any fries, he said no, it comes with the fries. So we said ok, just give us the sweet potato. Then when we paid, they added $2.00 extra for the sweet potato. We found that's a very bad way to trick customers paying a little bit more. Hence, 2-star off here.\n\nWe went over the HotNJuicy right across street after we left here, they were so packed even at 9pm. We ordered some more to-go and enjoyed the night at our hotel.
