Fast good food at a reasonable price. We tried a variety - rice, shrimp, beef, chicken, noodles, scallops- everything was really good. The owners are beyond nice- they smiled, made us feel welcome and provided suggestions on food. I would definitely recommend.  \nSeating is limited to about 13. There are only three tables of four.
