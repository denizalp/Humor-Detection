My company has used Craig for graphic design for years - with print material, promotional and marketing materials, design for physical product packaging, digital design, etc.  He's great to work with - timely yet thorough; always seems to know precisely what we're looking for and what we have in mind when creating designs for us; we're able to rely on him for not only fairly robust design projects, but also last-minute and immediate turnaround design projects and needs.  Our experience is it's been difficult to find a good graphic designer in Las Vegas, but we finally found one in Craig!
