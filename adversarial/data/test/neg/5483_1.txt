I really want to love this place but as far as the taste factor goes, it's just not up there! I got the cookie monster and found the ice cream to be so cold that I could barely taste the flavour! The cones are something special though - really elaborate, but very sweet and chewy (probably cause there's so many toppings that need to stay in place). I asked for a sample of the Thai iced tea flavour and I felt the same way about it. Not to mention that I waited patiently in line to ask for the sample (after already purchasing two decked out cones) and the man at the cashier reluctantly did it and said that people behind me were waiting (a total of 2 people behind me, wow...so busy). -_- \n\nNot comparable to the other great parlours in Toronto. Trust me - I LOVE ice cream. But if you're looking for something picture worthy, you're in the right spot.
