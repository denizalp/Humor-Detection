I am always hesitant to give restaurants bad reviews because many times bad reviews are just odd occurrences. La Parrilla Suiza; however, not only failed to deliver quality service, but the food was a nightmare. I ordered a water, two fish tacos, and a side of rice; a simple order for most Mexican restaurants. It took close to 45 minutes for a waitress to get me my water even after I repeatedly asked for it. My food was delivered after an hour and a half and it matched the services quality, which was horrendous. My fish tacos consisted of a cold tortilla, one fish stick per taco, lettuce, and avocados (which I asked to have removed). It was such a joke I just ate the fish sticks with my hands. The rice was the only thing that was mediocre. My meal experience was poor as was the guests around me, who routinely waited over an hour for the meals only to be presented with sub-par food. \n\nOverall the service was incredibly disorganized and poor and the food was worse than what a four year old with an EZ-bake oven could make.
