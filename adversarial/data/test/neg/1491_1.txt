Went to one of the opening events with a friend and was amazed!! As a devout carnivore, the ribeye and flank steak were straight out of my dreams. Seriously, the next time I am at that intersection and in need of steak perfection, pass on Flemings and head straight for the Fat Ox. Not to be out done, the pasta and apps were on point as well. The space is beautiful too. They also gave us a Lambrusco wine which is my new obsession. Finally, our server was so nice, he offered up to box up the bone on the ribeye for my dog!!! How nice! Great place. Cannot wait to go back!
