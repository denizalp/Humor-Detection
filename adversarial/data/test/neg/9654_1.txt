We moved in about two years ago and this place wasn't bad but it wasn't great either but it was cheap and we didn't mind the old appliances and lack of amenities. All of our neighbors were elderly people that kept to themselves and overall the complex was quiet. Then we got new management and everything started changing. Loud neighbors, domestic abuse, cops getting called all the time. Cars getting broken into, things being stolen from patios, drug deals, broken laundry machines. The list seems endless. The new management is rude and does not care about the residents. They don't fix maintenance issues, they give less than 24 hours notice before turning off the AC while it's still 80 degrees outside. They tell you to open the window but if you do all you can hear is your loud neighbors shouting profanities and racial slurs and all you can smell is weed. They removed all of the laundry machines without any notice and didn't replace them for a week. And just this weekend the entire door of a set of mailboxes was removed and all the mail is missing for over two whole buildings and the office staff does not care. There are kids constantly knocking on our door trying to give us rocks or asking for candy. No parents in sight. None of the parking spaces are close to the actual unit so taking in groceries is always a pain and getting the kids to the car is even worse. The pools are disgusting, no one picks up after their dogs, the storage units gets broken into, and the 'gym' is disgusting. The office staff is always threatening to charge us a fee for having a 'messy patio' while the only thing on the patio is oranges and leaves that fall off the trees daily. The office staff has lied to me about receiving my packages sometimes making me wait a whole day before they finally tell me they have it. The office is always closed during regular business hours. The staff leaves everyday for a 2 hour lunch and sometimes they lock the door while two of them are inside and if you knock they will open the door and literally scream in your face telling you they we're going to the bathroom and that you are being rude. This is easily the worse place I have ever lived in my entire life.
