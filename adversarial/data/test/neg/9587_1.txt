I love coming here! Been coming to this place for a few years now. I've brought several family members as well. The deciding factor was several years ago, my mom was having some medical issues. She went to the hospital, but they didn't really see anything wrong. Dr. Maloney took a look at my mom's eyes and instantly knew what was going on. She was able to confirm symptoms my mom was having without her my mom having to say. I just recently went in, and the Dr asked how my mom was doing. That gave me the warm fuzzies. Customer service is always amazing, and they give great cash discounts.
