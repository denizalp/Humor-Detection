We had dinner at Annona during Summerlicious with a group of friends. $45\/ person. The ceviche was great but small. I had the vegetable and leaf salad which was delicious. My husband got the halibut which I thought was slightly bland. I got the rib eye steak which was perfectly cooked with a side of potatoes both delicious. The dessert lacked a punch. The citrus sensation was way to citrusy! The sorbet was just ok but came with fruit which I liked. The chocolate mousse left me wanting for more. \nThe ambiance was nice and the food was alright. I didnt get what the hype is about this place and why it is so expensive. You could cook yourself a similar meal.
