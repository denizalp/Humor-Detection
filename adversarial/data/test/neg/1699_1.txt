This park has 9+ miles of hiking trails, a dog park and a several community park outdoor areas.  There really is something for everyone.  \nI stick to the hiking trails but this is a great place overall, probably the best park I've ever been too, simply because it has such variety.  \nI can't say how much I love these trails.  They are awesome.  I don't mountain bike, but there are lots of mountain biking courses too.
