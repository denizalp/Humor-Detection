My 12 year old son goes to MLFCT once a week for Occupational Therapy. He has a seizure disorder and developmental delays. I drive all the way from Boulder City because it is worth the drive.  Kerri is really good with my son and understands his struggles. Working with Kerri, my son is slowly coming out of his shell and learning new skills that can help him in everyday life. I see the other therapists and how they interact with the children. They are very caring and the kids seem to really like them. A place like this is definately needed in Las Vegas and I'm so thankful that they are open everyday.
