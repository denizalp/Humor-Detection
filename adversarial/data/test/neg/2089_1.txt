I love this place! \n\nI've been to Green about five times since I've first had it in April. For all of you vegans or vegetarians who cook a lot of your meals at home, this place is a satisfying getaway from the kitchen. I wouldn't eat here every day of the week because I love preparing my meals and saving money, but Green is a lovely treat!\n\nAs for customer service, I have no complaints! The employees are welcoming and always deliver your food within 10 minutes of ordering. \n\nI recommend the Singapore Orange bowl with mock chicken and brown rice. It's delicious! Treat yourself to an almond milkshake for dessert. \n\nYou'll leave full and happy :)
