SO good!!! I ordered a dish with medium heat, which at most places is almost no spice (3-4 out of 10), and I'll add chili sauce myself to get it how I like it, the medium here was more of a 7-8! My boyfriend got the yellow curry Hot, SO yummy! VERY spicy and absolutely the best curry flavor I've had at a restaurant! We also got pot stickers and veggie egg rolls, the egg rolls were nothing special but they were good! The pot stickers had great flavor but were definitely overcooked on the outside. I can't wait to try more dishes here!
