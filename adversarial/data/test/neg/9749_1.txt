Great food....not so great service. Arrived at 11:55 and we're seated promptly. Waited forever for everything else as did the ladies next to us.  Waitresses wouldn't even make eye contact us \nwe had to speak up to get their attention on multiple occasions.\n\nYes - I'll return again since the food was so good and affordable....
