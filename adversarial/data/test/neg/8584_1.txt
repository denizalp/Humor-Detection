Here are my ratings!\n\nFor Sunday's Champagne Brunch.\n\nEXPECT: Average size buffet, family oriented, easy access foods, and bar. \nSERVICE: 2\nCLEANLINESS: 4\nQUALITY OF FOOD: 2\nQUALITY OF DRINKS: 3\nAMBIANCE: Relaxed, family oriented.\nOVERALL: Bad service, not just from our waiter but all the others as well. The food isn't good especially for the price. Bottomless champagne and mimosas (the only good things). \nTIP: I wouldn't recommend.
