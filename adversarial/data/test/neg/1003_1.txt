I have been a customer at this salon for a few years now. I must say the work is excellent. I have never had a bad experience with work or service until my most recent visit. I waited awhile before posting this just to make sure I wasn't over reacting. I was in the salon last week and once again got excellent work but this time my nail tech was extremely rude. Her initial comments to me were that my hands were oily. Her body language suggested they were gross.  I had put lotion on prior to coming into the salon. She then proceeded to speak to an older lady in another language and I must say you don't have to speak the language to know when someone is talking about you. I'm pretty sure she called me an idiot! She kept pointing to the bobble head turtle at her station and mocking it. Both of them were laughing uncontrollably!!! She did not make eye contact with me but make a few more negative comments to me while she was doing my nails. Then at check out tried to charge me for a full set of gel nails instead of for the fill-in. When I questioned her, she got snappy. Another girl that worked there came up and corrected her. I won't be going back there!!! A suggestion to management, you may want to ask your workers to speak English, even when talking to each other, so this doesn't happen again. It's rude to speak another language in front of customers who can't understand you. If the conversation is positive there should not be a problem with this.
