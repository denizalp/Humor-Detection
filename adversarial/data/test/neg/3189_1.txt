I used to come here at least once a month...but boy...this morning will the last time I came here. Word cannot express how much my stomach hurts after having breakfast here this morning. I ordered a 4 items meal which includes eggs, fruits, 1\/2 waffles and 2 sausages. The eggs and sausages were super greasy...but I ate it. I wouldn't be writing this right Now if my stomach isn't in a tremendous amount of pain. No way I'll come back here again.
