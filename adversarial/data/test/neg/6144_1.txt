I used to love going to Trader Joe's.  The food was always fresh.  I loved their ready to cook meals like pork chops with apple dressing inside.  But since Fresh and Easy opened not far away, I think that their business has dropped off.  With less business, they don't seem to have the ready to cook meals done in the variety that they used to.  I tried to continue to support them as a business, but honestly, I would rather go to Fresh and Easy.
