Came here for lunch and had the oyster po'boy as the only thing I like more than oysters are oysters that are deep-fried. Perhaps this was my mistake as I haven't seen it on any of the reviews and it was pretty low on the price scale ($12) but it was a huge disappointment. \"Po'boy\" brings to mind an abundance of fried seafood on a bun. I understand Swan is an upscale-type diner but what arrived were 3-4 oysters on a bun that were bland and basically non-existent. I'll echo other reviews that say the service was subpar as well. Basically, there's a ton of great restaurants in 2 block radius and I wouldn't bother with Swan again.
