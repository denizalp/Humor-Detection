Dirty dirty dirty. The food was cold... I mentioned to the staff, how dirty the tables, floors and countertops ... they rather be in the back sitting on their phones instead of making sure the place is clean and sanitized. There was food under every table, and on the seating, but when the man came to clean the area he brought paper towel and stopped as soon as we left, he made sure to watch us drive off, very strange. Thanks for the food poisoning.
