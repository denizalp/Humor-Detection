This restaurant is unique.  You enter into a little non-descript building perched in the middle of an asphalt parking lot.  Down the stairs you enter into the bar and then dining room.  \nWe went to celebrate a college graduation.  The food was delicious, and the wine great too with generous pours.\nI had the grilled scallops which were perfect, light and tender, not chewy at all.  Salad was flavorful too.  My only issue with the dinner was the huge amount of baby carrots on the plate.  They tasted fine, but there were way too many and they looked like they had been poured out of a packaged bag from the grocery store.  They weren't trimmed or cut.  Everyone had mounds of carrots on their plates.  (I'm guessing that this is not their normal style.)\nThe graduate had the lobster stuffed with shrimp and scallops to celebrate and she demolished it.  Another in our party had the halibut which he called delicious.  And another had saut√©ed scallops.  (I believe they were in a butter and shery sauce.)  \nThe service was excellent.  \nWe really had a nice time and would highly recommend this restaurant, both for the food and for the experience.
