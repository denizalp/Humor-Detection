I just moved here from CA, and had less space than I had imagined for my storage. I searched for storage companies and I came across Closetbox Storage.  Called them, they came out on time, took my boxes very gently, and now I don't have to worry about the precious items stored in the boxes!!!  Love this service.  I am a senior and physically cannot do what I used to do as far as lifting and moving.  So this was the perfect solution for me.  The monthly payment is so much less costly than having an additional bedroom...and I don't have to clean the storage unit!!! Great customer service...
