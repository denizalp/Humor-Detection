Just loved their croissants. I would go back just for that! Incredibly crispy on the outer shell with really nice buttery flaky layers in the inside. Every other croissant since then seemed dull and grey. I stopped eating them out of fear I might get depressed if I continued. Perhaps I'm being a bit melodramatic but it really was that good. Oh how I miss it so!
