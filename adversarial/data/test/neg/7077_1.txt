I've been going to Pink Cherry for about a year now and they are consistently the same: amazing! The staff is so friendly and considerate. I won't go to anywhere else but to Shaina, she is such a hard worker and has truly built a great business and her staff certainly emulates her positivity as well. Check them out!
