We have been coming to Arrowhead Children's Dentistry for 4 years and every time they make my son feel at ease. He loves coming to see Dr Jane and especially loves the little gift he gets to pick from the toy box after his check up. The staff is friendly and we are always taken back promptly which I appreciate.
