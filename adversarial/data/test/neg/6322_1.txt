Great jewelry, great gift ideas, great staff and great store. I don't go into this store very often just because I'm rarely in that area, but it's definitely one of those cute stores that I am a sucker for.\n\nCome here for unique, locally-made clothes, bags and accessories, or even some of the mass-produced trinkets that you can easily grab at Urban Outfitters (Miso Pretty, other stuff like that). \n\nIt's only overpriced if you would rather buy a cheap crappy shirt from American Eagle that every person in North America will be wearing for the rest of the year. Buy local stuff, look unique, and spend a couple extra bucks.
