I have been frequenting The Well, and my regular RMT Leslie Vasquez, for nearly two years now. I was originally referred to The Well by my coworkers (we work at a hotel\/restaurant nearby). \n\nI find Leslie to be professional and courteous. She is very intuitive, and can always tell if I'm in the mood to chat or stay quiet, or if I need a relaxing massage versus some intense work to sort out my muscles. \n\nI find the online booking system to be incredibly convenient, and I plan to continue frequenting this establishment for the foreseeable future!
