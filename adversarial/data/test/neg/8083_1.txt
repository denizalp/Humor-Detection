Lets start with the positive as there was a lot.  This is a cute Italian BYOB in a great location on Brookline Boulevard. It is a welcome addition to the neighbor after the closing of the previous Italian restaurant that located this store front.  We made reservations for a Saturday night and were greeted warmly by the owners when we arrived as they were just cleaning up from a large party. The menu is not huge but enough items that everyone will be able to find something.  The prices are very reasonable with entrees from $8-$9 and specials which include a salad from  $13-$14. Our wine bottles were quickly opened and the service the entire night was fantastic.  I love a small local place where you get to meet the owners.  We started off ordering the cheesy garlic bread as an appetizer. It was delicious but I was a little put off by the paper plates it was served on.  Also the napkins were what you would buy at Target and have in your own home.  Anyway once I got over that our orders came out quickly. I went with the spaghetti and 2 meatballs which you also could have gotten with penne. Honestly it was not fantastic and a mediocre pasta dish-the sauce was a bit watery.  My fianc√© ordered one of the casseroles and I was expecting something similar to lasagna. Instead it was a bowl of your choice of noodles and meat with a ton of cheese melted on top.  They had way too much cheese on top which was overpowering.  Others in our party ordered a salad and lasagna which got good reviews.  The cork fee was $5 and they were nice enough to let us relax after dinner and enjoy the evening. We were not rushed out which is rare these days!  I really would like to go back and try the Sicilian pizza on the menu.  They do have take-out and another family shared a large pizza and it looked tremendous. It is hard to fine Sicilian style pizza in Pittsburgh.  The place is very small but the owner said it is very kid friendly which is a plus.
