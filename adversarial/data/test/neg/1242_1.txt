Located near Highland Creek, the restaurant is actually facing Ridge Road. This place is a little hard to find, it's in the strip mall down on the side. It's worth the effort.\nI have lunch here often. It's always a friendly place to dine. Unfortunately, they are not usually very crowded. They do a good take out business though. They have very fast service, so it's a good place to go if you are in a hurry but want to sit down for a few minutes. They have the hot mustard, sweet and sour sauce and soy sauce at the table. \n\nMy favorite thing here is the hot and sour soup; it's some of the best I've ever eaten. The hot tea is fresh and takes a while to brew... I usually end up drinking it at the end of my meal. The portions are fairly large even at lunch. Everything is clearly marked on the menu as hot if it comes that way.\n\nI unusually order the chicken or shrimp Kon Bo I think it's the best thing on the lunch menu. I do like it spicy. They cook it when you order, like most Chinese restaurants. \nRecently, I've been trying other dishes here. Fire Cracker shrimp is very good. It's even better at dinner time. At dinner, they encircle it with barely cooked broccoli, just the way I like it. The beef is always very tender in the dishes and is cut to just the right size.\n\nI don't particularly like the dishes that have breaded chicken. Some of the pieces are tough and seem to be over cooked. There is more breading than chicken. If I had to guess it's breaded ahead of time then cooked in a deep fryer and the oil is really hot. It has a good flavor just too overdone for me.
