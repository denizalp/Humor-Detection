Tim Jessop's written professionalism initially impressed me, but overall his work was sloppy, and he wasted a lot of my wallpaper, not to mention my time and money. The day he came to install, he mismatched the damask type patterned wallpaper, which I should have taken as a clue he was an overpriced amateur. \n\nThe following week he returned with more wallpaper (he did cover the cost of replacing a roll), but installed it so shoddily I'm embarrassed to admit how much I paid him. He pointed out some flaws with the paper that would have prevented perfect alignment, but his installation only exacerbated those flaws. He mentioned \"a professional cuts the paper in the corners\" (I think he meant to say \"he cuts corners\"), and explained there would be a slight overlap and mismatch in the corners, otherwise there would a gap when the wallpaper dried. Fine. I expected maybe a millimetre or two of overlap, not 3\/4 of an inch. Furthermore, he insisted I would need one more roll in addition to replacing the one he ruined on that first day, and cut through all the rolls I had, but left more than one roll as waste which isn't really usable for another project. I'm speculating here but since it was clear the extra roll was not needed I suspect he insisted on it since his wife is an interior designer and could collect the commission. This is total speculation on my part, but I can't think of any other reason he would insist I wouldn't have enough paper when that clearly wasn't the case. \n\nHis clean up was pathetic--I found two utility knife shards on the floor (I'm thankful I found them before I brought my dog back home that day), and glue dripped on the hardwood. To add insult to injury he insisted I pay $150 more than his original quote saying he had a hard time calculating the measurements (even though I had given him photos of every angle of the room, measurements, and a copy of the floor plan), and when I tried to negotiate the increase in fee, he said it was only fair because he'd covered the cost of the air freight to order the extra paper (the air freight for the paper to replace the one he ruined, and the one he insisted I needed, but ended up just cutting into useless strips). I regret it now, but at the time I just wanted him out of my home and so paid him the extra money. He also tacked on GST but didn't give me an actual invoice which made me wonder whether he has a GST number.\n\nDo not make the mistake of hiring this man--he is exactly the kind of \"contractor\" that gives contractors a bad name. It's a shame really, because I know there are some fantastic contractors out there, but it's people like Tim Jessop who make me reluctant to hire them.
