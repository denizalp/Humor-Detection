This is the worst branch of the worst bank I have ever dealt with. This is a chronic problem I have dealt with for over 10 years. There has never been a pleasant, efficient transaction....and I am sure there never will be. Staff the branch according to foot traffic or just freakin' close it already! Do you READ any of these comments? Do you care? Nope. I do LOVE when you are finished treating me like a criminal, you ask if I would like to open an account......LMFAO!!!
