What is the point of scheduling a service appointment when they don't even get your vehicle to a technician within a reasonable time allotment? Went in at 8:30am, was told it should take a couple hours. Called at 2:30pm for a status update, truck hasn't been touched. Then I was told they might not get to it until tomorrow.\n\nScrew this! I drove 90 minutes into town and was stuck in Vegas all day. What an absolute waste of my time!
