I have an extended warranty that covers a number of problems and services including oil changes. MPP is my warranty company and it seems like no one in the service department knows how to apply this contract and when questioned always pass the blame to someone or something which is out of there hands. Really!!!!! There is an 800 number you call for verification and that's all. I purchased my truck at Cambleback Toyota and now find out through the advisors at Right Toyota that this is not there product it's Cambleback Toyota . Now I understand (lol )Worst customer service and follow through I have ever experienced in my life! Service department is so unprofessional and this is not the first run in I have had with this group of service advisors and there supervisor! I have been having my truck serviced at RIGHT TOYOTA for over a year now and nothing has changed. I am writing this review to alert the public to be aware of this service department and do your homework. Look at all the complaints on all the reviews before you make your decision! Thank you llsj by the way my warranty is accepted through out the United States at all participating Toyota dealerships. Your treated like a bother not a valued customer !!!!! I'll drive 30 miles out of my way and return to Cambleback Toyota AWESOME service and they are always consistent. Customer Service begans at the top.
