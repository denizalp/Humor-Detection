I was excited when I found a doctor with Lyme Disease experience and who took my insurance.  Unfortunately, her outrageous charges prevented me from even booking an appointment.  Before you can be seen for an initial visit, you have to pay a new patient fee and a quarterly fee.  I think it was around $600, and your insurance won't pay for it.  That is ridiculous.  If you start out charging that, I can't imagine what fees you will pay if she becomes your doctor.  No thanks.
