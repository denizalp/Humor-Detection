I find the Cheesecake Factory to be one of the more tolerable chains.  This time around I ordered the fish tacos and he ordered the chicken and shrimp jumbalaya.  I've had better fish tacos, I've had worse.  These fish tacos were somewhere in between.  Neither dish knocked my socks off.  I guess it was good enough and the price is right given the sheer quantity of food that you are given.  \n\nThe bread is always warm and soft and I have no issues with the service.  We came around 8pm on a week night and didn't have to wait.  \n\nI think the Cheesecake factory is a reasonable choice to go eat if you with a group of friends just because the variety on the menu, the nice ambiance and they are relatively inexpensive. (Most entrees around $11-16).
