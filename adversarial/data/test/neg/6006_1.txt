Thank you, Kristin S, for inviting me along to happy hour at Maizie's (4-6 on weekdays). I met her, Melissa H, and Melissa H (no, that's not a typo--there are two Melissa Hs active on Phoenix Yelp!) there on a cool Thursday evening. I'm not sure what I expected from Maizie's (from the website, it looked more like a Cheuvront), but I was certainly pleased with what it ended up being: a comfortable spot to relax and unwind with friends. Less like a wine bar, more like a neighborhood bistro. \n\nThe decor is simple and cozy with stained concrete floors, light wood tables, some curved leather seating, and an impressive modern wine rack. We ended up sitting at a corner table (with a nice view of Central Avenue). Our server was really friendly, although maybe a little overly attentive. He asked if we were doing OK probably ever four or five minutes or so! At least if I return, I can be guaranteed to get what I need when I need it!\n\nI actually had my kickboxing class later that night, so I decided not have any wine (a big deal for me if you know me at all!), but I was pleased to find that they offered sugar free Red Bull and ordered one of those. My happy hour companions got wine by the glass, which was $2 off. We also split 3 appetizers (all 50% off during happy hour): tortilla chips with black bean salsa and guacamole, the spinach artichoke dip, and the pesto bruschetta. I found the pesto sauce on the bruschetta to be overly salty and the salsa a little bland, but the spinach artichoke dip was really good and satisfying on a cooler night. \n\nI have a feeling that I wouldn't enjoy Maizie's for a full dinner, since the  food I tried was a bit typical and not particularly inventive. That being said, though, it's an excellent spot for a satisfying happy hour, and I wouldn't hesitate for a second to order appetizers and drinks here at discounted prices. I could also see my husband and I lingering here past happy hour enjoying a bottle of wine and some dessert. \n\nAs a side note, be sure to check out the Events section of their website: http:\/\/maiziescafe.com\/events.htm. It looks like they have some fun stuff going on, including the upcoming prix fixe New Year's Eve dinner and \"Travel to Italy\" Tuesdays in December. It also seems that you can purchase wine and beer to go at discounted prices, which would be nice if you live close by and want to pick something up for a night at home.
