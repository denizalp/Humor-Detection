A family member recommended this hotel and we are glad we booked.  We stayed during a night stop over on our Thanksgiving roadtrip from NYC to STL. \n\nThe hotel was very affordable and we got what we paid for. Room was clean, if dated, comfortable and the location perfect. Parking was onsite and free. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The views in the neighborhood were fantastic and the area offered lots of good local eats and drinks. \n\nA great place to stay on a quick trip through the city.
