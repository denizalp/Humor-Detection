Never had been to fired pie before. Counter help were extremely helpful and courteous in explaining how things work. \nWe were impressed with the quality of the salad and pizza. \nOne big suggestion if you're having a salad ask for your pizza order to be held until you finish your salad, as it only takes 3 minutes to cook a pizza here. \nLooking forward to going back.
