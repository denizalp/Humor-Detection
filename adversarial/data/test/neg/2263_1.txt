I went here for a beer and food pairing event hosted by Dogfish Head Brewing.  The meal was ok, the service was very good.  I don't know what a normal dinner here would be like, but I am pretty sure some of the appetizers we were served could easily be purchased at Costco and the various courses were not nearly as good as I had expected.  I don't know if they were unable to deliver great food due to the menu of this event or what, but I don't think I would ever go back.
