She is easily the most talented singer\/dancer\nin show biz, but this is not a relaxing show. \nThe music is WAY too loud, totally unnecessary.\nRemarkable staging, costuming and \nchoreography. Some very sexy stuff, not for\nprudes. For a woman her age. 49, she's amazing,\nbut again, seriously,  take earplugs - the noise level was almost unbearable.
