Great sandwiches, huge menu!  The bacon on the Club Sub is tasty.  Fries are fresh cut and rustic.  But the real star is the beer selection.  Although I'm not a beer drinker so I don't really seek them out, I haven't seen a longer bar with as many beers on tap in this town.  \n\nI'll be back for the food and look forward to spreading the word that there's a new awesome sports bar in town.  And I can't remember the last time I wrote that out loud!
