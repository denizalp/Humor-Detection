I'd rather eat in a local place and Mimi's is, after all, a chain. Yet they really try to please with their menu and service is usually good. I sat at the counter on my last visit to the location at 75th Ave\/ Bell Rd on a Sunday. It was a madhouse in there, but my waitress was a top notch juggler and kept me and the whole counter happy.
