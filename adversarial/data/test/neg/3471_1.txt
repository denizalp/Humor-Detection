Vacation Nightmare, worst customer service phone call I got.\n\nI traveled with Air Transat to Europe before. The price is cheap and service was good. However, when I tried to book my vacation this year, I chose Air Transat vacation over Air Canada because it was cheaper. However, the service I got from Air Transat was so much worse than Air Canada.\nWhen I book the vacation package, on the website, it says \"Only 2 Room left at this price\", so I booked my vacation immediately. However the label on the website is a completely LIE! Do not believe it when you saw the label. After I book the vacation and came back in 2 weeks, it supposes to be at most 1 room left since I booked the one of last 2 rooms, however, on the website, it still says \"Only 2 Room left at this price\". That label is pure static.\nI want to cancel my vacation since I decide to go with Air Canada Vacation instead (better service and better deal). I put down my deposit of $310 for 2 people. However, the cancellation fee is $250 per person, which is $500 in total. If I just left my deposit where it is, i pay less money.\nHowever, I think Air Transat sold my info to those third-party debt collector company and I got the RUDEST customer service phone call ever. The lady on the phone was so bad. I told her I was not going to go and I don't want to cancel because the cancellation fee was higher than than the deposit. However, the lady was like \"I don't care. Call the phone number in the email we sent to you.\" (Not exact words, but something like that.) So I hang up.\nTip: try to avoid Air Transat vacation as much as possible. Air Canada and West Jet has better service.
