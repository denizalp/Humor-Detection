Right when you enter the restaurant you will be cheerfully welcomed by a lady who by far is the most heart warming hostess I've ever met. You couldn't ask for a better one! \n\nAs for food I ordered the sushi boat and a Korean raw crab dish. For the sushi meal it was introduced by a couple of fried tofu with a sweet sauce along with miso soup as it should. Both tasted very good and left a warm and happy taste to my tongue. For the sushi it was nothing out of the ordinary and I had no complaint.\n\nRAW CRAB DISH: it was introduced with korean side dishes such as: kimchi, bean sprouts, potato, radish... which all tasted formidable. As for the raw crab I was kinda disappointed as it seems to have been previously frozen. Taste was okay but had a lot of meat so I was satisfied.\n\nOverall, exceptional service, food taste just over okay.
