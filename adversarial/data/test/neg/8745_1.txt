Maybe they got off to a rocky start, but their service is now great, sparkly dishes, and nice linen napkins. we are a fan of their food--particularly the rice bowl which is enough for two adults to share. The sizzling tandoori chicken is super and was presented truly sizzling on a wooden platter. A great addition to the neighborhood.
