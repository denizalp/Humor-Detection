Have loved this restaurant since the first time I ever ate here. I own a salon in the area and can say that Il Bosco is responsible for feeding us multiple days out of the week. Love the changing specials and charm of the quaint atmosphere. Staff is friendly and accommodating, but not overly intrusive. Love the caprese panini and the biaggo pizza! All the food is extremely fresh and always tasty.
