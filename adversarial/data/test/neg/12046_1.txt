SO-SO buffet, kind of expensive for the quality of food served here.  Only memorable dish was this made to order potato dish where you can put bacon, mushrooms and other things to be grilled....mmmm yum But other than that the prime rib was pretty flavorless...OH the crab legs were pretty good but the SHRIMP was not even peeled...damn...oh but wait, they had really good mac and cheese and some decent ribs.. Shit i'm starting to like to place...no WAIT, it was too expensive.  3 STARS
