Originally I was quite disappointed when we could not obtain reservations for Joe Beef.  The wait is over several weeks, so I thought I was set telling for the restaurant next door, was I ever wrong.\n\nI was completely floored by the experience at Liverpool House, it was outstanding.  The raw bar was the very best I have ever experienced, giving me an opportunity to enjoy Sea Urchin for the very first time, and it was amazing.\n\nThe menu is varied and eclectic with Old French favorites like Confit to some of the best seafood and steaks in Montreal.  Our waiter put together a special tasting just for us and it was sublime.  He also paired our wines from one of the most extensive lists I have ever seen.\n\nThis spot is truly a gem in Montreal, I highly recommend.
