Sadly, Pho Da Nang in the Rio Las Vegas has really taken a nosedive downhill in quality over the past year.  I ate there twice this past weekend (and ate there several times a year ago as well).  The Pho Ga (chicken pho) was borderline awful.  The quality of the meat, the chicken, was really bad.  I don't remember this being the case a year ago.  The chicken was rubbery, seemed not very fresh, and tasted terrible.  So I decided to give Pho Da Nang one more try another night and ordered the \"Terriyaki Chicken Bowl\", which, as it turns out isn't even a \"bowl\" at all.  It is a \"plate\" with a dumping of rice, a side of broccoli and the same terrible chicken chopped into strips.  The chicken was NOT fresh grilled.  It was frozen, sodium-infused, reheated breast meat complete with the fake grill marks you see at cheap fast food joints.  Very disappointing they would stoop to this poor quality level of chicken.  I couldn't even eat it all it as the chicken was such a sodium bomb, rubbery texture, and ridiculous fake \"grill\" marks.  I guess they tried to hide this by smothering it with way too much teriyaki sauce.  At least the rice and broccoli was decent.  Overall really disappointed and hope Pho Da Nang decides to ramp back up the quality level of their provisions to upscale restaurant grade.
