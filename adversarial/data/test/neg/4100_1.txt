Amazing!! What a gold mine! They have everything when it comes to sandwiches, paninis, wraps and soooo much more! They have Greek inspiration, with pita pizzas, hummus and veggies, Brushetta. It literally took me 20 minutes to choose, and I know what I'm getting next time! Pictured is a Cranberry walnut chicken wrap- AMAZING!! & the Chicken Avocado panini- so good! Even the macaroni salad is homemade and light. We seriously can't wait to be back.
