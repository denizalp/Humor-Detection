By far the worst experience ever!!! We waited in line after our flight for about an hour and 20 minutes. Our flight was 45min! After the main line, we waited another 15min to get a car in the garage. It was disgusting! There was only 4 reps covering the counter. At least have more people if you are advertising lower prices than your competitors. Will never rent from Advantage again! I WISH i read the yelp reviews before we booked. I think it's comical that the responses from Advantage include \"customer satisfaction\" is their primary concern. Laughable! No one in the almost 2 hours duration I spent with advantage was happy with their experience
