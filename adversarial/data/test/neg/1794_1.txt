I have purchased quite a few items from this store. I have gotten to know some of the staff and management if not by name by site. They always treat me well and offer excellent customer service. If you visit the store and go to the gun counter ask for Heath, Clay or Sam. These are my go to guys, however all the staff I have encountered at the gun counter are excellent and knowledgeable.
