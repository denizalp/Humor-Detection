Double Charged me and had to call twice and they haven't fixed!!! IT HAS BEEN A OVER A MONTH!!!\n\nStayed at Starwood Hotels for 250+ nights. Never wrote bad review.\nStayed at this hotel and the hotel charged me 3X!! there was one reversed charge. In essence they double charged me.\nI've called back twice and each time they promise to look into it. NO FOLLOW-UP.\nI've even sent them a picture of my card bill. \"We don't have record of these charges\" they say. No one seems to care.\nStarwood should investigate them. No one seems to care.
