Barb and her staff are absolutely wonderful!!! They will go above and beyond to make sure I have a good experience. Whether it is for work, or personal use, I call this location, and they are always happy to help. Barb always remembers me and the types of cars I like, even after I had only been there just a few times! Whenever we have family in town, or are going away for a long weekend and need a car, we only use this Avis.  \n\nI have never had an issue using my debit card at this location! As Chris G said, you just need to have the funds available, which is standard anywhere you go. I will say that they do a great job in making sure you are aware of all of your options, and make everything very easy!
