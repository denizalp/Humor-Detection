Dr. Cellers and his colleague are the most compassionate vets I have ever met. I will never go to another office again. I feel complete comfort when I take my pets to desert hills because I know they are in great hands.  the front desk ladies and assistants are incredible, they really bring the place sunshine even when you are going through a hard time. the world would be a better place if everyone was as caring as desert hills staff is.
