I have a unique name - Starbucks and other coffee shops get it wrong even after I say \"v as in Victor - e - n - i\". There was a time I came to this Starbucks basically every other day. Gina remembers me each time and already has my name down before I can figure out what I can order. The little things like that mean a lot to me. Lines are normally long during lunch but the wait is not. They always get my order right which is a plus too :) The parking lot fills up quickly so sometimes I have to park at the end closest to the Starbucks building in the pick n save parking lot when I'm just trying to make a 5 minute trip.
