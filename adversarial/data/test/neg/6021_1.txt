Slow service, small portions. Ordered chicken on the rocks and it was dry with little sauce. Asked the male teenage looking server politely to add more sauce and he replied with telling me I had to pay an extra 20 dollars with a serious face. Smh. I then had to remind them that I ordered my meal with extra chicken and he replied that another 20 dollars needed to be paid. Maybe funny the first time, but the second time was not appreciated, no time for fun and games when the order was almost completely wrong. Never going back to this location. I'll stick to Lazeez, thanks.
