Been to Maxwell's several times in the past 10 months, we always leave full and satisfied.\nOur recent trip was no different. Was a Tuesday night around 7:30 or so. \nThe hostess was friendly and helped to clear a table for us to sit. \nService was superb and attentive with a sense of humor as well. \nI ordered the Black and Bleu burger, med well w\/ fries. My daughter had the BLT, the wife had the Asian Salad and a Mojito to drink.\nSide note: as the Mojito was being delivered by the waitress, the bartender stopped her, asked for it back and made another. He must not have been happy with something which scored high in my book showing quality and attention to his trade.\nMy Burger was cooked to perfection, bun was toasted and crispy. I initially thought there was not enough \"Bleu\" on the burger and almost asked for more but decided to put it together and just try it first....perfect! Note to Chef: don't change a thing.\nOne critique on the BLT: cut the lettuce up a little, my daughter had a tough time with it as it wanted to pull out with each bite.\nThe Asian salad was excellent. \nFunny thing, we almost went to City Tavern down the street to give them another shot, as we had a not so good experience there a few months ago. But, I decided to read some recent reviews first. Heads up.....Just go to Maxwell's and have a great meal and enjoyable experience.......every time.\nConsistency is a good word to describe this place.
