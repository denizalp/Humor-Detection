Good, wholesome, simple Comfort Food. \n\nI've been coming here for a few years. It's the \"spot\" for my brother and I. \nChicken Fried steak is so big it's folded over on the plate and smothered in gravy. Fried Pork Chops, smothered in gravy are delicious. Ribeye, decent cut of steak for $16. \nGet Coleslaw as your salad and biscuits on the table. Washing it down with Texas' own Shiner Black lager... \nit's a meal fit for a King!
