Great Service, Great Food, Excessive Price Point\n\nLet me start by complimenting the service at Hanks.  From the hostess to the server and the serving team, the service is great!  I was really impressed with everyone.  The team was super friendly, very professional, and didn't try to push us towards expensive dishes or sides.\n\nThat said, we go to restaurants for food.  While the food is very good, the price point is ridiculous.  This is my third time to Hanks, but the first time back in about seven years.  I've been to T-Bones several times, and always thought of the two places as the same restaurant (with a slight nod to T-Bones for being a bit better although I think they are about the same now).  My wife and I shared a Steakhouse Salad, which was excellent.  The restaurant split it without an upcharge, which is always nice.  The salad itself was great and I would order it again.\n\nFor dinner, I had the Wagyu 10 ounce filet ($86) and my wife had the 22 ounce rib eye ($68).  My first comment to my wife was the price.  I've eaten at Michael's, Gordon Ramsey Steak, Craftsteak, Carnevino (meh - pass on this place), Del Frisco's, Michael Mina, etc., so I think it's fair to say that I've tasted a fair amount of the steakhouses on the strip to local places (Golden Steer).  We have even eaten at Guy Savoy and Robuchon.  This was the first time I was shocked at the prices for a semi-local steakhouse.  I mean, you can get a rib eye cap from Craftsteak for $64 (or even the Wagyu skirt steak as a better deal than the Hank filet) or $66 from Gordon Ramsay steak, so seeing a simple rib eye for $68 was a shocker to me.  I don't mind paying a bit of a premium to eat at a celebrity restaurant, but I will not pay that much for a local place.  From what I remembered, the price point at T-Bones was much more reasonable and in line of an off-strip restaurant.  \n\nAs for the food, it was quite excellent.  My Wagyu filet was amazing.  For a filet, it had a fair amount of marbling and tasted phenomenal.  If I was ever going back to Hank's, which I'm not, I would order it again.  However, the rib eye kind of sucked.  It had a super umami flavor from being wet \/ dry aged, so you need to like that type of earthy flavor.  Michael's also ages its meats, but they are simply just better.  Anyway, the rib eye really lacked the fatty taste that makes a rib eye a rib eye.  If you put this rib eye against Old Homestead's rib eye, there is no comparison, Old Homestead is just better.  If you put it up against a rib eye cap, which really isn't a fair comparison, then you're better off just going to Gordon Ramsay steak and ordering it there so you can also order the sticky toffee pudding since you'll get a better steak for a better price at a fancy restaurant with an amazing dessert.  \n\nThe food is really good at Hank's, but it isn't worth the prices they are charging.  You can spend the same amount of money at a strip restaurant or spend significantly less money and just go to the Silverado Steakhouse at the South Point and get the same quality service and same quality food (albeit with much better tasting rib eye).
