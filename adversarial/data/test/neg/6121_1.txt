Came here based off the # of reviews, but found our dishes to be slightly disappointing. We had the pad sea ew with beef and the Tom kah soup, as well as 2 Thai teas. The Tom kah soup was good and something we would recommend. The pad sea ew, however, was way too salty. And when I say too salty it is no exaggeration. The restaurant booths and tables are old and show major signs of wear, but the establishment looks clean, which is what really matters! The pricing is great and very reasonable. Lastly, the staff was very friendly and sweet. Wouldn't be in a rush to come back here and overall it was an average experience
