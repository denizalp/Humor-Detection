Micro braids by Momi and some older lady. They are scammed. Went it for micro braids and we're given micro braids around the edges. They put big plats in the middle of my head. The older lady had an attitude the entire time and the work look like straight s#$. I would not recommend nor will I ever be back. I should have read the reviews before coming here, I've definelty learned my lesson.
