So my friend and I had a craving for burgers and instead of going to Five Guys, Harvey's, etc... we did some research on Yelp and found this place! Not going to lie, it's kind of in a random location, but it's definitely a hidden gem in Mississauga! \n\nTo start off, the place was decent in size, but the booths were outdated. They could definitely add more seating with the amount of empty space they had, but eh. We went on a Saturday night and it wasn't too busy. \n\nHere comes the best part.... THE FOOD! So the have quite a unique menu. They had a lot of speciality burgers and fries. I ordered the Loaded AK 47 and the Stacked Supreme and my friend ordered the Apple Butter Burger with Masala fries. Everything was absolutely amazing!! \n\nThe Loaded AK 47 had three mozzarella sticks in between two patties! It tasted incredible! If you're like me and you don't hold back on your cheat days, this is definitely the winner! The cheese oozes out of the mozzarella sticks with every bite and the patties were very juicy. The only thing I could complain is the buns. I thought the buns would be nice and toasted, but it wasn't. Seemed like they just grabbed the buns out of the bag and just threw it on there. So the bun was fluffy and broke apart easily, which I didn't like. Other than that, I would totally recommend this Burger! \n\nThe Stacked Supreme consisted of fries, tomatoes, lettuce, sour cream and one cheese burger (without the buns) cut up! It was so good! There was so much cheese and I loved it! The fries were nice and crispy and the cut up cheese burger was juicy! \n\nOverall, I would totally recommend this place to all the burger lovers out there! I'm definitely planning to go back! My favourite burger spot in Mississauga!\n\nP.S. It was cash only!
