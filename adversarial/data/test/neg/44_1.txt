I have to say the staff is fantastic at this location. I came in with my wife for a late Sunday lunch, without realizing they were just about ready to close up for the day. We were still served, without rushing, and had fresh home fries made for us. \n\nThe food is quality, as to be expected from any Eggsmart location.
