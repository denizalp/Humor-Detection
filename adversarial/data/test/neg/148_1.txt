Off the hook!!  so much fun!  we made a couple connections to bypass the line and get us through and after we had our pic taken on the red carpet on the way in i had a good feeling.  Club is very nicely done, layed out well...bars upstairs and down. I think they could move the vip area on the dance floor and have a bigger dance area but that would probably be my only critique.  Drinks are good and the DJ was AWESOME!  he kept playing one great song after the other and the crowd was really going.  My only complaint and I guess it's not about the club, I know the bouncers are just doing their jobs.  When stupid loser guys who flop down a grip of money to look cool in the vip area, don't have the bouncers grab cute girls from the crowd only to talk to them like crap and then try to discard them when you're done with them!  some frigging ass hat thought that would be a good idea...screw him!!  \nsorry for the rant!  \nGood music..lots of hot guys...good drinks...viva las vegas!!!  We will be back!
