This is my ordinary nail spot to go to. I refuse to go anywhere else because of the customer service and how well Kevin does my nails. Every time i have a picture of what i want, i show him and BAM an exact replica i swear!! My favorite nails are the coffin type nails with clear glitter on them. Kevin knows how to get those on point every single time! Ugh i love it lol His wife is such a sweetheart too! She always remembers us and always ask how we are. Adorable lol. & last but not least, waxing! Perfect brows everrrryyy timeeeee ! Love this place!! They really know how to treat everyone and thats how they get their loyal customers.
