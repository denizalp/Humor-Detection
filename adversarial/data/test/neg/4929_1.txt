Combing Caribou and Einsteins is a genius idea! I love the inside, it has a modern feel and is very clean. My friend and I were helped right away and the food tasted fresh and delicious. I got a blended coffee drink from Caribou but it was really sweet for my liking. I asked the gal up front if I could get an espresso shot added to cut down on the sweetness. She did it right away and was so friendly about the situation. It was a very pleasant experience and will definitely be returning!
