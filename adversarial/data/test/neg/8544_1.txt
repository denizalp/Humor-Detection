Let's just say my husband and I still continue to speak about the horrible night !! We went for restaurant week.. So we did the 3 course meal for a fixed price .. And the offered a wine pairing so we took advantage of it .. The wine was excellent .. We enjoyed each glass .. However.. They never brought our first course .. Came with our dinner plates and we indicated we never had our appetizers .. The waiter took our dinner plates away .. And brought our appetizers which were very good !!! Remind you this was an hour after being sat !! Luckily we had the wine to hold us over .. However .. For dinner .. I had the Beef and Lamb Pot Pie .. And I cannot say how salty it was !! Very salty .. And the two sauces just did not mix .. My husband had the pork chop and indicated it was good but nothing to brag about .. The Banana pudding with whiskey sauce was very good !! However .. All in all.. We agree we would not come back .. And after everything..  not once did a manager come by to apologize for the mix up with the appetizer and entree !!
