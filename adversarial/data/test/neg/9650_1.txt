First time here, and I was amazed at how yummy the food was. The interior looks like your everyday hakka place, so I was quick to judge. The portion sizes are large. I would say though they give a lot of vegetables with the protein dishes. Our table ordered some meat and tofu dishes and I would say about 70% was vegetables.\n\nThere's a lot of non-unique vegetarian options. It ranges from different types of tofu to different curries. They have a whole section for veggies on the menu. \n\nService wasn't terrible, wasn't the best the best either. You have to go up to them and ask for things such as if you need another glass of water. \n\nI would highly recommend the chilli chicken here. My friend who comes often says it's her go to. \n\nThis is a great place for big groups to mix and mingle with different dishes.
