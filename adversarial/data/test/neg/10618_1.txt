Kim the Dog trainer is seriously devoted to helping dog owners learn how to be better dog parents. My dog went through Puppy 1, Puppy 2 and has started Canine Good Citizen (she's 1 year & 4 months old).  She's really cares about providing the best dog trying lessons so everyone in the house can be happy and safe. \nTracy is so kind and sweet, she literally gets on the floor to smooch your dog, and is even sweeter to my daughter. She allows my daughter to come in and hold lizards, tarantulas, and other small creatures and ask a million questions while answering patiently. \nAll the staff there seem to genuinely love animals. \nThe dog food, dog treats and accessories are a little over priced in my opinion, but are inline with regular pet stores. \nAs far as advice or training, I would recommend this PetCo.
