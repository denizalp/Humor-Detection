Wanted to try this neighborhood brunch spot and popped in this weekend. It's cash only and seat yourself so don't just stand there when you walk in like we did. There's no hostess station so pick a table and sit down. Blend! We sat down next to an elderly gentleman reading the newspaper in his Steelers' Starters jacket. That's the type of brunch place this is.\n\nPrices are very reasonable: basic breakfasts (eggs, pancakes, omlettes) weren't over $6.95 and even the specials were only $8 or $9.\n\nI got the eggs benedict which is my go-to, however I didn't care for this version. Instead of hollandaise sauce, the dish comes with CHEESE sauce. Not my favorite that it came on a thin English muffin either, but our potatoes were good. (Two options: deep fried and pan fried with onions. We got both and thought the deep fried were best. Can you blame us?!)\n\nTotal bill for 2 came to $20. I'm looking forward to going back and trying some of their other breakfasts!
