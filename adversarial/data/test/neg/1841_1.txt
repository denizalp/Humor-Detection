Hands down the worst airline I've ever flown, avoid them at all costs. I fly over 100,000 per year with Southwest and love my experience every single flight. Allegiant should take notes. \n\nAllegiant's flight attendants are rude and condescending, their flights are delayed, and their seats are tiny and uncomfortable. Now they're charging for not only checked bags but also carry ons?? Oh, you want water? Better pay up. Pathetic.\n\nWe were once a loyal Allegiant flying family who, between the 4 of us, would fly over 200,000 miles with Allegiant annually. Now, fortunately we only fly with them less than 20,000 miles total per year. Our business and our money has moved elsewhere to an airline who actually cares.\n\nJust go through their ticket purchasing on their website to see how many fees are tacked on for this \"cheap fair\" airline. Disgusting. Do yourselves a favor and fly someone else.
