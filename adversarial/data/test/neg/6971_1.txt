What's not to love about this place?  Many choices for great tasting tacos, great atmosphere and hot waitresses.  I swear mine must have been a super model!!! LOL, you can tell I was impressed.  This place has a nice menu with many choices, its a little high end as far as pricing, but the quality is very good with so many combinations of tacos that you can get.  The particular visit, I had one fish taco only because I ate before, but I have been here before and the food is excellent.  If in the area, definitely give it a try.
