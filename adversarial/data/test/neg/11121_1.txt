We got the Summer of Cirque deal which was 2 tix for $100.  After taxes it came out to about $127 but that's still a great price for 2 tickets for any Vegas show.  The seats were up in the 300's but still good seats.  We could see everything just fine.  I'm not a big Beatles person so I only knew 2 or 3 of the songs plus I didn't really know the history of the Beatles so the story line was confusing.  I've been to 3 other Cirque shows and this would probably rank #3 after KA and O.
