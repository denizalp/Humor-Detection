I was here 4\/17\/2018 Tuesday evening.  My work colleague searched this one out and was only 15 minutes from our hotel in Vaughan.  This little place is a gem.  I have been to Korea numerous times and knew what I like and don't.  Great Korean food and the condiments are top notch.  Typical Korean condiments and the daikon was my favorite.  I had the seafood pancake appetizer and it was HUGE with lots of seafood including generous squid.  I had dot sot bulgogi bibimbop and my colleague had a bossam jungsik.  All great and the staff was polite and attentive.  Prices were very reasonable.  At first I thought $15CDN was a lot for a seafood pancake it was big enough to justify.  \n\nIf you go to this small place you will not be disappointed.
