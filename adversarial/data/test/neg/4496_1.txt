I almost didn't come here because there were a lot of bad Yelp reviews but, they were open late and I didn't want to go to the ER instead. The lobby was clean and nice looking and the girl behind the desk was sweet. I was seen by Dr. Peter Tretheway and his assistant Nick. The Dr. Was so very kind and compassionate but super professional. I was out in 20 minutes and had everything I needed. He was also very non judge mental about no insurance and rearranged the medication plan to best suit my situation. I would certainly return if needed.
