The pizza is much more fresh than compared to other fast-food pizza places.  I want to comment on the customer service.\n\nThey don't open until 11am on Sundays.  I wanted to get a pizza before the first football game of the day.  \n\nI called and inquired about the store hours, and the staff said they'd be happy to make my pizza early, allow me to come in early, and purchase my pizza early.  That is what has sold me as a customer.
