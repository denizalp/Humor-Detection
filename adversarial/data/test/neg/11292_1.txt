Wonderful coffee and tea, delicious foods, a comfortable atmosphere, and friendly people! It's a great spot to hang out with friends, grab a quick cup of coffee, eat lunch\/dinner alone or with friends, and\/or work on your laptop. It's hard to find an environment where you drink delicious coffee\/chai all day, eat a delicious lunch, then meet friends for a glass of wine and dinner over live music. I can't recommend Janey's enough!
