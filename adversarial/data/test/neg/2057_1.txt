I got fried platter, fish cake skewer and popcorn chicken. \n\nThe popcorn chicken does not come with any sauce, it tastes awful and greasy, nothing else. (The same is also true for the deep fried crystal noodle thing included in fried platter). Fish case skewer is soaked a salty soup base and doesn't taste good neither. \n\nThe only thing I enjoyed is the vegetable in the platter, which is crispy and spiced to the right extent.
