My coworker and I stayed here to attend a conference in NC. The facility is nice and the staff are very friendly and attentive. Included in your hotel fare, they offer a breakfast buffet which usually has eggs, potatoes, sausage\/bacon, fruits, bagels, toasts, donuts, coffee, etc. \n\nThe rooms are suite-style, which has a small kitchen, living area besides the bedroom and bathroom. They have a complimentary shuttle service that runs to the airport and anywhere within a 3 mile distance. You can ask to go to the nearest lightrail station (woodlawn) and take the lightrail to downtown.\n\nYou can also uber - though the uber drivers tend to miss the turns here (in which they have to go back and U-turn two more times before they can come back) so make sure  you tell them to look for the entrance right after La Quinta.\n\nOverall, my stay here was pleasant and relatively convenient.
