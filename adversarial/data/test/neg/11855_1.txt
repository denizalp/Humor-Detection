In all honesty, this place is decent. \n\nOur waiter, John was wonderful. I came here to celebrate my birthday while in Vegas and they treated me like the Queen that I am. It was a quiet Tuesday night at 7:50pm and they promptly seated my father and I even though our reservation wasn't until 8:15pm. My father quickly explained to John that it was my birthday and John told me Happy Birthday atleast 3x throughout the night. I throughly enjoyed the Roy's Trio which was my entree. I got my seafood at the Chef's recommendations and it was excellent. As an appetizer,I got the lobster pot stickers and it was a wonderful Asian inspired dish. I appreciated the fact that this restaurant is stand-alone and that there was ample parking space. In Vegas I feel like everything is Valet this or valet that. So it was good to differ from the norm. I enjoyed the whole experience. I even enjoyed the fact that if you're celebrating a special occasion that offer a free picture printed right away.  Overall, I enjoyed myself and I would come back. \n\nIt is good to note that on Mondays they have an excellent pre-fix special. Do it if you can!
