Great little record store.  The staff is very nice and know way more than I about music.  It's not a huge place, but they have some really neat stuff I didn't find anywhere else in the valley.  They actually have a pretty large parking lot considering their placement downtown so that is always a plus.  They have a a pretty good selection of new vinyl, not that much in the way of used.
