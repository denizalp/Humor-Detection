Quite possibly the best dining experience I have ever had. The service was courteous and prompt. The dining room is located in a repurposed alley way in old Montreal and absolutely gorgeous as all of the restaurant is located outside save for the kitchen. No need to worry in the rain because they have a canopy which protects all the diners from the elements. They have a varied and exceptional drink menu I had a martini that was made with orange peel gin and champagne and was incredible. We started with an order of the nachos which were absolutely delicious, the fresh made salsa included cranberries and were a delicious compliment. Next I had one of their dinner crepes which had chicken and was delicious, well seasoned and well portioned. The meal ended with a cheese cake and was divine! Definitely check this place out. Lastly they had a live jazz band that really set the mood for this wonderful meal.
