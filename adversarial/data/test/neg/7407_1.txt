I just had the most wonderful morning with Erica at Organic Massage Cleveland. What can I say. The place is magical! The barn felt like an escape, from the moment you walk in (and the sound and smell of a crackling fire) to the relaxing atmosphere she has created, it truly is a hidden gem. My massage was SO relaxing, and just what I needed. I can promise you, once you go here, you will never look at another massage place the same. This was a relaxation for my body & soul. I will be back, and I can't wait.
