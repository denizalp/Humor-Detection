I've been so pleased when I've eaten here.  They food is prepared so well and seems fresh.  I love the waitstaff attire.  It really makes me feel like I have my own personal chef coming to the table.  The servers we have had are always professional & courteous & they & the kitchen are most gracious in altering to our tastes.  They even allowed me to order a favorite dinner entree that wasn't on the lunch menu.  I normally don't care for open kitchens, but even being seated at the nearest table to the kitchen it is unobstrusive!  I usually like booth seating, but really the center tables are the best ones & especially if you want to see and be seen.  The decor is very relaxing which I enjoy.  I also enjoy that the diners that come in for the most part seem to enjoy maintaining the intimate feel of the restaurant and are not overly loud (or don't feel the need to be since the noise level of the restaurant itself is fairly calm)
