I've been wanting to see what all the hype about this place is for quite some time, but I am firmly against waiting for multiple hours to eat at a restaurant.  Now that this location exists and I don't have to venture to downtown PHX to eat there, we decided a visit was in order.  I was skeptical about PB's amazingness before eating here, so my expectations really weren't that high.  \n\nWe ordered the Wiseguy pizza and added mushrooms. The real star of the pie was the mushroom and also the fennel sausage.  It comes in slices instead of chunks on the pizza.  The wiseguy is a \"white pizza\" which normally doesn't thrill me, but I actually didn't miss the tomato sauce.  Would I go out of my  \nfor PB pizza?  Nope.  It was good, but nothing so special that I would absolutely have to have it again.  \n\nThe service at this location was good.  Our iced tea was constantly being filled and the server left us alone when we were deep in conversation. \n\nThe main reason that I just can't give PB another star is the sheer lack of variety on the menu.  We went to lunch, where there were 3 options for salads and two of the options really weren't salads at all.  There are only a few pasta options and a few pizza options.  My hubby wasn't all that thrilled with what he had to choose from.  Yelp doesn't believe in half stars, but if they did, I'd give PB 3.5 stars.  (sorry, I don't usually round up).
