The beckoning smells from the Thai house have made me want to try this place out for years. A few coworkers were raving about this place so I finally decided to give try it out.\nThe decor was festive but very dark. My friend and I were seated really close to the front door, but I didn't mind that too much. We were greeted quickly and our waitress was very kind. The menu was overwhelming and went on for pages. I'm no Thai expert so I was sure what to eat. I thought about the traditional Pad Thai but ended up ordering this eggplant stir fry and a soup. My friend went with the green curry. \nOur soup was odd. The broth was very bland. My eggplant wasn't cooked very well and one of the spices dominated the dish. \n I'll give the Thai House one more shot, but I'll have to eat a recommended dish.
