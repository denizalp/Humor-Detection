The worst experience I have ever had. Went to this store for a few items. Spent more than an hour and a half looking for items, either given the wrong location of items or they didn't know ! Finally in desperation I asked to talk to the Manager. After waiting for the Manager I told him of my experience! I told him I wanted just a plastic putty knife. Took me to the isle and they were out. None in stock ... really . Called home office and I was told I would get a call in 24 hours. Never happened ... obviously Lowe's doesn't need the business!!!
