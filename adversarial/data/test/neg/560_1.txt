Legit. I would come back to Canada for this place.\nCool staff, chill, quirky atmosphere, and great food.\n\nThe chicken meatballs were flavorful, with a chunky, tangy tomato sauce and delicious crispy buttery slices of bread. The root vegetables side was amazing. Out included celery root, carrots, sweet potato...and maybe other stuff...point is...it was roasted perfectly, not too crunchy, not too mushy, with excellent flavoring.\n\nIt took us all our power not to come back to the same place before leaving (we have to try other things!). We hope they expand to the US soon!!
