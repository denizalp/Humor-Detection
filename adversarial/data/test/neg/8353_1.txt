I have been seeing Dr. Knutson on a regular basis since March '16. I hurt my back helping a neighbor move and needed someone to help alleviate the back pain I was suffering from. Not only did Dr. Knutson answer the phone that day himself, he stayed past closing that evening to see me and hasn't let me down since. Thanks Dr. Knutson!
