Let me start by saying the biscuits here are so good! I came here for the shrimp festival a few months ago. It was decent. Nothing too special, I happened to not even get anything from the shrimp festival cause nothing was appealing. My friend did however get the items and they were decent, nothing fantastic. I wouldn't really recommend this, it was your average place.
