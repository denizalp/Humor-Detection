After three trips, we've never been disappointed by the food or the service. The owner often checks at the tables to ensure the customers are satisfied and his wife's touch is in the menu and often the specials.\n\nMy only complaint concerns their business practice of including an 18% tip in your bill, even for a party of two. It's even worse when the check comes back for your signature, with another \"tip\" line and no total. It invites unintentional double tipping if you missed that it was included prior to getting the signature copy. On our last visit we met new friends and enjoyed some small talk through diner. When the checks came I suggested they check for the tip. They were appalled and would have double tipped by accident if I hadn't mentioned it. The waiters earn a good tip, so that isn't the problem. But I wonder if an \"overtip\" goes to the waiter? How many people would catch this? On a check of $150, tipping twice can be a substantial hit.  I usually see a sign when a restaurant includes the tip. On the menu and at the register it reads something like \"A gratuity of 18% is included for parties of 5 or more.\"  I hope they reconsider this practice. I have complained, but it hasn't changed yet and keeps me from giving them 5 stars.
