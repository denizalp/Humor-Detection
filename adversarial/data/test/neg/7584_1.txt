Love the food and hate the beer.\n\nNot a fan of their beers - HOWEVER that have an interesting 'sampler' of their 4 beers I believe?? Goes the the golden brand to the amber dark ale (yuck!).  I also tried their Maple Beer that is bottled from Montreal - that was quite interesting as well but I wouldn't go for that again.\n\nI love their set up of the main bar downstairs but there is additional seating upstairs as well. You can munch on some peanuts if you're just there for a game and some drinks.   \n\nIf you're going to food you have to get the Flat bread pizza.  You can't go wrong and they are perfect for sharing. \n\nCan someone tell me what is up with the bathroom situation?? \nThey should really have one downstairs on the main floor.\nMake sure you're not busting to go to the bathroom because you have some hiking to do - 3 flights of stairs and then all the way across... it's a little bit much! \n\nOverall though a nice place and always full with people.\nI won't penalize them for me not liking their beer because that is everyone's choice, but I would definetely go here again to watch a game with a crowd of friends :)
