By far the worst Airline experience I have ever had. I have flown with you twice now, and on both flights you have made inexcusable errors. I was willing to let the 7 hour delay that I had from you guys back in August slide, hoping that, that was just bad luck. After my most recent experience over the weekend with you, I can officially say I will never fly with you again, nor will I recommend you. I went to check into my return flight on the mobile app and was given an error each time I plugged in my information for the return flight. I ended up calling their customer service line hoping it was a technical glitch. Shocker, it wasn't. The agent on the line asked me several times if I boarded my original flight that flew me into Las Vegas, it was from there that I started to panic once I realized these guys had no idea I was even on the first flight (after checking in 24 hours in advance and scanning my phone at the terminal). He then proceeded to put me on hold for 20 minutes after telling me they had no record of my original flight so they cancelled my return flight. After the hold was over the agent HAD THE AUDACITY TO TELL ME THAT BECAUSE THEY HAD NO RECORD OF ME ON THE FIRST FLIGHT, THEY ARE NOT ENTITLED TO PUT ME BACK ON THE FLIGHT THAT I ORIGINALLY BOOKED. BY THE GRACE OF GOD AND THANKFULLY ONE OF MY FRIENDS THAT I WAS FLYING WITH COULDNT MAKE IT, THE AGENT HAD THIS TO SAY \"Sir I would like to advise you that we have no record of you on your first flight, but as a courtesy to you, I will put you on that flight\". A COURTESY!? Your system messed up and almost caused a massive inconvenience to me. I had a ride and work the next day on the line if you didn't figure out how to remedy the situation.\n\nKeep in mind that I booked the 2nd flight using a coupon that they gave me for screwing up the first one. Save your money this time Allegiant, I have no confidence in your airline and will NEVER fly with you again. I advise anyone searching for a cheap flight to skip past these guys, their customer service and logistics in general are horrendous.
