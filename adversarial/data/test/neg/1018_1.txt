We were in Madison last Sunday and cruising State Street for somewhere to eat after 9:pm.  There aren't many options for just food at that hour, Osaka House seemed a decent choice.  Because we were hungry by that time we ordered a whole bunch of items (does that sound like a Seinfeld episode?).  All but one were pretty good and none were excellent.\n\nThe sole \"just ok\" item was a tempura platter with several items, mostly vegetables, on it.  We probably opted for the shrimp and chicken arriving with 1 shrimp and 2 chicken.  I'd steer away from it.\nIncidentally, I say probably because the menu is from their site is unavailable.  Just a guess but maybe it's because I keep my \"cookie\" vault locked as much as possible.  Sure, the vault could be culled but why do they need access to it anyway?\n\nWhile waiting for our order(s) we noticed a menu on the wall listing items with a $1 discount after 10:00.  We had already been presented with the check but because we were not quite sated after the first round, and the time was now past 10, we tried 2 or 3 from the discounted price list.  (Boy, talk about poor sentence construction.)  Anyway, I was curious to see if we were to be charged the discounted price on items ordered after 10 and we were.  Hurray!  Our tab for 3 was $69 before tip.\n\nThe waiter was sufficiently attentive and competent while attending the one or two occupied tables inside and one or two outside.  Not related to the waiter are the restaurant's listed hours.  At 11:pm they showed no sign of closing yet, their website lists 11:am to 9:30 7 days a week.  Yelp lists 10:30 to 10:30 all week.  A case of summer hours, perhaps?\n\nNo doubt I've had better sushi but this was alright.  Maybe there are better sushi places in Madison but this one appeared sufficiently clean and the food was as above.  I'd consider going back and would give it a shot if I were you.\n\nThe questions below remind me:  Searching for a Wi-Fi signal, one was listed for the restaurant but even though it appeared unlock, we couldn't connect and didn't ask for help.
