I am so sad, I looked forward to dinner all day after I found this east valley location earlier this week.  It is my husbands birthday so I surprised him.  What a let down.  We love Ah-So in the North Valley and thought this was related.  It SO is not...  The service was terrible, the servers were clearly overwhelmed and it all went downhill from there.  The drinks took forever, and then my order was incorrect.  When I told her, she near argued with me.  Since my husband was the only one that got his food I watched him eat- the vegetables were soft, poor quality overcooked steak and dehydrated shrimp.  He ate only because he hadnt had lunch and it was in front of him.  After 20 more minutes my food still hadnt arrived, we had enough.  Sorry but we will not be back.
