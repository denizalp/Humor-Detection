I was treated to this buffet by family visiting from out of town,  loaded up on lobster and crab, with some treats from dessert bar afterwards,  when the price is 40 bucks to eat, you dont waste your stomach on pasta and potatoes, too bad, those dishes looked good too.  I may come back if someone else pays haha
