Went here on the advice of a friend.  the staff were helpful and prompt.  We have standard dishes we order when eating tai.  Chicken pad Tai was a bit sweeter than we like and the spicy chicken eggplant had flattened pieces of chicken that were under seasoned.  The eggplant and the sauce were good.  Pricing was similar to other Thai Restaurants we have tried locally.  They did have extensive seafood options. We did not try any of the seafood.  They were helpful talking to the kitchen regarding ingredients.
