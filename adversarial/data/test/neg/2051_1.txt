How much time do you have? First off, AVOID this company!!! \nTheir so-called \"deal\" of $99 for four rooms and stairs.(LIES) This was obviously a ploy to get in my parents house so they can charge them more. My mother and father was harassed, intimidated, bullied and treated with so much disrespect.  They told my parent who are 77 and 70, there carpet needed a deep clean.  Keep in mind the carpet was just put in (6 month), its the highest end carpet you can find (nylon), and there is only 2 people living in there home.  So three of the five rooms are not even used.  The carpet (technicians) if they can even be called that, continually were pushing my parents.  My parents even said several times we don't understand why we need a deep clean, the carpets are only 6 moths old, we only want a normal clean.  They guys continued to harass my parents to where they were also uncomfortable with the two guys.  So instead of arguing more and more they just did it.  \n\nThey were only at there house for about an hour and the carpets where SOAKED!!!!! The carpet was still SOAKED 24hours later in some spots.  Where the carpet was dry.  It was hard and crusty, along with when you touched it had a very oily residue to it.  This oily residue was so bad my mother almost fell from slipping walking onto the vinyl in her master bedroom.  Again keep in mind she is 70!!  We all know how bad this could have turned out.  \n\nSo I called the number (702) 906-0322 and first spoke with a lady who called herself Angie.  She seemed nice at first.  I stated to explain the situation to you.  She placed me on hold.  When she got back on the line she stated can you text this number a copy of the invoice we don't have it in the office yet.  I said sure.  that number was (702) 723-8833.  She asked me to call back in about 15 minuets.  \n\nI waited about 30 (you know to be nice)  I then spoke to another lady who refused to give me her name but later told me it was Julie.  She was unaware of what was going on and placed me on a hold for about 10 minuets.  she came back on the line and said there is nothing she can do, due to them not having the invoice.  I then asked to speak to supervisor.  She told me no one was able to speak to me due to them being (out on a call)  I asked to be contected to their cell phone.  She then said i can't give you there number.  I said I don't want the number, I want to be connected to their cell phone.  Sorry we don't do that.  I will leave a note for them to call when they get back in the office.  She then became rude and told me I'm not the on who messed up your parents carpet. What do you want me to do.  She then hung up.  \n\n2.5 hours later i called back and spoke to another girl who said she was Juile as well.  She placed me on hold for about 10 minuets and came back on the line.  She said she was sorry for the hold be she was waiting by the supervisors office and he was still on the phone.  Can he call you in a few minuets.  I said sure.  five minuets later i did received a phone call.  she stated they were going to come back out and re- clean.  I told her no they were no allowed back at this house due to there total disrespect and horrible job they did on the carpet.  I want to speak to your supervisor.  She then told me there was NO supervisor and i would have to wait until Monday.  I asked how is there no supervisor when you just told me you were outside his office.  She then became extremely rude and stated to yell.  I told her i was going to be reviewing this company on every social media outlet and possibly go to news 13. She stated you want the number to Chanel 8 too, we don't care.  She then hung up.  \n\nSo during this whole debacle, i called Stanley Steemer to have them come out and FIX this HORRIBLE issue.  They were able to come out 6-25-16 (same day)  The two (TURE) carpet technicians came out and Immediately saw what a horrible job was done.  During the very first room they stated to clean there was so much soap coming up from the carpet they had to use ANTI FOAM!!!!!! Because it stated to clogged they machine.
