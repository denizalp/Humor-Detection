This place is a true piece of Americana, for gluttons, and overindulgence.\nReally? Does a lunch size portion of Mac & Cheese need to be over 3200 calories with over 100 grams of fat? Do chicken breast sandwiches need to look like the meat came from a chicken grown in Chernoble? Let's explore further, cheesecake without sugar? Makes sense for those who are diabetic. But let's really see who orders sugar free cheesecake. More than likely it's the people who devour the previously mentioned mac & cheese, then to ease that guilt, order the sugar free cheesecake, that has over 50 grams of fat because it's made with cream cheese and eggs., and served with a huge dollop of real whipped cream, which by the way contains SUGAR.             \n\nOk, let me be fare, once in awhile this place can be good, like once every few months. I've eaten there and I used to be a big eater, and as a lover of food I was impressed by the portions. They are so big i could take most of the meal home and eat it for lunch and dinner the next day.\n\nIt's a bit expensive, but for what you get it's worth the extra spending.
