This is a place to I bumped into when I strolled around in the Chinatown of Toronto. I had too much food with friends, so I decided to get something light. What I had in mind was Congee Cans, easy to digest, and it is my way to tide over indigestion, It always works. This food mart have everything I need. I bought some fruit, plus congee cans. It is clean and you can get some lunchbox. Of course, the mart doesn't accept credit cards.
