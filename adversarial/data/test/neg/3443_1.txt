This was a horrible disappointment. Our server seemed fine initially, friendly, giving us the specials, coming to refill water often. However, she went way too long without coming by after that. We were ready to order for about a half hour before she finally returned. Drinks were slow. Food was slow. My food was okay but a bit cold by the time it came out, small portion, and over-priced. Coffee was delicious.\nNow, after we ate, our plates were cleared quickly and a dessert menu was brought. But then 45 minutes went by without our server coming by. We wanted to order cocktails but it wasn't possible at that point. There was only one other table at that point, and the server was just chatting with other staff at the bar. Okay? Apparently if it's a big party and an automatic 20% tip you don't need to try at all. I would avoid this place at all costs given that it's a new restaurant on 17th avenue it is unlikely to stick around with poor quality service and overly priced food. Maybe they manage better with smaller parties, but it seemed to be just plain old lazy.
