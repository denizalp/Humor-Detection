Christopher Moving Company moved me last week, and I was VERY IMPRESSED with their professionalism, friendliness, and quick moving!  They moved a family of four from a 2200 square foot house to a smaller 1600 square foot house. They were fast and efficient in the move from the older house.  They arrived early, did a walk through, and got right to work.  The three capable gentleman asked questions to make sure all was taken care of to our satisfaction.  When we got to the new house, we even had a bit of snafu when a couch wouldn't fit in my office. They waited patiently putting in the office items as we took out an entire window in the front of the house to bring in the oversize couch.  I was so relieved and now I have an awesome  office to show for it.  After the couch was in, they happily (or at least it felt like it :) helped me bring in boxes and boxes of HEAVY textbooks into the office. They took apart and put together all of the bedroom furniture, and all was done within 3.5 hours!  This made the move EXTREMELY reasonable, and I would definitely recommend them to anyone!  Awesome!  Plus, the movers were Game of Thrones and SciFi fans, how could you not love them??!!
