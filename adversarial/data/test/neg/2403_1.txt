If you are looking wonderful and sweet welcome to the candy store then this is your place. I love how one side of the store you can purchase candy and other merchandise.  Another half of the store invites you to try out their amazing cookies, ice cream,  milkshakes, and etc. I love how friendly the workers are and they do allow you to sample their ice cream. Moreover,  I do recommend their ice cream sandwiches. You can build your own and it's the same price as one scoop of ice cream... I'll let you do the math.  We got two different types of cookies (white chocolate with macadamia,  and smores) then we chose to get the sticky toffee pudding ice cream. If you are looking for something non alcoholic and sweet,  definitely stop by and check this place out.
