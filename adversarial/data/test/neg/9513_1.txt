A really cool place, about 30-45 minutes from the Las Vegas Strip. I went here for a corporate event (Microsoft Annual Sales Kickoff), and they had food, games, and live entertainment from Bruno Mars!!!!  The place is wonderful, but the bathrooms are terrible, and which is why I am giving it 4 Stars.
