We were looking for a place to eat and decided to give it a try. It's super cute and completely gluten free. I had the bacon dish which was just scrambled eggs and a lot of awesome bacon -very tasty. Fiance had the eggs benny which was different and not the traditional. It wasn't bad but we didn't like the bread part on the bottom. It also had a TON of sauce. It was still pretty good. The cookies though are AMAZING!\n\nI would go back here for another try at the food and for sure the baking. The staff is super cute and nice so that makes it worth it as well.
