Gelato is not ice-cream, and texture is a major difference. The base is less sugary and flavour is more intense. Il Gelatiere knows that, and for those reasons I prefer gelato here than any other places.\n\n I like purity of flavour and I find Nocciola, Cioccolato, Pistacchio and Caffe' some of the most basic yet popular flavours where its possible to feel \"La difference\".  In over two years of my pilgrimage to the place I was able to contain my urge, and not to become addicted to it.\n\nMy five stars go to \"Il Gelatiere\" because their product speaks for itself, and it has been consistent in the long run.
