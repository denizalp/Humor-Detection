This dish is called Lobster salad rolls on the menu. Please look at the pictures, it come with a lobster shell but there is CRAWFISH. I can't find one piece of lobster. Be careful when you make an order!!!! I have talked to the waitress to ask the restaurant change the name on the menu or use real lobster and do not cheat people again. The waitress apologised to us and cancelled the order. She is polite
