Came here for their prix fixe menu which comes with bottomless glass wine pairings and according to our waitress, bottomless essentially means drink until your heart's content, but don't get annihilated. I didn't drink and so I didn't get the most out of it, but my two dinner mates did. They drank and I ate. It was all very exciting. Here's what I had on their menu: \n\nOnion Soup and Garbage Salad - The onion soup was on the saltier end and I would have preferred with less sodium. The garbage salad was a nice pairing to the soup. They really should name that salad better though. It was light and surprisingly contained shrimp. Score!\n\nAtlantic Salmon - This was delicious. Seared perfectly and salted evenly. Outside had a crunchy texture. Enjoyed thoroughly. Tasted a bit of their striped seabass and it wasn't as tasty. I recommend the salmon. \n\nPrime Ribeye steak - Hello yumminess. Ordered medium rare and was not disappointed. My bf, however, said it was too salty for him and didn't finish over half the steak. \n\nChocolate Banana Creme Pie - this was amazing. I really loved the softness of the creme and how well it meshed with everything. \n\nStrawberry Shortcake - not my favorite dessert in general so I can't be unbiased on this. \n\nOur waitress was friendly and very entertaining. I personally loved her. She made our night more eventful in terms of her wittiness. She brought out a specialty shooter and the guys loved it. All in all, for the price and if you drink, you should definitely drop by here and get your money's worth. Warning though: Wine hits you faster so be aware.
