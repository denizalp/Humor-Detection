I went to Alchemy when I was in town visiting from San Francisco. I got a great haircut and found this place to be funky, cool and rivals any place in SF. The owners and staff clearly have an eye for detail and for the extra touches that make a place inviting and cool. They were able to get me in with one day notice, and I love my cut. I didn't feel over sold too, although my stylist made product recommendations. They are a Paul Mitchell salon which I loved. Price was reasonable (although I'm from SF, so anything less than $80 is a deal).\n\nMy one piece of feedback would be to make the welcome-to-our-salon tour much shorter. I got a full tour with explanations of what the different areas are, etc... Some clients may appreciate all the info, but it was a bit much for me. I appreciated the intent, but I would have appreciated just a greeting, glass of champagne, and time to sit quietly and read a magazine or something. :)\n\nGreat place, great concept, and I hear they have a keg on tap there too (not a beer drinker but cool idea).
