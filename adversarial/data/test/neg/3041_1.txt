Food is salty & buttery.  Everything kind of tasted the same.  The sushi was good though.  I love the way you order the AYCE on the iPads.  Great setup!  But food NOT so great.  And price is higher than others, while food quality is worse.  I won't be back.   Also, they are cash only (no debit or credit cards) which is a MAJOR hassle.
