Came here for lunch buffet with groupon.\n\nThere was a decent selection for lunch but something just wasn't right.\n\nThe food wasn't warm. \nIt wasn't exceptional or that tasty. \nThe white tablecloth had a stain on it from the last guest.\nAs soon my guest and I left the restaurant we both felt a slight stomach ache.\nI felt like Indian food at a food court would have been better.\n\nThis place is a tourist trap and there are better Indian places in Toronto.
