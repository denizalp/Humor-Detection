They were good, just with some minor hiccups. Requesting and scheduling a quote to trim our Sisso went smooth. I was told they could come out same day for quote but we didn't end up with quote until the following day. Quote seemed fair, but I was waiting for several others to come back before I scheduled. Once I decided to schedule, they were able to fit me in within a week - no big deal. But I was not given a time the crew would show, not even a window until they called the night before (not everybody works from home). They did show on time the day of, and worked quickly taking the time to answer our questions and address our concerns.  However, the crew that showed didn't have a blower to clean up the yard after they were done and had to send another crew later in the day to finish. I also never received any formal quote or final invoice, I had to have a crew member sign a note proving I paid them. Other than that, the tree looks much better and will probably use them again.
