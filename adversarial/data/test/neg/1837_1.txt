Breakfast: excellent food and big portions. I have a 4 egg omelet with hash browns and a side salad (instead of bread). Spiked shakes are big, expensive, sweet and good, but you probably want to share. Breakfast burrito was also delicious. 4 stars\n\nLunch: disappointed we missed the cutoff for breakfast so we got lunch instead. Kitchen took forever. My salad didn't come with dressing which was odd. It was the arugula salad and had more wilted spinach than arugula.\n\nI would come back for breakfast but not lunch.
