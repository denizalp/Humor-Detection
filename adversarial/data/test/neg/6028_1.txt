There's only one reason why I consider making a trip to Maizie's.  The jalapeno ranch dressing.  5 up for the jalapeno ranch.  It's aMAIZIEng!  Your tastebuds will not be disappointed.  I dip everything in it.  \n\nSandwiches with jalapeno ranch.\nSweet potato fries with jalapeno ranch.\nSalad with jalapeno ranch.\nFish with jalapeno ranch.\nFruit with jalapeno ranch.\nDessert with jalapeno ranch (just kidding).\n\nI usually stick to the same few dishes (with a few substitutions here and there) and the staff is very kind and accommodating.  They serve meat, but have veggie choices - plural - unlike other restaurants that only have one veggie choice.\n\nSit inside or out.  I choose out because it's less crowded and not annoyed by the tellies.  But they do allow pets so keep that in mind if you don't like eating next to animals.
