Terrible service. I was referred here by my general dentist for my daughter for cavities. At the first appointment they sent us back out in the waiting area and expected us to wait for apx. 2 hours after the dentist initially looked in her mouth to get the fillings. I had to reschedule, and in the midst of all that the front office staff gave me three different prices for the treatment. When I told them I couldn't wait that long and expressed some frustration with the lack of clarity regarding the price they were unapologetic. We rescheduled. At the second appointment we waited 40 minutes past our scheduled time. They then refused to let me go back with my 5 year old while they did the fillings. I would be more understanding of this if it was a practice that had worked to establish some trust with me, but they had not. We walked out because I couldn't be sure of how they would treat my daughter without my being there. I understand there are some parents that might be disruptive, but you should also be transparent and straightforward regarding your care.
