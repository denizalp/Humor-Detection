Came here for breakfast on Saturday morning for the mimosa brunch, and happy we did :). They had a lot of breakfast options including a prime rib carving station, which was awesome. They had eggs to order, crispy bacon and juicy sausages. I was also excited they had gelato, the cookies & cream is a must try.\nOur server was very nice and took very good care of us making sure our mimosas were always filled. I can't really comment on lunch, they only thing I tried was the fried chicken and mac & cheese that they had just put out for the start of lunch dishes, but I enjoyed both.
