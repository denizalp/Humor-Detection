I love mod pizza! It a great on the go place. I'm always down for mod pizza, I can always switch up what I want depending on what kind of pizza I'm feeling. The staff there are so fun and energetic. They make the place feel alive! The manager, I can't remember his name unfortunately, is amazing and so sweet. Big thumbs up for this location.
