Followed Dr. Wayne Svoboda from Palm Glen to this office. So glad we did because he continues to be the best veterinarian we've ever had for all of our animals. A few months ago our elderly dog had begun to have pain and spasms over a holiday weekend and they were able to get us in the same day we called - which was president's day. They have worked with my schedule for dropping off\/picking up and go out of their way to follow up. We appreciate the staff and their resident talking bird.
