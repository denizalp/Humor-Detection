First time using Delia. I recently moved and my old spot was closed. I googled all the closest dry cleaners and they all, ALL had less than 2 Stars. For the first time, I chose a place based on Yelp reviews. Sad day. \nAnyway, place is clean and the clothes were what I expected. Clean job, no damage. \n1 star lost is due to obnoxiously high prices, in my opinion, and because I think the staff is ok. Better comparatively to other places I've been but not QT status. All in all, happy customer. I'll go back.
