I found this shop on Yelp when my finance  (now husband) was looking for a wedding band. My engagement ring & wedding band were heirloom pieces made of diamond & white gold.\n\nFor his wedding band, he wanted a piece that sort of matched mine. He looked at several big name chain jewelry stores, but didn't find what he was looking for. When he came into this shop he found a white gold band with a few diamonds that had been custom made. It turned out to be the perfect ring...not gaudy or flashy, but a nice match for my heirloom set. And for a much better price than the Jarrod and Kay Jewelers options. \n\nI found out later that this shop also custom made my BFF'S engagement ring and it is a truly beautiful piece!\n\nBased on both experiences, I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for nice jewelry that isn't exorbitantly over-priced!
