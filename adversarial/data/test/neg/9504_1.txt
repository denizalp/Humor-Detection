Full disclosure:  We just happened to show up at Sully's on the very night of Sully's 60th birthday.  They were decorating the tables, balloons hung from the tin ceiling, the place was packed, we waited about a half hour for a table.  We may have been the only people there who didn't personally know Sully.  (Nor did anyone introduce us, which most certainly would have happened in Ireland.  Or Italy, or any other European country.  Or most U.S. cities.  Or perhaps we stink.  Who knows?)\n\nDrinks were on the expensive side, service was disjointed while still friendly, volume was on the bleeding-ear scale and food was cafeteria quality.  Fun bunch of drunks, though!  We waited nearly as long after dinner, just for the waitress to take our money.  Fun bunch of drunks, though, including the staff!\n\nI'll go back for a re-review on a night that isn't quite so epic.
