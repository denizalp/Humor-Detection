D.D.S. are not one of my favorite people, BUT Dr. Dobash is just great, I had to see someomeone in a hurry and he fit me in. He is always watching to see if you might be in pain, Don't be alarmed if he breaks out in song, he does that from time to time. which seems to make you feel more at ease and his staff is just as wonderful too. I've been hearing of him from my staff and customers for years and I'm so glad I went to see him!
