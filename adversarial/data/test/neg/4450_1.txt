Ate here last night. Attractive place and friendly staff. However the food was disappointing. It was not the \"crispy crunchy \" chicken described on their website home page. We had the tenders and there was no crunch at all. The seasoning is interesting but not anything I'd want again. The choices of only tenders wings and thighs was surprising. What about breasts and drumsticks?  When I got back on line I discovered that the NYC location has these plus several other sides not offered here. I feel cheated as maybe it's better at their NYC location but I won't come back to this one.  As others have said, way too expensive for what you get.
