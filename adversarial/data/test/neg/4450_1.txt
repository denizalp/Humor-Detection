This is one of my favourite standing venues in Toronto. It's that perfect combination of size, intimacy, and accessibility. Many bands on their way up in popularity will make appearances here (usually for a pretty affordable price). \n\nThe set up is much better than many similar sized venues. I would highly recommend checking out your favourite artist or band.
