LILLY ,..  the makeup  tattooing lady was very unprofessional.    I had terrible anxiety during the  four hour procedure and she was not comforting at ALL  and not personable in any way , shape or form.  It was painful as well and she said it would not be.  SHE said that my lip tattos would look exactly like the way I wear my lipstick and lipliner.  After four hours of torture and seven hundred dollars down the Tubes , you can't even tell that I had my brows and my lips and eye liner tattooed on.  I'm very very dissappointed in my experience with Lilly. Then she has the nerve to call and say they forgot to charge me forty extra dollars For the numbing medicine that didn't even Work !  And called to say that for the touch ups she has to raise the prices because too much time has passed.  I feel\nThat she is very  much a rip off and I will look elsewhere to get my makeup tattoing next time.   Money well wasted.   Time wasted also.   And she was rude and also very  argumentitive.   Terrible customer service.  I love dealing with kind , personable people that just make your feel welcome and comfortable and that go out of their way to make your experience a pleasant one !!  Not ones that are rude and money hungry.
