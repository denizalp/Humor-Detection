Haymakers is a place we visit when 2 situations combine:\n\n1. I have a coupon\n2. We find ourselves nearby out of ideas on where to eat.\n\nService is usually friendly, and the food is decent. It is just that somehow we don't feel the love and we don't really have any favorites, so we do not come here often.\n\nIt could also be that every time we have been seated by the bar, and that is never our first option.\n\nWe have been here for breakfast and early dinner, and they do have good options. This last time both me and hubby had the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and they were very good.\n\nI have also had BBQ chicken (sauce on the side) and ribs in the past, both good too.
