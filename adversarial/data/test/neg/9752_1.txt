As I relay my experience you will understand why I am only doing 2 stars. I decided last minute to have 2 suits dry cleaned and after 2 other place was delighted to find I could have gotten same day services done as I was leaving for out of town later. Had not used dry cleaning services in a while and never in this state. The young lady that attended to me this morning, whom I later found out to be Rachel,  was cheerful..I was happy I was gonna get my suits done and have them ready for after work. \nWhen I went to pick up my suits were charged a whopping $33 plus dollars vs $26 and change as per the price list. When I queried was told that because one of the suit was a dress, be it a very short one with a jacket they were priced individual.  I asked to talk to a supervisor as I was under the impression I was paying for 2 suits . A person by name of Coleenwas called who said she could do nothing about it as ticket was written by Rachel and should have Rachel called. Rachel was called but did not even have the courtesy of explaining to me or even initiated the conversation this morning regarding the amount that was charge. And I took some responsibility for assuming. She wanted me to come back on Monday, where she could explain. Right lady!   Dont have time to waste.Nice way to treat a customer. I will definitely have second thoughts about coming here and patron by aware, don't be naive like me and just go back that price list. in retrospect should have asked what the total was going to cost before I consented to have the work done.  $33 to have 2 suits done, unheard off. Poor handling of challenge that aroused.
