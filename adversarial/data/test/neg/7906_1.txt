Tried Gadzooks today at the end of the lunch rush. I think that young retauranteur Aaron Pool will have one of 7th Street's most booming places if he is able to work out the kinks. \n\nThe enchiladas were impressive. I would have praised them in a full sit-down restaurant and was surprised at the quality and flavor considering Gadzooks is a \"fast casual\" kind of spot. I can't comment on every element of my dish because I ordered in such a frantic manner. I do know that I had chicken and short rib enchiladas smothered in tasty, tangy sauce and cheese. Every bite and flavor was delicious. \n\nThe parts of the experience that were really lacking were service and signage. Though the employees were friendly, their knowledge of the product was minimal and sense of urgency was nonexistent. Just having the individual fillings, cheeses, toppings, etc. labeled would have cut down on a lot of the confusion. There is a chalkboard menu above the area where you order, but you cannot even read it unless you are standing five feet away. Places like Subway and Chipotle have had the same ten ingredients forever and people still have to hem and haw over their order. \n\nI'm by no means suggesting that Gadzooks should go the Subway\/Chipotle route. On the contrary. They boast the thousands of flavor combinations available, and that is much appreciated. Yet in order to follow through on that promise, they need to have a precise ordering process with staff that is knowledgeable about every ingredient and can convey that information quickly and effectively. \n\nI'd like to see this place thrive, and I do absolutely recommend it. They've tackled the number one priority- good, quality food that is reasonably priced. Now they just have to work on the rest of it because a stressful ordering experience is enough to put people off the food altogether.
