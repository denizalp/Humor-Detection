Best window cleaners I've ever used!  Always do an excellent job. I've owned two story homes in Henderson and LV and Looking Glass has fair pricing and great workers.  They show up on time as promised but l have to plan ahead to because they seem to have a full schedule of repete customers.  I recommended them to my friend in South LV and he was impressed with their work. Call them if you want clean windows and professional services. Bill
