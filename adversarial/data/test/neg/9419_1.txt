My 750i went into safety mode with a drive train malfunction error code coming up. I was stuck in Vegas and we were trying to get home to LA since I had an early fight to NYC the next day. These folks treated us like GOLD! Took the car in right away, gave us a brand new loaner while they ran analytics. They had to replace both high pressure pumps and did the entire job within 5 hours INCLUDING a wash. Couldn't recommend a service department or D'Andre more. Super Service department!
