I love this place! It offers friendly solace in a busy city, as well as expertly crafted coffee beverages. When Dale is preparing food, you do not want to say no. Delicious, and crafted with attention to detail and taste. Sandrine and Zion are delightful hosts who make me feel like I am truly having coffee with a friend.
