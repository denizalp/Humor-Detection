This is definitely my new favorite Mexican place in town! Everything we had here was amazing and they have some really unique options that you can't find anywhere else in Charlotte. The atmosphere is awesome and it is definitely a great spot to hang out with friends. The price point is a little higher than I'd like for a Mexican restaurant, but this is definitely upgraded from your basic Mexican cuisine. I highly recommend the puffy tacos! They're a bit difficult to eat but definitely worth it- chicken tinga was by far my favorite.
