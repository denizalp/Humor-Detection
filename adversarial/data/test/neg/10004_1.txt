We were throwing a Bachelorette for a friend. We were a total of 4 girls who stayed in the Double Queen Belle suite. It was on the 22nd floor. Great view of the strip. Loved the huge bathroom!\n\nIt's a beautiful hotel and very well-maintained.\n\nHotel was centrally located so it was very easy to go anywhere. We were clubbing\/eating at XS\/ Wynn, so it was so easy. We just walked through hotels (it mattered coz it was a cold day). \n\nThere was some confusion and we were charged for the refreshments that we never had, I went to the Checkout desk and the rep immediately and very courteously cancelled everything, right there. \n\nAll in all, loved our experience.
