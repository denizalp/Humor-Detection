Have been wanting to visit Salad and Go for a long time.  So, while over in Surprise, I stopped in and ordered a Cobb Salad.  Drive thru was a bit busy but, since it was about high noon, that was to be expected.  Even at that I was in and out in about five minutes.\n\nFrom sturdy fork (why can't every fast food joint provide a decent fork?...it's the little things, people!) to salad my Cobb Salad was first rate.  Fresh, crispy, quality greens, lots of grape tomatoes, a whole boiled egg attractively sliced, generous bacon portions, tasty blue cheese crumbles and a blue cheese dressing in a little pack for self serving.  \n\nI was very hungry but could not finish the salad....extremely generous salad here.  \n\nSo, one of the winning ways to woo customers is to charge a fair price and provide the finest possible ingredients and this salad fit the bill.\n\nI have only one suggestion.  Though I'm not familiar with their business model...what they need to make a decent profit, but I would suggest they start making something like a \"go cup\" at about half the full salad pricing.  I'm a pretty healthy eater but couldn't eat this one today.  And a \"go cup\", perhaps served in a medium sized smoothie cup would be a fine thing to pick up and take home to accompany a meal at home.  Living alone, I've found my veggies go bad before I can use them up.  I'd be more than willing to \"fork out\" (pardon the pun) $3.00 for a \"half salad\".\n\nSo, keep up the good work, Salad And Go.  Don't get greedy, keep serving quality salads...and thanks again for that sturdy orange spoon!
