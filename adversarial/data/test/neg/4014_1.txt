Thank you to InfoDiva MLIS for reviewing this storage facility!  After a recent move to Las Vegas, I needed to put a couple of random things into storage, and had little information on which to base my decision about storage joints.  But I came across InfoDivaMLIS' suggestion and stopped by.  The managers of the Flamingo Rd. location are incredibly nice and helpful (they maintain the property very well, and it is impeccably clean).  They talked me down from getting a larger unit, explaining how the few things I had would fit in something smaller.  The storage units are easily accessible, and even after a few days of strong rains, I was pleased to see they were still dry inside.  I guess the only downside I'd note is that I was hoping to pay a little less for storage in Las Vegas, but I suppose I'm paying for the peace of mind of using a great facility.
