I could not recommend this company less. Customer service agents were rude when I chose to cancel my auto policy because they could not extend me an additional homeowners insurance policy due to an on-site oil tank. Additionally, even though I cancelled my policy early (several days before my coverage ended), they claim I still have an open balance.  Only way to get rid of this balance (which was basically a fee for cancelling their service) was to extend my coverage  (LOL) which was by the way, also way overpriced.
