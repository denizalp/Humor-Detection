I have gone here several times and had Ashley do my cut.  She did a great job and I will be back for her.\nA barber in the back of the shop had some violent trap music playing and I didn't like that at all.  You should only play inoffensive music at a business because some people don't like cursing and violence in their music.  Ashley gets 5 stars but that crap music loses a star.
