We stopped here for some coffee and a small bite to eat after a day at Carowinds. We waited 25 minutes to get our drinks after ordering. The waitress after finally bringing them to us took our order, and proceeded to go talk to the other employees for 10 minutes before ever entering the orders into the computer. BTW we were the only table she had. While waiting on our food for over half an hour we watched as 4 of the employees attempted a birthday song for the table near us and failed miserably because they didn't know the words and acted like it wasn't important anyway. The restrooms were disgusting, overflowing toilets, trash over flowing onto the floor. They weren't even busy for the hour and a half that we were there. This place is in need of some serious management. I'm not sure how it's still in business.
