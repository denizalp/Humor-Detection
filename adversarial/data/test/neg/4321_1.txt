Good food, reasonable prices... it's a known quantity. Yeah it can be loud and crowded, which isn't what you want for every meal, but when you're in the mood it can be a fun place.  If the wait is long, try sitting on the small patio for dining. It's a great option for locals who don't consider 101 degrees to be \"Hot\".
