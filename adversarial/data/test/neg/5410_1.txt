This company has different sales people call me EVERY single day trying to sell me a loan. My voice mail box is completely full with their calls. 30 to 40 calls from them in my voice mail that I have to delete one by one. If I haven't answered after 40 calls why are you still calling me??! If I ever need to refinance my home loan I would NEVER even consider using them. I don't know how they got my phone number or who they bought my phone number from. They are unprofessional and annoying. Any legit business would not stoop this low with non stop unwanted sales calls. Why go through a company that is that desperate for sales???
