In early May, I made the mistake of taking my Honda Odyssey to this shop for a simple oil change. I also asked that they check the brakes. I received a phone call from Jared, the service manager.  He informed me that I was in need of a new radiator, shocks and struts. I gave the OK but asked that he use genuine Honda parts. I was pleased that I could pick the van up later that day. The total bill exceeded $1000. Almost immediately I noted oil smudges on my driveway or wherever I parked the van. When I took the van to a garage in Akron, OH that I have known and trusted from childhood, I was informed that the entire undersurface of the van was covered in transmission fluid. I was told that the radiator was what was called an after market part and not a genuine Honda part. Worse yet, it seems that the transmission fluid lines had been spliced together. Even after this was fixed, Firestone had another surprise in store for me. When more drops showed up, another garage found that Jared and his crew had made poor transmission line connections to the radiator. All told, it cost over $600 to undo all the damage this shop did. I later learned from those that know more about cars than I do that these shops have quotas to fill. As I know nothing about cars or their maintenance, I was the perfect patsy.
