Gigi's has been THE neighborhood coffee shop for as long as I have been in the area ( 4+ years) and has been responsible for bringing the neighbors together day in and out. It's the best place in the city to cozy up with other work-from-coffeeshopers and take part in this awesome community vibe. Oh yeah, coffee is top notch ( they have that latte art down pat) and food is some of the best healthy homemade stuff you can get in T. They really care about their patrons well being here. \n\nSaving Gigi, I love you.
