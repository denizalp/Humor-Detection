I can't be more happy with Paws and effect and with Jason. Also happy to get me and my dachshund in. Prices are very reasonable . Jason lets me know if it will be longer and it sometimes can be this is a busy groomer!! It does help because I can run errands etc and know my dog is safe! There are so many groomers in this Rocky River area and I'm glad to say I won't go anywhere else!!!
