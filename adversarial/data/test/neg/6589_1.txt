Yes I'm from Hawaii like all the other reviewers. It's a total hole in the wall and far from my house but it really is the only option for Hawaii style Chinese food. I've always eaten in because it's so far, but unlike others I've always had good service. \n\nWe were there specifically to try the pressed almond duck - finely shredded duck meat pressed together, coated with cornstarch and fried. Garnished w almonds and sweet sour sauce on the side. It was a lot of duck for $10. Not something I would have to order again but it was very good.\n\n Also tried deep fried garlic pork ribs, which weren't very good - meat was tough and garlic was burnt. Looked better than it tasted. And had to go with our usual crispy gau gee mein w cake noodle. Great as always -huge portion w lots of goodies and 4 big fatty crispy gau gee (like big big pork won ton)
