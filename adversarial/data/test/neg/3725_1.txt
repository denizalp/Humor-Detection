Possibly nicest Chipotle I Have ever been too.   In a small development full of dining choices-parking sucks during lunch-where all are solid choices but you will never be sad about choosing Chipotle.  Standard offerings, if you been in one you've been in them all, but have to add Chipotle might be my favorite of the tex-mex burrito assembly line types (qdoba, moe's , salsaritas, etc.).  Burrito bowl is always on point and best guac around for this type of place.  No queso though, only downside.
