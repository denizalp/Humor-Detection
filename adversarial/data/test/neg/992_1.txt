In general, expensive GIVEN the food quality and quality of ingredients. (Operative phrase being \"given the food quality\")\nBut then no one ever went broke underestimating the taste and tolerance of the mass theatre going public and tipsy Blue Jays fans.\n\nHere's my note to Fred's:\nMy family had dinner at Fred's Not Here last night.\nI know that these days everyone is a critic, but in your business as in mine (travel) it's the squeaky wheel that is the most valuable.\nI have a couple of comments on my meal\n\n1. Normally, if I understand correctly, restaurants aim for a cost of ingredients target of about 30-35% of menu price.  The sprinkling of \"feta\" flakes that adorned my tomato with \"feta\" salad was so faint that it could have been mistaken for salt. I could not discern even $1.00 of food costs. Which means the $8 menu price is outrageous. \n\nNow, I do not mind pay $8 or more for a salad, but I would expect serious chunks, or even a hefty slab, of good quality Greek feta. \n\nFurthermore, the dressing tasted no more interesting than something I could find in a bottle or at a grocery store salad bar line.\n\nHow about trying instead something simple: some excellent EV Olive oil, fresh lemon juice, a bit of thyme and S&P, and you're done.\n\n2. There was a joke in my family that my father could carve a roast of beef so thinly that the slices were one-sided. I was reminded of this joke one the first bite of my 6-hour brisket. The slivers of brisket were so fine as to be almost ridiculous. I found the sauce gloppy, salty and unappealing. I would rather it be served naked. The risotto I also found overly salty. The dish would have benefited both in terms of look and taste from a dash of some vegetable. Are three asparagus spears or some nicely prepared spinach too much to ask?\n\nI would encourage you to review at least these dishes and consider upping your game.\n\nPS. though I should add that the duck confit that two other diners had looked quite appetizing. though again, a dash of veg wouldn't kill ya.
