This restaurant is my favorite Sushi place. Yama Chan does a great job making all of his customers feel at home and the food is great.  It is very convenient and is reasonably priced. The smoked salmon roll is terrific and the Shu Mai is also excellent.  There are lots of choices and Yama Chan is fun to watch.
