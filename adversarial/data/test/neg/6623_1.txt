Well, I read a great review, so I gave it a try! The review said fresh squeezed lemonade and delicious cinnamon rolls! So, I get there for breakfast, which is a very limited mwnu, all sandwiches and wraps, i ordered one deconstructed so I wasn't eating all the bread. They did not have ANY cinnamon rolls - only on Saturday,  which I didn't understand since they had a lot of other bakery items! The lemonade was ok, not like mine and no refills! The iced tea was good,  free refills. There are a few small tables in front of the door, it is in the corner of a small strip center so people are going through n and out of a Pila test studio while you are eating. It is ok, but with so many choices in town,  I doubt I will go back. \nOn a side note there were about 10 ladies in the corner playing Mahjong!
