Found it recently that this was a bar that was owned by somebody from Buffalo New York. Being a former Buffaloian  I want to check out their beef on Weck and wings. I had the beef on weck and my wife had the fish fry. Both of them were actually very good. The prices are more than reasonable. I would've gave it four stars however the service was satisfactory (slow and forgot simple items).  We will go back there because the atmosphere was quiet and welcoming.
