We are from Boston and we're in town for a wedding.  Came here with a party of 6 on short notice, and the staff was very accommodating.  We were about 15 min late for a Friday early afternoon appointment, but Kevin said it was ok and everyone was very friendly when we arrived.   We got a variety of services, regular pedicure ($20), regular manicure ($12), French manicure ($17), gel manicure ($25), and gel French manicure ($30) -- everyone's nails came out great!  Cindy was especially skillful, through, and friendly!!!
