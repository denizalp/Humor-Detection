Great Service, Okay food, and it did smell a bit.\n\nTried the Breakfast Special, 2 eggs, hash browns, sausage, and toast with unlimited coffee. The service was quick, pleasant and professional. The food arrived within 5 minutes and just as I had asked. The portions were as expected, the taste was within range although the hash browns could have been a little more diced up - no biggie! I would have liked a little more fresh fruit but again not a big issue.\n\nI would go back if I was in the area but I would be tempted to try some of the other breakfast opportunities first. The restaurant is a little tired, a little dirty looking - but clean and I suspect the odor was from an inefficient exhaust and the general smell some Toronto restaurants suffer from - I don't know why.
