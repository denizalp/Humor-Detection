Amazing! It is my first time to dye my hair. I had been worried that my hair would be damaged, but finally the hair look healthier than before! I love the shampoo and conditioner they use there. What's more, they provide 5 stars service there, which made me feel like a VIP. I will definitely go there again. Highly recommended!
