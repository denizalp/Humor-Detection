This is the first time I've had Pickle Barrel! I came to this location after work with my friends and coworkers around 8:30 and there was still lots of space. We were served by Darryl who was knowledgeable about all the options on the menu. I ordered a Lychee Lemonade which was sooo goood! I also got the mushroom swiss with a super side of sweet potato fries (which costed an additional $2 for the upgrade). I loved the food, the mushrooms with onion rooms in the burger made it even more delicious. However, the portion of the side was too small for me. I could have eaten 2-3 of the sides, that's why I upgraded the side.\n\nI would totally return to Pickle Barrel and specifically this location. I loved the atmosphere and experience.
