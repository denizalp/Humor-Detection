We adopted a 12 month old Goldendoodle male that was just neutered.  He had previously been owned by someone that wanted him to be their breed male.  They ended up surrendering him to the shelter due to him being so wild.  We took him in and had Michelle at Bark Busters come for training.  Within two hours I had tears in my eyes at the wonderful dog he transformed into in front of my eyes. He so wanted direction and leadership and that is what Michelle taught me.  He is now three days after training and still amazes me with his behavior.  No more chewing shoes, clothes, towels, no more chasing cat, no jumping on grandkids and no barking and jumping at door when bell rings.  It takes a little getting used to the sound of Bhhhh that corrects bad behavior but it works!!!!!  He is no longer a nervous wreck because now I make his decisions and he loves it and is 100% calmer. I would give Michelle 100 stars if I could.   Sheryl
