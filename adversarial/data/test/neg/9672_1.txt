I was very pleased with the compassion and care I received from peaceful passings, when I had to put my 12 year old chihuahua down. They were kind, and understanding. They gave me time to say good bye, and also for my other dogs to say goodbye. Most importantly, they allowed my sweet old girl to pass peacefully at home where she felt safe. I can't say enough thanks you's.
