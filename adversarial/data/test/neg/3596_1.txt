The Bacon Mac-n-Cheese went beyond my expectations. Had I been starving I would have been able to finish the whole thing. The fries trio is a nice surprise of regular fries, waffle cut fries, and wedges- a nice change from your ordinary burger and fries. They were busy, so service was a tad faulty, but nothing serious to keep me from going back.
