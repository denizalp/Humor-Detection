I am a fan of the show and enjoyed matching the show production with the actual business.  Brett was traveling and wayde was under the weather so that was a little disappointing, but trish does a great job with interesting stories.  We took a picture with the general and saw some other cast members.  It was a good time and most importantly had some smiles just like the show.
