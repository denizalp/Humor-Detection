Not Your Typical Toronto Cafe.\n\nFrom the minimal design and spacious layout, to the open kitchen and the Japanese snacks, the first thing I thought when I walked in was that this isn't your typical Toronto cafe (felt like I was in Tokyo or Kyoto). I had an Americano which tasted great and also the peach cake and a matcha cookie.\n\nAll in all this new cafe is a great addition to the neighbourhood and the city. It's got a really cool design, great tasting coffee, creative food and most of all, a unique experience.
