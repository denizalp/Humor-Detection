Cozy English-style gastropub is good for groups or those seeking something more intimate. Fairly standard menu - we had arugula salad and pea soup to start, then baked salmon over lentils and lamb shank - all very tasty.\nExtensive cocktail and wine menu as well, I tried a local lager that was very good.
