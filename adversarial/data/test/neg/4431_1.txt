This is a hidden gem.  Unassuming simple appearance with counter top serving but ample seating.  There are generous portions of very fresh food at an extremely reasonable price.  I had tabouleh salad complete with warm, soft pita bread.  I had planned to get lentil soup as well, but the salad was so large that I wouldn't have had room for it.
