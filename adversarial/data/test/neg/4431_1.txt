My wife started getting me burgers from this local dive bar\/diner years ago and I've been hooked since. The burgers are juicy, flavorful, and a little messy , like a good burger should be. I've only been in the business one time (to pick up a double cheese burger) and the to-go service was bar-rific: The bar tender greeted the local folks by name as they came in all the while taking your order and giving her straight forward opinion about whatever was on the tube.... Nice.  This ain't no fancy joint, but the food sure is tasty.
