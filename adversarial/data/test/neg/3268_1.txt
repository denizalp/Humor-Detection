I can't write too much about this place because I didn't get much when I went here but I was happy to see they had so many flavours of ice cream. Green tea is my favourite kind of ice cream and usually it is hard to find a flavour of green tea ice cream that isn't very strong but this place has an amazing homemade flavour of green tea ice cream! I'm not a fan of burgers really so I won't be going back for a burger but I will be going back for more dessert items. They had interesting facts on the walls to showing that this place is local to Calgary which was nice to see too!
