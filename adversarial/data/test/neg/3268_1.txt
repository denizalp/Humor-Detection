We went for dinner as it was my first time, but not my friends. We went at a great time as we did not have to wait to be seated. There wasn't a large dinner crowd yet. \n\nFood: the food was decent, however not a lot of seafood choices. Would have like to have a lobster dish, scallop dish something. The desert options were decent + gelato options...great.\n\nService: our server was good. She kept checking on us repeatedly. That was a plus.\n\nAtmosphere: cool little setting\n\nOverall: I'd eat here again
