On a warm Monday night when other places were packed this wasn't too busy. Music was good but not too intrusive. Menu pretty reasonable. I had the fish tacos, which were tasty.  Selection of British beers was a bit limited, but Old Speckled Hen suited me nicely (if a bit cold).  Service was a little on the slow side given the number of people eating.
