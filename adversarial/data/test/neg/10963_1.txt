This show is excellent. The best part was that he explained how he was doing everything. I went in wondering if there would be parlor tricks, but when he explained how he was doing everything, it all made sense. He is absolutely brilliant at what he does after his many years of training himself to be able to do all this stuff. He is also very funny, can be a little raunchy, but it is Vegas. I would recommend this show to anyone who wants to enjoy a show in an intimate setting without all the dramatic music and lights of some of the other more expensive shows.\n\nMy husband bought his book afterward and said that Gerry is a very nice man and seemed to have a very good heart. My husband is enjoying the book and says it is very inspirational. I'm sure I'll read it after I finish my current book.\n\nThis was the only show we saw on this Vegas trip and we were totally satisfied and didn't feel like we wanted to go see another show on a different night.\n\nThe only down thing I can say is that the people who work at that venue are totally clueless as to what is going on and what they should be doing. The venue does run other shows, but front line employees should know what is going on at all times.
