I'll keep this short and sweet unlike their delivery timing. The pizza is decent, kind of like papa johns or pizza but with a better crust. Its definitely not top notch but its good for the price. Its pretty cheap for a Vegas pizza in my opinion. The only ongoing issue I have with this establishment is when ordering on eat24 it states a 45 - 60 minutes wait time for delivery. Every time I order I am contacted shortly after through the app stating the restaurant needs more time. I don't end up receiving my delivery until 1.5 to 2 hours later. This causes a hungry person thinking their food is on the way to become Hangry. Try them if you are on a budget but I wouldn't suggest delivery, just go pick it up.
