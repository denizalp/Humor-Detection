Honestly, if you tell me that you're putting fries on a sandwich, I'm pretty much sold. I got the burger and was so pumped. I thought it was pretty good, but I ended up wishing it were a lot better. Mostly because the fries lacked flavor (so so sad) and the super cold coleslaw on the warm everything else just kind of felt weird texture-wise. I think this place is perfect for college kids, families, and for the stop at a legendary native shop, but I probably would not return.
