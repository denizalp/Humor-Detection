We purchased 2 vehicles in a month from the dealership and have lived to regret both.  Let this serve as a warning to have any vehicle you buy here independently inspected and reviewed. The general manager talked the talk, however he blew me off for months till I gave up on ever getting him to admit their faults or make it right. I'll explain each vehicle in depth, and you can decide for yourself if you want the hassle.... And before they try to say anything.. We bought another BMW in November, and we made sure to buy it anywhere other than from here.\n\nJanuary 2015: I decide I want to trade my 2011 Bmw 128i in for an SUV or Truck.  I've been a loyal bmw customer (128 was my third one). I've always been impressed by the dealer back home in Hawaii, so it was logical to find a semi-local one to where I was working at the time.  I arrive to pick up my car from service with the intention of trading it in. They had a Truck on the lot I wanted and I was ready to make a deal. I knew my credit standing (I do finance for a living), and I specifically told the salesman I wanted to be with the same lender as my prior loan.  We make a deal I was semi happy with (I got less on my trade than I wanted, especially since it was mint and they recertified it to sell as a cpo), and I head south to Arizona (where I was working yet not a resident). I intended to register the truck to property I have in Montana. After a few days I get a call that they found me a cheaper interest rate and I need to sign new docs, I had them fed-ex'd to me.  I needed to go back to Vegas anyway so I delivered them myself.  \n\nAfter delivering the docs, I thought everything was fine and went on my way. Big mistake. I'm beyond picky about my credit. I got letter after letter from banks they submitted my deal through. Every hit still shows up (8+), and I specifically said what lender I wanted.  This is ridiculous and unprofessional. It damaged my credit standing and made it look like I applied for personal, vehicle and other loan types. If you buy a used vehicle here be prepared for them to run it through everyone under the sun looking for whoever will buy the loan and generate the most backend for them! I doubt they would ever do anything to get the inquiries removed, but maybe they will after this.\n\nI tried to get my title paperwork sent to me so I could get it registered...well these \"professionals\" sent my paperwork to Arizona...where I was working (I am a Hawaii resident with property in Montana and Wisconsin).  I was charged THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS $2500+ in taxes and registration I shouldn't have owed.  Actually I've gotten two bills from the state since..one is on my desk now for $690 that pissed me off enough to write this.  The sad thing is, I wanted to register it up north to pay tax where I had property (lower rate as well), and were the truck is at 75% of the time. I also think its ridiculous I was stuck paying hundreds in registration costs, when it should have only cost me $75 if they had just sent me the paperwork like they said so I could register it where I actually live (when on the mainland).\n\nI battled this with the state of Arizona until june of 2015 until they said pay or they will send me to collections.  Thanks again!\n\n\nSince the first day I had the truck it had a vibration.. after replacing half the front suspension it was a pair of bad tires...which subposedly had be checked and were good to go...This cost a fair amount of money to rectify.  I later find out as well that there had been tweeters swapped out for junk instead of the factory sony set. I'll stop there but this truck has been in the shop more than it should have for stuff they should have caught on any level of inspection for someone spending over $40k on it. I bought their warranty (mistake), they take forever to inspect or pay the shop, and they refuse any problem they don't think is bad enough.  \n\nI called the GM, he blew me off saying over and over he'd call me back never to do so.  Idk if he is still there but FYI BMW of LAS Vegas, his actions cost you the sale of a BMW 650I Gran Coupe that we bought from Chapman in Phoenix...who did everything they promised and even got our car the Wisconsin registration and title we needed!\n\nSECOND Part:\n\nI was happy initially so I referred my grand mother to the dealer to buy a used Cadillac SUV... Well they sold her a car that had been in 2 accidents. Both front and rear bumpers were secured with liquid nails like epoxy, and the passenger mirror was glued on to boot. When it started falling apart we took it to a shop only to see the half ass repairs that were not disclosed.  This cost us over $1000 in repairs. Again the GM pulls the we'll make it right card, we'll call you back. He blew us off till we just paid to fix it. Lesson Learned, and we'll never be back...nor will we ever buy from any Autonation dealer!
