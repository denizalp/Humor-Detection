My husband and I always enjoy the food here. It's our \"go-to\" place when we go out. The food has really improved and we love their new menu. There are a lot more choices. Plus the food they served before the menu expansion has really improved. It must be the new chef.\nWe tried a number of dishes and so far they have not disappointed.\nService is always good. Today Kaitlyn served us. She was being trained but was pleasant and did a great job.
