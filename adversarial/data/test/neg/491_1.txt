Overrated. Cliche. Overpriced. Servers were friendly and cafe is very clean and comfortable. Menu has some interesting items and offers something for everyone I suppose. But..... Food is average at best. The cooks are very heavy handed on the details which makes for a muddled meal that is drowned out in sauces and such. And the prices are just bizarre in relation to either the quality or quantity. Given the other options in both Tremont and neighboring hoods, I'd pass and find something else.
