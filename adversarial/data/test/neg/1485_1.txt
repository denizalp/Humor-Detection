Ok...I stomp on my words. \n\nService was fantastic this round. The host was wonderful and accommodating and the food was even better.\n\nVegetarian from NYC was please with her fried zucchini and spanikopita. The other 7 were blown away by the portions and how fresh everything was. \n\nFor the first time I had the scallop bacon brochette and I don't know if I can  ever eat scallops another way again \n\nSo..reviewed my review..tasty and pleasant! !
