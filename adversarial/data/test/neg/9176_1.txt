My husband and I stayed here for several days and we are very glad we did :) The staff was professional, friendly, helpful and it appears that management staff is good also. They have a complimentary breakfast that I think is most excellent.  Their cleaning staff must be excellent because I am super picky and they met my expectations. \n\nBy the way, ask the staff about public transportation because the bus stop is down one block and it will take all over Las Vegas.
