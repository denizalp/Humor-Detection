I love Dr. Sherman! He is so amazing. He has been treating me for about a year now. He has helped manage my pain, make me more comfortable, and helped me improve with procedures and medications.\nHe is very caring and genuine. The staff here payss more attention to detail and goes out of their way to make sure that your questions, concerns, and somtimes very complicated issues are handled. It makes me feel more assured and less stressed when leaving compared to Tempe.
