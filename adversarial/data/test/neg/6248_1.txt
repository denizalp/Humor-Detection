The food is good. I will agree that the quality has changed as I remember coming to this restaurant with my family as a child, but the food is still okay. The service is terrible. I understand there is a language barrier, but respectively I feel customer service is an attitude and you should treat all customers the same. I could not understand the woman at the register and she became very short and upset with me when I was extremely patient and nice. I would suggest they hire someone with more experience working with customers.
