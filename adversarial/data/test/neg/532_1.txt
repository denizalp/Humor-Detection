This is what you'd think of when you think \"old school diner\". It is a great place for someone who's not sure what they want to eat, as they have all day breakfast, Italian, seafood, burgers, deli sandwiches, steaks, soups, turkey dinners, etc. The staff is always amazing and incredibly friendly. We have never had a bad server. If you are someone who likes desert, this needs to be a destination point. There is a whole case of cakes and the slices are gigantic. Not a fancy place, but great for those who love diners.
