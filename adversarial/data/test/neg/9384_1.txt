After finding out about their loyalty club online, I had to stop in & join! I've known about this place for quite some time and never made it here. It is a bit off the beaten path unless your path takes you deep into Summerlin. \n\nThe loyalty club includes gaming promos and a birthday freebie, so count me in! After the bartender signed me up, she told me $10 play would be available right away after earning 20 points. They have a sign above the bar to join their text club, and I did, getting an offer for $20 match play. I was informed that offer was the same as the $10 for earning 20 points. She told me she would put $10 on my card for next time. I shall return! It would be nice to get both offers cause it's confusing as to if they are one and the same offer..........?????\n\nIt's a small place with one big room for dining and gaming\/drinking etc. at the bar. Must be nonsmoking, I believe. Outside seating is also available. The menu has many different apps, meals, etc. to choose from and they have a Sunday steak special for 50% off steaks.
