We highly recommend Nick Corey at All Western Mortgage!  He was immediately responsive and available throughout our loan process.  He assured us he would give us top priority and be available weekends, evenings, or whatever was necessary.  He personally delivered papers to our escrow company in order to see that our closing happened on time.  We moved from California to Nevada and needed someone working with us who could be available by email, text and phone.  He got us pre-approved in short order.  Should we require loan service in the future, we will certainly call upon Nick.
