I just spent 3 straight weeks on my couch designing business cards. Back and forth, millions of changes.  At one point even the company name changed!  Needless to say I was long past when I needed then done. \n\nI showed up on a Friday, at 4:30pm, and a holiday weekend!   But Frank in the Old Town office was able to print me a handful of the new cards (yes, the ones with the right name) for my networking event tomorrow!\n\nFrank, you saved the day!  Thank you!
