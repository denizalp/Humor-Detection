I went here for brunch and was really impressed! Gorgeous views of the pool were with us while we pondered the many breakfast items on the menu. Im an eggs benadict fan and there were three kinds available: traditional, pork, and lobster. I opted for the traditional and it was one of the best Ive ever had! Along with breakfast potatoes and sourdough toast tthe meal was more than I could handle so I just finished my green tea. Our server was very helpful and friendly...I hope to be back soon!
