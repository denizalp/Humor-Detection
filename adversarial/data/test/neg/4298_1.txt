This place has some serious issues. More than once the oder from the floor smelled as if it was moped with a mop that was used in a bathroom. Speaking of bathrooms. I'm sure you've heard that a bathroom speaks everything about what a business is ran like. After seeing the men's room I realized OMG! this place should be shut down by the Health Dept. We asked to be moved to a different side of the restaurant.  The whole place smelled. We left. Didn't oder just left. Won't be back
