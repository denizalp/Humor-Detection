Best massage ever! Could barely move my neck and tried to get an appointment at three different places. This was the only one who could get me in on the same day.  Staff was really friendly and accommodating. Took advantage of a Yelp deal for $10 off and they game me 10 additional mins for free just for checking in. All organic products, full service salon with package deals. They didn't push them  on you either. Must say, this visit turned me into a massage person!  Thank you ladies for making my day!
