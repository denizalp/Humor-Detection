I cannot say enough good things about Allegheny North Veterinary Hospital.  The entire staff from the office staff to the techs to  the doctors is top notch...kind, compassionate  and truly care about your pets.   I've taken several dogs and cats there and have always been happy with their care.  Today I took my 15 year old border collie who has a hard time standing...they spent all of the time on the floor with him checking him over.  If you have pets you need to make an appointment here!
