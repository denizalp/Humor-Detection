I went in with a flat tire and asked for a patch. Being a younger female on a solo tire repair mission, I thought I'd get the \"you need a new tire\" sales pitch, but none of that occurred. Thanks to this team for being friendly from beginning to end, not making me feel like it was the end of the world & being efficient with the repair (took about 30 mins).
