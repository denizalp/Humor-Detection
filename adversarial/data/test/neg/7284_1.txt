My first buffet in Vegas! Came here during lunchtime and I was happy there was a wide variety\/selection but the quality and taste of the food wasn't as good as I'd hoped for. Some of the options are wee too bland while others were too salty. \n\nThe seafood section was one of my favorites. I enjoyed the clams a lot because it had great flavor. The Asian section wasn't too bad.. I enjoyed the noodles mostly. And you can't go wrong with sushi!! \n\nThere was a huge selection of desserts which was awesome! The two that stood out to me were the mousse cake and bread pudding. The total price I payed for lunch was around $37 after tax. Buffets are a must going to Vegas... but this being my first one I have nothing to compare it to.
