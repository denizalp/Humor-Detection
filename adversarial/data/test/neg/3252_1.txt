I've been coming to Tan Republic for quite awhile. I have frequented many tanning salons over the years. What makes this particular salon so unique, is the staff. Morgan and Chantel are so warm and welcoming EVERY time I come in. For being so young, their customer service is beyond exceptional! They are so attentive, and accommodating. I have been in the customer service business for well over 40 years, and you can't teach what they have naturally. I have seen both ladies in tough situations with patrons, and they both handled it with professionalism and maturity. It really is a pleasure going in there after I've had a tough day at work, or just to relax,  knowing that either Morgan or Chantel are going to make my day so much better. Great prices, beds, and excellent customer service by these two young ladies!!!\n\nSincerely, \nSusan Myers
