My go to take out place.   Not close to my home but I make a special trip there every few months and buy 2-3 dozen burros and a load of beans to freeze.  Yum.  Best ever.   Became acquainted with them when I worked near their store on Mohave and have not looked back since.  Now go to the one on Cactus.
