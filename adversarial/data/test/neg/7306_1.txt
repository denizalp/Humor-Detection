A huge thank you to carpet monkeys.\n\nWe had a small flood in the house this weekend, one of our salt water tanks committed suicide, not good, 100 gallons of salt water running through the living room and dining room. Thankfully we have tile in those areas, however we also have a couple of large area rugs which took the brunt of the flood.\n\nCarpet Monkeys were very quick to respond, very fair with the costs and showed up when they said they would.\n\nThe tech did a great job, even after my dog decided he really liked the guy and got a little to friendly (very embarrassing for us, 20 minutes after he left someone from the clean up crew showed up and the dog sat by my side the whole time.....)\n\nAnyways, they have my recommendation and once the drywall is fixed they will be called to clean the tiles.
