Worst place to eat in Vegas!! Right after I was seated my waiter came by and offered to get me water and the only choice he gave me was whether I wanted ice or not. Later, I heard him ask the folks on a nearby table if they would like bottled water, sparkling water or still etc. Then, it took him about 7-8 minutes to come and take my order. And then the food came only 15 minutes later. While I was eating, he never once came to ask me how it was going or whether I wanted anything else. \n\nI had to ask another waiter to get me some hot tea. The edamame was suspect, some pieces were downright mushy. The sushi was only so-so. I have had far better sushi, even at far cheaper restaurants. The sushi rice was not fully cooked and certainly poor in taste. The cloth napkin had a stale oily smell. And the miso soup was too salty. What a waste of money!!
