I came here for the first time about a week ago and this place is just okay. \n\nI'm pretty sure they have some really good dishes despite my poor food choice.\n\nI ordered a teriyaki bowl with chicken and it just tasted really bad. I had asked for no rice so instead I got a very messy black bean soupy salad. The whole combo was just odd to say the least. \n\nI think I would have preferred the beans on the side and I'm surprised that they did not pay attention to this small, but important detail. My whole dish became soggy and was not appetizing at all.\n\nI think next time I'll order some tacos and not subtract anything and hopefully that'll be a better option. I will say that I did try their chips and salsa and those are pretty darn tasty.\n\nOverall this place is alright and I can't wait to try some other items and hopefully I can give this joint a better review next time around.
