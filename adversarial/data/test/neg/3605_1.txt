One of the many hidden gems in Las Vegas.  A must check out spot for any whiskey, bourbon, or cocktail enthusiast looking for an intimate location.  All of the bartenders are a plethora of alcohol knowledge, and will recommend hand crafted cocktails based off of your likings.  From the fireplace, to the stars twinkling above you sitting at the bar you're eyes are often caught looking off into the distance in the little details of this place.  A guaranteed return spot.  And if you're adventurous, I HIGHLY recommend the Comfortably Numb, house, barrel aged cocktail. It is a Delano Las Vegas exclusive woodford reserve double oaked bourbon, Goddard vinalle, and coffee bean- infused carpano.  You will not be disappointed.  The small, intimate food menu is also delicious.  I did not eat anything on this go, but the Toasted Cheese (fdr's favorite) and tomato soup is always my go to!
