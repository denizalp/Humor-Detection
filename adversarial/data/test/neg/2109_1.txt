I have been here twice now to see concerts. I think the atmosphere is awesome. It's usually fairly fast to get into the club, unlike others in Vegas. If you get on a guest list, usually they will let the women in free. It makes for a very long night though, as the acts usually don't come on stage until around 2am. The drinks are very expensive, but that's every club in Vegas of this caliber. It's a great time and place to watch a concert though.
