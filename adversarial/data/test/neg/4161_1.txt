Our visit to this wonderland of cheese was quite possibly the highlight of my friends' and my recent visit to Montreal. Even if the food had been terrible, the scenic brick courtyard with its lush, flowering planters, live jazz band, and oversized umbrellas would've made the dining experience memorable. But luckily, the dinner was great too!\n\nWe tried the brie, pesto, and pine nut fondue as an appetizer, which was served with toasted baguette slices and a bunch of grapes, and which met with enthusiastic reviews from our cheese-loving crowd. A smorgasbord of the signature crepe dinners followed - we sampled the mushroom-filled Forestiere, the vegetable and goat cheese, the apple-bacon, and the duck. At about $15-$20 a plate, we didn't find the cost incongruous with the food quality. For dessert, we sampled the \"pudding chomeur,\" a Quebec favorite that features some sort of spongey, sweet base soaked in maple syrup and served with a side of vanilla ice cream - also delicious, though we were too stuffed to finish the modest portion, even between the four of us!\n\nThe service was equally pleasant; we arrived around 9:30pm on a Saturday night and were seated within ten minutes. Our dry-witted French waiter was a delight, suggesting that a hungry member of our party \"start with one crepe, and then if you're really still hungry I may bring you another,\" and later threatened to deny me dessert for not finishing my main course. English menus are printed on the reverse of the French, for visiting anglophones. \n\nOverall - great decor, food, ambiance, and service. We'll be returning if we're ever in Old Town Montreal again!
