Been here lots of times but the quality is going downhill.  Live music is nice, so is the charcuterie and some basic cocktails are well constructed.  The mains are made with less than fresh ingredients and the service is bad.  I could have put up with gaps in service for good food, but we couldn't come close to finshing our mains because the quality was so poor.  Grab a drink, but find someplace better for dinner.
