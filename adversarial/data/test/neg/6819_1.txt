We came here after I got a craving for some Italian food on the strip. After none of the other restaurants around sounded like the right fit, we decided to check out this little place a shirt walk off the strip. We are so glad we did.\n\nService here was great (had Frank as our waiter as well as Brandon), super friendly. Food wasn't the fastest to come out, but that's not surprising at a good Italian restaurant where you tend to linger over courses.\n\nI ordered the chicken parmigiana with the fettuccine Alfredo on the side. So much food, and the alfredo sauce was the best I've had in a LONG time. Buttery and creamy, amazing flavor without being overly heavy.\n\nAnd, almost most importantly, UNLIMITED WINE. You get a liter carafe at your table, either burgundy or Chablis. The burgundy was surprisingly buttery and smooth for a complimentary wine, and we made our way through two.\n\nNeedless to say, next time we're in Vegas we are coming back at LEAST once. If you're in the area and in the mood for some fantastic Italian food, this is the place to go!
