Amazing food and great customer service! \nMy sister and I, with our 2 children, had lunch here while browsing through the Venetian. We ordered the chicken and waffle, mac and cheese, and corn bread. Everything was delicious! As a local, I'm usually hesitant to eat at the Strip, but we will definitely be back and eat here again!
