Pretty good spread, okay deserts, caviar was nice. But they expect a fat ass $120 for 2 people. This isn't a steak restaurant. And considering we paid a $20 skip the 2 hour wait per person to be VIP...it came out to $170 for two people plus tip. Not worth it if you ask me! But I ate pretty well and it was thanksgiving lunch in Las Vegas, what do you expect? If price was lower, it definitely would have been fine. Maybe $35-$40 a person would be acceptable. Their crab legs were pre-split which was a first for me!
