2\/1\/17\n\nI moved to Casitas 2 months ago and absolutely love it.  My house is everything I could ask for....nice greatroom with counter like an island separating kitchen from rest of room.  Water and ice from the fridge,nice sized rooms, shower in master....my favorite!  And light coming in from everywhere and most of all, no one over my head!\n\nThe property is maintained well with nice botanical touches.  It is clean and quiet.  And the staff are icing on the cake. I was not here when some people were dissatisfied but they now all compliment Megan and her team and I solidly agree.  Megan, as well as Kim, and also Taylor, are always available and responsive to whatever your needs might be.  They are also just nice people and fun to interact with.\n\nMaintenance is wonderful and whatever you ask for is responded to within a day.\n\nKudos to all of you\n\nRuth
