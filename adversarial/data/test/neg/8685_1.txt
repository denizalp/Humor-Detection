Fantastic pizzas and the best in Toronto! I had the margarita pizza and it was perfect. The sauce was flavourful and a tiny bit sweet, the cheese was nice and gooy, and the crust was thin and crispy. The venue was very modern and hip and service was phenomenally fast, friendly, and not pushy at all. This place puts to Pizziolo or Mama's Pizza to shame. This place is well worth the extra dollars you'll pay for your pizza. It's about $14-17 per pizza but your extra loonies goes towards the freshest ingredients. Pro tip: There's a small patio outside so snag it if you're lucky. Worth every penny!
