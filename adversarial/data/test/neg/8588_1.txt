I love this restaurant, I don't remember how many times I have came here and I always enjoyed their food and service.  I've been to so many Chinese Sichuan (Sczchuan) and Cantonese restaurants in Phoenix area, Chou's is the only one which actually makes authentic Chinese flavors (northern style Chinese food). In the past I took many of my coworkers came here,  they all became regulars. My favorite dishes are spicy beef, tripe, and tendons; lamb skewer; beef\/pork pies; beef\/pork fried buns, green bean with pork; and fish filet in hot chili oil. Just great!
