We found this joint thanks to Groupon last year.  Since that first visit, we've been here a couple more times.  It's in a shopping center just off Mayo & Scottsdale Rd....for some reason, this shopping center doesn't do very well, places close down frequently.  We're happy that this hasn't. \n\nHere are some items we've had here:\n\nMexican Bean Dip, $4.99\n\nSpinach Con Queso, $5.99 \n\nNachos, $8.99\n \nOwner's Chimichanga (Shredded Chicken, Black Beans, Cheese, Rice, Pico de Gallo Charrio Sauce w\/Jalapeno Cream Sauce and Green Chili Sauce, Sliced Poblano Peppers, Cheese, Shredded Lettuce and Sour Cream), $13.99 \n\nUltimate Chimichanga (Roasted Pork, Rice, Pinto Beans, Cheese, Green Chili Sauce and Pico de Gallo), $15.99\n\nThe food is very good.  My fav's are the Nachos & the Ultimate and Owner Chimichangas.  The Bean Dip and Spinach con Queso are very good too, but if you get those don't get a large entree like the Chimichangas because it's too much food.\n\nThe servers are friendly.  The restaurant can get packed during happy hour and peak dinner hours.\n\nOverall, it's a nice neighborhood family restaurant.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%
