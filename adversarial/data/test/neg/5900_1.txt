Booked a massage while I was on vacation and I wish I had a therapist like this back home. The therapist JD found pressure points I was unaware I had and made suggestions for future appointments back home. I left feeling so relaxed I went home and took a four hour nap. He even took the time at the end of the session to ask if there was any more he could have done to make it better. The professionalism by everyone from start to finish was great. I would highly reccomend this location and if you want to be totally relaxed book with JD.
