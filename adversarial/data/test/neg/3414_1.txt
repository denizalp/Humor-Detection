Wanted a close, local gym that I can go to. I found One-to-One through CWRU. \"Discounted\" $39 per month membership. It's slightly overpriced, which I don't mind but my problem is that the equipment is outdated, so you are not getting what you pay for. Cardio equipment is OK, but the weight room is SO old. The weights are RUSTING! They are rusting so badly, you can smell it on your hands afterwards (don't ask why I am sniffing my hands) and if you know what I am talking about, you KNOW that is gross. I haven't gone in the pool so I can't comment on that. One thing I enjoy here are the classes, they are worth checking out. Otherwise, no point in joining this gym. I am terminating my membership, as the classes alone are not enough to keep me.
