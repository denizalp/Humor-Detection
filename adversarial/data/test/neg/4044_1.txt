Not much to say here about the food - its the same as all the other Chipotle locations. However today, I felt that the service was a little bit poor. I know not to expect a lot for a fast food place, but geez when I took 2 seconds to decide on my toppings, I felt like the people behind the counter were really kind of irritated with me. And there wasn't even really a line behind me or anything.  Food was good as usual, love that medium salsa. Place is clean and looks nice from the outside.
