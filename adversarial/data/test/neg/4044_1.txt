Cafe Neon\n\nYet another spot on my list I finally got to.\nOn the perfect sunny Sunday too. \n\nThere's a large seating space in the back so don't be fooled by the mini area in the front.\n\nThe menu for brunch is pretty standard: a big breakfast, omelettes and bennies. I opted for the standard breakfast with chicken sausage. I always worry about ordering sausages because you know that can be so hit and miss. This was surprisingly delicious and not what I expected. Definitely in house or at least not the norm.\n\nThe customer service is a little all over the place. I wasn't sure at one point where our server had gone.\n\nFood is solid!
