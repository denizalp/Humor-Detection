We were excited to try this restaurant for the first time. However, we could not even be seated. Upon entering the owners sent out there Daughter, who was probably no more then 8 years old to tell us they are not seating people because they just had a large group walk in. I get it got busy, but it was only about 3:30pm and if your a restaurant you have to learn to deal with having rushes on Saturdays. Not only that but if you can't seat people at this time be professional and have an adult tell us about how long it will take to be seated, we might have been willing to wait. In reality it was only two of us and we could have just sat at the bar. Very bad customer service skills. I expected more from a local small town restaurant.
