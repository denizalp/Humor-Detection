This is the closest buffet to me, so I've been here quite a bit, but usually only for special occasions.\n\nI did go here though on their half price Tuesday's. If you're looking to get a quick bite, Tuesday's wouldn't be the day to go. I think my boyfriend and I waited at least a minimum of 30 mins ... Though I think it was longer.\n\nFood is great, but not Mandarin quality. The dessert options are poor though.
