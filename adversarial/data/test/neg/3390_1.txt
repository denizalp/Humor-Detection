Started with an immediate greeting followed by a torn, disgusting menu. I ordered the chef salad without meat. For $10.50 I got a small bowl of lettuce--at least it was fresh, one slice of American cheese, 1\/2 a hard boiled egg and a tiny portion of banana nut bread. I decided to get dessert. Small hot fudge sundae. It was a decent size and they were fair with the hot fudge topping. I did not want whipped cream. The sundae was average.  I see m reason to return.  Server Brittany was very good.
