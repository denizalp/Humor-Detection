Great house brews (the porter was as good as any I've had anywhere) and an extensive soup to nuts brewpub menu at extremely reasonable prices. We tried the guac\/bacon burger, ahi poke app and the salmon quinoa bowl....all hits, no misses. For a. chain brewpub, this place is pretty hard to argue with. Big nicely laid out room with perefectly nice servers. \n\nCan't go wrong here. At this price point, the place is a no-brainer.
