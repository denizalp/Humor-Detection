NOTE: they now accept credit cards. It is no longer a cash only place. A lot of reviews say it's cash only which almost detoured me.\n\nThe food was good. I do not eat Thai food often. The yellow curry was pretty good. 1-10 spice level like normal. I do not see why people rave about the spring rolls. Very average but not bad. The pad Thai has a sweet flavor that I enjoyed but I could see some people who would not like it. Give it a try and see what you think.
