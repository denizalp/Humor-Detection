To Paul E.'s comment below. Maybe the issue is with your paediatrician suggesting in the first place that you should take your child to emerg if she only had a cold. Of course you need to wait a long time since the sniffles doesn't constitute as an emergency. I'm surprised they didn't send you home straight away. Seriously.
