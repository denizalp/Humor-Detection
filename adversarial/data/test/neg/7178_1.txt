Great company!  Terry was very responsive to my quote.  We worked out a moving time that was beneficial to both of us, even though the move was only four days away from when I called.  I wasn't sure I had three hours of moving; turns out, it was more!!  He gave me a quote and told me how much I'd be charged for any time after the amount of time he estimated.  I liked how they billed on the half hour instead of every hour.  If I didn't need a whole hour, I would save a little money.  :)\n\nTwo friendly guys showed up on moving day, easily and carefully moved all my items out of my house and into their truck.  They were professional and courteous.  Worked hard and were fun to move with!  Great personalities.  :)  They helped make me feel at home in my new building, making sure everything was put in the right place.  I'm so glad I hired Above Average Moving!!  Thank you for everything!!!
