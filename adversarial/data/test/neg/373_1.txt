I've always enjoyed coming into DQ. The ice cream is always delicious and the food is pretty good. \n\nThe service was great. Got a friendly greeting going in and was promptly served. The young lady was very friendly and polite. \n\nOrdered the #2 Flamethrower burger combo, it was nice and hot getting to my table. The fries were piping hot and crispy. It was a very good lunch.\n\nI'll look forward to returning here in the near future.
