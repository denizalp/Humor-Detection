They don't actually care about their customers. That's the problem with these type of warehouse stores! Theres no SERVICE anymore. I called the tire department. No one answers. I go to the actual store.... I stand there for 15 to 20min waiting for someone to help!!! To top it all off, when I speak with a Manager, Bill, he didn't apologize! He justified the ineptitude by saying \"Don't you always have to call someone to help anyway\"???\nSeriously??????\nNot only that but he alluded to the fact the tire dept has a phone in their garage area but ignore calls on purpose!\nIt's not hard to have some part-timer stand in the this section ready to take questions for a given period in the day. Not only that, their general workers aren't nearly as helpful as they used to be. Attitudes! If you can avoid places like these, Do it!
