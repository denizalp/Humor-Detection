Not sure how we found out about this place, but I am definitely glad that we did! It was absolutely amazing and worth the trek. \n\nFor $10, you get 1\/2 portuguese bbq chicken, a salad, rice, a mountain of french fries and a dinner roll. Definitely enough food for two hungry tummies! \n\nWe're not the spicy food type, so when she asked if we wanted it spicy we were quick to say no! I kid you not, she gave us a look as if we were weenies :[ so we hesitantly changed our minds and asked for it spicy. Let me tell you that sauce is phenomenal, it would not have been the same without it! Its vinegary and sweet with just enough kick. By the end of the meal, we were soaking up the spicy sauce with our fries just to make sure we didn't waste a drop of it. The fries are delicious on their own. just the right seasoning.\n\nSuch a great deal for a great amount of delicious chicken and fries heaven! I wish they had a place like this in LA. \n\nI must warn you though, its a small corner establishment. Not much room to sit and eat. So do figure out other places you can park it and enjoy your meal!
