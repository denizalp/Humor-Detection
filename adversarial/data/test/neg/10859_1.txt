Two of us went for lunch. I ordered a steak sandwich. My buddy who cant make up waited like 5 minutes to order and then ordered a sandwich. They made his sandwich and he paid. I was still waiting. I asked whats the holdup and it turned out they never made it. I watched the one guy put my stuff on the grill and the other guy scooped it up and and put it in the fridge. I will not be going back.
