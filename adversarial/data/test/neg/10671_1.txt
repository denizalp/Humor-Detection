So the service is fine but the food is super bland. I got spaghetti with meatballs and it had no flavor. Don't be afraid to add garlic, salt, flavor! Oye vey! My husband got the lasagna, same thing... taste like nothing. My kid got a pizza which was huge but greasy and average. Overall it's a little expensive for what you get. Large portions but no taste. Ugh.
