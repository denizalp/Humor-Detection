I can't speak for the other dishes, but the beef noodle soup here is really good! They have both spicy and non-spicy versions, and the flavor is great for both. This is probably the most authentic Chinese restaurant I've had on the strip. It can be a bit pricy, but it's the strip and everything is pretty overpriced. The wait can get kinda long if you go during meal hours. It's open late though, so if you're looking for some nice hot soup after drinking\/clubbing, it's definitely a great option.
