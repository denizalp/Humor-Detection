First thing to catch my eyes were the servers - the girls are HOT - the bartender is a 10+ - yet very sweet.\nThey have my favorite beer on tap - Tennants. Big kudos for that.\nWings are large - but what they call hot is 7\/10. Even asked them to tun the heat up on the wings but to no avail. The place is a sausage fest with 10 men for every one lady. \nOverall - servers 9 - food - 7
