I had the morning to myself and was a bit nervous to go on my own.  I was worried that the character actors would be too intimidating. I finally decided they would leave me alone if I didn't want to participate. Ha!  The joke was on me, and I have thoroughly enjoyed laughing at myself. \nThis place was so much fun. I found myself playing along in the excitement, making up stories and sweating nervously. Well done!
