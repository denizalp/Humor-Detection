First time checking out this restaurant and it'll now be our go-to for Japanese.  I was a bit worried at first as we were the first ones in for dinner but then within half an hour, about ten other patrons came, whew!\n\nWe enjoyed our teriyaki and tempura bento boxes; tried both salmon and beef.  First came a mini vermicelli soup and small fried fish bites; we thought this was unique.  Our bento boxes came with miso soup, salmon\/beef, udon noodles, house salad, two pieces of California rolls, rice and five tempura pieces.  Food was tasty, no complaints, fast service and for $9.95, we were really amazed with the spread.  We've been to several other sushi restaurants on Dixon and Steeles and this place offers way better value.  I like having variety in my entrees and especially likes the nice variety in my bento boxes.  Took a look at the prices for their other offerings as well and they are very well-priced.  Will make it a point to try other items next time.  Glad we discovered this place!
