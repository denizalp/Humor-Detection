Since this place is near our Vegas home, we've been wanting to hit it for a while. There is a serious lack of dinner options in our part of town. Any how, made reservations on Thursday for Saturday night, no issues. We arrived at 7pm to find a jammed packed restaurant. But were seated immediately, huge plus in my book.for as busy as they were, our waitress was on it. Took the drink order, Wifey says her Bloody Mary was great. Rest of us had iced tea. Did 3 appetizers, the Ranch Wings, the Mushrooms and Crab Cakes. All were good, nothing awesome, but good. For main course, I did the Porterhouse, Wifey did Lobster with Filet, Son #2 had the Porterhouse, Son #3 had the Sirloin and our friend had the Filet. \nMy Porterhouse was perfect, I mowed through it. I also had the baked potato and the Lobster Bisque soup, damn good. Wifey says her Lobster was crazy good, but she took her Filet home for later. \nSon #2 reported his Porterhouse was dry and half was over cooked. Son #3 disappeared his Sirloin and reported it was great, he also loved the Crab Cake appetizer. Over all, a great dinner with exception of Son #2 getting a over cooked Porterhouse. But when I saw the giant open fire grill, completely covered in steaks, I realized I'd of over cooked one or three of them too. This place is a prize, I love anywhere in Las Vegas that is not full of tourists. Would recommend.
