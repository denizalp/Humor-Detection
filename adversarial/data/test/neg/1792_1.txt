This was some of the best, most authentic Mexican food I have had. This was our first time going, we went at 11:30 and the place was packed. To me that's a great sign! We had chimichangas and both types of tamales. People pile in to wait in line and find a seat. They do serve margaritas, but we just had a quick lunch and will try them next time. Fun fast paced atmosphere. Food was amazing, our kids devoured the leftovers on us. We cannot wait to go there again for margaritas and something new to try!! A+++++
