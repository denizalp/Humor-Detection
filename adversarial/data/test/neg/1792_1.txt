The service here is probably the worst of any restaurant I've been to, and it makes me miss the days when Hash House was at M. I've had friendlier service at Arby's (for real).\n\nThe food is so-so and comes in huge portions. I always order the sage fried chicken plate with mashed potatoes, two eggs and a biscuit -- today, the eggs were runny, so much so that there was a yellow liquid pooling underneath that made the eggs look like they were sitting in soup. The fried chicken was really dry and lukewarm on top of that, and the mashed potatoes had zero flavor. \n\nSometimes restaurants have off days with the food,  but there's never any excuse for poor service. Our waiter (I think his name was Brian) was so busy legitimately giving my family a hard time for ordering basic breakfasts -- he says, why order a basic when you're at a restaurant with so many creative options -- that he screwed up my uncle's order and forgot to add the extra egg. \n\nOn top of that, all but one dish was brought out at the same time, so we were half finished by the time my aunt got her breakfast. I got up to find our waiter, but he blew right past me so I asked the hostess if she could check on what was going on. A few minutes later, we flagged him down and instead of apologizing, we get a lecture about how all the food is brought out fresh as it's finished -- that's cool, but it should have been better timed and he could have at least given us a heads up we'd be waiting an extra 15 mins after everyone else got served. To boot, we had to snag a hostess to pour coffee for the table after we only got served one cup in the 45 minutes we'd been sitting there. \n\nFor people who thought this spot could replace the one at the M, it doesn't . Try your luck elsewhere. \n\nQuick tip: they don't have the 55+ menu at this location.
