When it was called Gado Gado, I would drive by and think about stopping but not doing so.  What is a Gado and why are there two of them?  What kind of food would a Gado serve and would I like it?  Is it even a restaurant or is it some strange club where I would be abducted and turned into a Gado?? \n\nI drove by and saw it was Cafe 157 and stopped in for a drink.  I love re-purposed spaces and this is a restaurant inside of an old bank.  The drive thru stalls are now home to a killer patio and the former bank atmosphere leads to a semi-dimly lit restaurant.  For a not-so attractive guy like me, lower lighting works great (as does temporary blindness FYI).  \n\nAt the bar, I met one of the owners and she told me that I was seriously over-thinking the Gado's.  In fact, they even reward their loyal customers with their names on the bar stools.  Yes, I like that!  The bar is positioned in a way as to not overwhelm the dining room and there's not a tv every foot as seems to be so popular in restaurants today (probably to distract from the mediocre food).  \n\nAfter a few tasty drinks, I decided to partake in desert which was a chocolate cake.  It was so good that I later convinced another patron to get it as well.  \n\nGado, I mean Cafe 157 is definitely a place that look forward to returning and trying other items on their menu or just dropping by for a cocktail on the way home.
