I just had one of the best fish dishes ever at this place. Highly recommend the steamed halibut! Comes in a spiced tomato soup puree with avocado\/guac on top. So good Im already craving it again. If you dont like cilantro ask for it without. \n\nCoworkers seemed to enjoy the mahi mahi and salmon sandwiches. Bread basket also comes with cornbread muffins. Service was fast and excellent.
