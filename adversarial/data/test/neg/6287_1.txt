Great experience. Went on a late Tuesday night; there was live jazz by young musicians and a solid crowd. Ate sweet potato fries for appetizer; they were tasty without too much oil, and the side condiments were flavorful, especially the spicy\/sweet jam. BBQ Pork entree was good if not a bit too juicy, but good flavor. Side salad was excellent with interesting combo of ingredients of dried apple pieces, radishes, onions, mixed greens, and a tasty vinaigrette. Would go again and would recommend for quality of food, atmosphere, and service.
