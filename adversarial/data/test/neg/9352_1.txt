Poulet Bleu is a great new establishment, and the highest praise I can heap is that (for once) you don't realize that you're dining at a DeShantz restaurant.  \n\nThe food is great, and the selection of small plates and side dishes is really extensive, particularly compared to other French restaurants in town.  I particularly enjoyed the frisee salad with poached egg. \n\nThe shining star of Poulet Bleu is the atmosphere and decor.  It looks fabulous inside and out (we had a lovely night on the patio), and you genuinely could be in the middle of Paris.  The service was also attentive and quite good. \n\nSome of the prices for dishes seemed high, but that's increasingly the new normal for nicer restaurants in Pittsburgh, and it's not out of line with what you see at any other similar restaurant.  \n\nHighly recommend!
