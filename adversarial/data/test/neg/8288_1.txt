Terrible, terrible, terrible!! These people are completely unable to do their jobs. How hard is it to ring people up and hand out the food? I have never had such horrible service! I went through the drive thru and pulled around to pay. There was a young lady standing there talking to a man with her back to me. I sat there for  minute, she would not turn around. I decided to pull up to the next window and sat there for minute. I finally pulled away. I also had an experience last week also. My daughter and I went thru the drive thru for some french fries. They were making them fresh so we pulled over to wait. Fifteen minutes later I walked in to the restaurant , the workers had no clue I had been waiting. While I was standing at the counter waiting for my food another lady came to the counter and complained about the fries also. The  Manager was very nice and refunded my money. This store needs HELP! So sad.
