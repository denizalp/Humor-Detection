The tequila was good but it went down hill after that. The chips are crisp and good but the salsa was pretty bland. We got a beef and a pork taco. You could not really tell the difference other than the texture of the meat. It as was bland and luke warm. We also ordered one of their signature dishes a stuffed poblano pepper. Halfway through it was cold. And also bland. Bland and cold do not make good Mexican food. Really need a do over here.
