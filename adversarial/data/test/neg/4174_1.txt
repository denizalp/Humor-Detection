Came here for lunch while in Vegas. The restaurant was busy, but we were seated right away. Lots of TV's that had the football game on. Server was very nice and quick. I felt the meal was just ok. I ordered the club and it was dry. Barely any mayo on it. My husband felt the same about his sandwich and too much bread. Prices were reasonable.
