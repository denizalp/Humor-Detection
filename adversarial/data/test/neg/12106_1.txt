This is a great Peruvian restaurant. We have been here several times, my wife is Peruvian, and we know Peruvian food well. Today we had the lomo saltado, this is a great dish that many Americans love, and Tumi prepares it well. We also had the ahi de gallina, also great here. I have ordered the pollo a la brasa many times here and you can't go wrong with that either. Great food and great service.  We'll keep coming back!
