Went to the pharmacy once here and I never want to go back. It was my first time coming here and I was treated like some junkie trying to get high. If you want to get interrogated by a pharmacy tech this is your place. \n\nUpdate: last time I was here they accused me of pharmacy shopping and told me if I wanted to get my script filled I would have to permanently get my scripts from here. Ok, so fast forward one month and they no longer carry my prescription. What a joke this place is.
