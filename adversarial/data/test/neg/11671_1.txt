My daughter's cat decided to use her couch and her stairwell as a litter box. I walked in the house and couldn't believe the smell. I was only going to be in town for 3 days and was a little nervous about being able to get someone out right away. I checked yelp and liked the reviews for Carpet Monkey. I call them Monday at 9am and Mary answered the phone. I told her my problem and she said she would have someone out to my house by noon that day. Right at noon Kyle came to my front door. He was polite, listened to all of the problems I had and even suggested he could fix the stair carpet where the cat had used it as a scratch pole. He used enzymes on my couch, cleaned it. He cleaned the carpet under the couch and up the stairwell. He fixed my carpet and it looks perfect. I can't believe how wonderful the house smells now and how well the carpet was fixed. If you have a problem with your cat this is the company to call. Kyle also explained everything he was doing . I would highly recommend Carpet Monkeys if you need help with your carpets or your furniture.
