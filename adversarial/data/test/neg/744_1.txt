We choose this restaurant for dinner one night because i wanted sushi but, my girlfriend doesn't eat it. So we needed a restaurant that had both a full menu and sushi to accommodate both of us. Sushi was very good, typical prices and she had the salmon which she said was good. All in all i would recommend this place but, it is a little pricey...very up scale.
