Definitely keep an eye out on your bank account if you use any Hertz location but especially this one.  My husband and I rented a car here on June 18-June 22, 2018. \n\nOn 20th of June I went to check my bank and saw a charge of $109. So I called the Hertz and they said the fee was for returning our car with out gas so they charged us a gas fee.  Problem is we hadn't returned the car yet.  We weren't scheduled to return the car until the 22nd. I was told by employee that the fee would be returned to me no problem and that they had made a mistake. \n\nOn the 22nd when we were supposed to return the car we had to deal customer service because our car was still marked as checked in. This took a little bit of time which caused us to miss our flight and caused stress for the rest of the day trying to figure out a new game plan. \n\nI called again on 24th only to be told I needed to have a receipt for my gas from when we returned the car on Friday to get my money back even though we had no problem with gas on Friday because we had filled it up before returning it and did not get an extra charge. I had called again on the 25th and again on the 26th and finally talked to the one competent person that works for Hertz to get them to understand that they needed to return the money the deducted from my account for gas for a car we hadn't check in yet and that a fee should not have been deducted from my account in the first place.  Still waiting for my money to show up in my account.....\n\nWe recommend if you want great deals, great service and great cars you use Enterprise.  We have a great experience every time.
