Really enjoyed our dinner here. The service was wonderful & the food was definitely very good. We made reservations for Thurs evening. It was not busy at all. \n\nI think the prix fixe menu is very enticing (price & food). It was a bit difficult to narrow down the choices. In the end, we went w\/ the ...\n\nclam chowder - not the usual creamy style we are used to having. but tasty & good,  bit different & lots of clam\nJambalaya (rice) - the sausage was good! \nCreme Brulee - they certainly didn't cheap out on the ingredients, the surface was hard & crunchy on a nice sized plate. Could've eaten more :D\n\nSeafood fondue (shrimp, scallops, crab and mushrooms) - so cheesy and yummy!!!! save ur bread for this.... there's too few Ciabatta & Cheddar jalape√±o bread for dipping. you could get full just from eating this.\nBourbon Street Crab Cakes (entree) - came w\/ 3 crab cakes. they were ok. i've def. had better crab cakes somewhere but it was not bad at all. It was also served w\/ creole rice (sausage & chicken) & some veggies \n\nThe service was excellent. The food came fast & everyone was polite. Definitely can't wait to be back sometime soon... Would be awesome to come here for dinner then attend a play afterwards on King Street :)
