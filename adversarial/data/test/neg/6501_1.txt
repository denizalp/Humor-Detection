Great beer selection, decent to great food, much improved staff.\n\nI usually come here for my fix for delicious German\/Belgian beers on tap. They have a large tap menu, and a great bottled beer menu (but you have to ask for it!). The beer has been great, although I did get a pretty sour Delirium Tremens once. I assume it was at the end of the keg. Aside from that hiccup, it's been great.\n\nFor food, their maple-glazed shortrib was fantastic. Their spatzel and blueberry duck, not so much. Stick to their heavier meals like stews and lambs, because they do them well. Their fries are really good, too. The rest should be ignored.\n\nAs for the staff, at first they were kind of stand-offish and not terribly knowledgeable. They're now well-seasoned and the ones I've had lately have been extremely nice. Great improvement.\n\nThis place fills up fast, so get there ASAP!
