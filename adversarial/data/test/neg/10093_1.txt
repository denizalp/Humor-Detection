Hands-down the best dining experience I have ever had. We were so impressed with the food and service that we booked the gorgeous private dining room for my mom's 60th birthday party. The staff, especially Stass, were so unbelievably accommodating. The owner, Albino, was an absolute gentleman and made the experience so easy and wonderful. With over 10 entree options, there was something on the set menu for everyone and the food was as delicious as when we had dined here the first time. Would 1000% recommend, cannot fangirl enough about Chiado.
