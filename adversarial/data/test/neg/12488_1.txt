I was on my vacation and went to Montreal. I found this place as I walked around town with my friends and decided to stop by. It was the best meal that we had in Montreal. Their Banh Mi is authentic and it was better than any Banh Mi restaurants here in my hometown, LA.  My friends and I chose different kinds of Banh Mi that they offered us. I got the Roast Pork or Porc RÃ´ti, the meat was chewy and a little bit juicy. Along with their special sauce, I felt like the food melted in my mouth as I chewed. It gave a nice flavor along with all the condiments, such as pepper, cucumber, and cilantro. The pate and mayo were fanstatic, they tasted sooooooo yummyyyy! \nMy friends chose the Special, BBQ pork, And Grilled Chicken and all of them said it was very yummy and tasty. Their bubble teas were awesome too \nAlso, the restaurant was very clean and neat and it made me feel warm and cozy the moment I stepped in. Inside the restaurant were pictures about Banh Mi, and Letters on the wall behind the counter were bomb! \nThe service was incredible, the owners were both friendly and we felt very comfortable there. We decided to come back before we went back to LA though and I'm craving the Roast Pork banh mi now \nAnyway, I can't even complaint anything about this place!
