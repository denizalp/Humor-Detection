I had a recent cleaning at Bella Smiles and was very impressed with how the hygienist remembered me from four months prior and asked questions relevant to my needs. She took the time to make some care suggestions and did a fantastic job on cleaning my teeth. The wait time was under 5 minutes. I highly recommend this place!!
