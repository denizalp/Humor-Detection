Wow, what a great breakfast.  A little bit of a wait on a Thursday morning, the day after a U2 concert and the morning if a playoff hockey game.\nThe pancakes are really different, they call the crepe style, so kind of halfway between a crepe and a pancake, with crispy edges.  I got the strawberry one, very good but I could actually taste the sugar granules in the sour cream filling.\nThe eggs were solid, the bacon fantastic!!
