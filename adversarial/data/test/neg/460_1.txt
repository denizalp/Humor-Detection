Managed to get a great deal by booking several months in advance at this hotel and glad we did.\n\nThe hotel appears to be brand new and is modern and elegantly designed.\n\nThe rooms are well appointed and beautifully furnished...  there was a little noise from other guests, but not obtrusive.\n\nThe free use of Gold's Gym was also a great bonus ...\n\nAll in all, we loved it and would not hesitate to return...
