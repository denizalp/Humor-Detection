This place is as good as it gets when you're craving some good old fashioned burgers and fries.  Always packed both inside and at the drive-thru, but the workers are always super friendly and the food is always consistently good, fast to come out and perfectly assembled.  Burgers are amazing, fries are delicious (and definitely fresh cut), and milkshakes are da bomb! You also can't beat the prices!!!  Definitely our go-to burger joint!  I don't think I'll ever be able to live in a town that doesn't have an In-N-Out ever again!  It's that serious.
