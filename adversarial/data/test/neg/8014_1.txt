I was in Las Vegas temporarily for 6 months, and used Safe Ship for my mail. Had a great experience using these guys - they were always friendly, helpful and even held my mail after I went back to Florida and shipped it to me once I had a new address to give them. \n\nOne time I had a perishable package delivered there, and they called me right away to let me know about it. Very professional and I recommend them highly.\n\nCharles Weiss\nLargo, FL
