Finally found a service shop that is honest and cheaper than the dealership. Guaranteed work. Replace my broken tail light, no charge. Explains the problem well and offered to give me the replaced items. They even told me to hold off on a rear brakes replacement as there's still some miles left on them. Good work, no more problems with my BMW. This place is well run.
