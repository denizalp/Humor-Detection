Update 2\/13\/17: We received an exchange, and were able to return the boxsprings but have reached out 5+ times in an attempt to speak with someone about the extremely negative experience we had, and the fact that it took 2 months for an acceptable product to be delivered, with no success. The response I continue to receive is \"we have updated your account and someone will reach out to you\" - which never happens. Extremely disappointed by their ability to fix issues in a timely and acceptable manner. \n\nWe had a good experience when purchasing our new mattress, but the problems started and continued with delivery. There was a huge buckle\/crease in the mattress, and I was assured that it would settle. I really considered refusing delivery and wish I had. It's a good 4-5 inch bump. Rather than settling, it got worse. \n\n3 weeks later, we requested an exchange and were told it would be no problem. We even spent an additional $200 on a new boxspring, to accommodate our new bed. \n\nThe delivery team arrived almost 45 minutes AFTER the 2 hour delivery window with no apology, and immediately pulled out a cell phone. They began to take photos of the dirt smudges my dog had just caused by jumping on the bed that i had stripped anticipating delivery - and rather than listen when I explained the \"stains\" were just dirt they ignored me, spoke in Spanish to each other (incorrectly assuming I did not understand them) and attempted to call for approval 5 times in front of me, being put to voicemail each time. \n\nThey left the house, returned to the door stating they were told not to remove the mattress (which was clearly a lie because I watched them attempt to call and noted how they said to each other in Spanish that he \"never answered after 7pm\" after the first rejected call) & left. No mention of the fact that they were supposed to deliver my new box springs, which I'd already paid for. They then told me to contact the store.  \n\nAt this point I want to return everything and never do business with them again. I was told to keep a defective mattress in hopes the issue would correct, notified the store when it did not, providing pictures, and went out of my way to arrange my schedule to be home for a \"2 hour window\" that turned into almost 4 hours by the time they left. With no new mattress. Horrible experience.
