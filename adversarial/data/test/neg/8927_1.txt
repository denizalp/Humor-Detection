Went there twice this week. Once for dinner with my husband, and once for lunch. We sat on the patio at a table under one of the cabanas. It was nice and relaxing. This is not a place you want to go when you are in a rush or on a quick lunch break. It takes a long time to savor the food and the atmosphere, and I think that's what the restaurant is going for. The food is excellent. For dinner I had the halibut which was excellent. For lunch I had the crab ravioli, also delicious. Everyone else's food looked amazing as well. A lovely atmosphere and very nice for a no rush lunch.
