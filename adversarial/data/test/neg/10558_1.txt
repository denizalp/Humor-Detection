Went here this last Saturday and I have no complaints. It's ALOT better than most chain restaurants like Applebee's and Chili's. Hostess was sweet and our server was attentive and funny. They had a good special on beer which the boyfriend loved. They also had plenty of deals like an entree with an app for 15 and many others that were similar. We ordered the potstickers for the app which were pretty good. Boyfriend got the appetizer sampler for his meal. A plate of meat so and he had complaints. And I got the sirloin medium and it was cooked to perfection. It wasn't packed when we got there around 3pm so I will definitely be coming here instead of attempting to maneuver the CCMills food court.
