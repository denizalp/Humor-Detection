Best record store in Charlotte and they are expanding!!! Lunchbox is currently working on a new location that is less than a mile from the current one but will be much bigger! It should make browsing records a lot easier. The current location is popular and can be hard to see all that they offer. \n\nI love the mix of new and used that LB offers. I'm a vinyl lover myself but they have cassette tapes and CDS as well. They even have turntables and t-shirts available. The staff is very helpful and will order almost anything that is still in press. \n\nLunchbox has an overwhelmingly popular Record Store Day event. The line was hours long this year but they had live music and gave away lots of records.
