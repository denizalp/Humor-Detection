Took my fur-babies there...by far best grooming experience ever! \n\nWe went on a 4 mile hike with the babies two days before my appointment so they were matted & gritty, (& my Shih Tzu was completely brown). When I picked them up they were both soft and smelled wonderful. Santana (my Shih Tzu) was nice & bright! Usually when I take him to other groomers they say I have to pay extra for whitening shampoo & it'll take a couple of appointments for it to show, but w\/ GHI I didn't have to pay extra, & he was back to white after the first bath. The knots had been cut\/brushed out. They listened & executed the exact cut I wanted for them. Not one mark (as in cut of scratch) on them... I checked throughly because I'm very protective of them. They were both very excited when we got there to pick them up vs when we pick them up from any other groomer (they are usually shy and quiet when I pick them).\n\nMy babies look perfect again. I'm definitely coming back! Excellent job GHI!
