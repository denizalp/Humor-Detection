I really like to thank the phoenix police dept for all their help in helping us with a apartment building  that has  had many issues.  we have made progress  and have cut down on vandalism\/theft\/trespassing\/squaters  etc . We could of not done it with out you . It seemed like everyday  we were calling you for assistance and each time you  responded you were courtesy\/professional\/concern and offered great customer service. we worked as a team to  transform this apartment building to  a better place to live for our  tenants. we will be forever thankful .Even when we did not call you  u were in the area patroling. Once again thank you so much . You are appreciated and respected . Joyce m
