Haven't been there in over a year, last time wasn't so good. I heard they had new owners and some of the menu changed. We went this past Saturday night and we were more then pleasantly surprised. 1st of all the drinks were very reasonably priced and the staff could not have been any friendlier or accommodating. The menu still, had some of the old favorites like Chicken Paprikash which my wife had. It was far better then the last time she had it. We started with the stuffed fried artichokes as an appetizer. My wife not a big artichoke fan gave in to me and we shared it, she is now an artichoke fan, they were fantastic. I had the Pasta Provincial with mussels, it was what pasta in garlic sauce should taste like. our dinners also came with a choice of soup or salad, I had the clam chowder which was creamy and seasoned correctly. Usually I need to add pepper at most places, this was just right. After dinner we moved to the bar area and listened to the band for awhile. Overall great experience that I think will get even better as the owners continue to improve it.
