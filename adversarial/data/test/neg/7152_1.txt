This place makes you feel like family. Tony brought out our pizza and some garlic knots that were on the house for our first visit and a handshake. Find me another place local that the owner greets their customers with a handshake and I will gladly go. The pizza, there is not enough room to describe it. It is the best in AZ, period. Garlic knots, superb. Prices, way too low for what you get. They are well worth our commute from Queen Creek.
