Horrible. We went there for brunch on a sunday and they were not busy at all. We got our drinks (water) in a reasonable amount of time, and we're waiting for the waitress to take our food order. We waited for about 25 minutes before we received any attention from her. We decided to get up to leave. As we got up, she cams to our table finally and said \"are you guys leaving or what?\" Needless to say, we left. I do not have an opinion to give on the food, since we did not get to taste anything. Based on the service alone, I would recommend to skip out on this place.
