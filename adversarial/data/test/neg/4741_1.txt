The pizza from these guys is fabulous.  So is much of their hot table.  However, any time that I have used them for catering, I've had to call them several times to ensure they had everything correct.   There were two occasions where they had no record whatsoever of an order from me.  Further to that, for two Christmas Eve's in a row items were made incorrectly; I ordered a seafood risotto and got a huge tray of complete MUSH for rice as they used regular long grain rice and over cooked it.  I couldn't serve it and ended up throwing it all out.  The second time was when I ordered chicken tenders to be made for the kids.  That typically involves breading and frying them.  We opened up a container and found chicken without any breading that appeared to have been pan fried but not sure.  Because of these repeated errors, we have flipped our Christmas Eve catering requests over to Solstice Restaurant.  Have had much better luck with them and they will deliver too!!!!
