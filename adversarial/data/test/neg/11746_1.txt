I decided to check this place out for the first time after hearing how good it was. From the moment we walked in the door till the time we left, the service was great. The hostesses were friendly and our waitress, Cat, was phenomenal. The food was really tasty and I think I was served a baked potato as big as my head! I recommend the Chicken Colorado which is chicken with bacon and BBQ sauce. Yum!
