This place might get such a good rating from me because it reminds me so much of my favorite place to see a concert back home (the Uptown Theatre). I'm very into old-style converted venues. Also, because the first band I saw there was The Gaslight Anthem, and c'mon, how could that be a bad thing?\n\nThe stage is set high and offers a great view from pretty much anywhere (if you can score a spot on the railing at any level you're completely set). The sound is also one of the better systems I've found in these parts. \n\nI don't find it hard to get to as the Queen streetcar runs regularly enough and stops just a short block away. However, I do find the post-show trip complete with crack addicts on said streetcar harassing everyone for money to be less-than-desirable, but what can you do. \n\nAnnoyingly there are no ins & outs, mostly because there is a strange little cafe of sorts attached to the venue (you can enter from the sidewalk\/smoking area or from inside) that wants you to buy overpriced fries and such. So if you need some \"fresh\" air (which, you probably will because there seems to be zero ventilation inside the building) you'll be stuck hanging out in the smokers patio. \n\nIf you drink there are plenty of bars here for you. The main bar at the back of the top tier of the floor area and 2 smaller bars on the sides of the main floor itself. There is also a bar on the balcony level when it's open (for larger shows). \n\nSecurity was very thorough (2 people looking at all the ID's, bag searches for girls \/ pat downs for guys) but really laid back about it. The girl in front of me first got busted on her fake ID, but they just Xed her hand and she went on. Then security found her \"pot-in-the-mints-container\" stash and dumped it ... but STILL let her go to the show. Where I'm from, you'd probably be arrested for either of those things on the spot, so this was definitely surprising. \n\nAll in all it's a good mid-sized concert experience and I won't hesitate to snatch up tickets when good bands stop by and play here.
