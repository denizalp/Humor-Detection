Finally!  This space has been vacant for so long with that HUGE \"bar\" sign just waiting for someone to open up a bar. And thank you beer gods for the bar that went in a craft beer bar!!\n\nI can't wait for them to iron out the design details,  because this space is dope, and the beer list is killer.  Tons of taps and all of them crafty.  There's plenty of choices for everyone, including ciders and sours for those of you who like that kind of thing. \n\nThere is an amazing beer garden area that just needs some cool lighting and a few ash trays and it will soon become The place to be!  The bar is simple and straight forward,  and there are a few tvs around to watch games on (although they could use just one more behind the bar so if you're sitting at the bar you don't have to look so far to the right, but whatev)\n\nAll in all,  I can't wait to make this a new staple in my beer bar rotation,  I'm sure they will become very busy very fast.
