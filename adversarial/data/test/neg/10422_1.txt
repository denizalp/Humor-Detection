Well, been a few years since I yelped and I still find myself hangin at Sierra Gold. Liked it so much that I recently recommended it for the Michigan State alumni bar when we needed to find a new home to root for our Spartan teams. We're a rowdy, fun bunch, especially when we have a cowbell to rock it to our \"Go State\" cheer.  But I'm sure the Gold can handle us.  Now I haven't just been sitting here for 3 years, took a little hiatus from the bar scene here and there, but nice to come back to a place where Charlie still knows my name :).
