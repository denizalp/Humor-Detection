Very nice experience. One of the best massages I had! The single cabins with shower system is genius. The atmosphere is not posh but the treatments and amenities are still very fancy. Nuts, strawberries and drinks available to relax after the services your get. A bit hard to find in the mall though. Don't forget to leave a tip. They really don't push you to do so.
