Two stars for being the worst of the three that I've been to.\n\nThe usual SS staples are there, and the food isn't bad, but they ditched the Calimari that is on the Chicago menu!  Unbelieveable.  That was the most delicious thing I had ever had!\n\nMostly, my beef with this place is the location, in a mall, and the ambience of the place.  The ironic part is that when you are dining at the Chicago or Miami locations, it feels like you are in Vegas: swanky, cool, fun.  But dining in the Vegas one feels like you are at a Legal Seafoods in suburbia.\n\nJust misses something.  If you're in Vegas, go someplace else.
