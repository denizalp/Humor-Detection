I don't quite know who's the Tom behind this restaurant (Sawyer, Finn, Selleck), but regardless after a few sittings I know this review is overdue to get the word out that this gem on the NYNY hotel \"border\" is a heavy food contender on the LV strip scene.\n\nStaff wise it has been hit or miss sad to say, but I'm glad we didn't let that deter from giving them multiple shots. The first time our waiter decided to \"educate\" us on how to leave a tip and what to leave which irritated my wife to the point of leaving that feedback with the manager (oh to be a fly on the wall for that chat). On the last visit however we had what I thought sounded like a southern belle and she knocked it out of the park from a service standpoint!\n\nAs far as the menu goes it is a bit massive and clearly has something for everyone (or should anyway). With each sitting go figure I went the seafood route and had the lobster Mac and cheese and the lobster roll, but with so many selections (appetizers, burgers, salads, sandwiches, etc.) you can't go wrong.\n\nThe combination of lobster and shrimp was an under the sea extravaganza for the simplest fact that it was tender as heck and well portioned to the macaroni and cheese which blew me down! The noodles themselves even for a baked dish were not crispy or over cooked and the cheese was gooey and coated them to perfection! Finally I found enough room to indulge in the pop tart, YAY to that! It was good, but it didn't totally blow me away like I had hoped. For me the main pain point is (to me) the lack of filling inside. It felt like I tore into the pop tart and just ate flaky crust which was like getting socks on Christmas morning.\n\nAs I bring this to a close I can say up to now I've had a 4 star experience here and I'm certainly clutching to the notion there is that one menu item to cause the Kobayashi hot dog wiggle to bring my taste buds to a 5 rating. C'mon Tom's Urban, prove me right..........Please?!?
