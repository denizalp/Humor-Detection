Free wifi, good coffee, alot of space and room to meet, study, hang out and drink coffee. From the tables to chairs and outlets, I would see this location as good study spot.... not hard to find but it just north of yorkdale but i dont see this plaza seeing as much attention with yorkdale right there.  It is queit, the coffee is good. I could probably spend hours here and might if Im not kicked out.
