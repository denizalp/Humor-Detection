No stars. Serious problem here. Went to get a cart when an young associate was locking some carts up outside He told us go over there across the way to get one over there. Inside the store a young woman working there had no idea what a water filter pitcher was. Another associate told her they were back by the wall where the microwaves were. No one assisted us to find the product. The product wasn't there. Terrible customer service, seemed there was no training or supervision of employees.
