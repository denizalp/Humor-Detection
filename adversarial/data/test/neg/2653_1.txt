I don't eat Zaxby's often - at all really. With all the great talk about Zaxby's, I often wonder why they are never crowded. I ordered the boneless wings (original flavor\/sauce). I was craving boneless wings. Service was average, no complaints, no highlights. The food was hot. Really nothing special to say here.
