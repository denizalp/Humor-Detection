-Customer service is lacking in this location.  They don't seem to have their priorities in line.\n\n-Prices (with appliances) are usually not the \"Best Buy\", if you do your research you can find a better price at other competitors.  \n\n-They don't stock their video games, majority of items listed in inventory are in the BOH or in the cabinet locked up, forcing you to look for someone to help you find a game (Bad customer service -- no sense of urgency).\n\n-I left a complaint on a survey I took after my purchase (wasn't even bagged, or offered a bag -_- ) and they emailed me offering to give me a gift card refund for my purchase, but even with that I don't think I'll ever shop at Best Buy again....rather see my money go to other stores that deserve it.\n\n-Only reason I still shop at Best Buy in general was for their 0 interest for x mount of months, but all their competitors do the same thing now defeating the purpose of shopping at a chain that doesn't have Customer service as their first priority.
