The foods were fresh and nice and the vibe was easy and relaxed. \n\nI particularly enjoyed the seafood selections. The seafood tower was very, very fresh. A special treat. The seared halibut was nice. \n\nThis is a 3.5\/4 star place, but the reason that I'm bumping my review was my personal experience. The timing seemed to be right on. All of the staff seemed to be in a good groove and that made for a \"just right\" delivery. We weren't there too long, but weren't rushed a bit. From our table, you could see the kitchen and their synchronicity was on point. Good focus. \n\nI love an easy time.
