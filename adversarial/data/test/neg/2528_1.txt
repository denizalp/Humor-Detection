It pains me to do this.  I love this place.  But I went in a few times late night to work on my lap top and have a donut.  The first time I thought this older lady was kind of rude.  The next night I went in slightly earlier and had a younger girl who was sweet.  She asked me which color cup I wanted.  Third visit the rude older lady is there.  Nope she doesn't care what color cup.  She can't be bothered even with an empty store.  Fourth night I go.  I was looking for a specific flavor.  I start to ask.  Before I can even get the flavor out she goes this is what we have.  Okay maybe I just don't see it.  They have dozens of flavors.  Just rude.  And of course she doesn't ask what color cup.  So I sit down.  And a couple come in and she was rude to them as well.  I won't take it personal but I think it warrents a one star reviews if the employee is being rude to everyone.  This is not what Hurts is about.  It's one of the coolest places in Tempe.  To the manager or owner please hire better employees. I'm sure it's tough to find people to work the grave yard shift.  This older lady really needs to go.  She has no business working customer service jobs.
