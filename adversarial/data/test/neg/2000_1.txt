Kevin Speakman is the star of the show over there! I've worked in sales for over 12 years, and I would hate to sell to me.  However Kevin was awesome, responsive, knew his business, didn't play games and got me a deal that made me feel great.  If you are in the market for a new Ford, go there and talk to him.  I went to Ford Country, Team Ford, and Gaudin, but none of them could hold a flame to the customer service, down to earth attitude, eagerness to earn your business and knowledge of vehicles that Kevin has.  I am thrilled with my purchase and am thankful to Kevin and Friendly Ford.
