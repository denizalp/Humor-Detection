I am a big fan of Hertz and LOVE hertz Gold, since it saves so much time.  However, my last rental in Vegas was a bit of a disappointment.  Not only did the car smell like a smoky casino, there was a liquid substance dried to the inside pillar next to the drivers seat (right where you pull the seat belt from).  I was praying it was just a soda that exploded, but I feared it may have been dried projectile vomit.  Obviously, this was something that should have been addressed when cleaning the car and before the car was put back into circulation.  While leaving the lot, I tried to alert the gate attendant to this. He seemed very disinterested.  He never looked at what I was trying to show him and just gave me the damage form to mark and sign.  As a Gold member, I guess I was expecting a little more concern.
