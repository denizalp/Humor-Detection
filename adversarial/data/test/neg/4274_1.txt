A fair option for ordinary, North American-style Chinese in the shadow of Concordia University's downtown sprawl. \"Spicy\" dishes really aren't (and I had asked for mine extra-spicy), and the seasonings don't really have any level of particular complexity. Disappointing because I was expecting more based on the raves of a colleague; ultimately this is really on a par with food court Chinese, albeit served in a nicer setting and with very amiable, pleasant staff.
