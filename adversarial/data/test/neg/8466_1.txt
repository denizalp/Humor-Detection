In my opinion the view was amazing .The atmosphere was very homogeneous. It was very un welcoming . We ordered the fish and chips plis the grilled salmon .they dishes lacked flavor and were bland .the fries and tartar sauce were the only things that tasted flavourfull .The price does not maych the quaulity of the food
