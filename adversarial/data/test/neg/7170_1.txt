So I went a while ago when they had restaurant week, and I was going on for a bachelorette party. I realized I totally spaced on writting a review...\n\n Coming into the place, it's not super big, but has a cool vibe. There's a big hanging swing chair in the corner that I'm sure people love to take selfies in.  From what I remember all around food was decent, although someone had some type of fish plate and it did not look or smell fresh.\n\n  The one thing that really irked me and several others was that they couldn't seem to understand what a medium rare steak was.  First we get well done, then when we tell the waitress that the cook is wrong, she looks at it and goes oh is it not done enough.....no it way over done.  Then the guy running the joint is like ya well those are cooked medium rare, but I'll cook more for you myself.  Super condescending, I wanted to Google medium rare and shove it in his face.  So they come out, and the inside is almost raw to rare. At this point I'm like whatever, I'd rather have it be undercooked, and  I'm starving.  The overall flavor of the dish was fine, and the desserts at the end were very good, but bottom line, if you serve steak at a high end spot on the strip know how to cook it, and do a better job a client recovery.
