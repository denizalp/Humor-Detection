We visited The Standard today during the Taste of Italy.  They extended the patio and offered only a small special menu due to the anticipated crowds.\n\nWe were there Sunday around 3pm and it was about 1\/2 full.  Service was Ok, but it did take a while to place our order.\n\nThe calamari fitti  was excellent, but the portion size was very small.  We saw other tables order it and sizes varied widely.\n\nWe also ordered a pizza (only 4 on the special menu and when we asked to substitute they refused) while indrediants were fresh the pizza was not properly cooked.  Crust was soggy.  \n\nAlso order a couple of beers.  Daughter Mill Street listed on the menu as $8 but on the bill was $8.25\n\nNo bread was offered for the table.\n\nAll in all a very mediocre place.  So many itialian options on this street like diplomatico that it is  unlikely I will return.
