A couple of friends told me to check this place out. Chinese\/Mexican sounded kinda gross to me, but gave it a shot. I'm so glad I did. It's the best food! I love the jerk fried rice with the Korean barbecue black beans. I get the emerald chicken in a burrito and the red jade chicken in the quesadilla. Bomb! You also get a snicker doodle cookie with your meal. Delicious!
