What a treat! Visiting from Chicago and heard about this gem from a local. Between our group we ordered the Carne Asada dinner, the 'Armando's' dinner and a ala cart mixture of shrimp taco, carne asada taco, chicken enchilada and a green tamale. I'm honestly still having a hard time ranking my favorite, they were all so exceptional. As if the food wasn't enough to get me back in the door, the service was even better! Bridget was our server and she was amazing. Two thumbs up. Five stars. Not a bad thing to say.
