Worst service I've ever experienced in my life. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR BUSINESS! If you decide to risk a migraine be sure to not give them your credit card info because eventhough you have a month to pay your amount due by the end of the month online, they will auto charge you before they even pick it up or drop off without telling. Also I was charged 200 dollars more than what was estimated when I was online. Once they charged my card and had insufficient funds 1day  into me having the container, they canceled my pickup and I got charged by the landlord for having the container on the property past the 1st of April.when I called customer service they did nothing at all and had an attitude. GARBAGE company don't trust them. Learn from me.
