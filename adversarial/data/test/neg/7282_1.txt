Not sure if we got rip off by a Half Off ticket booth in Planet Hollywood, but $180 for 4 is steep for what we witnessed.  \n\nI guess I was expecting top talent for Vegas.  I been here about 6 years ago with super funny comedians with Gary Valentine headlining. That's what I expect for this entertainment capital of the world.  But this time was pretty poor.   Sure I laughed more than my share, but you can tell the level was bottom rung.   I been on two carnival cruises recently and they were Vegas quality. \n\nThe place hasn't been updated in probably 20 years. I don't mind as much but let's get real talent or lower your prices. I always have my local improv if I want to take my chances. \n\nThank you for reading
