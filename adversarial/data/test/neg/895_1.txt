Always an excellent meal at Salvatore's. It is one of our \"go-to\" places to take people who are visiting us. Great, cozy atmosphere, diverse beer and wine list and, of course, amazing pizzas. We haven't had one we didn't like. When they brought back the jalapeno assasino for a weekend, we couldn't get enough.
