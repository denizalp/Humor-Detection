Came for a late lunch and was one of two people in the restaurant at the time. The other gentleman was already halfway through his meal. Decided to order the ultimate chicken sandwich because how could you go wrong with that.  Cashier took my order, asked for a named (I was the only person ordering or even in line). Didn't take too long for the meal to be made, cashier proceeds to yell my name across the whole restaurant as I'm standing in front of her. Waste of money!!! The sandwich cost almost $15 and was three chicken fingers cut up with some lettuce and sauce. The seasoning was overkill and was used on both the fries and chicken. Overall it was an overpriced, underachieving sandwich. Won't be coming back.
