Hands down best quick service Mexican food in Vegas.  Fresh ingredients, great flavors, and huge portions.  I'm completely addicted to this place.  I usually go twice a week and I love the online ordering system.  It makes it so much easier to order and pick up your food.  Plus it gives you more time to chill out and talk with Ben, the owner.  What a character.  He is by far one of the funniest and cool dudes in Vegas.  Truly cares about 100% satisfaction for his customers.  This place is a real gem and so needed in the northwest part of Vegas.  This ain't no Robertos.  If you want real quality Mexican food with bold flavors, check out Jefes.
