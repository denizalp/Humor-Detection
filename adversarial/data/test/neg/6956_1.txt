Hands down the best pedicure I have ever had! They did an amazing job on both my gel manicure and pedicure. They took their time and were so professional and sweet. If I lived in AZ this would be the only place I would go. My mother and sister also enjoyed their time there as well. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
