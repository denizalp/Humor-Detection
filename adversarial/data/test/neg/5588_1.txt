What a find! This small Peruvian joint on St. Clair West is the real deal. The most warm and friendly staff you'll ever meet and great traditional Peruvian food from Ceviche to Lomo Saltado.\n\nWhile the menu has a variety of meat and seafood dishes -- Ceviche seems to be a specialty -- the best bet is to go during one of their festivals. It seems Roberto, the awesome manager, runs festivals just about every month. Last month was Potato Festival, this month is Ceviche Festival, and next month is the Peruvian Gastronomy Festival.\n\nAt the Ceviche Festival we paid $25 dollars for a delicious all you can eat buffet and a free Pisco Sour. The spread was extensive and most items were unlabelled so I wasn't totally sure what I was eating, but there was a variety of lamb, chicken, beef and rice dishes all of which were simple and traditional but totally awesome. Of course, there was also about 5-6 varieties of Ceviche: octopus, shrimp, fish, chicken (not raw, don't worry), and a couple mixed ones. To finish things off there was fried plantains, potatoes in cream sauce, corn of the cob, and tamales.\n\nThe experience was like being invited to a Peruvian family pot luck. The staff were all smiles and chatted with us throughout our meal. The decorations were awesome and the Latin music was pumping out of the stereo non stop. I haven't had this much fun at a meal in a while.\n\nHighly recommended for the food and the experience.
