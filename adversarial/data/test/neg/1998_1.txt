I love this salon!! Sammy is the best and of course the other ladies are AMAZING as well. They really care and listen to exactly what you want. I had visited a previous salon and had asked for a balayage and the girl absolutely destroyed my hair! Sammy was able to fix it all in one visit and make me love my hair again. Prices are so reasonable and the service is amazing. I've been going back just for regular cuts and toning and the service is amazing!
