Clean restaurant,  clean kitchen, open glass kitchen,  you can actually see inside. You can see the cooks whipping up your pho.  This place is so clean. All and I do mean all pho places smell like someone spilled the fish sauce and spread it around the restaurant with a dirty mop.  Not Jenni-pho,  it's so clean,  I love it.
