Great selection of used books to look through, friendly people. They are very homely, the perfect nook and cranny sort of place for a used bookstore connossiuer. Thin, long and cozy. The one department they seem to lack slightly in is being up to date on new releases, but who goes to used bookstores for such a thing?\n\nFor collectors, avid readers, or anyone looking for a classic used book store atmosphere, Paul's is in a fabulously convenient location and will provide winningly.
