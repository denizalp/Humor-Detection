My husband and I visited the brewer last Thursday. Honestly we were on our way to Thirsty Lion and last minute decided to go to 12 West Brewing.  We sat inside first and I enjoyed my 1st glass of Knarbar (Bourbon Barrel-Aged Russian Barleywine). I was in heaven for sure. I am a huge Barleywine fan, thanks to living in AK for about 27 years. Beers are big and heavy up there. My husband had K-Lax (New England Style IPA) and his was extremely delicious as well. Fortunately for him he was able to get one glass of the IPA before it blew. I wasn't sharing my barleywine, I am greedy about that but he still loves me. The atmosphere was ultra casual and cozy, then we headed outside to sit under the heat lamp and enjoy our Baked Potato Pizza which was yummy and Fire and Brimstone, I wasn't a big fan of that pizza but the beer stole the show.
