WONDERFUL place! My boyfriend and I went here last night on a whim and I really can't say enough great things about it. Our waiter was amazing, and he really knows his beers. Seven recommended brews later and we were super impressed with each one. We had the summer sausage plate first, which was a delicious snack. Eventually we ordered the chicken and waffles, and let me just say that, as someone who lives in Texas, I did not have very high expectations. But oh wow they were amazing! Seriously, I could've eaten two more orders. \n\nGo here. You won't be disappointed at all.
