I am thankful to have found a fertility doctor like Dr. Fisch!  From start to finish the whole process was seamless.  My husband and I did IVF for the first time and everyone from Dr. Fisch to Amy, Suzette, and Alisha were just very patient and understanding.  I was able to call anytime day or night if I had any questions regarding any of medications, concerns etc.  My husband and I are now expecting our first child in June and are extremely excited and grateful for Dr. Fisch, he helped us with starting our family.  I would recommend GVF to anyone struggling with fertility.
