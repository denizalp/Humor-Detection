Long time Walden customer and pains me to say this most recent trip was not up to par.  The rooms are starting to show wear and tear.  For our room the shower didn't work and several lights weren't working.  The massage beds were uncomfortable due to the sheets not being fixed properly.  I love Walden and hope they don't let things go too far before doing some much needed updates.
