I am very disappointed. They dropped my hutch and did not offer to replace my piece. I have had the piece less than year. It is soft pine and damaged... no discount or replacement. Sent someone out almost two weeks after the move to do repairs. I will NEVER use this company again. You hire professionals for a reason.
