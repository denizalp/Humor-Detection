Came on a Sunday night, it wasn't too busy, we got a table right away when we walked in. Servers are nice and smiley. There are a good amount of choices on the menu, unfortunately they sold out of mochi balls, and many items come with it, hence, that limited our choices on that night. Portions are fairly small if I compare it to Sugar Marmalade (pricing is almost the same). I like how the desserts were not too sweet. It's convenient that they take credit cards. Will come back but for a little while.
