I was really expecting much more based on the reviews.  Walked in on a Thursday for lunch and the place was empty except for the staff.  Only the waitress welcomed us; the rest looked at us like we interrupted them.  Another couple came in and left after looking over the menu. \nWe ordered a caprese appetizer with eggplant which my hsb loved.  I thought it was fine.  I ordered the tagliatelle bolognese, which was delicious but a skimpy portion.  My hsb ordered the salmon pasta and liked it.  I was surprised with the sweet flavor in a savory dish and was glad I hadn't ordered it.  There were only 4 pasta choices for lunch, and we learned that there are only 4 choices for dinner as well.
