A great addition to this neighborhood. First of the design of the store itself nice and open concept and in addition it is comfortable (take note the cafe nearby which is all style over substance).\nThe desserts were very good and I will update once I have tried other items. This visit I tried the matcha white chocolate cookie and London fog cake. They use organic items so the higher price is justified. Both items were quite good. \nAs for the cappuccino hmm it could have been better though if they rotate their beans it might improve on the next visit.  Here is the verdict on the cappuccino:\nEspresso: Medium\/strong flavor\nCrema': Decent\nMilk: Frothed very well with nice microfoam.\nLatte Art: Good\nI personally didn't like the coffee bean they used hence I would rate it 3.5 stars. The desserts are solid so overall 4 stars and I will be back.
