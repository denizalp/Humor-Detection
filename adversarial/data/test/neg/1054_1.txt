I really like Central Diner. \n\nIt's a proper diner, with a large menu covering all the bases:  breakfast all day, sandwiches, burgers, pasta, steaks, pot roast, etc. \n\nOur service was great - the server visited our table frequently, refilling drinks, checking on us, and taking away empty dishes. \n\nPortions are quite large, so you can spilt most dishes, or plan to have some leftovers (don't leave it, take it home!).\n\nI'll be back.
