I give this business 0\/5 stars. ( I had to put 1\/5 to post this review) I went there this past weekend to have breakfast with my daughter. When I walked in the lady had told me 20-25mins for a table, I was fine with that. She then processed to help the guests behind me and had quoted them 15-20 mins and there where more people in their party. I was a bit confused, never the less I still waited. I then noticed that she seated a party of 2 people that had just walked in and didn't even put their name on the waiting list. I also saw that she sat the party that walked in after me first. She also sat another party of 2 people that just walked in and never waited. When I went to ask about my spot on this list, she walks away and acts busy for a few mins. Then ignores me and helps another couple standing at the counter. When she does help me she says, Oh your next I'm just waited for someone to clean the table. Now I understand this place is small and very busy. But this is the worst customer service I have ever gotten anywhere. I have worked in the hospitality industry for a long time and have seen so many different things, but I must say this has been by far the worst. I didn't end up staying and I  won't be going back!!
