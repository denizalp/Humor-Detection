Set up a consultation and arrived early per usual. There was construction in and outside of the building. The receptionist proceeded to complain in front of me to another woman how all the construction was stressful to her. \"This is my life now\" she stated. As I waited well over my scheduled appointment I then asked the receptionist if the doctor was busy and if I should come back. She said he was at a hospital for an emergency procedure but I could see the nurse at the office. Yes, a nurse for a surgery consultation. \nUnprofessional and disrespectful to a potential customer ready to spend several thousand dollars.
