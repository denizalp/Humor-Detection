My daughter went here after her eyelash technician moved away. The place was very clean and the staff was extremely friendly. Her old technician was rather rough sometimes. She would move her head from side to side, pinch her and poke her with the tweezers and would rip the tape off her lower lids. \n\nNOTHING like that happened here at FYA. Tana was very gentle, soothing and very skilled. There was no pinching, pulling and poking. There was only perfectly straight, beautiful eyelashes. (Her eyelashes were crooked somewhat with the other technician)\n\nThe price was rather expensive($175 for Diva set), however, worth it because of the service and the look of the lashes afterward. She has yet to go for a fill to see how expensive it is, but she says it's worth it for how great her lashes look.
