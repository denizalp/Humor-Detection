Terrific little bakery tucked away in a location that's easy to overlook. It's in the bottom floor of a row of townhouses, and though there's a sandwich board out front it doesn't scream TASTY TREATS -- looks more like a logo for a kidswear store.\n\nDon't pass it by, though, if you love cakes and cookies at all. Incredible deals here -- cakes that will feed 8 for only $22 or $24. The most tender macaroons (not macaron but real macaroons) I've ever tasted. And the cappuccino was surprisingly delish, not drowned out by milk.
