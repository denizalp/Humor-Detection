The food is great but get here early before any rushes. This place is like a typical Tacos El Gordo in TJ but with a more youthful modern flare. You walk into a line that's designated for the type of dish you want. If you want tacos al pastor, go here. If you want tacos adobada, then go here. Then you wait for a few minutes, sometimes longer when people are confused and start cutting into your line, you order your food and they prepare it right in front of you. You then place it on your tray and as you walk towards the register you pick up some elotes from the corn guy and maybe some chips. Then you pay, then walk to your table and blissfully scarf down that great adobada meat.
