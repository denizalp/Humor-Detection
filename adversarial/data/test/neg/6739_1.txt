I visited Winking Lizard Tavern while in Cleveland to see the new Southern Tier Brew Company Cleveland location (across the street). Winking Lizard is a great bar with amazing food. We split an appetizer of beer cheese and pita and I had a chicken Philly. Both were great and a week later I have a craving for more. The portion is definitely plentiful and well worth the money. The beer selection is enormous, if you can't find something you like, then you really don't like beer. I even found some Southern Tier on the list, but chose the Cleveland micro brews out of respect for the area. \n\nThe location is great, walking distance to the Cavaliers arena and Indians baseball, plus there is a parking ramp close by. \n\nI will definitely return.
