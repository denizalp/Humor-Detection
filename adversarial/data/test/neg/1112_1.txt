this ultra hip\/ultra chic place is located above the tangerine nightclub at ti.  after being greeted by several host\/hostesses at the entrance, you'll ascend a couple of  flights of stairs (an elevator is available)  you'll notice all the entire walls are decorated with gold colored deposit boxes, like youre in a vault or something.  once you get to the restaurant, youll see that it isnt one huge room, but its one long corridor, with little rooms jutting out here and there and tables along the corridor. you also can enjoy views of the pirate ship and performance in the front of ti, or even dine\/hang out on the patio if you wish.  inside there are 2 sushi bars and 2 bars (yes you can eat at the bar).  the wood used for the floors and tables were all a matching tea color.  at one end of the restaurant where one of the bars are located, there is a center seating area of big lounge chairs with a multitude of wooden bird cages hanging above in the vaulted ceiling.  one of the private rooms had this funky cool huge rectangular chandelier made of test tubes.  i dont know if there are are more bathrooms, but the section that had 2 huge bathrooms and were unisex and all to yourself, which had an attendant outside to clean up after each use.  there was one area of the corridor where a faint red glow shined on stacks of newspapers (like the chinese movies) decorated the wall.   \nfor our meal, we let our waiter, garrett, give us the grand tour of the haute items of the social house.  we started off with some tuna tataki in ponzu sauce.  my mouth went crazy after taking a thinly sliced piece of seared kobe beef.  that piece of meat was so thin and drizzled in garlic infused olive oil that it just melted in my mouth.  the same thing happened with the thinly sliced yellow tail drizzled in jalapeno infused olive oil.  they have their fish flown in daily.  i had to have toro (so silky and just the right temp...it melted in my mouth) and uni (cold and really creamy).  we also got special social hose rolls...curried lobster w\/avocado and cucumbers and a kobe tataki and marinated shitake mushroom roll.  we also had giant chunks of shrimp and lobster cooked with lemongrass. for our last savory dish, we had soy mirin kurobuta pork belly.  it was atop a japanese pumpkin mash, which was supposed to even out the saltiness of the pork, but i think it overpowered it with its sweetness.  i said, \"the hell with it\" and ate the moist and tender soy marinated pork belly.  our waiter, had a specially made platter that included most of the desserts on the menu, mochi filled mochi, chocolate molten cake with toasted melting marshmellow, pancakes over rice pudding (uninteresting), a very very light cheescake, a guava sorbet, a tangerine sorbet, and my favorite freshly made coffee ice cream (kona blend...the fragrant aroma just lit up my nose)  i also have to add this meal was not without sake b\/c we had a whole bottle of momokawa pearl unfiltered sake.\nthis place opens up at 5pm and closes at 4am on the weekends...its a place to kick back, listen to good music from the live djs, eat really good food, and get awesome drinks.  this is currently one of the hottest places to dine in vegas...
