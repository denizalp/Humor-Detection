Came for breakfast after St. Patty's day.  I picked out this breakfast spot for my husband and I.  We both ordered water and a hot beverage.  I asked about the flavor of the URBAN POP TARTS  and she replied Cherry.   I ordered the Urban Pop Tart and the HUEVOS RANCHEROS LOCOS.  My husband ordered the of the HANGOVER SLOPPER, which states in the menu comes with 2 fried eggs.  The server asked how he would like his burger cooked and he replied Medium.  \nAfter the food was delivered, we waited for our server to return with silverware.  The fried eggs in the Hangover Burger where Not hard..  Which if my husband knew they where going to be running- he would have requested to cook the eggs hard.  He hates running eggs.  My dish was tasty! The Urban Pastry Pop Tart was actually Apple -not Cherry- and it was very good! I let the server know that it wasn't a big deal, but maybe she didn't know.  She replied with yeah, they mix up flavors. \nOverall 3 star rating.
