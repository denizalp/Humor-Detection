OK trip this time except the hour wait on the Tarmac.  Here's what I can't believe.  I was in the row in front of the emergency exit.  The flight attendant went through the responsibilities of the people in that exist row.  She said they need to verbally affirm they could do it by saying \"yes\".... leaning against one of the emergency doors was a very petite young woman... probably less than 100lbs... totally out of it (my guess is that since I was flying out of Vegas on Sunday afternoon she was recovering from partying all night)   The guy next to her had to nudge her to wake her up and tell her to say \"yes\"\n\nThis is a person who would be responsible for the lives of passengers trying to exist in an emergency?\n\nThe flight attendant should not have accepted \"Yes\" from a person who was clearly NOT capable of standing... not to mention opening a heavy door and helping people in an emergency situation.
