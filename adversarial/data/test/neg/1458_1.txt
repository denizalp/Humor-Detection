Excellent variety of things you can't find elsewhere. Salad bar on MOST days are fully replenished with fresh things to choose from. \nConstantly stocking shelves. Only downfall with that, the stock guys don't really move out of the way and aren't very friendly like the other associates. \nOne cashier (reddish hair) is beyond amazing. She is super friendly and outgoing. Nothing but a fun and friendly girl. \nThe gentleman at the prepared foods is super helpful and will tell you what needs to be done when you get home with the food. \nCustomer service ladies are ok, but not like the rest of the associates. \nAnd the parking lots at ALL Heinens are AWFUL!!!!!
