Went here for late night apps the other day, since they are open pretty late. First impression walking in I noticed it was too dark. I been to many cheesecake factories and I know they tend to be dim lighting but this 1 was overly dark. The floors weren't clean at all, they were very slippery and the booth bench had food on it still. I don't like to complain so I didn't. The speed of the waiter was fine a little on the slower side but no harm. We got nachos, avocado eggrolls, and the fries platter with mushroom, avocado, and zucchini fries. Overall the food was good. I recommend the avocado eggrolls. The nachos weren't the best slightly oily and seems like they went cheap on the ingredients. The fries were good. The main reason I gave them 2 stars is because of the cleanliness, if the floors and booths aren't clean where the guess are can you imagine the inside?
