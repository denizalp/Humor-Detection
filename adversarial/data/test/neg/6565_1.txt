As there are stereotypes of women getting ripped off at car dealerships---I was a bit nervous dealing with any car issues---Well... I needed not be... Josh fixed my problem for in absolutely no time (just needed a bolt replaced on my windshield wipers whereas Northland Volkswagen would have charged close to $1000 to replace the whole motor (not to mention some bogus diagnostic fee)).  So in sum,  if you want a mechanic that you can trust to not charge you unnecessary amounts, get things done very quickly, then this is your place.
