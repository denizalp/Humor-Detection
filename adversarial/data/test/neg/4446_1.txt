A few weeks back we did the Red Rock Canyon tour and it was awesome. This was a gift for my husbands birthday, and I got the groupon so it was an even better deal for a very fun morning.\n\nWe started by meeting up with our tour guides at the place that they keep the scooters. They do hotel pick-ups (and it sounds like they keep things fun during those too) but we are local, so we just met them there. \n\nThey had all the scooters out and after a brief explanation of how to get into the scooters, they let you pick which one you want. Then you get a much more thorough explanation of how to operate them, where you are going, how you are getting there, what to do if you get separated on the way...pretty much anything that comes up. The guides we had were very funny and kept everything light and entertaining which was great.\n\nOnce you get into Red Rock, you stop at a few places and one of the guides gives a little speech about the history and fun facts, etc. Still very entertaining even for locals who have already been there. Then you get a little time to walk around and take pictures. After the first stop you go back to your scooter and water bottles have magically appeared in your seat, which is very appreciated at that point as you have realized it is a little hot and you are smiling so much from the ride, you may have added a little grit to your teeth ;-) \n\nRiding in the scooters is a TON of fun, I just loved it. My husband drove, but he seemed to really enjoy it too, even with not being able to just watch the scenery fly by. They are very simple to operate and with one tour guide leading in front of the group, and one bringing up the rear, you don't have to worry about getting left behind if anything happens. \n\nWe had a great day, and would love to do it again! Worth every penny for sure. :-)
