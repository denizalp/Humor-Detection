We came here for lunch and the food was pretty decent. The chicken was very well seasoned and very juicy. The coke slaw was tangy and crunchy. The fries were thin and crunchy and not too salty. Just the way I enjoy them. \n\nIf the food was amazing fried chicken, the price also reflects that. For a four piece of breast, thigh, drumsticks and a wing with fries and coleslaw was 17.95. I got the blue ribbon chicken sandwich and it was about 11$. \n\nWhile the food was great.. if I'm going to pay 35$ for fried chicken I'd rather go to Buffalo Wild Wings and order for 3-4 servings easily.
