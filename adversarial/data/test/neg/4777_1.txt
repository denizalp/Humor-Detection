I had a mixed experience at this Sheraton location. I would have given it two stars but management offered a free stay to make up for my bad experience. \n\nThe check in process was easy and all the staff I encountered were friendly. I got a king size bed on the 36th floor with a good view of the city. Multiple elevators were fast and efficient. The Room was nice, clean and modern. The bed was very comfortable with four large firm pillows. If not for all the deafening noise and vibrating room, I probably would have had a great sleep. \n\nAt 9 am, I was awoken by an incredibly loud drilling sound. The room was vibrating and I thought the wall would cave in. They were doing restorative work on the outside of the building on my floor. This continued for over an hour. I should have been pre-notified or Sheraton should not have rented rooms in this area. I called to complain and put the phone on speaker so they could hear the loud drilling sound. The manager noted they were not aware the work - how is that possible?\n\nI had a few other issues as well. It was impossible to close the blinds - they kept opening after I closed them. The TV kept loosing the cable signal in the morning - the drilling and vibrating probably loosened the wiring! \n\nAt the end of the day, management offered a free one-night stay at any other Sheraton to make up my for my bad experience.... so kudos for that. In fairness, this is probably more of a one-off experience so I would probably stay again if in the area. At least management did the right thing.\n\nBK
