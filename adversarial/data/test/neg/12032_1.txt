As far as the food goes this is some of the best pizza you will be able to find in the Phoenix area if you like real Chicago style pizza. \n\nHaving said that it is very expensive. The pizza is excellent though, so it may be worth the splurge. I recommend looking for a coupon before ordering, although do so with caution, because this place also needs to be criticized for being stingy with coupons. They need to lighten up and accept the deals they print out. We have had an issue or two in regards to that.\n\nOn the other hand, the delivery service was good and the delivery guy even made an effort to run the pizza to us, so it was nice to see that he was trying hard to get the pizza to us as quick as possible.
