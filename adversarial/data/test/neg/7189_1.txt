I'm picky about just about everything, and although I can work with places that don't meet all the criteria, if they don't meet the basics, I'm probably not likely to go back for a second service. The basics for me are a well-maintained place, excellent hygiene, a nice atmosphere and friendly staff. The nail techs should be experienced, attentive and good conversationalists. There's nothing worse than not having your hands free to mess around on your phone, AND have boring conversation to while time away. \n\nPedicure Lounge is better than basic. The owner is an expert nail artist, and her staff are professional, friendly and well-trained as well. Pedicures are relaxing, massage is great, and there are fun menu options to choose from. All the stuff they use is made in house - smells great, and leaves my skin velvety smooth. Diana (business owner) is super meticulous and knowledgable - I get great nail care tips from her. On my first visit, I let her know I had particularly ticklish feet, brittle nails, sensitive cuticles, etc. She always remembers to customize my appointments accordingly. \n\nSelection is also great. Tons of colors, and a fun plus is their \"TAT\" machine. For $5 you can pick out any design from an album of nail art and have the machine stamp cute patterns on your nails. They had special themes for halloween, Xmas and other holidays. Fun stuff. \n\nAnother cute nail is their rock stars. Can't go wrong with glitter. So festive. \n\nGel lifespan is through to 2 weeks, sometimes longer. By the 3rd week, the corners finally start to peel - but in my experience at other places around here, my gel nails were lasting only a few days! So, good quality here IMO - worth every penny.\n\nNeedless to say I highly recommend this place!
