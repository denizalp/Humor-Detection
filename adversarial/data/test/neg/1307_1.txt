Wow I have never had worse service! They couldn't find my location because I didn't have an apartment number on the shipping label. I live in a condo and don't have an apartment number. They were too lazy to search harder for my house so it was sent back and now I won't recieve it today. Absolutely ridiculous. Use a GPS.
