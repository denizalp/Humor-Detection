Internet sales guy is unresponsive, we were approximately $1,000 apart on a $30,000 vehicle and he wouldn't even return my emails. Went to a different dealership and bought the same vehicle for $27,000. \n\nThey will do whatever they can to get out of making warranty repairs.  They wanted $700 for a repair that was covered under my warranty. \n\nWhatever time frame they give you for an oil change at least double it. \n.
