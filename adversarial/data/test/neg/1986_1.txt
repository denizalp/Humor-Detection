Good diner food! Comfortable, cozy, friendly. Coffee is steaming and filled up constantly.  Love the specials on the board!  Eggs Benedict, crabmeat omelets...yum!  All the basics, too, served alongside Mancini's toast...talk about Pittsburgh classics!  Fried mush has always been my fav.  Who knew it could be even better with just a touch of crumbled bacon?! Just the right balance of salty and sweet. This is a great place to start your day off with smiles and kind words from all.  Yay Kelly-O!
