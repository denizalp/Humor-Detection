I order the 北海道Don.....Salmon roe very fresh 5\/5  .. uni yummy 4\/5 .  I agree the shirmp should take out the intestine 4\/5. And rice can add more vinegar. Overall i like Miso soup very hot n lots of tofu and seaweed 5\/5.. and they serve  hot green tea and tea bags. Thats good. Party tray looks fantastic. I will definitely  come try again next time!
