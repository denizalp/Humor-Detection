This show is great!  Deducting one star simply because of the staff outside the show.  You cannot enter the theater with drinks, no problem, so we stood by the table they asked us to until we finished, after 5 min the staff came up to us and said we could no longer stand there.  We were not drunk, loud, or inappropriate, we were standing where we were asked and the show still had 10 min before it started.  The ladies were just rude, we are on Vegas, pull the stick out if your ass and have fun Rio staff.  I wish the show would go to a better hotel.
