This is definitely smaller than the farmer's market downtown, but that isn't a bad thing, personally I've grown to hate the sluggish crowds down on the square. This is a nice smaller market, prices seemed like they cheaper than what you find downtown too. Plenty of parking of course, since it's in a parking lot.
