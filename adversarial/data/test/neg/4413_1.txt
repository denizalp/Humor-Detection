Was there for dinner this week.  Had plans with another couple to go back on weekend.  Cancelled those plans.  Service was poor, portions small, prices high.  Chicken was Luke warm and dry. \n\nMartini glass half full and had to go to bar to remind them of order after not served in  half hour.  manager has no clue on talking to customers for feedback.  Every bad review is worth 10 good ones and this is that one.  Oh yes, checked the bill and charged for more drinks than we ordered.\n\nJ Scottsdale
