I had one facial and it was great. However Michelle did not show up for my second appointment and the woman who had an appointment prior to me was also stood up. I texted and called and no response. Not a good way to treat loyal customers. Apparently this is a pattern of the owner who not only does not show up for scheduled appointments but then doesn't even have the courtesy to call and apologize.
