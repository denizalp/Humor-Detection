El Valle is the best Mexican restaurant in Charlotte because the food was good, fast, and most importantly well priced! Most Mexican places in the CLT are super pricey but not this one. This place was open while hurricane Florence was hitting Charlotte. We went and the food is fantastic! The service is very fast and polite as well making sure our order was right. I finished my plate which I rarely do, the margarita was good (maybe a little less tequila than I like) and the queso was great too.  This is our new favorite Mexican spot.
