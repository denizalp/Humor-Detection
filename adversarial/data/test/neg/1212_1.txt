We went here for lunch.  I've been here a few times now.  I usually order a burrito, but I don't reallty like the sauce they put on top of them and I always feel so full and tired when I got back to work afterwards.  \n\nYesterday, I went with fish tacos and they were really good!  Homemade tortilla which tastes great and the taco itself was delicious.  It comes with a side of rice and beans.  I got the black beans.  These were both meh.\n\nIt's a good place to go if you work in Southpark for lunch-they are really quick about getting you taken care of for a quick bite.
