This is a small local pub that shows sports and tends to have a more blue collar crowd in a not so blue collar area. Cheap prices and standard pub fare on the menu, the food doesn't stand out, pretty much your run of the mill pub. The owner works here everyday and is quite friendly, she tries to make people feel at home. She will often bring out some complimentary fries or pretzels for patrons when drinking beer and chat a bit here and there. A great place to go if your looking for a small cozy little bar you can call your own lol it's small enough if your a regular they should all know you in no time
