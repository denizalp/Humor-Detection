WOW!  Totally caught off guard by the authentic flavors in the meats. I stumbled across this place because I was waiting for a movie to start and needed somewhere that wouldn't take to long to prepare food. I sure am happy I went!\n\nI went on Tuesday, $2 taco special. They don't skimp at all on the toppings and there's a bar on the side to add more great stuff like slaw and cilantro. You can't go wrong with the mixed tacos (steak and chicken). I got them on corn tortilla. 3 tacos left me stuffed. 5 stars for the food and excellent customer service.
