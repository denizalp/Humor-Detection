I saw this on Groupon so thought I would try it out.  I've been here twice now.  The first time I got a protein shake and it was ok.  I can back a second time and wasn't expecting much,  got the Santa Fe chicken wrap spicy and the cucumber salad as the free side and is was unreal. SO GOOD! I'll defiantly be back and recommended to friends and family to try.
