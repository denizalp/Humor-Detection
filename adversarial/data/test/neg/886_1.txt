Let me start by saying this was my first time in a Best Buy for several years and wow was I shocked at how much the layout changed for the better! The layout is more of a room by room experience for example you have a Samsung area and Apple area for all of there individual products. The TVs are separated by brand areas too. I think I'm this layout looks awesome and really lets you focus and compare individual brands. I usually use Amazon to purchase everything but am now tempted to do my due diligence and experience these products first hand. I highly recommend checking out this Best Buy location. I was just in the store browsing and was asked if I needed help by almost every employee in the store. They either thought I looked suspicious or was confused I guess haha wondering around aimlessly.
