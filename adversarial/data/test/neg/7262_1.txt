This was one of the many coffee places I used to frequent. This place is a gem. It's open late I think even 24 hours. Every time I've gone there, I found people chatting enjoying a beverage. Or a plate of food. They have very nice seating area. If you want to get on your tablet or you mobile phone; either work or chat. Urban Bean is great for both. Outdoor seating as well. Also they bake all their bakery items in house. With a good selection of vegan items too. Not only that;  they also offer food, sandwhiches, plates soups, stews and from my recollection alwdays some thing for vegans. And what I loved was every thing was made in house,; rite there in back . And they were always cooking up healthy concotiions.\nAlways with the focus on healthy.
