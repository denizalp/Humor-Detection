He is at Hooters now!   I came to see him on Monday night with some friends.  He pretty much makes most of the guest part of the show and I was no exception being pull up on stage in the first 5 minutes but I was with 2 friends so it wasn't that bad.\n\nHe guesses things which seem impossible for him to know like peoples first, last and middle name.  Your first crush...he had a TV show at one time.
