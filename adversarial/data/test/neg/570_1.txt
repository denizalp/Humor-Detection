A feast for the eyes and soul. 60s trippy complete with VW bugs and mod fashion sense, the show did not disappoint. I've been trying to acquire tickets for LOVE now for a few years whenever I get to Las Vegas. Finally I succeeded. It has all the wild acrobatics of the typical Cirque du Soleil show with the addition of the Beatles soundtrack remixed by Beatles producer Sir George Martin and his son Giles. One of the coolest things about the soundtrack was hearing lots of lost behind the scenes audio clips of the mop top lads from Liverpool horsing around in the studio between takes -some of which I've heard and some a brand new experience for me. \n\nA colorful kaleidoscope of sound and visuals. Definitely five stars for me! A splendid time is guaranteed for all!
