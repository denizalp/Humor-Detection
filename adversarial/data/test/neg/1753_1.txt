We just had dinner here for the first time last night with our 2.5 year old toddler. I'm guessing it was pretty empty because this place is pretty new. \n\nWe went for the all you can eat option, which is roughly $24.00 per person, and free for kids under 3 years old. \n\nThe fantastic thing about the all you can eat menu is that all roll orders are 2 pieces, which is fantastic because then you really can try almost all the different rolls on their menu (which is a lot) they are very creative, and the list of rolls seems endless. Fantastic rolls!\n\nI love sashimi, and this is where they lose a star. The sashimi options are very very limited. I think it was only 6 or 7 choices, and I didn't love the sashimi I did get. \n\nThe desserts are fabulous. We had the dessert rolls (mango, strawberry chocolate etc) and they were great. We also had the deep fried banana and ice cream, which we devoured. \n\nMy favourite thing about this restaurant by far is our server Edith. She was quick, prompt and our water glasses were always full. She was friendly and absolutely amazing with my daughter. She spoke both french and English and was just altogether fantastic. I wish she was my server at every restaurant we ever went to.
