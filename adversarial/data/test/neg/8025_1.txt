My experience here was mediocre. When I first checked in it looked beautiful. When I went into my room it was very dim. They do not have a lot of lighting in there so might not be a good room with only girls. Getting ready was pretty difficult. \nNext, the ac started leaking our first night there. We called front desk and they said they can switch us rooms. We were already headed out the door and they said that they can do it tomorrow for us. Tomorrow came and Greg who was at the front desk was not helpful. There were no notes on the system of the room switch and basically said all the rooms are booked and they don't have a room available for us. Load of crock. When does a hotel fully booked and their lot is not even full, pool doesn't have people there, etc. he had the too bad so sad attitude. He looked at us if we were asking for an outrageous accommodation.  They ended sending a handyman out who fixed it and drained out all the water. Everything looked half done. For it to be remodeled it wasn't all that great. I was disappointed with the service I received and when asked by another person in the front desk when I checked out, I told her the same story and all she could say was sorry and I hope ur next stay with us will be better.
