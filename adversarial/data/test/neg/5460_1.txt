Went there for lunch and ordered the Cappellini - angel hair pasta with lobster. It was delicious: the pasta was very fresh and wasn't starchy at all, didn't give you that carb overload feeling. The sauce was the best part,add of tomato broth but not your classic marinara at all - complimented the pasta so well. The lobster was good, small pieces that added an extra something. The dish was $45 wish is on the pricier side as the portions are not very large, but I definitely enjoyed it. \n\nI also tried what the burrata pizza - what the waiter described as a \"better\" Margherita pizza. It was thin and oval with the cheese added after it cooked. It was good, the cheese looked like ricotta it was served in dollops on the pizza but wasn't. I didn't think the pizza was anything spectacular but still good.
