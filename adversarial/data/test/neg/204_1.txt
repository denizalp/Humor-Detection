I am such a chicken, at the same time, I demand quality.  When I moved here I knew no one so it was hit or miss till I found Dr Dameron AND his wonderful staff. Just can't say enough about them.  Caring, gentle Dr and the staff and hygienists.....STELLAR.  I'm moving to Georgia in a few weeks and just had my last cleaning and xrays.  I wanted them all to move with me...don't think that's gonna happen but the ones here who I'm leaving this group to are some lucky individuals.  I'm going to miss all of them.   AWESOME GROUP
