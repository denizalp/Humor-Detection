I was so lucky to come across Pink Cherry Wax! One of the best experiences I've ever had! They got me a same day appointment and with one of their master waxers, who happened to be the owner! Shaina was amazing! So sweet, welcoming, and very enjoyable to talk to! She did my brows EXACTLY the way I liked them, and on my very first visit. This will now be the only place I come to for any waxing needs I may have!
