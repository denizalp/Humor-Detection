Alright. So I've been here many times and it just keeps getting worse. The most recent time was New Years... I post this now because I just remembered the story the other day about the most expensive baked potato I've ever had. New Years was a prix fixe menu at, I believe, $75 a pop. Everything, I mean everything, was bland or overcooked; except for the baked potatoes, which were the best ever. Go figure. My fiance emailed them shortly after we'd been there, to let them know how horrible an experience we had and they never replied... \nWe'd made a reservation, showed up 10 minutes early, waited at the bar for a half hour, and when we were finally seated, we were given the worst table in the house; I was squeezed between a pole and the table while my fiancee, sitting across the table, was crammed chair to chair against another patron. After asking the server, she moved the table a little bit and said, \"there you go,\" in a condescending tone.\nSuffice to say, they've gone too far down hill for me and I won't be returning unless they change chefs for one who isn't stuck in the 70's (despite his young age).
