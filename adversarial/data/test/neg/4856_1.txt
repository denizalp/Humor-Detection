I return to Dor-Stop again and again.\n\nThe service is attentive but brief as it should be for a diner.  Also, the humor and casual nature of the dialogue with the staff is refreshing.\n\nI enjoy the burgers most at Dor-Stop, and it is what I will come back for again.  The perfect doneness, the juicy result of good quality meat, and the rye bread that I get it on all make it great.  I am not overly impressed with the breakfast although my parents do like the simplicty of the omlets and pancakes here.\n\nThe price is right, the service is great, and the food is wonderful.
