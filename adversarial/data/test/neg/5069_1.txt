This place has been here for ever.  It's in a rough-seeming area (with the usual vape and other seedy businesses).  The food is very tasty.  But the place is FILTHY.  Don't bring your kids here.  When you sit down to eat, you better bring a sani-wipe.  The plastic picnic tables and lawn chairs have a black, oily residue from prior customers, and often random smears of sauces.  But as a quick, low-end food joint, it is fast, and very yummy.  They have snicker-doodle cookies which are good.  But the chocolate volcano ones are 10x better, but only on certain days.  Why they don't offer them all the time is beyond me.  It's not cheap: it's probably the same price as many fancier restaurants, but I come here because coworkers insist.  I'd only give 2.5 stars if the system would let me.
