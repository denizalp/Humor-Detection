Best food from any of the China Tango locations thus far! I have placed orders before to other Chinese restaurants before, but this this time was surprisingly and happily much different   \nOrdered from yelp Eat24 and service was was good and on time  \nCalled the restaurant to confirm order as I often do and was greeted by a very nice person on the other end who truly seemed to appreciate my order which was a welcome change from other call in orders for delivery  \nI had asked as I often do for extra hot oil and other sauces and was so pleased to receive for the first time a nice selection and quantity of sauces including my favorite, hot oil. Also the sweet and sour sauce was one of the best I've ever had thus far. Quality and also taste of food was a fantastic! \nPlease give this Restaurant a try. Even though I live quite far away and much closer to other restaurants I will definitely be willing to travel a longee distance to this restaurant in hopes of indulging my occasional craving for a quick, tasty and satisfying meal.
