I stop here periodically when I need something I forgot somewhere else or couldn't find.  I find their prices to be high compared to other chains unless you happen to hit a sale for the item you want.\n\nThe store always seems a bit cluttered and even messy.  There is often stock in plastic boxes on the floor waiting to be shelved.  It's just not a pleasant place.
