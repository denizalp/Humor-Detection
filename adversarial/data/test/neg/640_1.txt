I'm absolutely awful at handling the pain of Brazilians (to the extent that I simply quit getting them for 2 years). The hard wax was amazing for cutting down the pain and making it bearable. Carly was also wonderful. She was really nice and distracting, and used almost exclusively hard wax (perhaps because I told her I can't stand the pain), which I really appreciated.
