I personally would have given this place three stars but the yelp scale seems to say that means \"okay\", and when I give three stars I mean \"edible.\"\n\nThe people at the cash register were really nice, it's got a good vibe, they've got delicious passion iced tea, the food came out quickly, it's right by the light rail, it's got big windows which was great for people watching (and keeping an eye on my bike outside), and the set up was nice. I found their service concept a little weird (you order at the counter, they give you a red thing with a letter on it, you stick it on the table, get your own drink, sit down, the food is delivered [fine] but it gets weird when it's almost like service starts then - someone asked if I wanted my drink refilled. Not BAD, I just found the concept...strange.)\n\nBut the reason I'm only giving it two stars is the food. \"Fresh\" is in their slogan but the food wasn't. I got the Natibomb (I think that's what it was called) at the recommendation of the guy at the counter (that's another thing - everyone there was uncommonly attractive. Again, not a bad thing, but it was noticeable that they want their servicepeople to essentially be eyecandy... just without the skimpy clothes.) Anyway. The natibomb. It has apple and turkey and bacon and cheese, all things I like, all things that can be done in a way that is both indulgent (mmm bacon, turkey, cheese) but refreshing (fresh, crispy toasted bread, nice big bites of apple.) Instead the bread was soggy with butter, the cheese was bright orange (come on, real cheddar is DELICIOUS! Don't give me bright orange!), the turkey didn't stand out, the bacon tasted pretty cheap, and the whole thing was really greasy. Like, had to drink my (very delicious) passion tea to wash the grease down greasy. The apple seemed really out of place and didn't cut down on the grease at all. My salad was kind of overdressed, too, but not horrible. \n\nWhich is fine. If you like that kind of food, I think you'll like it there. But greasy food just isn't my taste. If you want a non-greasy yummy sandwich, try Essence Bakery on University & Hardy (they also have fantastic macarons) or The Center Bistro just up the street from Ncounter on 6th & Mill behind the brickyard. Both have local ingredients, too, which is a niche Ncounter isn't going for. \n\n(As an aside, another thing that was strange was how many customer service people were there. There had to be at least 7 FOH staff walking around and while the restaurant isn't small, for something that isn't even full service dining, it seemed really overstaffed. But whatever works for them!)
