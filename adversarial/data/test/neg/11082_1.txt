My friend and I experienced most excellent customer service at this MAC location two days ago.  Jordan (staff member) took us aside and provided a full on make-up education session as she applied a full face to my friend.  Not only was Jordan friendly, she was extremely knowledgeable.  She took the time to ensure we knew everything she was doing and why, also beautifully enhancing my friend's features.  We were just browsing and had no appointment, so we were very lucky.  Jordan also brought over another staff to touch up my eye make-up as well.  I'd recommend Jordan to anyone.  She had the nicest complexion and make-up of the bunch.  Needless to say, many products were purchased after this.  Time well spent.
