everyone keeps mentioning how great the lunch\/dinner is (which it is), but don't rule out breakfast.  if you're lucky enough to wake up early enough to catch the breakfast rush, go!!!  i camer here after waking up to a lobotomizing headache and it was definitely worth it.  in fact, i suggest you come here with a hangover--it just makes everything taste better.  the waffles are awesome; and whatever you do, do NOT miss out on the dessert (drooooool).
