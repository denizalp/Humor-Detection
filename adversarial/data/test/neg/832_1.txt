Went here for the first time over the weekend with one vegan eater and three meat eaters...everyone agrees the food was AMAZING!!! We each ordered a plate of tacos so we could each try a different kind, if I had to pick a favorite it would be the cauliflower tacos, however they were all great. We also ordered the fried guac... SO DELICIOUS!! I super recommend this place if you are vegan\/vegetarian or not.. Also we went mid day and in July, we had to sit outside because seating is very limited inside. They had misters going so the heat was no problem. Check this place out of you get a chance!
