Was excited to try rolled ice cream for the first time, but I have to say that I'm disappointed. Right when we walked in, we realized there was a bad, strong smell inside the store. We had to leave to eat it because we couldn't stand it. The fruit toppings were simply not fresh, and they were discolored and tasted off. We probably won't be back, as the price is a bit too high for the low quality and flavor.
