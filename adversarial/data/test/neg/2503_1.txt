Situated between a small variety of Vietnamese businesses, this family-run Korean restaurant is a hidden gem. \n\nThe service is efficient and friendly. The menus are easy to read and feature pictures for every dish so that it's easier to order. They not only serve just Korean food but there is also a variety of Japanese foods like sushi and sashimi as well. I love that there is the Korean or Japanese name for every dish as well as a quick description on what it consists of. The food portions are huge and the food itself is outstandingly delicious. Meals are also accompanied by Korean side dishes, miso soup and tea which are all equally as yummy. \n\nThe only downside is the limited seating but overall, this restaurant is perfect if you are looking for delicious Korean food but don't want to travel downtown for it.
