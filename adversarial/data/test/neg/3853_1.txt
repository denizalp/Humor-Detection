Had the Lentil Soup and a Turkey Special without mayo (they don't have low or no fat mayo) or cheese. Soup was okay but not terrific. Sandwich was on mushy wheat bread. When they say \"heated\" it means your sandwich is zapped in the microwave. The deli meat leaves a lot to be desired. I get much better turkey from my grocery store. All in all a pretty ordinary experience.
