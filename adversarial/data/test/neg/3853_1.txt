Great job on the remodel, love that it has a starbucks and two levels. Everybody was SUPER nice and helpful... greeted by ALL workers there, even one that was on break. Parking lot is kinda sucky... spaces are close but it is a small plaza and at an awkward spot being on that weird corner. Way more selection than the old\/smaller one that was there.
