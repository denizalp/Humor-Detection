Thai House is really a Thai house once you walk inside. It's neatly decorated with Thai ornaments with wood panellings and carvings and a traditional Thai music is piped in. Fried spring rolls for appetizer tasted good but the sweet and sour sauce that came with it was too sweet. We always get Pad Thai everytime we are in a Thai restaurant. That has become one of my basis to initially gauge what has yet to come. And it tasted alright although it was on the border of being too sweet. The green curry was a delight! Light creamy sauce and a bit spicy. You should try it. We also had the King and I, shrimp in a sweet and salty sauce with brocolli, red and green onions. It was good but not my favorite. So far, this is my favorite of all Thai restaurants we've ever been. Will come back to sample more dishes.
