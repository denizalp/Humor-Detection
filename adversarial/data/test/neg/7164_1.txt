The inside was surprisingly bigger than what it looks on the outside, very chill and artsy ambiance.The beer selection sounded great. And the food didn't disappoint! I had the half size American pho and the Phorito burrito with Ginger pork. I loved that the pho broth wasn't too salty. It was a good ratio of noodles and meat. The burrito was unique in flavor and satisfying. The dank herb sauce was outstanding on the burrito. \nThe service was good and fast (although, it wasn't busy). All around really great flavors!
