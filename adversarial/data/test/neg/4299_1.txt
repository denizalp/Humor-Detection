Brought phone in for cracked screen. Was replaced but phone started \"ghosting\" afterward.  Store blamed it on the mother board, which is a bit of a stretch - the phone was working perfectly except for the screen when it was brought in - seems highly coincidental that the board failed while it was in the store.\n\nI took the phone to another place and they pointed out that Ubreak had not replaced the screws in the bottom of the case and they had severed an internal cable when taking the phone apart.
