Its my 1st time to get waxed at this Salon,and I was very fortunate to have Lorna do my eyebrows.She is the BEST at what she does.She listens to your suggestions and she does such an amazing job..Lorna is that type of person that will make you feel like she has known you forever,she  has such a great personality and a good listener..I     will always try to get Lorna to do my eyebrows,she gets booked right away,because she is the most requested,but the wait is so worth it..
