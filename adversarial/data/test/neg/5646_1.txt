I have never loved a dentist or dental location before. I've always been super stressed to go to the dentist up until coming here. They are amazing, recognized me after one visit. Always care for my son with lots of care and patients. Made me feel amazingly comfortable through everything. Worked through any payment issues with me. They're amazing and I hated the dentist. I even avoided the dentist for years and they didn't make me feel terrible about it, made me feel like I could just make the change now. They are super supportive and helpful.
