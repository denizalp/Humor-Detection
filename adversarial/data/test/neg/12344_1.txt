Living in Highland Park, Kelly's is my local bar of choice. Food is well above average for bar food and they have specials on apps during the week. My favorite thing on the menu is the Pittsburgh Bites (tofu, mild) they are deep fried, crispy, and super tasty. Other stand-out items are the halloumi with olives, and tacos. Friends recommend the burger, chicken sandwich, and mac and cheese, but I have not tried these items before. I had a Southwest wrap once that tasted like it was frozen and I didn't like it, I haven't tried the other items, since I'm not into meat, but they also do a nice salad.\n\nThere's a lot of hype about famous bartenders and upscale bars in the city lately, and indeed, if you're interested in an expensive cocktail of the \"craft\" variety than Livermore or Harvard & Highland are probably more your speed. Kelly's does classic cocktails, and the bartenders care about what they are making. I have never been displeased with any cocktail I have had here. The beer list is also extensive, they change drafts regularly. I am a wine drinker usually but I have no idea if they serve wine here because I always get cocktails. They are strong, high quality, and reasonably priced. I will admit that there have been nights when I've had a few too many, but thankfully this bar is in walking distance of my home ;)
