Decided to try this ramen place out after reading Yelp reviews. Came on a Saturday night, we were seated immediately and ordered soon after. Found the ramen to be just okay, nothing amazing but decent enough.  The Ika Yaki wasn't as good as we were expecting, have had better.\n\nService is friendly, but the place is small and a line started forming as we were leaving the restaurant.
