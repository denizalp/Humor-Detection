I'm in love with this place! It has a hearty vegan menu (and of course non-vegan stuff). Such a treat. The vegan sausage sandwich was delish and the vegan cheesecake was just as good if not better than regular cheesecake. We went on a Friday and the owner's 20 something children were playing a live acoustic set. Such a great vibe this place has. So happy to have found it. Yay!
