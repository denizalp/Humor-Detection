What a great little place! There are only approximately 10 tables which really gives it an intimate feel. Service was excellent. The bartender and chef both came over at different times throughout our meal to make sure we were enjoying the drinks and food. Which we were! Everything was great. My boyfriend and I both tried the vegetarian tasting menu and although I was a bit skeptical, given that vegetarian dishes are never my first choice when I eat out, everything was delicious and you could tell quality ingredients had been used. Cocktails were also excellent - great mixologist. Will definitely be back!
