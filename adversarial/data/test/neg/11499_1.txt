The few sweets that I tried (lemon tart, caramel candy, fruits bread and truffle) it was really tasty, all fresh and well prepared. They seems to use all the best ingredients for everything they make.\nThe lady was really kind and helpful with us, but a little too pushy, asking us to try different things while we didn't want to.\nBut two things got me a little down with this place:\n1- I understand the quality of the products but I think it's a little over priced, too expensive.\n2- After choosing the sweets and sitting on the table, it took so much time for them to bring us what we choose to eat. We almost gave up and left.\n\nWould I recommend? Hmmmm, yes. It will be a good place to buy maybe a gift for someone that really appreciate sweets. But not for an usual place to go sit and talk.
