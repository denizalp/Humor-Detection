Had a very good experience here last night dining to celebrate my cousin's birthday.\nThe food was very good. Our party ordered a range of dishes; skillet cornbread, burnt ends (appetizers), chicken and waffles, short ribs, shrimp and grits. All items were cooked perfectly and had good seasoning, though in our opinion the fried chicken would benefit from added seasoning.\n\nService was on point, from the hostess to the wait staff, all were courteous and effective.\n\nDecor is rustic-modern, and lighting (an often overlooked dining component) is balanced and soothing. The bar and lounge area, the latter furnished with comfortable sofas and lounge chairs, are relaxing and inviting.\n\nThe only cocktail order by our party were Old Fashions and they were spiked appropriately while still exhibiting all the expected flavor characteristics of that drink.\n\nWe would return to dine here.
