Went here after a concert at Gila River Arena.  Late at night it is a weird combination of restaurant\/club with blaring music and packed elbow to elbow but also tables out and servers.  If you can get through the battle to the bar and get a drink this place is pretty fun but presents a lot of hurdles to just have a good time.
