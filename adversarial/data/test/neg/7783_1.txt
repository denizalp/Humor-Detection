This is a well known restaurant that has been in Madison for a little while. The customer service is excellent. The time it took to be seated excelled our expectations. They were short staffed but still and still provided stellar service. The food was cooked to perfection and had a great temperature. The cheese curds, the firecracker shrimp, the ribs, the oriental tacos, the cat fish, the pulled pork, the sweet potatoe fries, the hush puppies, the seasonal veggies, the Mac and cheese, the brisket baked beans...EVERYTHING was amazing. I will definitely be back, and tell all of my friends about this place!
