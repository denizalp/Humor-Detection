I absolutely love coming to Dr. Rose's office! Everyone in the office is always so kind and welcoming. I love getting my teeth cleaned and Grace, the dental hygienist, always does an amazing job. Melissa, the office manager, is the best at her job. You can tell that she is committed to the patients because she goes out of her way to really help you and make you feel at ease. Dr. Rose is really knowledgeable and kind. I saw another dentist who told me that I had a cavity but after evaluation, Dr. Rose ruled out decay and explained that it was only a stain. I recently changed dental insurance which this office does not take, but I will continue being a self-pay patient because my experiences with this office is worth it!
