I attended a Cleveland Scene event here last week, actually a happy hour event and I could not have been more pleased with everything.  The bar area is adorable, the staff is adorable and the dining room is adorable.  It is safe to say that I was pleasantly surprised with my experience, since it seemed like a hole-in-the-wall spot in Lakewood.\n\nAlways on the hunt for good Greek\/Middle Eastern dips I eagerly ordered the 3 out of 4 dips appetizer (hummus, garlic eggplant and feta with roasted red pepper) and they were all amazing.  The hummus was creamy and had a good garlic taste, I was expecting the eggplant to be more like Baba but it had a choppier texture and more of a sweet taste and the feta gave my taste buds a run for their money. \n\nDefinitely recommend for an evening out with friends and good ethnic food.
