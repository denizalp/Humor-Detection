We thought we would like this place because of the beer (which we do!!  Lots of stuff on tap including 6 or 8 beers of their own), but the food knocked us off our feet.  Really really good food for pub fare.\n\nI highly recommend the meatloaf - it is a giant portion and very tasty... it's not your mother's meatloaf!
