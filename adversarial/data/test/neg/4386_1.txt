Looked for a breakfast place on yelp as we are from out of town - stopped here based on name sake alone - AMAZING! Had Benedict biscuit and carrot cake waffles - just delicious...don't even get my started in their Iced lattes, Starbucks should be quaking. Got to talking with the owners who are an adorable mother\/daughter team. Will definitely be coming back. Stellar food. Stellar service.
