I don't have the words to tell you how wonderful Mon Bel Ami is but I'll try. Our Wedding was on 3\/30\/13.\nWe had our wedding booked at another Vegas Chapel but two weeks before they told us they wouldn't do the ceremony they said they would.  We where freaking out to say the least.  We had looked at Mon Bel Ami but chose the other place first mostly because the photos looked better.  \nWell with only two weeks Mon Bel Ami got us in on the same day and time, did everything we asked for and so much more.  They where perfect from the start, so out going and helpful.  When we told them what happened with the last chapel they where very shocked and even apologized (the other place didn't)\nOur wedding was more then we could have asked for.  Tony the minister was great.  Our ceremony was a new one for him as we are Wiccan and wanted a handfasting but he did a wonderful job.  Even after the wedding when he came in to talk to us he said he really loved the wording and asked if we had written it ourselves.  For the record yes, we did but we found the out line for it on line.  We also have a 10 year old son that was included in the ceremony and he really liked that.\nI can't remember the photographers name (I'm so sorry) but he is AMAZING.  The photos are outstanding to say the least.  They really need to update the website to reflect his work because this was the main reason we didn't choose them first.  We also love that we got the rights to all our photos at no extra charge but I think we got the largest photo package they have which really wasn't all that much if you compare it to other places.  The other chapel we booked at wanted to charge us $700 just for the rights and that was on top of the $500 we where paying for a little extra time anyway. \nThe flowers where and still are beautiful, I had 12 red roses with dark red calla lilies around them.  They didn't even start to dry out for a week and that was with no water.  Now I have them hanging above my bed drying and they still look good. \nWith Mon Bel Ami you will get much more for your money with the same or better quality of other larger chapels in Vegas.  I also like that they only have one wedding at a time so it's all about you.  \nMy limo was running a little late but at no point did I feel rushed at all, it was no big deal to them and if it was I sure didn't know it.\nYou can tell that the staff at Mon Bel Ami loves what they do, all of them.  They care about the couples and it shows.  Thank you to the whole staff for saving our wedding and making it better then it would have been.\n\nI would only recommend that they update the web site, make it more user friendly and put up new photos.  This would attract more couples to you.
