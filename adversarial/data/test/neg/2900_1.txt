I found my old Invicta watch while packing for our move and decided to take it here based on all the great reviews and I promise you they live up to their ratings! \n\nA little hard to find because it's tucked away in a complex off of Scottsdale road (just across the street from Chase Bank) but you will be glad you came here for repairs. \n\nThey were even gave my watch a buff to take away some of the scratches! \n\nThank you again!!
