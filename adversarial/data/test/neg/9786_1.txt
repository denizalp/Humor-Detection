Dr. Fisch and his team are the best to work with.  They take time to explain everything from start to finish in great detail.  Dr. Fisch is very honest and knowledgeable- I wouldn't go to anybody else.  My husband and I went through three cycles and it looks like the third time was the charm!  The process of IVF is emotionally tough, but Dr. Fisch and his team make it much easier!
