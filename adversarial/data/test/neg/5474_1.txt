Decided to check this place out after reading a bunch of great reviews. We did the Osaka High room which was pretty good! So many rooms to go through that it made the experience well worth it.\n\nMy only criticism would be the staff. We didn't escape the room and only had one section left to get through. When the staff came in telling us we were out of time, the normal procedure would be to walk us through what we had left. Instead, the guy said he was unable to finish a walk through because the next group had arrived. It seemed that he was unwilling to walk us through the remaining aspects because if he did, then he'd have to reset all the puzzles... I've been to quite a few escape room locations and never has this happened before, even if the next group had arrived..\n\nOverall the Osaka High room was pretty cool, but I only wish I knew how it ended.....
