Wow! They warn you about dropping your jaw to the floor and they don't lie! My father found out about this place due to the Pee Wee Herman bike from the original film, however, we were able to enjoy much much more! There are hidden treasures of all types through this museum. The staff only added to the experience as we were given a complimentary tour which helped to hone it on some of the rarest of rare treasures. Would suggest for history and bike enthusiasts alike!
