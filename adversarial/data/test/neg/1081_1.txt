I had a good time here last weekend and would have reviewed much higher, until I looked at my bank statement! The day after visiting Surrender I had 5 pending transactions from the club on my bank statement - I should have only had 2. The same thing happened to one of my friends, but she had 6 charges. We paid for drinks at different bars within the club, so it wasn't just a fluke. After calling our banks they explained we had to wait until the charges actually went through (up to 3 days) to dispute them. Currently I have 2 incorrect charges that went through and another pending. I called to dispute them with the club, and conveniently the only person who can help me with this (according to the woman who answered the phone) works 10-4, so I will have to call during my working hours to try and get this settled. I'm beyond annoyed and will not recommend that anyone visit Surrender.
