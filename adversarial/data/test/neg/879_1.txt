The Village Seafood Buffet at the Rio is (as far as I know) the only all-seafood, all-the-time buffet in Vegas.  It's not cheap, at about $40, but the selection is great, and I highly recommend it.  The buffet has a wide range of seafood and non-seafood items, the highlights of which are the raw oysters, raw and steamed clams, snow (and sometimes king) crab legs, and petite lobster tails.  They have some meat options as well, usually some prime rib, sausage, chicken or turkey, etc.  The sushi and salads\/desserts are great as well, and they have cuisines various parts of the world.  I highly recommend the buffet, and if you're smart you'll go early or late, as the line can be long!
