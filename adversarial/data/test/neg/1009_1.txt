I love the patio area of this restaurant and really like their Happy Hour menu.\n\nLike many Scottsdale restaurants, I'm more of a fan of the Happy Hour food than the dinner menu which doesn't have much that appeals to me.\n\nThis place is especially nice if you have out of town guests. The location makes it very memorable.
