We had our sons 5th birthday party here and it was great! The adults had as much fun as the kids! We usually did birthday parties at our house but not anymore. We had 2 party hosts that helped the guests get checked in and kept us informed of what was planned. It was great not to have to clean up. \nThis was such a memorable celebration & can't wait for next time we go jump!
