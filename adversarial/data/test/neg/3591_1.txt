I came for a quick bite through the drive through with my sister, and my debit card was so scratched, since I was waiting for my new one to arrive still at the moment and it wasn't taking my payment. The fact that they still gave us our order even after they tried a million times was extremely nice of them. Employees were understanding and I was happy. I'm coming back and paying for what I owed. And the order was made correctly as I love their potato soft tacos.
