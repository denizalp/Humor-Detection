This is such a fantastic restaurant! One of the best places for Mexican food in town. Don't let the outside fool you...it's a hidden jem. Be patience with the staff and you won't be disappointed. Everything is made from scratch and the portions are large. The enchiladas and the verde sauce are my favorites but everything is good. I never regret exploring the menu. Save room for something from the bakery or ice cream shop next door.
