This is a really cool shop. They sell eclectic jewelry, clothing, handbags, and home decor. Most of the items are imported. I love the jewelry. They have sterling silver, wooden, bone, beaded, and fun costume jewelry. Every time I stop in here, I get a pair of wooden earrings because I have never seen these before anywhere! Also, last time I went, all the clothing was 50% off! Definitely worth a visit if you're in the neighborhood!
