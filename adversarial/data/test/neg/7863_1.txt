Absolutely love this place. New favorite restaurant for authentic Mexican food. It also comes with really delicious sopa. The service was amazing, too. The facility was clean and quaint; I can definitely see how maddening and crazy this place could get during a meal rush. You definitely have to try this place; you'll love it! I promise.
