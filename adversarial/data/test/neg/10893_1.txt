I want to make this review short to contrast with the s l o w service and long night i spent at Rick Moonen's Seafood Restaurant. \n\nAmbiance - nice and clean but lacking personality\nService - far too slow and too much talking about the menu and food\nFood presentation - trying to be artsy with all that liquid nitrogen stuff blowing around\nFood portion - tiny as hell\nFood itself - mediocre\nSeafood - not that fresh\nPrice - extremely overpriced for what it is\n\nIn conclusion - it was a very boring experience that left me hungry afterwards.
