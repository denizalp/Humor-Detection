I have used the services of It's A Dog's World School of Grooming for our four dogs since 2004.  We had our rescue dog Kai groomed there a year ago.  One day we brought her home and noticed her paw was cut.  The paw continued to bleed and we finally stopped the bleeding by putting pressure on her paw.  We were never notified by the grooming facility but called and spoke with Manager Dawn Pennington.  Dawn acted surprised of the injury.  I asked that the next time one of my dog's is injured that I be notified immediately.\n\nOn December 10th, my mini schnauzer Katie was groomed.  At he time Katie was 13 years old.  After picking her up from grooming, I noticed she had a puncture wound next to corner of her eye.  I rinsed her eye and didn't notice any changes until a few weeks later when her eye glazed over white with an opaque film over her eye. We had a separate dog groomed on 12\/13 and I let him he owner's daughter know that Katie's eye had been injured.  I also called and left a voicemail on 12\/23 after the vet appointment with no returned call.  I spoke to Manager Dawn Pennington on 1\/3 after leaving several messages.  \n\nDawn denied the injury and said to submit vet bills.  She said she would file a claim with her insurance but I never heard back from an insurance adjuster,  after serving a legal letter and writing reviews on Facebook, i received a call from the adjuster,  we will need to have my dog's eye removed.I took her to the vet on 12\/23 and the vet prescribed antibiotics and eye drops for almost two months.  We continue to see the vet but its looking more and more like eye removal is imminent.\n\nI write this review because I don't want anyone else to have this experience.  Mistakes can and do happen.  However, the owner should be immediately notified and the school should offer to resolve the situation and not try to deny it ever happened.
