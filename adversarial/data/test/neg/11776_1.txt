The place was not busy and the prices seemed high for breakfast and brunch\n\n\nPer your comments...\n\nI thought I was reviewing for Kitchen table which was 5 star. The food was great, the service was great, and the prices were good. \n\nTo be honest, we went to your restaurant before and it had a sewer smell. We thought perhaps it was a one time issue. This was not the case...same smell. Plus the prices were high for what you get. \n\nI would much rather go to kitchen table next door. Even with a 10% discount I would not go back. Even with a free meal I would not go. You asked me to be honest...so here it is. Good luck.
