I wish I could give zero stars. It was the worst Puerto Rican food I have ever had. The chicharon tasted like salty old bricks. The arroz con gandules was crunchy old and nasty. The bacalaito had to have been sitting under that heat lamp for days because you couldn't even bite through it without breaking a tooth. Gross!!!
