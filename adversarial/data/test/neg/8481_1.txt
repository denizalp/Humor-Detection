I whole-heartedly, enthusiastically recommend this fantastic local boutique. My experience in particular, was based on the mission to find a wedding dress, while avoiding the superficiality that is so commonly found in the wedding industry - especially your basic run-of-the-mill bridal shops. I wanted something locally made and custom designed...and with some searching, I landed on the instagram account for Cleo & Clementine. Boom! Through the power of social media, wedding dress wishes were granted. \n\nThree months before my wedding day, I set up an appointment, and met Monique (the owner) and Rachel for the first time. From there, I will say it was definitely a journey, which turned into a serious challenge once certain family members (read: my mother) got involved with the design choice at the last minute. This turned into a whirlwind of fittings, design and fabric changes one week before the wedding. Not an ideal scenario for anyone - but Monique and Rachel were incredibly patient. and determined to make everyone happy. They never once made me feel like I was an inconvenience for making changes, as it was apparent that they sincerely wanted to create the perfect wedding dress for me. \n\nAt the end of it all, it truly felt like they were a part of the family, to the point where I extended them invitations to my wedding. I'm so glad I chose to support a local business that is passionate and full of authenticity. Monique and Rachel, I cannot thank you enough - your skilled efforts and overall kindness will not be forgotten. My wedding dress and the entire experience was completely perfect.
