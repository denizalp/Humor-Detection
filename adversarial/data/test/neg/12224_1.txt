The food was great!!! Everything from the chips and salsa to the main course rocked. They give you bean dip and sauted onions\/bell peppers along with the usual chips and salsa. I am a fan of the salsa because I like it mild and well blended. So good! We had the chicken and shrimp fajitas. Very very good. The service was good too. They offered us tons of napkins over and over for our messy 1 yr old. We are going back for my birthday. I am excited.
