Food was good, BUT...Eliminate the dishonest and underhanded way that customers are cheated out of extra money. I asked for one order of 20 wings with 3 flavors. The order was purposely entered as 2 orders (10 and 5+5) of wings, which resulted in a higher price charged to me on my receipt.  Though the extra amount (stolen) is small, the dishonest intentions are not. If the menu has 20 wings at a price, and I order 20 wings, I do no want it entered as two orders which costs more, so the employee gets a bonus. To me, it is stealing from customers, because something is done which I did not ask for, and I am charged more for a decision which was not mine. DISGUSTING!!! I brought the difference in price up to the employee for an explanation as to why it was entered differently than how I ordered from the menu. The employee shamefully admitted they get bonuses when they enter orders in that manner.  SHAME!!!
