Mike & his sweet Nephew Fernando did an awesome job on my Cadillac yesterday. I honestly felt like I had a new vehicle. I have a used car, I have had it for 1 1\/2 years and they did a great job shining her up. Friendly, detailed and I was proud to support a Locally owned business on Shop Local Small Business Saturday. Thank you so much and I will definitely refer folks to you!!
