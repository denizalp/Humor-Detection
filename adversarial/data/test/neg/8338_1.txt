The day before my visit here, my buddies and I talked about how we missed out favorite all you can eat prime rib. As that conversation carried on, I pulled up Google on my phone and Google AYCE prime rib and Pickle Bill's was the first to pop up from a list of AYCE spots in Cleveland. I brought it up and it was tossed in the air as place to visit the next day even though we were already having prime rib that night.\n\nFast forward to today, I yelped the place and it had a lot of mixed reviews. Even with all that, I knew I had to make a visit to give my own review. We made reservations for 11 and made the hour drive to try it out.\n\n8 out of the 11 in our party orders the AYCE prime rib and\/or crab legs. Service started off rather slow because our server got swamp, but after all out orders went in, I noticed we had extra help and it was pointed out that it was the owner's wife helping serve us. My guess is that since we were dropping some cash, it was priority to take care of us. I mean she was at our table making sure we got what we needed and got it in a timely fashion. Kudos to that as I've never had that happen before. The restaurant was pretty busy too as most people were waiting for an hour from what I heard as I walked to the men's room.\n\nOn to the food. The prime rib was mediocre and the crab legs to start off were not great. There were major inconsistencies in the prime rib cuts and the crab legs were served cold. The crab legs seemed as if they were made the night before and then refrigerated to be served as back up since they through so much. We went two rounds with these crab legs and then the third round came with freshly cooked legs. How can I tell? Well, they were warm and the meat wasn't shriveled and dried up. A refrigerator sucks water out things when you don't cover it. My guess, as stated, is that they make a batch ahead of time or refrigerate what isn't sold from the night before to be served the next day to not take a loss on cooked legs. The freshly cooked legs had juicer meat, because of being freshly cooked, and were warm as stated. With all that being said, it wasn't horrible as they were edible but don't expect top notch  tasting food. I ate 3 rounds of crab legs and 2 cuts of prime rib. I do like he fact that they don't give you the creamy horseradish. I'm not a fan of the creamy stuff at all. Their bread with cinnamon butter is pretty good and their side dishes are okay. I opted for the coleslaw and redness and with rice. The coleslaw was really bland but the red beans and rice was good. \n\nOverall, it's a decent place. We all had the same thing pretty much so I can't really speak on anything else off their menu. It's going to be hard to convince me to make the hour drive back but I would just to take some family or special guests. We sat out on the patio and it felt like we weren't even in Ohio anymore with the decor and the river right there.
