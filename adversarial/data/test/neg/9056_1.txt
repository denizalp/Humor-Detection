What's not to love.  The staff here are consistently happy and cheerful and helpful.  They are very good at looking up information, taking my money for payments to be posted, and letting me get on with my business.  I also like that they are a reputable bank and have not be involved in the plethora of scandals that have plagued other financial institutions.
