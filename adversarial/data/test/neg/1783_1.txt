I found this shop due to their online presence. They have an updated Facebook and website which is excellent for people that aren't necessarily close by. I wanted to do my research before making the trip out to fort mill. \n\nI came in search of a solid hot sauce for an uncle of mine and I definitely came to the right place. The folks that work here are super nice and more than willing to listen to you and help you out while you search for what you need. The store isn't too big but you can get lost in the sauce here if you don't know what you are looking for. \n\nThey have lots of their own products including Carolina reaper seeds so you can grow your own. They also feature different sauces from other friends even some from New Zealand! \nDon't miss the tasting bar. I didn't and it set my day on fire. You can see if you can handle the sauce before you even buy it. What a great place! Will remember this shop for gifts as well as my own hot sauce needs!
