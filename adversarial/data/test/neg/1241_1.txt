Ah, Silverton...How I used to love thee. Good craps, good food, good valet. But you've grown. It looks like all your attention went into that big new expansion, and you forgot some of the little things, like updating your slots. Yes, now you've got a Starbucks and a Johnny Rockets, but how about a Star Trek machine? Full-pay video poker?\n\nSilverton is a great \"locals\" casino. It's a nice enough place and has most of the amenities you would want. The slot club is far more rewarding than Station's in my experience, which was enough to get my play for a long time. Table games are good, $5 blackjack all day long, craps still even gets down to $3 during the days (I think) with 10x odds, and it's still only $5 even on the busiest weekend nights. Restaurants are all at least good enough, and Twin Creeks is actually pretty great. Valet service at night is *excellent*. Now if they would only put in some more slots that I'd actually wanna play, I could get back to my once religious visitation schedule and update this review to 5 stars.
