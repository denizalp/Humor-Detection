This is one of my favorite places for Mexican food in Las Vegas. I love the bean dip and the queso fundido with chorizo is phenomenal. I always order the same thing which is a combo of a beef burrito and chicken taco. The burrito is flavorful and juicy. The chicken in the taco varies a little each time though and can either be juicy or quite dry, but when it is dry I just put salsa on it and it is fine. The staff is always super friendly and quick. \n\nI've seen at least two other restaurants fail in this location, but Juan's seems to know what they are doing because it is usually pretty packed.\n\nI am giving it four stars rather than five because the drinks are very inconsistent. Sometimes the apocalypse drink tastes great and other times it has so much alcohol I can't even drink it.
