I find this cute little Italian Bistro by chance after leaving exhausted from an evening at Mapleside Farms enjoying family fall activities. This little restaurant is across the street from Mapleside, so it was perfect. We walked up to an adorable patio with gorgeous hibiscus flowers. It was close to closing time, but the staff said that they were still open. The inside was so cute and cozy and we got our beverages, salads and bread right away. Our main entrees arrived and the Fettucine Alfredo and the meat sauce in their baked ziti was honestly the best I have ever had. Friendly staff and a warm atmosphere. I do not live in the area, but will plan on going back whenever I am down that way.
