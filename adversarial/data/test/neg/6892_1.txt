Shakes are sometimes made with the improper amount of milk, management is not very personable and in fact are often rude. You feel more like an intruder than a customer, let alone family. The team members are very friendly and remember you and make meaningful conversation.\n\nWhen placing orders online, if I leave allergen specific requests (such as no mushroom, no tomato) in the additional details section, food is still improperly prepared. This has happened on 3 separate visits. Additionally I was assured I would be refunded for a food item I paid for that was not included in my order, and it has been a month with no results. This store has so much potential and unless there is a change in management they will not get the positive feedback that I know they are capable of earning. \n____________________\nOn my 11\/24\/16 visit associate Taylor prepared my order superbly. She followed the instructions in my additional details and prepared my order neatly. My shake was deliciously thick! My original pick up time was 12:15, but Taylor had it ready when I arrived 10 minutes early -- she even put napkins in my bag!
