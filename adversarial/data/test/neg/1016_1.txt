I came in for gender reveal last Tuesday. Tech was extremely friendly, got really good pictures & was able to tell us the gender very quickly.. Room is big & comfortable, family friendly.. They have toys in the corner to keep your little ones occupied. Definitely had an awesome experience & recommend!
