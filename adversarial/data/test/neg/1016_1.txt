Fresh ingredients, great flavor and personable service. My husband and I were fans from our first visit. Since we live nearby we are regulars. If more of our neighbors would go more regularly they would stay open later in the day. So, neighbors...go and give it a try.  This is not your greasy, overly bland excuse for Mexican food.  This is fast, fresh and tasty!!!\nTry their breakfast burrito with chicken or steak, YUM!!!
