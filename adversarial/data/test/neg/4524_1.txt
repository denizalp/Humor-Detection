Love the selection of cheese and charcuterie to start. and the olives are delicious as well. They have some tasty and creative house drink options. i go for anything that contains whiskey, so i was happy. The entrees were a good size, a fair price, and tasty. And the blueberry cheesecake dessert was delicious. Thanks for the fun meal!
