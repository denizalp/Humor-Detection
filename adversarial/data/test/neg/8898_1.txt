I came into this store pretty upset with Cox in general due to some online customer service representatives.Gabriel was so amazing that he actually turned my opinion of the company around. He took the time to listen to my frustrations and he bent over backwards to deal with them. From now on, he's our go-to guy.I highly recommend going to this particular store if you're having problems with Cox, it might be your answer.
