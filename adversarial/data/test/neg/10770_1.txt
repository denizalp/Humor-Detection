The Chinese groceries supermarket at Market Village next to Pacific Mall. It's not a very big food mart but it holds a variety of meat produce, veggie selection and packaged goods. They also sell food at a fairly cheap price.\n\nDon't expect a clean supermarket nor one that is tidy and everything neatly placed, this isn't one. But it has the standard fresh groceries you want from fruits to fish. Their cashiers are pretty fast at their services too.
