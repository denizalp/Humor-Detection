Ultimately, they did a great job! The floor looks great and I had them re-face my fireplace which is now my favorite piece in the whole house! There were a few snafus (wrong tile showed up initially, dryer needed a new vent, floors very hazy and I couldn't get clean) but, once brought to their attention were corrected very quickly. They completed the job in a timely manner and communicated each day regarding progress. I appreciate their dedication to ensuring customer satisfaction. I would definitely recommend!
