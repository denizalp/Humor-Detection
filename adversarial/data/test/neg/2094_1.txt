I honestly had bigger expectations with this place. My favorite thing out of everything I had was probably a vanilla infused beet salad. Everything else was either too salty or bland. I remember coming here years ago and my expectations were definitely met.. paying $40\/person is a bit much for a mediocre meal.. Also, the two stars I gave is for the dessert, which was delicious!
