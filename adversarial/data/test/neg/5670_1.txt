I have some family in the Rock Hill area and decided I wanted something local and unique for dinner. Well I should have thought twice about this place. \n\nMy wife and I went here on a Saturday Night. The first thing I noticed was the very interesting interior design. The interior was like we stepped back in the 1950's. It had a ocean\/island feel but not like a good place you would eat on the beach. The servers had on Hawaiian shirts, but most of the dishes on the menu were Chinese dishes (Click on their website). Most of the clientele were older persons. \n\nMy main reason to go here was the southern style vegetable dishes they served. However on Saturday nights they do not serve them. I thought this was very strange. We did not want to spend $10-15 for a Chinese dish, so we ended up eating a burger (Me) and a grilled cheese (Wife). The food was okay, but was average at best.\n\nThe staff was friendly. When I ordered, I asked for the burger and whatever came with it. She asked if I wanted fries and said \"Whatever comes with it\". Well I got fries which was not included and cost about $2 extra. My Wife got her grilled cheese (hard to mess up) and a baked potato which appeared to be microwaved. \n\nI observed what other people ordered and it looked okay, but the portion were small for the price. Luckily we only spent $16.88 plus tip: Hamburger, Grilled Cheese, Fries and Baked Potato.\n\nI am sure they are good at something, and maybe if the meal is free I might go back. I hate that I took a chance and was disappointed. Aloha!
