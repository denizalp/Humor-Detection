Entrance Fee: $5\nTime Limit: Unlimited \nNumber of Board Games: Too many to count\n\nThis place is amazing for a group of friends to spend a day. When they first opened, they were a small place and then they expanded to their basement and then expanded to another building next door. It's a pretty massive place now. The workers are very knowledgable with pretty much all of their board games; if you pick one off the shelf and can't figure it out, don't be afraid to ask for help. The workers won't bite. \n\nNever tried any of their cafe items, so I can't make a comment about that. \n\nDefinitely worth a visit, even once just for the experience.
