I purchased my car from Shane, he was wonderful. He catered my my wants and needs and made me feel like an important customer. I wasn't just a way to make money to him, the surrounding employees were also cheerful and asked how I was doing and wanted to make sure I was enjoying my time there. I will most definitely continue doing business with this company.
