Food is cheap but tasty.  I would recommend it to everyone who likes Taiwanese food. It's on the second level of pacific mall. Fast and easy. Have been there once in a while, never disappointed. Only thing is that you have to be okay to eat at the food court and be patient when you try to find a seat because it's pretty packed usually.
