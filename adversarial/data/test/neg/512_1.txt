My dress didn't need much, but I knew I didn't want to go do David's Bridal where I had purchased the dress.  I had read too many horror stories.  I needed the dress brought up some, a bustle, and cups installed (I was not going to wear a bra on my wedding day).  They also pressed it and had it hanging nicely so all I had to do was put it on.  Beautiful work, timely manner, easy to work with.  The only reason I am giving this a 4-star is because I think it was a little over priced for what I needed done.  However, I took comfort in the fact that it was in good, experienced hands.  Would have had it preserved there, but I did not have time to drop it off before I moved just 2 days after my wedding.
