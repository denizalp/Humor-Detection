had the pho here like 6-7 times\n\nit's good pho, not the best I've had in MTL but better than the other places in the area\n\nwhat stood out to me here is the service, some of the staff are extremely kind, considerate, and overall very good servers\n\npho is a solid 8\/10\nservice is a 10\/10 (depending on who waits on you)\natmosphere is 8\/10 - it's nice and usually quiet, but the decor isn't super nice or fancy \n\nMy friend had another dish once and it wasn't great, definitely come here for the pho\n\noverall, this place is pretty pho-king great hehe
