I've had lashes done all over the city and Kim is by far the best.  She takes her time, and it shows.  My lashes last for 6 weeks and still look amazing.  I trust Kim implicitly, and recently went to her for microblading. Unsurprisingly, she did an AMAZING job.  I couldn't be happier with the results.  Not only is she meticulous about everything she does, she makes a couple hours pass by like 5 minutes.  LOVE THIS GIRL!
