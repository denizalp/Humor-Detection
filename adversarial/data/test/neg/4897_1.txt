Dr. Vander Doelen is a fantastic chiropractor.  He spends a healthy amount of time trying to understand root causes of injuries with focus on prevention (rather than a quick snap and send off).  I almost felt like I was getting a 2-in-1 chiro+physio.  He also uses acupuncture, which I can say has certainly helped me with some acute pain visits.  Highly recommended.
