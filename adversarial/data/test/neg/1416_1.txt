Always like coming here for good authentic Chinese\/Vietnamese\/Cambodian food. We ordered their family meals for $80 you get salt and pepper shrimp, big pot of hot and sour soup (your choice of Vietnamese or Thai style), stir fry calm with sweet basil and jalape√±os and the whole sweet and sour fried whole some fish. I have also ordered their pho too and it's very delicious and tasty. After your meal they serve a small bowl of sweet desert. We been coming here every time we visit Vegas. Service could be a hit or miss today took them 15 mins to come take our orders due to a large loud party behind us. We will come back when we visit again.
