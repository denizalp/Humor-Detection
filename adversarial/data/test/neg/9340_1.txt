This place is sort of like how fusaros used to be with several hot plate items that change daily - they have salad and sandwiches which tend to be on the gourmet side.  \n\nToday's menu had a beef meet pie, breaded chicken breast and fresh vegetables and a few other items - all of which were tasty and worthy of the $7 or $8 cost. \n\nAlcohol is also served with fine beer and wine options :) two doors down from spadina and Adelaide.
