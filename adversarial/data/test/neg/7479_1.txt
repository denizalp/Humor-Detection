The hunt for good ayce sushi is tough. I wouldn't say this was the better ayce I've ever had, I would visit again if I was in the area.\n\nLike many sushi joints, Ichiki has integrated the iPad system to order. There's a great selection and variety of items. One notable example, is the pressed\/torched sushi. Everyone is trying to do nowadays, but for ayce torched it's pretty good! They also had butterfish tataki which is different from the regular salmon and beef tataki.\n\nThe orders come out fast and quick. Unfortunately, our group over ordered and we were charged $15 for excess food. Although, for 15 dollars we got a deal on how much sushi to take home as we ended up with 3 full takeout containers.
