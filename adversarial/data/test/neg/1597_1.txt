Honestly, I have dealt with horrible customer service in the past but NEVER something this bad. Every time I called, or my bridesmaids called they were super rude and not helpful. We ordered the dresses through the website with a rush delivery. I called yesterday to get an update because I knew they were coming in, they acted super annoyed that I was even calling about it and then the girl had to rush off the phone because UPS was there and she said she would call me right back... No one ever did. Then they got emails saying they were ready for pickup and my bridesmaid sent me a video because she felt so uncomfortable because the employees were arguing in the back super loud and then they lost one of the dresses. Even after it said that it was ready for pickup. Super unprofessional and rude. Beware if you're getting dresses from here, don't expect great customer service.
