This is Megan B, sorry not Eder. (First yelp, his Mac) It was my first time getting my lashes done and I was beyond impressed!! I am so happy, they look amazing! Especially in my engagement photos! I only expected to go a few times but I think I'll be scheduling a fill in a few weeks! I was so relaxed the whole time, Gabriella did an amazing job!
