great supermarket.  big spacious clean.  my bf introduced me here and ive been going ever since.  the produce and greens are fresh and yhe hot station has killer shawarma.  ive noticesit closes early sometimes... so watch out if u have shawarma craving...come early.\n\nthe deserts are presented beautofully and neved have i seen a plaace so devoted to nuts lol.  also a nice fresh bread section.  impressive.
