Really awesome Greek-inspired restaurant inside The Cosmo. It's not cheap, but they have a lunch special, 3 courses for $29 which is a good deal.\n\nWe got fizzy water, a whole bottle for only $8. They brought out some grilled bread with good olive oil, with freshly cut basil they clip at the table.\n\nI started off with the Tomato salad. Really nice! Even the lunch portion is generous. Tomatoes were ripe and juicy. Loved the high quality feta cheese! DH paid an extra $10 for grilled octopus. This dish was great - octopus was tender with nice char grilled flavor. It went well with the beans. DH thought it was a bit too salty, but he likes his stuff less salty.\n\nFor the mains, I got the Dorade Royale, which is a grilled white fish, whole including the head and tail! This was really fresh and delicate. A simple preparation with good olive oil, herbs, capers, and lemon. It had a few bones, but thankfully, the server warned us about it. Delicious and healthy, a great alternative to standard greasy Vegas food. DH paid $15 extra to get the lobster pasta, which he loved. The sauce was tomato based, a tad sweet, but worked nicely. DH said the amount of lobster was generous. Plating was really cool, including the lobster shell.\n\nDessert was definitely the weak part of the meal. I got the Karidopita cake, which is a dense, heavily spices cake. It had a ridiculously sweet honey orange zest sauce, like the stuff you drizzle on baklava. The tiny scoop of vanilla (?) ice cream really helped with balance, but it was still too sweet. DH got the seasonal fruits. A lot of the fruit is clearly not in season in Vegas - pineapple, strawberry, watermelon, apple, figs. They would have done better by offering some type of sorbet.\n\nOverall, a great place for Greek inspired seafood. Gorgeous environment, excellent service. Go for the lunch deals!
