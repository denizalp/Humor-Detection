A big storm with 60-mile winds left us with a very large silver maple with a cracked trunk and big limb over a neighbor's fence. We called 8 different tree companies, and many were slow about calling us back (or never did). The owner, Mike, called back and even stopped by that day. Unlike many companies that emailed us higher estimates than they verbally quoted us, Mike wrote out an estimate on the spot. Johnson Tree Service gave us an quote for $2,700--interesting since the highest quote we received was $4,800. It's also worth noting that most companies charged $300 for stump grinding, but Johnson Tree Service quoted us for $150 for the stump.\n\nThe crew got here early to set up, and then had to wait for the MG&E person to cut the power (since a big limb was directly over a neighbor's powerline and close to a transformer). During the entire 5 hours that it took, the entire crew was working hard. I think it also speaks well of a company when the owner is getting dirty and working alongside his crew. They got the job done, and they made sure to give us an itemized bill for our insurance claim.\n\nSome people expect everything to be perfect when taking down a tree. If so, you might not like  little things like hostas getting covered with mulch, or grass getting stomped down. The thing is, this was a big job, and I'm not going to sweat the small things. I was more worried about protecting my neighbor's yard, since they had to drive their big machines through their yard (and we already inconvenienced the neighbors by taking out their power for two days). Johnson's heard my concerns and were really good about laying down planks so that my neighbor's lawn wasn't torn up. They also used a blower to clean up all the leaves in the yard even though most of them were not from the tree they were taking down. All in all, I highly recommend Johnson Tree Service and will call them first if we ever need tree help.
