Horrible service. Paying for the max internet speed which consistently runs at lower speeds than advertised, or simply doesn't run at all. Every technician they send out did the job wrong according to the next tech... and service charges for them to come out and fix what they didn't do correctly in the first place. Customer service is always reluctant to do more than tell you to unplug every cable in your house and plug them back in. All in all 0 stars
