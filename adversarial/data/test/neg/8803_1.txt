This was the best dispensary we went to in town. It was spacious, clean, and had comfortable seating in the waiting area. The staff was exciting and fun to be around. They simply asked for our drivers license and we waited about 5 minutes before going to the back. We purchased several edibles and was shown several different product options. Everyone was super friendly and informative about the strands they displayed. We picked up free admission tickets to the LA comedy club. I would recommend this dispensary to anyone looking for fair prices and great product. Thank you Exhale for the fun and memorable experience .
