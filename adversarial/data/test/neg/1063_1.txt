Named after the man who gave Cleveland it's name, this nostalgic joint is like a throwback to a time when Jazz and Frank Sinatra ruled the airwaves, and when American values still meant something.  For those who have never had a phosphate, it is quite good and is the signature drink at Sweet Moses. In fact all the drinks here are very good, whether it's something with ice cream, or just a simple phosphate, you realty can't go wrong no matter what you get.  So go in, have a seat at the long bar, order a drink, and reflect upon an era that has long been swept away by the winds of time.
