For urgent care I keep my expectations low. Came here because it is very close to my job. Unfortunately, I was out of options and needed to be seen right after work. I was able to be seen quickly, I only waited about 15 minutes. Great!  The medical assistant\/nurse who took my blood pressure was nice but the doctor who was attending and the front desk staff was not welcoming at all. I've worked in urgent care before, you must realize that patients don't WANT to be there for fun. I got the impression that they really could care less about the patient and more about just getting a job done. The doctor didn't introduce himself and barely greeted me when he came in the room. That made me a bit uncomfortable. The nurse who gave me my prescription just handed it to me with no explanation. Fortunately, I was familiar with it, but what about patients who have no prior knowledge? They need to put the CARE back in healthcare.
