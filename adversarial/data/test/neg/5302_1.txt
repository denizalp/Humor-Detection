Love the wine list. They have three AZ wines available and use local meats and produce. This is my second time and so far the food has been okay. If not for the romantic wine bar atemosphere, I dont think I'd come back. Dont get the ceviche and the bruchetta is pretty lack-luster compared to everyone's favorite- Postinos and The Living Room. I am excited to go back and prove this rating wrong, since its right in my hood.
