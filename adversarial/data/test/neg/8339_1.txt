This location was a surprise! First of all, it is in the weirdest plaza which you would not expect a Swiss Chalet to be in. My friend wanted to go here because they have a play area for the kids. I had no idea SC did that sort of thing?\n\nOkay so they play area is not fancy but the kids and other children in the restaurant seemed to approve of it. I liked that there was a little seating area near the play area that they put all the louder families like us. The restaurant is way bigger than it looks so other, kid free diners would have been able to eat without hearing from kids. Awesome.\n\nService was quick, efficient and friendly. They had a little trouble if we asked something of them that broke them from their routine but it wasn't a deal breaker. Food was as expected....I mean it is Swiss Chalet. It was very hot and fresh too!\n\nThe best part was that while it was busy, we had no trouble getting a table. Very important when you have little ones in tow!
