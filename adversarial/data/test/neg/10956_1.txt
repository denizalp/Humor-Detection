It was a sad day to me when I learned of Dennis passing. I knew him and his brother years before they started their store in Phoenix. Tracks In Wax goes back a few decades and built up a loyal clientele over the years.\n\nWas in there about a year or so ago and the place had gotten in a sizable collection. Droppped a C note in fifteen minutes.  They have good employees who know music, album condition, and know how to make the customer feel  welcome.
