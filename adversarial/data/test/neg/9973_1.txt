Contacted Definitive Entertainment about installing speakers in the ceiling and ordering some main fronts. Gregory came out for a free estimate, professional, friendly, and pointed out some things I hadn't thought of. Got me the speakers at a much lower price than I could find them and the install went smooth as silk. They had to cut open the ceiling at multiple places to get the cables run, everything was done in less than 8 hours including the ceiling being patched and textured, and everything cleaned up. My wife didn't even notice anything different when she got home from work (which is a big deal). Couldn't have asked for better service, promptness, and professionalism. Will certainly use Definitive in the future!
