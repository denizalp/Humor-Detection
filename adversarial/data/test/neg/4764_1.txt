Went in to try frozen yogurt for the first time and at first I had no idea what to get. Aoife walked me through it and let me tell you.... This place has grade A frozen yogurt! The topping selection was mind blowing, I did not even know there was that many things that could be turned into a topping!!  I am always happy to help a family owned business!
