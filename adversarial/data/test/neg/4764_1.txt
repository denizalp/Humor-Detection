We tried Curry Bowl two weeks ago, as I was getting home late one evening, and I asked my wife if she would like for me to bring home Indian food from our new neighborhood restaurant, and she said \"yes\".  Very nice staff; however, the restaurant needs to improve the interior surroundings. I know that it's new but, you just don't get a great feeling when you walk in the door.  We ordered several items, and I must say that I was most impressed with the quality and flavor. We had the Lamb Curry, and Chicken Tika Masala, and Garlic Naan. Would love to have a little larger portion for the price that we paid; however, I will definitely come back for another try.  It's good to have great tasting Indian food so close to home.  They could definitely turn down that TV.
