My boyfriend and I went there as I was given a gift certificate for Christmas. I would have been downtown but both the Eaton Centre and Front street locations closed. So we decided to use the voucher ASAP before there's more closures. \n\nIt was both our first experience. We arrived at around 10pm, the dinning room was quite empty and we were seated promptly. \n\nOur waiter was nice and took time to explain the menu. We elected to share a plate of fried calamari and 2 prime rib steaks with a side of their ribs, as apparently they were famous for it. \n\nThe calamari was a very, very sad dish. The batter was soggy and the calamari was kind of soft, as if overcooked in too much oil. \n\nThe steaks were nothing to write home about. Cooking was done as requested (rare). The french fries were forgettable and the veggies also seemed like they were overcooked in oil. \n\nOur waiter only came once and both our glasses of water were never replenished.\n\nIt took them well over 15 minutes to process the gift cards. We were getting wary to leave by then. \n\nThe decor is somewhat dated and the equipment, furnishings and menus are not very well maintained. \n\nI am happy we had the gift card to pay for the dinner as I would have been more upset to spend my own money on this meal.
