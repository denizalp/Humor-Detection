I would have given it more stars but my second visit was really disappointing. The first time I went with my wife, we really liked the food, and one of the owners were really nice in serving and suggesting what to order, we even ordered food to go. But a week latter when we came back, there was this Caucasian guy that took our order to go and when I asked for the bill, he charged me extra for an extra dipping sauce, even fast food restaurant would never changed you for an extra sauce. I was so disappointed that I don't think I will ever go back
