All the food is great and everything is made with quality ingredients! Also best mimosas in the city hands down. Service is usually good too especially if you're lucky enough to get Wade as your server, he's so friendly and accommodating, I'm not sure if he's the manager or not but he should be! The only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because the food is kinda inconsistent, still good but inconsistent with ingredients and stuff. Maybe they have a lot of turn over in the kitchen or something...
