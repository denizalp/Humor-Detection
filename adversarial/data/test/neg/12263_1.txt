I've been a few different times now and every time the food has been great! Service has been a bit iffy (especially tonight after having Amanda as our server) but I will still come back just to sit at the bar. Why? Huge selection of liquor and a rotating selection of speciality beer as well as the best mules I've had at a bar. Most importantly though Dawn is hands down the most amazing bartender I've had anywhere and brings a life to the place that is otherwise nonexistent without her. All five stars go to her because if she wasn't there I would most likely not come back.
