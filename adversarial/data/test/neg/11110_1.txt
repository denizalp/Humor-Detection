OVERATED buffet!.  I saw the reviews, so I decided to check it out.. I was kind of dissapointed.  I felt there wasnt much of a variety of selections.  it seem most of the buffet consists of beef and crab legs.  I have to say I liked the chilean bass, vegetable chow mein.  kobe beef didnt taste good and the crab legs were salty.  I have to say this buffet has the best dessert though.  I find Rio buffet much better, especially in variety .
