From where I sit....4 employees behind the counter doing nothing. 2 different couples, a small family and me in here. Get my food, pulled pork cold and dry, no smoke flavor, just salt. The roll so cold it was actually frozen in the center. An employee brought out another one, dry and guess what? Ice cold again! \nGo to get my drink, they're out of what I want. \nGo to the \"condiments\" area, pickle and onion containers empty and the whole station filthy. \nI filled up my bbq sauce cups, return to my table only to realize they had the hot bbq sauce in the one marked sweet and vice versa. \nThe worst part about this experience? My meal was free because they screwed up my last order beyond belief. \nNEVER AGAIN. NEVER EVER AGAIN.
