Horrible experience.  I had the same experience as Hugh C.  Pods stated they need to pick up pod in 48 hours since it was delivered on street.  After 48 hours we called, and they stated it wouldn't be picked up for 3 weeks.  They want to charge us $100 to pick it up after one week.  So, they are picking up five days later and charging us $100.  A total scam.  My HOA is now calling because the pod has currently been in street for five days versus two.  The only positive thing is delivery guy did a great job.  Customer service is horrible.
