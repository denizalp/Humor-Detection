We always have a weird eating schedule on weekends, after brunch, you get hungry around 2-3pm, but it is also a time when many restaurants close for the afternoon in preparation of the dinner rush. There are a lot of Japanese restaurants in Baldwin area, and since it is a nice sunny day, many people are out in the patio. We decided to try Konnichiwa. They were open for another hour before they close for the afternoon.\n\nI got the chirashi don, it's the first time I had it since back from Japan. There was a wide variety of fresh sashimi. Of course, it is not as fresh from the ones in Japan but it is comparable. We also got the soba noodles with tempera and sushi set lunch special. It was pretty good, I like their soup base. The food was pretty good, it is not cheap but compared to other high name Japanese restaurant in downtown, it is reasonably priced.
