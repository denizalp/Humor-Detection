Stopped by tonight for the first time and walked into this little food court. Got the food to go after some great hosting by the owner. We spoke about her home cooking and everything from scratch approach. I got home and indulged into exploding flavours and perfect consistency. I'll be going back to try more! The soup was tasty and loved my veggies and rice!
