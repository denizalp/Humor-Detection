Friends of ours from the area took us here after a Cubs game and we had a very enjoyable experience. The ambience is very cool\/trendy and the patio looked awesome. Super comfortable, with good seats\/couches, heaters (which for Arizonians is a must), and acoustic musicians...I hear at night the bar can be somewhat of a pain because of overcrowdedness.\n\nFood was solid. For app: Prosciutto with an abnormally large portion of meat. Fried Calamari which had a good reception for those who ate it and an awesome salad.\n\nFor dinner: I ordered the short rib which was fantastic...however when I first looked at it...wasn't so sure. Not a big portion upon first glance but after devouring an extremely tender piece of meat (even sharing a few bites) I felt differently. The pureed corn was a nice touch and I was extremely satisfied once finished. The dessert looked just as good and was from what the rest of the table said.\n\nOnly downside: Waitress seemed preoccupied the entire meal and not really all that friendly. No recommendations, monotone, and looking over your shoulder as she explained the specials and taking your order...maybe she wasn't a Cubs fan....who knows.
