Extremely cool place with tons of potential. The biggest drawback is the beer prices. Way overpriced. I would go a lot more but is is hard to justify paying the high prices. I could understand it if they had more live music and 2-3 food trucks. A lot of times it is 1 food truck and no band. I hope they rethink this.
