I love the convenience of LA Fitness, so that's why I stay. \nThe staff I have encountered are nothing to write home about and the reason for the mid range stars. \nI do have to admit the 4am staff is great, but all my interaction with them is just a hello, check in and goodbye. I rarely had questions at 4am, but I also did not encounter any issues. \nThe staff at this location any time of day after 4am seem annoyed when you want to ask them anything, or even just check in. The other day I came in around 6pm and went to have one of the two people behind the counter check me in and immediately thought about leaving. Yeah I'm not a regular here, but I do deserve respect when I show up. The trainers do not appear to be approachable if you aren't a client and I don't see too much staff on the floor that you could even ask for assistance. \nI'm not a huge fan of this location, but I really liked the one they moved from. I am glad I can try out different locations with my membership, but this is the one closest to home, so it's a shame they lost so many of the Peoria location emenities.
