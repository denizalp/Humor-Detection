Came here on a Saturday night for dinner, place was packed, we were seated promptly.I sat there for a good 10 minutes before someone came over to see if I ordered tea.Had to flag down someone to place our order, we ordered the set dinner for 6, the 4 stars is for the food, we especially enjoyed the curry Crab, the place is short staffed, for a higher end restaurant it needs to have better service to match.
