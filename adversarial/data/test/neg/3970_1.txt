The food was OK but for the price I expected much much more. The snacks that they serve gratis before the meal were better than what either of us had for dinner. For 50 bucks a person that should not be the case. The food tasted like that one good Italian restaurant you enjoy any city USA (except 5 times the cost). We ordered a side of potatoes for 15 dollars and what we got looked like a serving of homestyle potatoes you get at say a Dennys. The service was impeccable but should be considering there is a captain who also expects to be tipped (FYI there is literally a line for the captains tip!). Don't know if that is a New York thing but I have never come across that and I've eaten at Michelin star restaurants. Save your money, way too many options on the strip to bother dining here.
