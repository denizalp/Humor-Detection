The service and food is amazing.  I came by myself - a mini vacation before Monday business - and was treated like I was a party of 10.  I ordered one of the special samba rolls - Maine lobster in crispy rice with asparagus, avocado and mango with a nice peanut dipping sauce.  I was pleasantly surprised that it came with a lobster claw with a good serving of lobster meat.  The sushi is also high quality.  I enjoyed one of my base test sushis of tuna and it was very fresh and flavorful.  Don't miss this great sushi spot at the Palazzo.
