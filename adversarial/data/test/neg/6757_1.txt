Magic acts in Vegas don't necessarily come and go like most shows.  Penn & Teller, Lance Burton, Steve Wyrick; these shows have been in the area for awhile.  So has Jeff McBride.  He has not been acting, however (at least not locally); he is the owner of a magician's school in Las Vegas and has been doing this for many years.  According to many magicians, he has been considered the most influential magician in the world because of his teachings.  \n\nYou would think if he can teach so well, he can put on a good act.  You'd be right.\n\nJeff is currently performing a limited engagement show at the Palace Station SoundTrax room every night of the week except for Tuesday.  This run ends on Thanksgiving.  The show is run at a decent hour (7:30 pm) which is great for bringing the kids without keeping them up too far past their bedtimes.  The magic that Jeff performs can be disturbing in parts as it explores dreams and nightmares, but many scenes are light and magical and can inspire a child's mind.\n\nThe cost is around $50 and is very reasonable considering other acts in town.  Locals get $10 off with a coupon found in Palace Station.  After the shows on Friday and Saturday, he has a night club open in the SoundTrax showroom called Wunderground.  Magic acts, psychic mind readers and other side show acts perform while music is played.  While I have yet to attend, it is supposed to be very entertaining and is free to go to with your ticket.
