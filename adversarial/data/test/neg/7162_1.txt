My husband and I ate here because there are literally no options in Terminal C at the airport. The food here is absolute garbage. I ordered the mozzarella appetizer which literally tasted like nothing.  I'm really curious as to how they achieved this. How can food taste like nothing? My husband got a bleu cheese burger and said essentially the same thing. There are no options so all I can say is good luck if you come here.
