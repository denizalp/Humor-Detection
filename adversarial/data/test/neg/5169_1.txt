Amazing place. Went their for a friends birthday. Service was sharp and quick. Food was excellent. Choices from menu were plenty. Wine lovers will enjoy the selection of wine they have. \nCertainly on the more expensive side, but worth it. Possible other downside may be lack of options in the dessert menu. But overall, had a great experience.
