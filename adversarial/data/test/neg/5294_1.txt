Had the Kamayan experience this past Sunday with a group of friends and I highly recommend it. Everything about the dinner experience was great. \n\nOur servers were always attentive, warm, and accommodating of our large group. \n\nThe food itself looked, and tasted, really good. As someone who grew up in the Philippines, it's exciting to be able to experience Filipino food reinvented in a way that honours their traditional flavours while putting a new twist on them. The kamayan aspect itself brings back memories and it's a great way to experience Filipino food how Filipinos have long enjoyed it.\n\nIt was one of the best meals I've had in a while, and I'm looking forward to coming back to have it again.
