I really want to like this place, have tried it 3 times hoping it would get better and it hasn't. Today was the same as usual the rude employee (loud, reddish hair) rushing me through, didn't even give me a chance to get sauces. Aren't the sauces their big gimmick? When I asked for some she looked annoyed. \nThe food has been ok the last couple of times. Nothing spectacular just ok. Today it was not good at all. The rice was beyond undercooked and everything was flavorless. I wish this place would get better but after three tries I'm figuring this is as good as it's going to get.
