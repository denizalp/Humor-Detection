I want to start by saying the food is great and they give you alot!! My husband ordered a pastrami burger. We had a sampler for appetizer.  I had a gyro. Our 2 kids had chicken fingers.  Well the wait was long. There was. A \"professional photographer \" that wanted to take a pic of us so we did and she told us she be right back. We sat there for a lonnng time. She never came. Then our waitress bring 3 out of 4 orders and tells me she is gonna be right back. She took 7 minutes ( she was cleaning tables and what not) to finally bring my husbands food. Then took forever to get our bill. Finally get the bill and she charged us for 2 adult chicken fingers. We didnt want adult. Lady at counter claims waitress was new. But good side was great food. I ordered gyro and it came with 2 with lots of fries.
