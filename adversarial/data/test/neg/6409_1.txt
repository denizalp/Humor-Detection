Worst service! After nearly 40 minutes waiting in line; we finally got to the ticket office and they said: 'we're sold out for that screen... we have a FEW spots for this one...' seriously? Is it too hard to change the sign at the entrance and let people know (before they try to get in) what's actually available?... we left and there was at least 50 more cars in line. also, control the entry line... there's cars getting in through the exit, sneaking out the line.
