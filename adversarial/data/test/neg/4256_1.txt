The vibe at this place is positive and low-key.  Floor plan is very open and felt welcoming. Once nice weather comes our way I am sure that Patio is going to be a fan fav!\n\nFish tacos (3) were great.  Each taco had enough pieces of tender fish grilled & seasoned to really hold up well to every bite.  Companions looked happy with their burger and a beef dip sandwich (no french fry left behind).  Very good service, good pacing and the wait staff seemed professional and positive.
