Dined here for lunch. Definitely a touristy place, but the cocktails are too unique not to review. I got the blow pop martini, rimmed with pop rocks and a tuna melt for my meal. Albeit pricey, they are one-of-a-kind. We enjoyed the casual dining atmosphere outside allowing us to people watch on a beautiful, sunny day.
