This place has such a welcoming and relaxed energy. I love it. The staff was awesome and extremely friendly. Susan and Robert were great! I opened up a Subscription Box on my first visit :). \n\nSelection seems okay ( I didn't get a chance to see it all), and it seems that you would love this shop if you're a Marvel or DC fan. \n\nGrooviness!
