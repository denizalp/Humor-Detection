Janelle at the VIP check in was amazing! Thank you so much for your help and with a smile!\nThe festival was amazing. If you are Vegan go if your curious go there is no loss. \nMaggi Vegan Jerkee is to die for try the hickory orange! I loved the yoga and shirt Vendors. I would recommend parking in the lot off Culver early get there early or you wont find parking. The first thing to do is get food the lines get long quick especially at Southern Fried Vegan!
