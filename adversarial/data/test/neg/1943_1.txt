I've really expected this place to be bad, but it was actually great. \n\nI wasn't feeling too well, so I was being very careful with my food - the place passed the tender stomach test, with flying colours - my salmon was excellent, with no after effects. \n\nMy kids loved the volcano ice cream - definitely a nice touch. \n\nMay repeat.
