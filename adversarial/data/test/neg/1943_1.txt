I flew from Las Vegas to Wichita. The flight to Wichita was half full, so the extra money I paid for priority boarding was unnecessary, however the Wichita to Las Vegas flight was full, so I felt the money spent for priority boarding was well spent. You pay for everything, soda was $2 and mixed drinks were $7 and snacks were available but pricey. Both legs of the flight were 30 minutes ahead of schedule. I will certainly use this airline again.
