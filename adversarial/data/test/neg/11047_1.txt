Not very good. Tried a couple different sample plates, rolls and sashimi and wasn't impressed. Purple rice was a nice esthetic and interesting but fish was just bland.\n\nPros: Food came out fast even though it was very busy. Convenient location if you're downtown.\n\nCons: Food was bland, nothing special. It's not a traditional sit down restaurant where you have a server, it's self serve after you stand in a long line. Tiny and cramped dining area (lots of people standing room only). Really small and crummy old bathroom.\n\nWe came here based on the great reviews but I think I went to a different restaurant, haha.\n\nProbably won't try again.
