Excellent sushi. I got the harumi roll and loved it. The sex and the city roll was pretty good too but not as good as the harumi roll. I took off one star for the service. Our waiter was excellent, but the hostess was not. Initially my boyfriend and I were seated at a booth. We were asked to move because a group of four was coming in. I said it wasn't a problem, but then a few minutes later the hostess sits another couple at the booth we had just been sitting at. Apparently the larger group wouldn't fit in a booth. I think it's a little rude we weren't offered our seats back. We were instead at a much smaller and cramped table. My waiter even seemed a little confused about why we weren't moved back. I get that being a hostess can be a busy job, but I felt she could have done a better job.
