A little leary at the beginning due to being much cheaper than 2 other places, but was assured by a friend this was a good place. Dropped it off and said I needed it by a certain day and got it back a day earlier. A little confusion on when I was dropping it off, but not a big deal. \nMy car just needed a little touch up from some scraps until I hit a pallet that was on the highway 2 weeks ago. Anyway, car looks great!!! Paint matches, little nicks gone from my hood and the front looks brand new!!\nMaryLou took care of me and made sure it got done before I needed it.\nEven came out lower than the estimate!!
