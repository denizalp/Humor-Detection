Peppermill is OK, that's about it.  Really expensive for what you get, I think.  There are better places to eat, but I confess...breakfast isn't a staple meal in LV.  Coffee shops in the casinos are the same price, even less...  It does glimmer in that old-world tacky sorta 70's Vegas flare, as contrived as it is, with lots of neon and psychadelic colors.  Sorta fun to see, once.  I miss the old coffee shop in the Mirage.  They closed it in 08, I think.  We tried the TI coffee shop, NOT the same thing.  Planning to try the new one in Aria, next week.  Maybe it can measure up the the Mirage.
