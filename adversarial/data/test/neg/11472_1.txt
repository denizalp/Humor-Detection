Prior to seeing a show at Planet Hollywood, my husband and I decided to grab a quick bite. With NFR in town, we knew finding a quieter place would lead us to the quickest service in the casino. Cafe Hollywood delivered both on quickly, friendly service and good food. I was pleasantly surprised with our choice to eat here. \n\nCafe Hollywood is located close to the escalators up to the Mezz level on the casino floor, tucked between a Starbucks and a bar. We were greeted by the hostess who was able to seat us immediately. She offered our choice of table or booth in a number of locations, which was lovely. We opted for a corner booth tucked in the back which gave us a big separation between the hustle and bustle of the casino. This was much appreciated. The walls were decorated with pictures of celebrities and they had TVs mounted on the wall. There is even a dessert bar in the center and an actual bar in the back left corner of the restaurant (full service of course). \n\nOur server arrived promptly to our table and took our drink orders. We received both our waters and beer\/wine in a timely fashion. From there, the server continued to be very attentive, bringing out plenty of condiments before our meal arrived. In grand total, I think we waited 10 minutes for our food to make it to the table after ordering. The restaurant was pretty slow, so I appreciated that they still served us quickly! I enjoyed the Buffalo Chicken sandwich, which was quite good. It was paired with fries that really stole the show (the batter was perfect, without being too greasy). The whole time they even played a great mix of current music and fun throw backs. Overall this is a great little quick bite place to have a nice dinner prior to catching a show.
