My experience with wellish vision institute was great. Their staff is amazing. Taylor is a true asset to the team and delivers great customer service. my initial consultation for LASIK was easier than most eye check ups given I hate anything near my eyes. I felt confident with Dr. wellish, he is one of the best eye Dr's in town. Every time I mentioned his name everyone is familiar with him and has nothing out positive things to say. He is not the cheapest but I wouldn't go anywhere for a lesser price - we only have one set of eyes
