My five stars goes to our Awesome Waiter\/Server CARLOS S ...... And yes we remembered his name because people like him, you never forget!! Made our first experience one to remember. He was very attentive! The restaurant has a wide selection of meats and salad bar with other sides (rice, mushrooms, potatoes) When coming here make sure to pace yourself in order to be able to appreciate all the food the restaurant has to offer.
