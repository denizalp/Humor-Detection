Love. Love. Love this place.\n\nGood prices all day long, but stick around long enough and there will be some random even greater special price of the day.  Love that even on the special prices for cocktails you still get a fairly decent pour.  The patio is great at night for watching all the crazy drivers on Camelback.  Service is always pretty good, and the managers are always roaming about helping aid in good service.  They have pool tables and tons of TVs.  I've only had one thing here that I didn't like, and that was just a personal preference thing (their nachos are with the cheese sauce instead of shredded cheese) The 1\/2 price munchie menu for late night is awesome.  I have a love affair with their Hummus....soooo good!!\n\nDefinitely a place to check out for sure!
