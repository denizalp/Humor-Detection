Ordered catering for my office from Firehouse Subs with disappointing results. The online ordering went fine but everything after that was a mess. They cancelled my $300 order by mistake and then lost my credit card information, luckily when I called back they hadn't deleted my entire order. Then on the day of pickup it was obvious they had not prepared any of the food and rushed to give us something. The order was 45 min late, the sandwiches were not wrapped individually so you couldn't tell what type of meat was on each sub, and the salads ordered were either wrong or did not have all the ingredients listed. I order food for our office regularly and I have never experienced such disorganization as I did with Firehouse Subs. For this much hassle I don't know why anyone would use them for catering.
