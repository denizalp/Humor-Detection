Diego Pops is a cute little spot in a old Town Scottsdale. If you go, I highly recommend their pink sauce- whatever it is :) Brussels sprout nachos and prickly pear margaritas are some other good choices! Would be great if management provided placemats and\/or menus that don't look like placemats as it is awkward and confusing when the waiter\/waitresses removes them after we order. All in all great place though!
