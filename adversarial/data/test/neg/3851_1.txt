Tiny takeout, very tidy, spartan place.  The sushi chef, who I think is also the owner, was super friendly, and helped me to decide on a sushi tray, having never been there before.  Fantastic selection of combos and rolls, very decent prices.  The quality and presentation was outstanding.  No complaints whatsoever, I am definitely a return customer!
