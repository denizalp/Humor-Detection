5 stars for the beer and Belgian frites. \n\n2 stars for the service and attitude. Results in a 3.5 star but I'll round t up to 4 because Rodenbach is my favourite beer.\n\n\nThe bar area is incredibly overcrowded and God forbid you come on Saturday night - you'll be sitting close enough to someone that you can see their pores. For whatever reason they only allow you to sit in the dining area if you say you are going to eat food - I had to lie and weasel my way into the dining room because there were no seats at the bar area (\"you can sit anywhere in the lounge area, and dinner area is ONLY if you purchase food\") - so you'd rather have me not stay at your establishment at all than have me come into the dining area and have drinks and an appetizer? \n\nNow the service. For some strange reason, whenever I am there I get the same middle-aged man as the server who seems like he hate anything that moves. The first time we had him, when he learnt we are only there for drinks, the beer and the water glasses were THROWN onto the table to the point I was worried he'd break something. Second time I was there with another friend, even my friend said \"He seems to hate us for no reason\". Third time I was there with a group of friends for a late night drink (at midnight). The dining area was dead but the bar was still pretty busy. Again they almost forced us to sit at the bar area but hopefully realized that it's ridiculous and we could be allowed to sit in the dining area (the peasants that we are). No surprise, the same waiter with his flat jokes and sarcasm offering us tequila because what else would six professional women drink? And then it began again, beer throwing and endless side eyes. \n\nI've been to this place at least 10 times and will keep coming back for beer and trying to avoid the nasty waiter man who will not get more than 10% tip.
