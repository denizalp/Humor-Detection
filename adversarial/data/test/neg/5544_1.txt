Just ate there on a Saturday night.\nCame it at 8pm and the place was empty.\nService was solid but our waiter was egregiously unrefined...butchering his description of the dishes and almost talking us out of several of them.  Food was good...started with octopus then had the two fish specials.  On food, I could give it 5 stars...but the service, decor, ambiance, even the menus felt cheap and unrefined....not nearly up to standard for a restaurant like this.
