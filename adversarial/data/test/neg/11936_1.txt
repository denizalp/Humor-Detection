Just perfect. I love the selection of meat - black Angus, grass-fed organic, chicken, and vegan. Also the customizability of the burger options leaves a lot of room to mix things up. I had the grass fed beef and it was excellent. The jalepeno burger has a perfectly fried jalepeno and worked really well. Decent craft beer selection too. The cherry on top is that this place is dog friendly. Check it out!
