I think they're friendly, like others have mentioned, but I have to disagree with all of the mentions here of fair prices. I been in three times and *never* seen a game priced better than in other shops in the valley. You want an old sports game, Madden '08, for PS2-- and it's scratched and the disc only? $12. That's the price at which her \"system\" says it should be priced, she explained. She let me know later that she made a mistake and it's actually only a whopping and unfair $10! \n\nI guess Game Zone has a good selection, but better prices are to be found everywhere else. There are a number of other stores in Chandler and Tempe which are cheaper (Zia, Fallout, Flashback). They might feel a lot less like a mom-and-pop shop, but at least they are consistent and fair with their prices.
