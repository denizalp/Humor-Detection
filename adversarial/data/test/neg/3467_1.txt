I've been to a paint night before, but the experience was nothing like what I experienced with Kate at Paint Party Night.  She and her staff were extremely helpful and hilarious.  They truly know how to bring in the party to the paint night.  \n\nThe best part is she goes at a pace that allows you to keep up, but does not allow you to over analyze what you're doing so that you keep changing what's already decent to something hideous.\n\nIt's a great vibe, fun experience and an entertaining place!  The time flew and before I knew it, my painting was done.  I will definitely be frequenting this place!
