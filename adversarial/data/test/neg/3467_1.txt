Love this Starbucks location. Located in one of the best plazas in Arcadia. All of my experiences with the staff here has been pleasant. Spacious and tons of available outlets for labtops. Super efficient and fast. Only downside is that the parking situation gets dicey around lunch or dinner time, but is to be expected since there are a number of popular restaurants located in the same plaza. The restrooms are for the most part very clean as well.
