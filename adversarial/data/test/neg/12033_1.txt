Should be 4 stars, but the prices are a bit on the high side.  Went there for lunch on a Friday afternoon.  Very good burger joint, great flavor, not greasy at all.  Their \"ketchup\" was fantastic as was their poutine (especially the beef stock reduction).  This place is definitely worth a periodic indulgence, but not a place I would regularly dine at.
