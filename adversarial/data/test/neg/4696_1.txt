John the manager is very friendly and helpful. I'm out of state called on the phone explained my daughter's situation with her car. He had 4 new tires put on at a very fair price in about an hour. A week later she ran over metal that was in the road and popped one of her tires. They towed it in last night and he had it repaired first thing in the morning.
