A beer garden in a supermarket? What a great idea!\n\nIt is not too loud, dark or divey in anyway. Their beer selection is vast and often has some rare options. They even sell growlers with coozies.\n\nIf you want food there is a rotating menu, and all of the ready to eat food in Whole Food can be purchased and brought in to eat. \n\nNext time you want a quality beer or just to get some groceries with quality beer gogles give this place a try.
