We ate here twice during our stay in Phoenix. I very rarely have pizza...basically like never. This is because of my preference for plant based foods and not many places create a suitable pizza, and those that do use Daiya, which I find disgusting! Well, Pizza Heaven uses Vegan Gourmet. On pizza I don't even know if omnivores could tell the difference!\n\nMy son ordered a pepperoni pizza off of the \"regular\" menu said it was good too. Our 2nd time there we shared a vegan pineapple pizza (light on the \"cheese\") and we both enjoyed it, just wish there was even more pineapple on it.\n\nPizza Heaven has a separate Vegan menu offering which earns tons of bonus points in my book!\n\nThe staff is super friendly and the restaurant is clean!
