When you're hungry and it's 1am, this is a quick spot to get some Mexican food. However, because I am gluten free and pescatarian I left very unsatisfied with the food itself. The customer service was on plaint and she knew exactly what to suggest when I mentioned I don't eat meat or gluten. The cashier suggested that I make breakfast tacos with scrambled eggs, beans and cheese. She mentioned that she wouldn't be able to make them but she could give me the ingredients to do so. The eggs came out cold and the corn tortillas were thick and steamed which didn't make a good taco. All in all, cold and bland with a soggy tortilla was a disappointment. They were also cleaning out the Horchaga at the time so that was a bummer as well, but I can't fault them for that.
