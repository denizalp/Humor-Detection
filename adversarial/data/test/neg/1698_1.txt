My fav seafood buffet on this side of town. We went Sunday for dinner and it was $18.99 all day. Might be pricey to some but for the amount of seafood and good quality seafood, I wouldn't mind paying it. Everything tasted good. I would go back just for the sashimi alone. \nAs part of the grand opening they gave each table some lobster. It was super tasty and hope they have it as something you can order in the future. Lord only knows if they have it on the buffet, one person would just take it all. \nService was great and for a buffet, that says a lot. The hostess was super nice and our waitress was very attentive. \nI hope it doesn't become like all the other buffets. All great in the beginning, then cut costs and quality goes down. Hope to be back before that happens.
