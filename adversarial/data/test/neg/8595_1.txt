Love this place. Especially the basil spicy noodle, yellow curry chicken, and beef pad siew. \n\nIf you get there mango sticky rice make sure to ask for the plain white rice; otherwise they have started using a strange artificial banana flavour multicoloured rice which we don't like (think: Popeyes candy cigarettes). \n\nThe people are friendly and their delivery and takeout is fantastic.
