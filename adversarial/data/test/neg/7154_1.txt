I LOVE this place! The food is delicious and the service is super friendly. \n\nDuring my most recent visit, I took my sister in for her birthday. It was her first time having Ethiopian. The people who work here we so friendly. They seemed just as excited as my sister, explaining the dishes and cooking styles; they seemed to really take pride in what they were doing. \n\nAnd they SHOULD take pride, because did I mention that the food is delicious!? The vegetarian feast is my favorite. I've also tried the zelzel wat (I think that's what it's called -- it's the beef) and homemade cottage cheese. All of it very yummy. \n\nThe vibe is very cozy, almost like going to a friend's for lunch. I can imagine parking being a hassle if they had a rush of customers but I've never had a problem. That said, delivery from here is just as tasty as dine-in so don't let a little laziness get in the way of enjoying a good meal -- go ahead and have someone deliver it to you ;)\n\nI hope this place does well. Seems like some really great people running it and I so love Ethiopian food! Definitely check it out, whether you are a long time fan of Ethiopian or a first timer, you will be glad you did!
