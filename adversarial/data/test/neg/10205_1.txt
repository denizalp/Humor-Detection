Awesome Thai restaurant! I drive past this plaza every day, and it was great to see a Thai restaurant pop up. The restaurant is family-run, is very clean and has a nice look, and best of all, serves great food!\n\nI got the Eastern Thai Salad and the Spicy Noodles with chicken, both of which were packed with flavor and a nice amount of heat. I could tell everything was fresh, and my food was made in a very timely manner. \n\nFor me, one of the most satisfying feelings is being full from fresh, wholesome food. This certainly took the cake. I will be back!
