The staff is really helpful, but you better talk to them in French! Like everyone else in Canada, they take it kind of easy ans slowly. The pharmacist can give you advice and if it's a minor health question you don't need to spend time going to the hospital, which is great. I would give them 5 stars if they were little faster though.
