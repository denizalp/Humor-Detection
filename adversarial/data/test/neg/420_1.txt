Wow get your rotisserie on here! This spot is very popular so order to go or come off hours as there's only 5-6 tables.  Be sure to order as much as you can to avoid wishing you had more. I got a 1\/2 spicy chicken combo covered in fries and small side salad for about $9.\nWhatever that sauce is I've got to get my hands on it! It's spicy sweet barbecuey sauce that got me feenin.
