I absolutely LOVE this sushi place! I'm visitng my family in Arizona and being a huge sushi fanatic, they brought me to Masa and I am NOT disappointed! The sashimi was fresh and the pieces were SO full and large.  Some sushi places only put a small sliver on their sushi pieces, but Masa put very, VERY generous pieces in and on all their sushi pieces.  Definitely recommend this place- love it! \n\nPS. Sorry if this review is a little too happy and ridden with grammatical mistakes.  I just love Masa too much.
