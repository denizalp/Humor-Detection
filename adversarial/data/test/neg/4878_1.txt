I decided to revisit this restaurant again this year. Unfortunately it's nothing like it used to be! Menu is much \nleaner with selections. There is little if any southwest flair.\nWe were sat in booth with little light and crack in the seat \nMoved to another table waited for service and assistance \nENDED UP LEAVING!
