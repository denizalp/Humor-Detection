I could write a novel on why I think this place is horrible but to spare you the thousands of details they A. Pass you around from person to person B. Make you do half their work for them by not following up with third parties like hospitals and doctors when questions arise forcing you to do it yourself C. Do not return your emails or voicdmails. Using this attorney turned me into the biggest bitch I've ever had to be just to get things done. I wish I had done more research before signing on with this office. Please do not leave me a response either Mr. Cordova, it's not necessary.
