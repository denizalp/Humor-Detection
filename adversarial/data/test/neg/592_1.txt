Called at 12pm to reserve a space for a large group, was told the manager was too busy to talk to me and she would call me back. 3:45pm, no call! I called back to inquire about a reservation again, was told that the manager was busy and couldn't talk to me. \n\nWhat type of business doesn't like to make money, should never be too busy to speak with a potential customer, this is so unprofessional. \n\nOh well, I'm sure some other business would\nLove to have our $$.
