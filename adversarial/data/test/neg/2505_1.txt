This location is ALOT better than other locations I've tried very friendly and speedy service. Though I haven't tried a burrito here yet I love the fact that one of their options is called big ass burrito that takes cahones with all this pc crap these days. Also love the fact that they have tacos which is what I always get from here since I don't want Taco Bell eww and always wondered why burrito boys doesn't have tacos(which is my usual burrito place) I love the taco options I can get hard shell soft shell chicken, steak, fish, or an assortment whatever I want. I have a location right by me Kennedy and steeles, but it's just not the same seems like a downgraded version. I don't know maybe it's the people or the friendly attitude but this location just feels more welcoming so I don't mind making the drive. A warning though if you do get hard shell tacos don't wait more than ten or fifteen minutes to eat it as the middle of the shell starts to get soggy and fall apart. For a fast food place this location is definitely a win which is more than what I can say for other locations of this franchise.
