The west coast's prized gem burger place.\n\nHow does it live up to 5 Guys and Shake Shack on the East coast though?\n\nwell, it was just OK.\n\n5 Guys is still the best, and I'd give Shake Shack the edge over In-N-Out (and thats coming from somebody who doesn't really like Shake Shack)\n\nMaybe it was just this location, but overall In-N-Out seemed like hype  that didn't really deliver
