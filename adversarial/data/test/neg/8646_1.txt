This place was conveniently located right near our gate at the airport.  This is a bacardi-themed restaurant that serves up some quick takes on Cuban cuisine.  Since I had to run, I ordered a Cuban sandwich and a bloody mary.  They offered a double shot for just $3 more so I took them up on their offer.  The food took a little while to come out and was ok.  I think they nuked the sandwich though because by the time I got to the end, the bread was hard as a rock.  Not bad, overall.
