Worst delivery people in the business.  When an exchange of words was exchanged, the lead man and driver said F**k You to my wife and i and then drove off,  NOT taking the old box spring with them; this after spending almost $2K on a mattress and box sspring.  DON'T DO BUSINESS WITH THESE PEOPLE!  THEY ARE CRUDE, IGNORANT, AND DO NOT STAND BEHIND THE LIES THEY TELL YOU JUST TO MAKE A SALE.   WARNING.....
