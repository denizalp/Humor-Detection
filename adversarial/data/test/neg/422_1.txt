I paid for my bottle of apple juice through the app and waited under the mobile pickup sign for a good few minutes while being ignored by staff as they just paid attention to the people in line. I asked to make sure I was at the right place and they knew I was there for a mobile pickup. A few more minutes pass and by now if I had waited in line like everyone else I would've got my juice and left. Since no one wanted to talk to me unless I was in queue I went to the back of the line and told the staff my situation when it was my turn. Then he gave me my juice. \nIf Tim Hortons doesn't want us to use the app don't advertise \"Download the App\" all over the store! Complete waste of my time!
