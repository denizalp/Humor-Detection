Every Kabuki I've been to is the same. Just mediocre meals. Came here the other day and it was pretty busy so I was expecting a wait and shitty service like the ones in SoCal. But instead, the hostess (Giana?? I think that was her name) kept us pretty entertained and gave pretty good hospitality while we waited. So we got our table and I figured, its gonna be a wait might as well  knock a brew. Food is alright, (Chefs, I understand its busy, I'm not trippin) & Service was stellar.
