Best date night in a long time! I absolutely love all the computer escape games and have been wanting to try the \"real thing\" out for a while now. My husband and I were alone in the room (with the game master). We were initially signed up for the Library, but ended up changing our minds at the last minute to the Gameroom. That was easily the shortest hour of my life! We got pretty far for only two people, but honestly I don't know if we would've escaped even if we had 2 hours. It will definitely get your brain juices flowing. There was no one coming in the room after us so our guide gave us some extra time and walked us through the parts we didn't solve. We talked about it all the way home and cannot wait to go back and *hopefully escape the Library! I would recommend this for everyone. It was very challenging, and was nice to be entertained by using our minds and working together.
