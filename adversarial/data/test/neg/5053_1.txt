Wasn't a huge fan of the food or specialty drinks. The vibe was cool and the bartender was great, very nice and friendly. I got the Whiskeyberry Sour and it was pretty good. My girlfriend got the White Rabbit and it was too much. It was thick and was kind of overwhelming. The kind of drink where you have one or two sips and you're good. The Super Greeky Pizza was fine, nothing special and the Warm Artichoke Jalapeno Dip was odd. We couldn't decide if you we liked it or not, but we kept eating it so take that as you will lol. All in all nice vibe and great service.
