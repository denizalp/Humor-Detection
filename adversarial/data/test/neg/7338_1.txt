Food was pretty good!    I got the chili relleno and cheese enchilada combo.    Prices were good.     I didn't love the chili as it wasn't soft and fully cooked.    It was a bit tough.    But flavor was good.     Loved the beans and rice.    \n\nDaughter had a breakfast burrito and liked it.   \n\nOnly bummer was that they didn't have fresh brewed ice tea, only sodas.   \n\nOverall it was tasty and I'll probably go back and try something different.
