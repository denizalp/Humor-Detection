The better choice on Open Table when deciding at 4 PM for New Years Eve dinner.\nWe were seated at a table in the window which was quiet. Service was impeccable - an huge improvement and the food was amazing.  We had wonderful fresh oysters, 2 start specials, lobster risotto and black cod.  All flavourful and fresh.  Dessert was a true European pastry with rhubarb and greek yogurt.  A huge improvement on our experience 9 months ago.
