If you are from out of town and are looking for a place to catch up with your cities sports teams, this is a good place to check out.  Expect the typical bar fare, brats, wings, fries etc...   They have a good amount of flat screen tvs so you can see the action from any vantage point. It is also relatively inexpensive.
