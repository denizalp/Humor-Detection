Yesterday was our first \"office visit\" here and it was really good! The people behind the counter (I'm assuming are the owners) are extremely helpful and are really nice! \n\nI had the Steak Wrap that was with Roasted Peppers, Onions in a Spinach Wrap- Very good and light it was served with a side salad I had a Red Vinaigrette with it. \n\nThis is really close to our office so I anticipate going here more in the future! I look forward to trying more of they're menu
