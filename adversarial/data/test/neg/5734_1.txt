We've been coming to Juan's for years and LOVE THIS PLACE.  People are talking about water stains in the bathroom and food not having enough salt. Smh do you go there for the bathrooms or the food? If you need more salt im pretty sure theybhave salt shakers on the table. Stop looking for a comp meal. We wont stop going there. I think we'll go today for dinner.
