I am only giving it one extra star since the manager gave us a freebie. However, the free item was horrible. \nWe arrived and patiently stood while we watched 5 people, who all arrived after us, get seated before us. Why? They were older, looked hungrier, or had better clothing. I don't really know. We seemed to be see through as nobody acknowledged our existence for a while. \"Have you been taken care of?\" Um- no.\nSo our freebie was the 4 cheese grease trough spinach artichoke dip served with 10 corn tortilla chips. The dip was greasy. I know, it's cheese, but the grease was encircling the serving bowl. Microwaved maybe? Whatever happened to it, it was rather gross. The 10 chips served with it? We didn't even finish them. But really, a few more for theatrics would have been nice.\nFood was good looking, but taste was bland and dry. I had the roasted turkey 1\/2 sandwich. You really should not have to drown your food in mayo to be able to swallow it.\nFrench onion soup was tasty.\nService. Hmm. I will try to be nice. The waitress seemed to be bothered by us. I almost thought she gave me a dirty look when she had to refill my drink, but that must have been my mistake? when she brought the bill, I think she threw it at me as she recited the \"have a nice day and I will be your cashier when.....\" I don't know what the rest was as she was saying it while back turned to us and walking away.\n\nMy suggestion is to go next door to Ajo Al's.
