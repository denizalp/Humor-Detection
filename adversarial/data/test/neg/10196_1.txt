I visited this juice bar in October, about a month before their official hard-opening. However, I had a very good experience, and their juices tasted great! So, there is my review:\n\nAs I walked along Copeland Street on my way towards Starbucks, I noticed a new business across from it. Situated between Eden and Le Mardi Gras, and above Girasole Restaurant, is Salud Juicery, which I effortlessly deduced is a juice bar.\n\nI walked up the stairs and through the doors. I immediately noticed the unique decor. There were wallpapers that were vibrantly green; tendrils of (fake?) branches that stretched from the floor to the ceiling; and furniture (including the tablet holder at the register) that looked to have been made with pure, natural wood. All of these accentuated the fresh, all-natural, health-oriented motif that the juice bar was going for.\n\nAs soon as I walked up to the counter, Ginny, the owner, greeted me. After a quick introduction of her business, she offered samples of several juices. I gladly accept, and she whips up at least four different juices in no time. Here are the ones I tried:\n\n- Redhead Irish (organic spinach, kale, apple, lemon, cucumber, ginger): The taste of ginger is pronounced, but the sweetness of the apple and hint of sourness of the lemon toned it down. I liked this juice, and I felt it would be a nice drink to have if I am sick.\n\n- Jane Good'All (orange, strawberry, peach, banana, coconut water): This was a sweet juice, but not overwhelming sweet. I could taste each fruit that was used to make it. I know some people may have qualms about coconut water, but I don't, so I enjoyed the hint of coconut in this juice.\n\n- The Beet Goes On (beet, carrot, apple, ginger, lemon): A juice with a dark red color, I could taste all of its. The beet, carrot, and apple add sweetness while the ginger and lemon add a touch of spice and complexity. I feel it could have used a bit more apple; nevertheless, I really liked this juice and was my favorite out of the three.\n\nBecause I really liked the The Beet Goes On, I ordered the small size of it. In about a minute or two, it was ready. I paid, gave a nice tip, and sat down at one of the wood tables in the rear seating area. This seating area had a few small tables and two sofas. It was very cozy and secluded enough to offer a nice respite from all the shopping and yoga, and also a nice quiet place to read a book or study.\n\nAfter finishing my juice, I complimented Ginny and another employee, who was probably doing work in the back during my sampling, on the flavor of the juice. I told them I would definitely come back (and I meant it!).\n\nI don't think I will do a full juice cleanse, but if I'm ever in the mood to drink something refreshing and I've reached (or exceeded) my caffeine intake for the day, I will stop by for a juice, a smoothie, or a shot of wheatgrass (a.k.a. Healthy Espresso...??).
