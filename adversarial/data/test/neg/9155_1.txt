After visiting Sam's Town, I made a short detour down Desert Inn Road in order to pick up a pair of blueberry cake donuts at this modest bakery.  As I waited for the owner to bag my donuts, I noticed the photos posted on all the walls and realized I had once read a story about the owner who has been nicknamed the Cambodian Rambo.  The donuts were indeed cake like and there was a desirable undertone of blueberry flavoring.
