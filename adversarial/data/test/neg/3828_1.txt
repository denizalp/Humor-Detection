Plain and simple, Ray Barron kicks ass!! I've always had a hard time trusting hair stylists, but I trust Ray completely. He's a genius with hair, has a great eye for what looks good and the skill to pull it off beautifully, and he's super easy going and fun to talk to. I don't write a lot of reviews, but this man easily deserves a 5 star rating!!! I'd happily recommend him to anyone and everyone! :-)
