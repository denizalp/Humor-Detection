This meal was delicious. I have to say. I went with St. Louis ribs and coconut shrimp. My bf ordered St Louis Ribs with chicken. Baby back ribs were $20. .. um no. Going bk to this place was a big deal b\/c my bf & I had a huge almost dealbreaking fight @ Tony Roma's in Albuquerque, years ago. So we stayed away due to trama. LOL. So glad we rose above and rib-loving conquered all. This place was great. I had veggies - delish! and cornbread casserole OMG! so good. it was so good it could be counted as desert. The shrimp came with some kind of orange marmalade to dip it in - with real orange zest tasted so fresh. I loved it. I'd definitely go back. I was wearing the LBD and coudnt eat very much but I did enjoy a great glass of riesling with dinner, it was a great night. Cant wait to go back.
