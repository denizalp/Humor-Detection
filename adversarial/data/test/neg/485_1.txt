Sat in and was ignored in the \"drive through\" for 15+ minutes before someone pulled up in the 3rd (labeled exit) lane and was immediately helped.\n\nBeyond poor customer service and attention only made worse by the lack of organization and order kiosk in the drive through. \n\nStanding and taking orders works great if you implement a system like in and out has, not so much if you lack any order and drive up windows for your \"drive though\". \n\nWon't be back and won't be recommending.
