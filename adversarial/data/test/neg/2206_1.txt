Sabrina came out to New RIver to fine tune my rooftop antenna. She was very professional and helpful, and managed to find some more stations with an amplifier to augment my antenna setup. I couldn't be happier with my free tv signal now - no more satellite bills! I highly recommend Mr Antenna and Sabrina!
