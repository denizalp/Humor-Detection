I appreciate what they're trying to do here. They went all-in on the retro drive-in look and unique variations on the dog-and-burger menu. \n\nI've tried three different dogs and one burger; fries and rings. The meat and fixings are fine -- not spectacular, but OK. On my most recent visit, the poppy seed bun for the Chicago dog was distinctly stale. (I've run into a similar problem at some other places, where they don't sell many Chicago dogs so the special poppy seed buns sit around for far too long.)\n\nI'll echo what at least one other commenter said: The sodas are bizarrely small portions. They boast about their own root beer. In house, it comes in what looks like a nice-sized chilled glass mug, but turns out to be largely ice. I got a to-go version one, and it was a tiny cup, again with the ice -- and filled to the brim so that spilling was inevitable.
