We were there at 5PM and restaurant was getting full.  For good reason, as there nothing bad to say about this place.  \n\nRamen is extremely reasonably priced around $7 or $8, portions are not enormous but filling.  Low use of msg, as I'm not thirsty at all after the meal.  Noodles are cooked perfectly.\n\nThe star is the black sesame ramen, very rich flavor, one of the best ones I've tasted.\n\nThis small restaurant can be easily missed on Spring Mountain Road.  Best thing to do is use the GPS for first timers.\n\nHighly recommended!
