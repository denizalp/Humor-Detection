Finally, I found a real Chinese noodle joint in Calgary. I was SO happy that I did, as my default comfort food is Chinese noodles (generally Singapore-style rice noodle), and Calgary has been bereft of genuine noodle houses in my time here.\n\nAs others have mentioned, noodle houses are to be viewed as fast food, at fast food prices - and Fat Kee nails it on both counts. You get a great plate of noodles served with tea for as little as a Big Mac meal, often delivered as quickly - and it tastes so much better!\n\nI have had better, but Fat Kee is usually very good. The inconsistency that shows in the occasional plate only being \"okay\" loses them their 5th star here.\n\nThe service is prompt if a bit brusque - hey, they're busy. And the decor makes you wish there was something to look at out the window - but what do you want when lunch is under $10?
