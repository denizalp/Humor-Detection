The lady Mayra in the office was really rude. I asked her if she knew if the technician needed to check the thermostat as well as the outside unit and she laughed and said, \"I don't know, I'm not a technician.\" I was extremely shocked at that response. Her customer service skills are terrible. Just off of that alone I would seek a different company but unfortunately this is the company my landlords homeowners warranty goes through.
