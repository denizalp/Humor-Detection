Be careful if you need to get your machine repaired here.  I took mine in for cleaning, and they replaced the water pump.  They didn't call me before doing the work, they just did it.  Even if the work was necessary (which it wasn't because that part had just been replaced a month prior), it's shocking that they just went ahead and did it without my permission.  They charged me close to $200 and there was nothing I could do about it.  They basically stole from me.
