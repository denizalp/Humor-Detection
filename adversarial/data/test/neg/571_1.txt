I have been waiting for this place to open for a longgggg time now. Finally went tonight and I ordered the pot stickers and pad kee Mao. The pot stickers are great! Nice and not soggy. I ordered a level 8 and I don't think it was very spicy at all. So next time I will need to get a 9 or 10. I used to go to Gaati but they have new owners and it is just not the same. So far I like this place. Hopefully this will be my new Thai spot.
