I HATE taking photos but Michael made me feel so comfortable and got some great photos. The price was really reasonable compared to what I had previously found, and Michael was so awesome. He took tons of pictures until we got the right one, and let me do different outfit changes- he also gave his professional opinion about everything I asked, from earrings to outfit to hair choice. Really happy with my experience!
