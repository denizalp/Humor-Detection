The first experience I had didn't meet my expectations but I went back a second time to give it another try because it's so close to my home but it was even worse than the first! The lady kept rushing me to choose a color before I was ready and did the COMPLETE OPPOSITE of what I asked her to do! I wanted a thin natural looking acrylic overlay on my natural nails and she completely rushed through them making it look extra thick and chunky not to mention she didn't even put any acrylic on the sides of my nails making it look like a hot mess. I will never go back and do not recommend for anyone.
