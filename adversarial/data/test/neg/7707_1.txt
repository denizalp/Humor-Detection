Angel's Diner has become a regular stop for our family.  We eat there at least once a week, and we really enjoy the reasonably-priced, delicious meals. The menu is extensive with American and Mexican foods, sandwiches, breakfast items available all day, and lots of comfort foods.  They plan to offer a buffet once a month starting in August.  Angel's is always clean, and the staff is very friendly.  The owners are the sweetest couple--very accommodating!  Check 'em out!
