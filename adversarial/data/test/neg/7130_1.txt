I used to think B Spot was a great place, but after further review.  I don't know anymore,  the last 2 burgers I got at the restaurant were completely different.  The Yo! burger and the fat dog burger, but they both seemed and tasted the same...Very greasy... I don't know, not sure if I will go back there. \n\nThink the beer selection is terrible.  So all and all, doubt I will go back here.
