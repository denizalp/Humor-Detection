This is by far the worst McDonald's in the area. I live 5 minutes from the store and work across the street from it. So I try not to eat there due to the terrible service and cold food. Thought they would get better when they were bought out by individual owner instead of corporate location but no they are worst. Went through drive through tonight for first time in months. Asked for a Mac , tenders meal and a mcchicken. After seeing the order screen notice the  Mac Jr was not on order I asked if it was on order  they said she had it on there. So I continued after waiting for 20 minutes to get to pay window keep in mind had 4 cars in front of me and no one inside store it took 20 minutes to just get to the pay window. I got to pay window they have my food waiting cold of course and hand it to me in the pay window. Of course the Mac Jr they said was on order was not in bag and the fries tasted like they were sitting for the whole 20 minutes I was waiting. Upon going back into store to correct their error they continued to charge me for the Mac Jr they never put on my order AND ANOTHER ORDER OF FRIES so I ended up getting charged for two cold orders of fries. I repeat do not go to this McDonald's ever they have not gotten better and should just shut the location down. I would suggest going to the new one opening on providence and Audrey Kell but guess what same owner owns them both guess McDonald's is never getting my business again. DO NOT GO HERE EVER
