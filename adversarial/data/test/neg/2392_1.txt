Sonic is one of the better fast food chains out there. They offer a different selection like tater tots, grilled cheese sandwich, and you can make your own flavored soda or slushies! I really never had a bad meal, and I like the nostalgic drive in! Their crew seems to be very friendly, and haven't had a wrong order yet. I'm not much into this place but since the wife gets her way all the time, and she is a grilled cheese person. Well I really don't have to say anything else! You get the picture!!!
