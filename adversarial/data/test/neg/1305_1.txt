This is an update review of TopGolf.  I was a frequent visitor here.  However the last visit I was there I got food poisoning from a sunrise burger.   I ran into a server that knew me by name and asked why I wasn't going anymore which I explained why and her response was yeah I wouldn't trust the kitchen.  I think I will stick to normal driving ranges for now on.
