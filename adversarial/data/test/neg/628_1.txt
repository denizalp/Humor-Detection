This is not a very professional location compared to my previous experiences across the country. I travel a lot and have to have service in areas unfamiliar to me. I usually have a good experience at Jiffy Lubes but this time I was disappointed. Not only was the receipt very difficult to read to do poor print quality they checked ok on items that I know should have been addressed. Very minor, such as washer fluid, however I paid for full service. Not wanting to take the time to read a very faint receipt I left, my bad. Their excuse for the poor quality print was, it must be an old machine because the toner doesn't last long.
