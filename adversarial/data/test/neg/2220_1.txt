This is our neighborhood restaurant, with a great location and great atmosphere.  We especially love the outside patio area.  They grow their fresh herbs right outside on the patio.\n We've been coming here since day one, and it just gets better and better! Tonight we had the caprese salad which was amazing as was the handmade wood fired pizza. We topped the night off with the Creme Brulee with fresh strawberries.  Everything was so delicious!!\nThis place is perfect for any occasion. Dinner for two or something larger. In the past, we've held my daughters sweet 16 party as well as my 50th bday surprise party.  This is a place you can always count on.  Thank you Bill!!!
