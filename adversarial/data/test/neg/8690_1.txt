$25 for a weekend brunch and $5 extra for the unlimited champagne?  DO IT.\n\nWhen my party and I arrived at around 12:30 the line was intimidatingly long.  It was moving pretty fast though and before we knew it our group of 8 were seated with champagne and orange juice (we had to mix our own mimosa's).\n\nThe variety is huge and everything I tried was delicious.  We had two waitresses (yup, stayed long enough for a shift change) and both really took care of us, especially our second one.  They both kept our champagne glasses absolutely full and were always prompt with bringing more orange juice.  I don't know why the orange juice comes in such small carafes though -- it could have saved them a lot of work to just give us a big pitcher.  Our second waitress was especially lovely.  She even warned us that the mimosa's ended at 4pm and to remember to get our fill because we paid so much to get in.\n\nWe stayed here long enough to see some of the dinner items brought out. Salmon poke and tuna poke were enough of a temptation to get my disgustingly full butt off my chair to sample just a bit more.  So a tip for the weekend:  Do come at around 2 pm (to account for line wait), and eat slow enough so you can at least get to sample some of the dinner items (brought out at ~4pm).  Do this and you will absolutely get your money's worth.  But even without this, I was happy and full and buzzed and I can't wait until my next chance to eat here.
