Ginger Monkey Tavern was just ok. The staff was nice and polite, but overall it seemed like an off night. We were a party of 4 adults, and one child. \n\nThe staff is not really versed on the menu or beverage ingredients. That makes it difficult with allergy issues. \n\nAppetizers: We ordered wings (undercooked, but seasoned nicely), duck fat fries - cheese sauce was grainy like it sat too long and starting to separate) and the Brussel sprouts. The food came out lukewarm.  We were told wings are baked, then fried. They should have been cooked through and we were disappointed. \n\nEntrees: The chicken carbonara was ok. Plates were super hot from sitting under a light, but the pasta was not hot and the sauce was lukewarm. We ordered a chopped salad - not my definition of a chopped salad. Lettuce cut into huge pieces, and you couldn't find the olives, etc.  I asked for croutons but was told they didn't have any. When I mentioned there were croutons for the Caesar salad, she seemed stumped and surprised, but I did get some croutons. The croutons are not home made. The strawberry salad had one berry. The burger was undercooked.  We ordered sliders, but they were out of buns.  Our last entree was short ribs. Either the order wasn't placed, or there was a kitchen mishap. Unfortunately everyone was finished with their meal by the time this  entree was served. This wasn't a seasoned short rib, but a chunk of pot roast. On the other hand, the accompanying rice was cooked perfectly.  \n\nDessert: we ordered an apple crisp and 3 more desserts. The apple crisp was meh. And the ice cream - No flavor, and definitely not vanilla bean as advertised. We also ordered a hot tea and never got any. We had wanted decaf, but they were out. Management did not come by to apologize or share what went wrong. \n\nIt was sadly an expensive dinner and we were very underwhelmed by the kitchen. Our server was really delightful, and could have used more help.\n\nI don't know if we will attempt another visit.
