It's a bad time when you drop your iPad and have a big crack in the display, but the folks at iRepairs Wireless mitigated the pain dramatically.\n\nAfter receiving the $299 estimate for a fix at the Apple Store, I visited this place - and for $170 after the discount, I got the iPad back in 2 hours. And the display looks like a new one. It just feels like the same grade of Gorilla Glass, you can't tell the difference.\n\nAnd this is saying from a fanatical Apple fan who has owned every iOS device released to date, on the first day of launch every time.\n\nI'm satisfied!
