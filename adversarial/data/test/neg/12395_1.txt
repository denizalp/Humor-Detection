AYCE places have tried to up their game for a long time and I personally never had an interest in AYCE. Maybe its perception that the food is mediocre. I went to Spoon and Fork for the AYCE lunch special with a friend in the Oakville location on a Friday lunch time in January.\n\nOverall the quality is not bad and I have to give kudos to the restaurant for dishing out good quality sashimi considering the volume of hungry customers. But it will never replace the a la carte restaurants. And given it is AYCE the expectations have to be lowered. Still, its a quick and rather cheap way to fill up quickly for lunch. The only thing is the server was a tad slow in the beginning where other tables had their food before we even had ours and we ordered first.
