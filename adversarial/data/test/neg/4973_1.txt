I went to this location midday on a Monday for an oil change. This is a oil change express station with two servicing stations. There was one vehicle being serviced when I arrived. They only had two attendants and said it would be 30 minutes before they could even start to work on my vehicle. The Walmart tire and lube express down the street got me right in.
