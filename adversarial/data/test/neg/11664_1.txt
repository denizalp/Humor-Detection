Honestly I haven't been in a Barnes & Noble store probably for years. Came here to check out a book my son took with him to read. I have difficulty buying something I know I can get for less online (e.g. at Amazon). But I learned something new about the B&N membership. As a new member you get $50 worth in coupons (though I don't know what they are), and you can supposedly stack multiple coupons on top of each other. So in the long run it likely could be less than other online stores.
