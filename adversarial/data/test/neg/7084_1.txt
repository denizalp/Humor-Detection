I went into the store on Maryland, and from the moment I walked in neither of the stores sales girls \/ cashiers ??? smiled. The clothes are really cute and reasonable but one of the girls was very rude. I had about $250 worth of stuff I was about to purchase and because of her rudeness I left it all there. I will never go back to this store again. I understand that everyone is not ass bubbly as I am but I expect good customer service anywhere that I spend my hard earned money at and at least a smile when I walk through the door. I know it wasn't me because neither of them ever smiled at anyone. I gave a one star because I couldn't give anything less. I would not refer anyone to this place unless they don't care about the way they are treated in a store. BAD ENERGY. fyi. If the service was good I would have written a review about that!!!
