The restaurant doesn't look very unique from the outside and you may question if it's just another short term solution for the space once taken my restaurants that come and go, but the food experience inside is pretty amazing. I hope they keep strong momentum and are here to stay in our neighborhood. \n\nThere are fun wooden dolls that provide a unique look and feel you would expect if this place was in a casino. The host person and staff were friendly and professional. Menu navigation was easy for dinner and shared plates with a small group is the way to go. \n\nStart off with their apps and try the Lucky Rice. While the prices seem gourmet level, the quality and presentation definitely support it. We also had the Thai beef salad, short rib steamed buns (delicious!), foo dogs, yakitori, and a number of sushi rolls. Many of the dishes are a bit spicy, with various usage of chili and jalape√±os.\n\nCocktails were solid - offering classics and interesting specialties that are uniquely crafted for anyone's tastes. \n\nDefinitely visiting again.
