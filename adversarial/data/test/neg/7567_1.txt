Went to lunch with my mom. Everything was going good until my mother was done eating. I ordered soup and salad. The waitress took the salad away while I was still eating. Bowl half full of salad. Then we got the bill and my mother was charged the dinner portion. Explained she accidentally rang in the dinner portion. That was it, did not fix it in the system.  Thats not our fault you rang in a dinner portion. Im still kind of salty that she took the salad away while i was still eating. Felt very rushed (at 1130 am)
