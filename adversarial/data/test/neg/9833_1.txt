Simply amazing. Mike Staggs, the President was so easy to work with. Got some awesome tires at an insane price. Also, I ran over some road debris on the way home (the day the tires were installed) and I got a large piece of metal embedded in the tire. Tire did not deflate, so I drove it back to Tire Dawgs the next day. Mike's crew removed the piece of metal and patched the tire ... BUT here is the cool part. Mike ordered me a replacement tire which arrived the next day and they did a tire swap out - AT NO CHARGE. This is my new \"go to\" place for tires. It should be yours too. You WILL NOT be disappointed.
