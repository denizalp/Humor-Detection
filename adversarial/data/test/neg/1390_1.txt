While the name is kind of unfortunate and makes the place seem more tourist-y than it actually is, the restaurant was great.  We ate here because we had come to Gold Coast to eat at the Noodle Exchange and they were about to close so we felt bad going in to eat.   I had a curried noodle dish, and my girlfriend had kung pao chicken.  Both dishes were fantastic.  The service was really good and portions were large.  My only complaint is that if you don't like seafood\/fish\/shrimp, your menu choices are fairly limited.
