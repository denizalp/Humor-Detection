The fried chicken tenders were good, and I love the shoestring fries! I had ordered the side of corn not realizing it had a little bit of spice. I can't eat spicy food at all, so I asked if I could switch it for mash potatoes instead and they were super nice and switched it for me immediately! Great service as well! Gerald (sp?) was super attentive and refilled my water and brought us ranch. Hard worker!
