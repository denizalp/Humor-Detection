Basil Box is great, and I'm really pleased they are opening so many locations. \n\nThe food is fresh, tasty, flavourful, and quite filling. \n\nTheir menu is a select your own type of style so you can choose the base, veggies, protein, and toppings. \n\nMost recently I got the chilled noodles with peppers, sweet potato, lime shrimp, and with cilantro, peanuts, peanut sauce and a bit of spicy Penang curry. It was absolutely delicious!! So filling and great flavours. \n\nIt came to about $12 with tax which is perfect for lunch. \n\nThis spot is bright and spacious and has plenty of comfortable seating. \n\nWhat really made this a five star experience was the service. The server was incredibly friendly and took the time to welcome me, and offered suggestions. He even said bye on my way out. \n\nI'll definitely be back to Basil Box soon!
