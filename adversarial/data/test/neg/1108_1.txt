My son's hair dresser did allow me to use the gc after I chose to also tell her that I thought I should be able to use this free haircut.  I felt bad for her because the other employees were annoyed and not very nice to her when she was trying to get my free haircut card to go through their computer system.  They also told her in front of me that she's going to get in trouble.  Very unprofessional.  I made sure that they saw me tip her the price of a full haircut, and I told her how much I appreciate her doing this.
