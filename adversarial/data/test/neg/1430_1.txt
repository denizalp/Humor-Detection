If you want your pool to look like this, call Hugo and his team.\n\nPrepare for a lengthy but useful read:\n\nThe largest issue ensued during a misunderstanding between my home-warranty, myself, and Protege pools. My pool filter busted and my home-warranty faulted Hugo for lack of proper maintenance. This was not hard for me to believe as 1. my knowledge of pool care is limited and 2. it was noticeable that even though I was paying for weekly service Hugo did not every weekly and 3. we consistently had issues with the pool greening. So of course, after finding out I had a $1200 problem on my hands from what my home warranty was claiming was lack of maintenance which I was paying Hugo for, I called quite upset (crying, not yelling). Hugo came over and said that home-warranty was lying and they just didn't want to cover the damage, but that he would work with me because he doesn't want his name smeared into the ground for bad business. Promises he'll look for filters, let me pay on a payment plan, and that he \"won't even make money off of this deal\" just wants to help me get this taken care of. I said okay, I'll do what research I can on my own to learn more about the issue. Please just let me know what it costs on his end, I'll see what I can do, let's just try to keep the pool from greening in the mean time. This is the last I would see of Hugo (but not the last communication from protege pools leading me on to believe they would still service my pool). This was around July 27th.\n\nI leave a voicemail a few days later asking if they can utilize liquid chlorine to keep the pool from greening with no circulation, no response.\n\nOn July 31st I have an outside inspection done from a different pool company ( and speak with several others on the phone). Turns out is very possible that Hugo had nothing to do with the filter busting. \n\nOn August 1st I send him the inspection report, tell him I'm sorry for not taking his word immediately but essentially that would make me a sucker because I needed to do my research. Stated that I know he's probably swamped from the dust storm that occurred the previous night but did let him know I had left him a voicemail and would appreciate a call back. No response.\n\nOn August 2nd Sandra texts me and states Hugo is really behind from the storm and he will be there before the weekend for services and that they have \"great chemicals that will make it perfect.\" The weekend comes and goes, no one stops by.\n\nAt this point I'm buying my own chemicals and doing my best to sift debris out of the pool myself, because I can't risk the pool getting any worse. I call back August 8th saying this (via voicemail again), and I state that I have another company coming to fix the filter. I just wanted to see if someone is ever going to come and render service or if i need to find a new pool guy and if they plan on charging me if they're not coming back. No immediate response.\n\nOn August 9th Sandra texts me stating she was told to \"hold service\" because they \"thought I didn't want to continue service after an issue with Hugo\" and that their route is completely full. Sandra apologized for the \"misunderstanding\" and offered to see if she can get Hugo back on my route. I declined.\n\nI never asked to discontinue services, in fact it was the complete opposite. I would ask when they were coming and they would reassure me that they would...even though Hugo had no plans to. Beware, if things get difficult with your pool, they'll run and leave you guessing with a big fat mess on your hands.\n\nFor the record, I still have all the text message communications between myself, Hugo, and Sandra that confirm everything I've stated is true. Stay clear of these guys.
