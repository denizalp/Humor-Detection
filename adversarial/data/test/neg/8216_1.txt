Honestly, It's not easy to rate an icon of my youth. As a child, it was a special treat to visit Cooper's in its iconic A-Frame building. When I played baseball, this place was packed after each game. In high school, I'd bring the occasional date here on a hot summer night for a soft serve cone. So can anything really live up to the memories?\nThis is still a great little ice cream stand. Service is fast and friendly, and it is still popular on a hot summer night. Have prices gone up? Sure. But this isn't a 50 cent cone from McDonalds or Burger King. Cooper's has a wide selection of ice cream, toppings, and sundaes made to order. Eastlake would not be the same without Cooper's Twist and Shake.
