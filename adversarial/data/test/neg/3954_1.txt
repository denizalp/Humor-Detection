after reading the reviews of higher rated critics,\nmaybe the sweet crepes are the winners here. \ni wouldn't know though. \nnormally at a creperia i would order one savory and then one sweet for dessert but i was so disappointed in the ham n cheese crepe i couldn't even finish it. \nthe cheese tasted like Velveeta cheese (for those unfamiliar with Velveeta, it's the most processed and non-cheese tasting cheese of all American cheeses ever made). completely unappealing \"cheese\" product.\nI ordered a side of creme fraiche and what i was given was (to the best i could tell) a cross between vinaigrette dressing and thousand island. after sending it back and rerequesting the \"white sauce for crepes, creme fraiche\", i was given a processed version of ranch dressing.\n:(\nSorely disappointed!\n\nand it's not cheap either.\nfor my crepe and an OJ, it ran me $18\n\n-side note, no wi-fi either, so i don't know why you'd want to even bring your laptop in to do some work with a coffee either.
