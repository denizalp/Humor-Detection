I remember going to Sienna Mercato about 3 years ago and the meatball was beyond amazing. \nHowever 3 years later, I'm honestly not too impressed by the meatballs anymore :( \nThe side pasta was also very mediocre, which is disappointing. \nI would come again to check out the roof top bar, but probably no more meatballs for me.
