Of all the times I have been to Vegas I was missing something.....I needed something out of old time Vegas, something flashy, gawdy, and cool not dirty  and cheesy like Fremont street and over the top like the strip. Then I found my oasis....Peppermill! I went here because I saw it on Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations and I was in complete awe of the decor and the large drinks they had and what I thought to expect Peppermill gave more. \nIt's a great place to have drinks with your friends away from all the typical Vegas stuff. The waitresses outfits are tasteful and classy  from what I have seen at Vegas which is a relief itself. \nFirst time goer and likes to drink get the Scorpion.
