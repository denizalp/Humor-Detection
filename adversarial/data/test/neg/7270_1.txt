I bookmarked this restaurant a while ago and finally made it over with two friends. Unfortunately, I went for an early dinner at 5:30PM after having eaten buffet for lunch, so I wasn't very hungry. Nevertheless, with three people in our party, we ordered family style and I still got to try several dishes.\n\nThe restaurant is located on the second floor and is much nicer inside than it appears from the outside. Service was attentive and friendly as well. The menu is quite large and I haven't had much Malaysian food.\n\nSee my photos for pictures of what we ordered. I enjoyed everything! I always love soup and the Bah Kut Teh here was tasty, though not strong enough (Chinese herb wise) for me. We have a similar dish in Taiwan with the same name (pronounced in Taiwanese, which is a language almost identical to the Hokkien spoken in Malaysia\/Singapore), though the Taiwanese version does not have cabbage or tofu and is made with pork ribs. \n\nPrices were fair and portions moderate. Definitely a great place if you're in the mood for something different. I can't wait to come back and try more off the menu!
