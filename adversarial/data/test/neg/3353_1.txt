Service when we arrived was amazing. We walked around and enjoyed some shopping before going to our rooms and found some unique places. \n\nWe arrived at 1230pm and check in was not until 3. I needed to shower so they got me in right away. Service amazing and when we got to the room we loved is so much we booked 3 more nights. \n\nWithout a doubt we will be staying here again in the future. No issues at all and the service was over our expectations throughout the property. \n\n Best Hotel and Casino in Vegas!
