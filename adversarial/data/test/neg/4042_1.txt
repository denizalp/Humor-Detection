Started out rough - they don't take reservations for one. But once we got past that - my god. Ridiculous!!! Food is incredible. Coming from a city of steakhouses (NY) the service is impeccable and the food is top notch. Mini pasta primi? Yes!!! Shrimp cocktail - FANTASTIC. Wine list, on point! Steak? incredible!!! No more on the Strip dinners, this is now my go to celebration dinner!
