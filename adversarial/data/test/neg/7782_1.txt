I ordered the McAllister's Club to go with potato salad.  When I got back to the office the club did not have any cheese on it and it barely had any lettuce or tomato.  It was basically all meat and bread.  Not too impressed by that.  But the potato salad was really good and so was the sweet tea.  I emailed through their website about my experience but never received a reply so apparently they really don't care that I spent $10 and did not get what I ordered.  I will keep that in mind the next time it crosses my mind to go here.
