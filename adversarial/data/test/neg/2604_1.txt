This place is so good you smell it driving down the street before you get there! Literally everything looked good on the menu. I'm from Kansas City so I love my BBQ, the day we went I had the #3 Italian beef sandwich and I'd have to say it was the best I've ever had (my lips were tingling in a good way). This place is a must and Billie was the most amazing host. Will be returning soon! Location on baseline & mill ave in Tempe.
