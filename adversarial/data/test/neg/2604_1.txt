Jake at JW Landscaping is awesome! \n\nHe is polite, professional, easy to get in touch with, and quick to get the work done.  He presented me with a quote and was able to handle my landscaping concerns in record time.  Plus, I practically had to force him to take my money.  \n\nI highly recommend JW Landscaping.
