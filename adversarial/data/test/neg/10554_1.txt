Saturday night out and we opted for RRBC.  We had been there before for their beer after the dinner crowd was gone, but wanted to check out the food.\n\nVery loud and crowded at the bar.  I am sure the back patio alleviates this in the warmer months.  Beers were very good and the selection will meet anyone's palette.  \n\nFood?  Not impressed.  Started with the Riccotta Pesto dip that has pita drizzled with balsamic reduction.  Lacked taste and needed something.  Friends had the Asian tacos and loved them.  They considered getting another plate but didn't.  I did not have any since they were gone so quickly.  I had the salmon with asparagus risotto that was no different than I would get anywhere else.  Wife had the chicken tacos and only ate one.  Dry and no flavor.  Brought them home and they are still in the fridge.  Friends had the beer cheese soup and thought it was very good.  \n\nSo, if you are looking for good craft beers with a nice selection, this is the place.  If you are primarily looking for food or a quiet atmosphere I might not recommend.  I would like to try this when they weren't so busy and see if it makes a difference.\n\nSide note:  Any time we have come here later in the evening for just drinks I can tell you that the bartenders have been some of the finest.  Great service, knowledgeable about their craft products and personable.
