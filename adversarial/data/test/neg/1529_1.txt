I want to make this review clear that this 5 star review goes to one person only from Lorex's support staff (Jenny with Lorex Customer Feedback Representative).\n\nI have had nothing but nightmare with my last order with Lorex with their customer support staff via tickets and calls. It was until Jenny stepped in and help out with my order did she made everything right again. Recently due to Jenny's hard work I placed a new order and again I had questions\/issues so again I contacted Lorex's normal customer support and again NO UPDATE; therefore, I had to email Jenny for help and with in hours she was able to resolved my problem and again made me a happy repeat customer. \n\nI also want to say I do love Lorex's products as I have 16 cameras now and chances are will add more. I just hope someone in Lorex's customer service department can be trained to the standard Jenny has showed me. \n\nmy other review with the nightmare issue is on (http:\/\/www.resellerratings.com\/store\/Lorex with new update of 4\/5 star).
