A small little frozen yogurt shop that has about 10 different flavors to choose from. The tasting cups are at the beginning so you can try different flavors before committing them into a larger cup.\n\nPersonally I like the chocolate nutella with a small side of tart....there's something about the combination of a bite of a sweet and tangy that makes it delicious. \n\nMojo offers a variety of fresh and dried toppings and also syrups as well. They charge $0.44 per ounce.\n\nThe seating inside is limited, maybe only 4 or 5 seats but there are a few tables outside the store that you can sit at.\n\nI do agree that the staff could use some training on customer service, but I don't deal with them that much besides paying for my yogurt. It isn't so bad that it would deter me from coming to this place if I was around the area and had a frozen yogurt craving.  \n\nIf you come here often, be sure to get their frequent diner card for stamps.
