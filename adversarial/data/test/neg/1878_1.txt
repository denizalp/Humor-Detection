About a month ago, we had the pleasure of working with Myron on our wedding day at Bear's Best. Although I hardly noticed he was there in the reception, he captured great photos and honored my request for evening shots. The firecrackers around us were so creative and really made a unique effect! Overall, we were so pleased with his work!
