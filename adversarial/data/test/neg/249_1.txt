FROM A HOTELIER; The staff: friendly, helpful and extremely polite \n                                   The Housekeepers: very clean room, attentive\n                                   The property: clean, pretty and considerate\n                                   The Breakfast: Good and hearty\nI recommend this property to anyone looking for a lovely, clean room with all the amenities one could want.  A laundry mat on site, nice pool area,\nclean property with friendly, polite and helpful staff.  Rates were very reasonable.  I would have paid more.  Thank you for making my first visit to the Phoenix area a wonderful experience.\nOnly negative thing: found the suite cheaper on Booking.com and front desk would not price match.  You could have save on the commission.
