Just moved here and I've passed by this place a few times. Finally my wife and I decided to give it a shot. It looks great on the inside. Looks like if busy the size could be a issue but there wasn't really anyone there so didn't effect us. We're originally from Texas so we wanted to give the smoke house part of the menu a try. We got the Austin because that's where we're from and how could you not order something named for your home town. Unfortunately we we're extremely disappointed. The brisket and pork were so extremely dried out and flavorless. We couldn't believe it! There was no smoke ring in the meat that we could see so where's the smoke house aspect coming from? The ribs were ok. They definitely had a smell to them that I couldn't put my finger on. I'll be willing to give this place another shot and try the seafood side of the menu. It definitely seems like this is a seafood place that trys to sell BBQ. If you're going for the 1st time I would stick to the seafood side for sure because the bbq here does not pass this Texans quality test at all.
