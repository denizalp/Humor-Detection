Ok, so I heard a new vegetarian\/vegan restaurant opened up in Charlotte, of all places.  Naturally, I was super-excited.  Then, my roommates ate there and LOVED it - I mean, seriously rave reviews. \n\nSo, I ordered take-out from there for lunch today (Mushroom Farro Risotto) and all I can say is:  Seriously???  This is what everyone's raving about??  I just paid $14 (before tax!) for HALF A BOWL OF RICE AND A FEW PIECES OF TOFU, with some fennel and mushrooms thrown in.  It doesn't even come with sides!  And with the exceptions of the mushrooms, it's rather flavorless --- an OILY to boot.  Long story short:  I'm $15 lighter and still hungry.  \n\nNow, I'm all for gourmet and it's great to think there's a high-end date restaurant with vegan options.  However, calling something \"gourmet\" comes with a bigger responsibility than simply throwing some rice in a bowl (or on a plate) and OVERCHARGING for it.  \n\nI'm sure once the sad, deprived veggie masses get over the novelty of this restaurant, they're going to wake up and realize a) They're STILL starving and b) THIS PLACE IS AN EGREGIOUS RIP-OFF that is just taking advantage of the veg\/vegan community.  \n\nSo... yeah.  I'll just be happy with Zizi's and Luna's.
