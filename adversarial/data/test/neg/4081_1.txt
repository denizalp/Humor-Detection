On an impromptu dinner, a coworker and I decided to try somewhere close to our houses. I'm always in the right mood for sushi, so I thought this place was going to work out just right. I'm glad we chose it, because I had a great time!\n\nThe intersection this restaurant sits on is a busy one for the area. It's filled with grocery stores, shops, restaurants, gas stations and bars. Definitely a lively area for Henderson. When you walk in, you'll notice a very modern place. After the hostess station there are separated date night rooms to the right and another dining area to the left.  The big focal point in this restaurant is the sushi bar, taking up almost half the restaurant. Business signs, flat screen tvs and exposed ceiling air ducts bring out the modern look for sure. Along with the wall dividers and the sushi bar, bamboo plants are used to break out the room into smaller intimate dining areas. Our servers were really nice. They were accommodating and very attentive when they were around. At times, it was hard to flag one down as they would congregate on the far side of the restaurant, away from the guests. Also, there's a \"head honcho\" lady that works the hostess station.  I say head honco because she certainly acted like it. She walked around eating, speaking loudly, kind of a turn off. If she was meaning to let everyone know that she was the boss, she certainly did that with no shame. \n\nFor starters, I got the White Truck pinot grigio wine for $7 a glass. It was light, crisp with a sweet ending. Super refreshing for my meal. For my starter, I got the Hamachi\/Yellowtail collar for $8.95. I can't get enough of this stuff! Grilled yellowtail served with a ponzu sauce. Super flaky and marbleized. Grilled to perfection. One only piece of feedback: it came after my actual meal came. Speaking of, I decided on the chicken katsu for $12.50. Breaded chicken, deep fried and served with katsu (ketchup based) dipping sauce. The meal was served with miso soup and salad. The plate came with a scoop of rice and grilled veggies. I thought the chicken was light, the breading wasn't too heavy and super crispy. The sauce was a little to dark and strong from my \"kastu\" taste. Seemed to have a lot of Worcestershire sauce or similar. The veggies were sauteed in soy sauce and a little too salty but at least brought another element to the fried dish. All in all, I'd say it was pretty flavorful!\n\nI'm so glad to have discovered another sushi restaurant close to home! Sushi is something I can eat again and again. Although I had no sushi on this night, I really enjoyed myself and the company. If you're ever in the area and looking for a place to welcome you and your company, stop by The Sushi. It's a surprisingly great treat!
