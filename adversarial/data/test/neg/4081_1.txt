If you want to get cultured, you will LOVE it here. \n\nIt was a visually indulging experience and stimulated all your senses. Even if you are of a Mediterranean background, every bite is new and exiting exploding with beautiful flavour. Everything was plated so elegantly using lots of floral detailing, service was exceptional, ambience was dark and cozy, and you feel truly immersed in such a delicious adventure. We brought some food home and it just wasn't the same - something about it is ultra inviting and different from any other place.
