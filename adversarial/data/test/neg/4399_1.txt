We attended this month's third Friday N+U event (free) at the Heard and it was a blast! This month, it was Capoeira and African drumming\/dancing with an open bar and margaritas\/street tacos in the cafe. The event was entertaining, full of energy and my 3 year old and I danced for almost an hour. My margaritas certainly didn't hurt! I had a great time and I am really looking forward to September's event, jewelry and drinks!
