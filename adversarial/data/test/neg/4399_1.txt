Not the most colorful place. It's not a hole in the wall either. Great place to come play. It's not loud and the food is great. A nice gem is on Friday and Saturdays there is Prime Rib:O Prime Rib cooked how you want for $4.98 two sides of your choice.\n\nBit run down but everyone in here is really friendly. Haven't played anything here aside from Keno. It's only a nickel a play and you can win big.\n\nFavorite thing here is the food. Gaming here is nice but come here for the food and stay for the atmosphere. Not loud but really lively. People are veterans and retirees. If you ever get bored go to the bar or restaurant and listen o a couple stories from the vets.
