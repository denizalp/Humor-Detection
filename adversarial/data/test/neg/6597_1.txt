The guy sitting in the first tattoo station, treated us like shit! I have NEVER been to any business that was so unprofessional.\nMy husband and I walked in, and my husband asked if he could use the bathroom while I picked out a tattoo. The tattoo artist told him, he could not use the bathroom until he received cash from us. I was in disbelief, so we told him we would go somewhere else and get a tattoo. And he said, go ahead they won't let you use there bathroom either.
