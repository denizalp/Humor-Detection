I have spent entirely too much money at this place due to A\/C problems. The issue still hasn't been fixed. I will find a reputable mechanic that will not take advantage because I am a female. Also had I known this place had an 'F' rating with the Better Business Bureau I would've never gone there. I am beyond pissed with the horrible and shoddy service done to my car.
