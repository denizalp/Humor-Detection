Have ate at Carolina's many times and thus far the only menu item I was not impressed with was the green chili, not sure if it was just the batch of the day but was very bland and tasteless. \n\nThe Oaxaca(say it with me now: wuh-ha-ca) is amazing, best I've tired around but do order more than one (small size burro). The Zarape Special is my second winner of the menu and consists of three flauta's garnished beautifully with a homemade guacamole that is excellent, and again some of the best in town. Especially when compared to Filibertos.\n\nLast but not least, their red sauce is addictive, with a noticeable garlic taste, wish it we were spicier though or that they had hotter options available.
