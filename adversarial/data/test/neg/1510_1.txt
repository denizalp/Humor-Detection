My honey decided to surprise me with dinner plans last night here..  We waited a bit but not too long.. My fav dish on their menu is the baked spaghetti. When I asked the waitress she advised it was a discontinued  item.. I am highly disappointed by this statement.. We asked why, her response was, we want to be known  for our speciality, our pizza, not the baked spaghetti.   She stated that it was a  limited time only.. Now mind you, every table around us had at least three to four pizzas on them.. I think folks know you make pizza. Bring back the baked spaghetti and i will consider coming back to your restaurant.. Wood fired pizzas are every where... But the baked spaghetti was only found at your location. Maybe Lou Malnatis that is opening in our neighborhood after the first of the year will have it and my business... Your food is good, but....
