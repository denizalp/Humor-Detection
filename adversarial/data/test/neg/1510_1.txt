Roxie floral did all the flowers for our wedding and everything came out beautifully. They did our bridal party bouquets and boutonni√®res, corsages, aisle arrangements, center prices, and petals for the flower girls. Everything exceeded my exceptions. We didn't have a big budget for flowers so we told angel our budget and she made everything work. I would definitely use roxi floral again!
