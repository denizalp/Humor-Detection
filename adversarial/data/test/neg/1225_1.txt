This is my go to when I have out of town suppliers.  I've been there with small parties (just 3 of us) and large parties (over 10).  Each and every time service has been top notch.  I suggest calling ahead if you have more than 4 people since they do have been known to have long waits during the busy times.  Each of the levels is a different experience with my two favorites being the Meatball Joint closely followed by the Beer Garden.\n\nLet's talk balls!  They.  Are.  Fabulous.  Each month there's a new ball being featured based on the time of the year, and then there's also the regulars.  You pick your ball, your sauce, and then lastly how it is served.  From small sliders to paninis, or served over pasta you have a crazy amount of combinations to pick from.  And the parmesan fries are to die for!\n\nI hear they also have salads and that they're good ... but let's be honest, I don't eat greens.
