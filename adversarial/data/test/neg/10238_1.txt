Omar's window tinting is definitely a 5 star business. Booking was quick and easy. I sent him a message via his website, and got a call back the same day. I made an appointment on a Saturday (which I might add, when most other tinting businesses are closed). He helped me choose the best option for my vehicle based on what I was looking for. Omar gave me a 2 hour duration for the actual tinting process, and was done ahead of schedule. The quality itself is superior, as I noticed no flaws whatsoever in his work. My car looks amazing! Omar and his staff provided very friendly service. I would definitely recommend this business to anyone including my own friends and family. Thank you Omar for a job well done!
