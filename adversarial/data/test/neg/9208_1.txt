My wife and I are purchasing a house in the neighborhood and were concerned about what local eateries and umm, drinkeries (?), there were close by.\n\nWe drove 'round the neighborhood and found The Covenant and wow, are we stoked.\n\nEverything we ate and drank was awesome and everyone was so friendly and informative about the area.\n\nWe can't eat to live close by and make this our go-to place!
