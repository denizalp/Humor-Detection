Located right across the street from the Bellagio Fountains, the Sugar Factory is a must!  On my recent trip, we enjoyed the patio seating and watched the fountains go off several times.\n\nThe food is delicious; but admittedly nothing special or unique and the pricing is on the higher side -- you're really paying for the atmosphere!  When I was here last, we split appetizers, which left us very full as the portions were a decent size.  The Fried Macaroni and Cheese was the favorite for our group!\n\nThe Lollipop Midori was a must and very easily split between two (perhaps even three if you aren't really drinkers)!  They bring it to your table and pour the drink in so you can watch the dry ice do it's thing!  \n\nOverall, a very pleasant experience -- the waitstaff was professional and courteous, we were eagerly chatting away amongst our group, I think our waitress sensed that and was being careful not to interrupt our fun.  The food was good, but not fantastic; and the drinks were wonderful!  The patio seating with a view of the fountains really MADE the experience.\n\nYou can purchase the swarvoski crystal lollipops in the shop after your visit, or many other candy items, which we did not do; but it makes great souvenirs for yourself or gifts for friends!
