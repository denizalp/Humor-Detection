Lately the metal shows coming through town have been coming to Club Red.  I get it's a dive bar, so I have no issue with that. Overall I like the place. It's a quick 15 minute drive from my house and parking is super easy too.  I wish there were more places to sit since it gets packed inside.  Unless you get there early, there are only like 4-5 tables.  You're left standing for hours at times.\n\nThe bar is good, lines get long between bands, but that is to be expected.  Bathrooms are clean and easy to go to.  There are actually 2 stages\/rooms, sometimes 2 shows go on at once.  2 weeks ago when we saw Carnifex and Oceano a rap show was going on next door.  The smell of weed was overwhelming when you went into the hallway to use the bathrooms.  I guess they let you smoke it inside?  I laughed at it, but this leads me to my biggest complaint about this place...vaping!  \n\nWhy on earth is vaping allowed inside the club?!  It's disgusting!  Most venues make you go outside, but they are ok with it here.  A few months ago during Whitechapel it was overwhelming, but then the last few shows I saw (Dying Fetus, Carnifex\/Oceano) etc wasn't as bad.  \n\nOverall, it's a decent place to see a show.  You can stand towards the middle\/back and not get killed in a most pit and still enjoy death metal while being fairly close to the stage.  I'll keep coming back.
