I'm actually here right now writing this. I really like how bright and airy it is in here -- makes it much easier to get work done. My one complaint is that the drinks are actually pretty pricey. A large iced coffee (16 oz) is $3.70. I was actually really surprised by that price (no prices listed on the menu for iced drinks). It is really good though so I'd probably get it again. This place is definitely an upgrade from Company of Thieves.
