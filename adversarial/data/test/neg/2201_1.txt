Beautiful restaurant that came highly recommended to myself and my date. Romantic setting that is also good for larger groups. The waitstaff was helpful and extremely knowledgeable regarding the menu and wine list, and gave us great advice as to how we should tackle such a diverse and interesting menu. \n\nIf you are in the 412, certainly stop here for dinner. The avocado and crab meat tian was to die for, and order the duck as your main entree- you won't believe your tastebuds. Also, who knew chocolate creme brûlée existed? It does at Sonoma. And you don't want to leave without tasting it.
