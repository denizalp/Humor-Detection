My wife and I went up to Toronto a couple of weeks back and this little gem is without a doubt one of my new all-time favorite restaurants in the city! We had a variety of the oysters (of course), the bacon Mac n cheese, and we split a burger. Oh! I can STILL savor it all. The owner\/host came out and was an absolute delight. She helped to make the night perfect! Do yourself a favor if you're ever in Toronto...CHECK THIS PLACE OUT! Promise you won't be disappointed!
