This is a cozy place with an eclectic setup and music to match (I thought they were stealing the music from my phone as the playlist was almost spot on what I have on phone) \nBeer selection is decent and seems like a shot and pint kind of place.\nIt does get packed so beware of lineups later at night. The interior is a hodgepodge of several pieces of furniture thrown together but I guess they know they are not selling the interior here rather they are selling character and they do that well. I felt like I had walked into some laid back college kid's living room. Service was decent despite the mad rush of people.\nI had a Blanche De Chambley and was even given the orange slice as garnish. I also got a couple of tequila shots and they had an extensive selection for tequila as well. It does get packed so beware as there was a lineup of people trying to get in at one time.\nService was decent so 0.5 stars for that.\nDecent place to visit if you are in the area and this kind of vibe attracts you.\n3.5 Stars.
