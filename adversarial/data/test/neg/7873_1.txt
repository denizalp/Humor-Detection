Great service, great food.  Met what I think to be the owner the first week it was open and he was cleaning the place, asking customers how the service and food was and holding the door open for people.  Love to give people business that deserve it.\n\nThe big bonus was the food was also great and the people behind the counter were extremely courteous.\n\nKeep up the great work.
