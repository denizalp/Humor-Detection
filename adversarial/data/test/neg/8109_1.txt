Wow I see a pattern here. I've been with these guys for about 2 years. The first year they would come as scheduled....but this last year absolutely not. I've had so many issues with them from simply not showing up for 3-4 weeks at a time when my contract is weekly service for 7 months and bi weekly for 5 months out of the year....to spending 15 minutes on my front and back yard without even touching a single bush to prune. My plants and bushes would be so overgrown I would have to call and complain to Ryan to finally get it done. All the while, continuing to pay my dues every month. There were so many other problems but I don't want to write a book. I can't believe I stuck it out with them for this long but I finally cancelled their service last week.
