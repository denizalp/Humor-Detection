Have been going to Salon Zen for several years and am extremely happy with the way Krisanna does my hair....from color, cut and style!  She is very knowledgable on the latest techniques!  Occasionally with my schedule I have also had Felicity instead and she's wonderful too!  So happy I found this salon when we are visiting at various times throughout the year from New York!
