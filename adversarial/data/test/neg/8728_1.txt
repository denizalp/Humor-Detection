The driver was one of the rudest people I've ever met in my life. The driver said the bag was too heavy so I took out a second bag and tried to buy a second ticket but she wouldn't let me because she said the bag was too heavy. It was a circular argument. When I tried to call her out on her faulty logic she walked away from me. The bag was not more than 50 lbs. I know this because it actually weight less than it did when I took it from the airport.
