What a great place!  I read about it on a Yelp email and since I needed chorizo to make chili, I stopped in.  Great prices!  The chorizo is yummy.  I will come back to get tacos!  Also, I have seen chefs on the Food Network cook with dried chiles but I never knew where to get them.  Now I do!  I will definitely go back!
