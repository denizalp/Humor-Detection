I was just in the plaza here picking up some dog food when I saw Hobby Lobby I decided to walk in because I've never been in the store before it's amazing how much stuff they have I think I like this place better than Pier 1 Imports as far as furniture and accessories definitely will be back glad I stumbled upon this gem
