Came here for dinner with my mom. Walked in and it was empty and got to the counter and no one in the front. Someone saw us and took their sweet ass time to come help us. The food didn't seem fresh it was like they re heated up the meat and put it over old rice. Idk about this place anymore it use to be really good. Now the empty place speaks for itself. It's Losing it's flavor and touch
