Just finished up lunch here with my girlfriend a little while ago and it was amazing! You order at the counter and then pick your own seat and they bring you the food when it's ready. We ordered the lasagna thin crust pizza and we cleared the whole pizza. It was amazing! Perfectly cooked, crunchy thin crust, and an incredible taste. They have beer and wine as well which goes great with pizza. Highly recommended!
