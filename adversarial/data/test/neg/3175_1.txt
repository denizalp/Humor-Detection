I was here on business, so i do feel a tiny bit guilty not giving this place 5 stars. Overall we had a great time staying at THEhotel. \n\nHighlights:\ngreat lighting everywhere\nnice bar at the very top with view of all of Vegas!\nno slots or tacky casinos in lobby\nlovely room with all the amenities including HIdef TVs in every room even the bathroom! \nLiving room and 2 bathrooms included in suite\nlittle extras like sewing kits, bath crystals and shoe polish included\nQuick and easy check in with no lines\nhi-tec door bell and signage for housekeeping and do not disturb\nFast room service!\n\n\nCons:\nconfusing as hell to find the entrance\nnot the best location on the strip\nmovies on demand were $30 bucks?!\nNO Availability of King size beds for late check in, (so we had to take a room with barrier free design, which meant we had a bars all over our bath tub)\nNO complimentary WIFI anywhere in the bldg\nNO coffee in room\nPlace looked dead in the lobby and restaurant for the week duration of our trip
