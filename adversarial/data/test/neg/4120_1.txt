THEIFS!!!\n\nI went to this Mr.Lube to get an oil change. I left being ripped off.\nWhile getting my oil \"changed\" I was told that several of my fluids were low (wiper fluid, transmission, and power steering)  and would I like them topped up. After my oil change was done I was SHOCKED to find out that I was charged $25\/fluid top up! \nMy bill for an oil change was over $200. When I confronted the \"mechanic\" who is also the manager  Shahin Ahmed. I was told that is standard policy to charge for all fluid top offs. I argued but to no avail.\nFor my next oil change, I went to another Mr. Lube in Brampton (Ray Lawson and HWY 10).\nWhen I first entered  I told them right away I didn't want any fluid top-ups at all. The attendant was quite puzzled as to why I requested this, I proceeded to recant my story at which point the attendant shockingly told me THERE IS NO CHARGE FOR TOP UPS! Regardless of what is being topped up. \nSo Mr Shahin Ahmed completely ripped me off and is going against company policy. I have also submitted this to Mr.Lube corporate in hopes they do something
