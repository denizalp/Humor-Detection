First time we went my family and I waited 1 hour and 45 min -  our pager buzzed and we were told to stand in another waiting section, because there was noone available to walk us to our table - so we stood and waited with the other people who were also waiting to be seated for another 15 minutes. Finally, we get seated...placed our drink and food order and no bread came....we are starving by this time...so we ask for bread...waiting, waiting...bread finally arrives then our food.  ALL of our food was COLD...by this time were are getting frustrated...we tell our waiter and his response upsets all of us. His response was \"all I can do is offer to \"reheat\" it\"  REALLY!!! You want to put our food in the microwave!!! So my husband asks to speaks with the manager - our food is remade and its pretty good - we even get free cheesecake. So by the end we are all fine and say we will come back and give it another chance.  Well we went on Friday - only had a 30 minute wait this time - we ordered our food and get our bread (without having to ask). Our food arrives FREAKING COLD AGAIN (pissed and annoyed) my daughter and I decide to send ours back- my husband sucks it up (I ordered the flatbread pizza) my daughter gets her meal back (watery) and I got HALF of my flat bread pizza back with burned edges - YUP, you read it right...HALF of my DAMN pizza was missing and they didn't say shit about it - like it was cool! I did not send it back I paid for the damn meal AND still gave the server his tip - BUT MY FAMILY AND I WILL NEVER GO BACK AGAIN!!!!!!!! PISSED!!!!!!
