I need the preface the five star rating with he fact I am totally unfamiliar with this style of Mediterranean Food, outside of ordering lamb or a Gyro at other places, this was a new adventure. \n\nWas looking for a bakery (sweet tooth was acting up) and found this deli for dinner instead. \n\nI had a combo plate with beef and chicken shawarma humid, salad, olives,relish plate and pita bread included....I also ordered these little football looking things that o won't even try to remember how to spell, filled with meat and delicious. \n\nThe great server behind the counter was wonderful with answering my questions and the myriad of spice flavors have my mouth an adventure I won't soon forget. \n\nThink I'm gonna stop by for some baklava from the dessert case before I leave town. \n\nYou gotta stop here
