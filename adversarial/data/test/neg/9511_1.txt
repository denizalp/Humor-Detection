As locals we tend to make trips down to the strip rare and only for restaurants where we know the food will be exactly what we want. Yardbird fits the bill for that perfect chicken fix and sides that make choosing so difficult  that we need to keep returning to try them all. Of course beginning the meal with those BISCUITS doesn't hurt either! Seems every time we also need the deviled eggs and fried green tomatoes to start. Service is where they excel...attention to every table is immediate and gracious. Bryce is our favorite we request as he truly makes his his job look effortless yet no detail escapes his attention and he is quite helpful when trying to choose each dish. Management has done a great job in balancing the attention to the  individual diner while still hosting those big corporate groups at the same time in the same dining room. Kudos to all!
