I came in with my best friend's sister to redo her hair from the day before. They had made her hair too red and were bringing it down to a dark brown burgundy. I'm assuming the woman in the office who spoke with my friend's mother and sister was who runs the school. She was very professional and was very apologetic. What turned me way off about this school was the presentation of it and the students and educators in charge. As soon as we walked in all of the students were sitting in their chairs texting and talking about inappropriate subjects. Not only were they rude and seemed annoyed by questions asked by me and her mother, but the students gave rude glares and whispering comments about me and other clients in the building... I know from experience what it was like to be a cosmetologist student. I've been licensed for about a year now and work in a salon as well. At my school we were held to a higher expectation so we were prepared to work in nicer salons. In my opinion, if you go to Avalon, the standards they set for their students set them up for failure. Not only are their techniques half assed, but the way they are taught to present themselves to clients is very unprofessional and trashy. I wouldn't trust anyone from this beauty school to touch my hair.
