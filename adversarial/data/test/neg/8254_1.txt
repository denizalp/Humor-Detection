I used to come to this place all the time when I was younger. I loved it then and I love it now. It's so easy to forget about little gems like this when you move away for a few years but man am I glad I went tonight. You can't beat the large pizza and wing special... the wings and pizza are excellent and you can easily tell the dough is fresh and made in house. Everything has great flavor! \n\nI wish I took a picture but I forgot but they now have boneless wings for whenever I am lazy.
