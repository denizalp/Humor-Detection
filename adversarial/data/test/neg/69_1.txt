I love their pizza! I'm here once a week at least. I drove all the way from out by the airport to pickup delivery once. When i showed up, they acted like they had no idea what I was talking about. They even told me to check my phone as if I could have called another location, which there is only one, so not sure why they suggested that. \n\nNot only did I know for a fact that I ordered from the right number bc I order once a week, but I know for a fact that the man telling me I never ordered was actually the one who took my order! Come on, guys. You think I don't recognize your voices by now? I only come in once a week. Needless to say, being a little miffed over the situation, I haven't returned, but boy is their pizza good.
