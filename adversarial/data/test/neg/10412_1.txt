The pharmacy is very slow. I usually fill at the Capitol Clinic, but stopped by here today because I was nearby. I waited almost 15 minutes for my Rx even though there was only one other patient waiting. At Capitol, it's usually a minute or two. Fill your prescriptions elsewhere.\n\nGreat experiences with clinicians. Dr. Tock (derm) is very helpful and Dr. Barnes (optometry) is fantastic. May be weird, but I have fun going to my eye appointments. She's great.
