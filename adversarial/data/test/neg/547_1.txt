I absolutely love this place!\nGood affordable Pho.  I can't really try anything else due to a fish allergy, but the PHO is awesome. \nThe broth is light but super flavorful. The meat is tasty, and the sides are just right.\n\n 4 stars because my allergy fear keeps me from being able to try anything else.
