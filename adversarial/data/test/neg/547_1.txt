So first impression was not good !!! We came here for my Birthday for a girls nite out and were told it would be a 10 min wait 30 min later we went in to see when our table would be ready they took us back then it took 15 min to have somebody come by to take our drink order at this point we were pissed and hangry !!!! We were getting up to leave and go across the way to the Quarter at the Sorano Wine room and our server came to ask if anyone has helped us ? We said no and we're getting ready to leave he took out order and from there on things were great the food was amazing !!!! I'm not a big fan of the pretentious feel of the place though that's why I can only rate at 3 stars and then as service in the beginning. But the food was great and I will definitely return.
