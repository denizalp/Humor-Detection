The appetizers were good, and our server was funny, but the restaurant was not that busy and it literally took 2 hours before the last dinner plate was delivered.  Everyone had finished eating by the time the last dinner plate came.  My friend mentioned to the server it wasn't cool, and sent his food back.  The server removed that meal (that we didn't eat) and also an appetizer from our bill which I thought was a nice gesture.
