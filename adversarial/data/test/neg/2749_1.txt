Best pupusas! Come with time to spare. They make everything cook to order (which is why it's so yummy) so the wait time is about 15 minutes or so. Now if you are eating here, they do provide some yummy salsa and chips as you wait for your order. Wednesday and Saturdays are their deal days. $1.50 for each pupusa.
