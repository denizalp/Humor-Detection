I went here tonight after hearing good things about the place. I was very disappointed. The food servings were large but the food itself was not very good. The Chicken Fried Steak had no real taste at all. It was just bland. The pork chops were good but not great. Salad just a salad and the bread was cold. I do not think I will be going back after spending $46 dollars for so-so food. Very disappointing.
