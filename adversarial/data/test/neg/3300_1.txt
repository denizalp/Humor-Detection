My wife and I recently travelled to Arizona on vacation.  we rented a Ford Fusion from Alamo and were very happy with customer service and the desk, how well organized getting to our rental car and ease of returning.   The car itself was excellent, no issuses at all and we put some miles on the car sightseeing.   I will use Alamo again in the future when we travel.
