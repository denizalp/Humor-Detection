They say they have a strict no illegal drug policy but all day long, everyday there is pot in the air. There are on average 2 arrests a week. Homeless people use the pool shower to take showers. People love to blast rap here. Rapping about drugs, rape, prison,  and any number of other things any respectable person wouldn't let their children listen to. The maintenance staff isn't the most friendly, often time coming up with excuses, for example, as too why then pool isn't open until 3-4 hours after the posted time every day. Have children? Don't let them run around in the grass unless you expect them to come back with dog poop on them. Despite having bags readily available people just leave the crap sitting there for someone to discover it on their shoe. Nice front office staff, though. I'll give them that.
