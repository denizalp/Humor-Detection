Always great to have a new coffee shop in the area, but this one is a mixed bag:\n\nPros:\n+Nice, open inviting space.  Lots of light, spaces to sit and work or chat.\n+Always very friendly staff.\n\nCons:\n-Coffee and latte's just aren't very good.  They seem to be doing all the fancy schmancy coffee steps necessary: complicated brewing, latte art, etc; however, the flavour just isn't there.  I had one of the most bland latte's of my life here recently with milk that had been burnt.  The coffee is also somehow not taking me to flavour town.\n-Tiny sizes.  \"Regular\" appears to be about 8 oz.  That would be fine for an individual pour-over or a latte reflecting Australian flat white quality, but it misses the mark here.  Prices are consistent with what other shops charge for a larger portion.\n\nOVERALL, I'll give it a couple more tries, but as of right now, I'm underwhelmed by the beverages and recommend Moonbean, Pamenar, or Jimmy's for a superior cup in Kensington.
