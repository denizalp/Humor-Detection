I wish i could give a good review but I really can't .  I went into this place and the food was ok but not very consistent.  Sometimes they saute veggies and sometimes they don't.  The staff all have pretty bad attitudes and especially some of the girls who take your order.  I think they should get more friendly people and work on their consistency.  I mean if you are taking peoples orders at least say hello and thank you!
