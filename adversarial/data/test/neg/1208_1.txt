We lived here for 2 years staff were very nice and friendly but ever since new management took over it went down hill. You don't get good service. Gave my 2 month notice and move out they made me pay for carpet that was perfectly fine went to talk to property manager but she said he couldn't do anything for us. They're not even 1 star worthy. Don't wastes your money and time. You can get far better service  in other places.  Apartment that we're in right now is far better and less than what we were paying at Tuscany Ridge..
