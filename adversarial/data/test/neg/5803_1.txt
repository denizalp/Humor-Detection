I've been wanting to try this place since before it opened. Tonight I went with two girlfriends, and although we had a great time, I was completely unimpressed with the food.\n\nI would give it five stars for the ambiance and decor - it's a quaint, rustic place and I loved everything about how it looks!\n\nBe sure to dress warm though - they use the outside seating as the waiting area. There are a few heaters, but it's still chilly out! Thankfully, we only had to wait about 20 minutes.\n\nFor our starer, we ordered the salad with mozzarella, arugula and prosciutto and though the mozzarella was very good, the salad was somehow too salty. The bread and vinegar was delish. I believe my roommate said the vinegar was the best part of the meal - which I agree with. It was an extra $2, but if you're going to order bread, then it's worth it.\n\nI ordered the spaghetti and was disappointed. I prefer angel hair pasta and this was thick pasta with nothing special to the sauce or noodles. Thankfully, we ordered a side of meatballs - those were amazing and really helped the spaghetti. I also tried the gnocchi that my friend ordered and thought it was terrible - very bland. \n\nWe all split the flourless cake for dessert. It was okay - but tasted more like a brownie than a cake. It had a pure coco flavor just lightly sweetened, which was unexpected but good. However, it would have been better if were truly a cake.\n\nSince I live nearby and loved the atmosphere, I'll definitely be back, but hopefully will find something I like besides the meatballs, bread & vinegar.
