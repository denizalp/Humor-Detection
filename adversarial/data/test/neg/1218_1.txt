Good food. Had the pork belly for an appetizer and then their house burger with fries. Only gave it 3 stars because the value just isn't there. $14 burger (bun and patty and fries); $2.50 for a slice of cheddar; and $3 for 2 shiitake mushrooms. Burger is about halfway between a regular size burger and a slider \/ mini so the additions are pretty small. The Mac and 3 Cheese as a $7 side was good, but again, pretty small.
