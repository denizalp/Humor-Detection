I wish this place had more reviews and only 3 stars? C'MON! \n\nI am not big into delis but my husband, son and I have been meeting up for lunch once a week to break up the long work days\/long days at home with a crazy toddler. \nFor us, it's great because the service is always quick so before our little one starts to go a little crazy ;) Plus the location is pretty awesome. We all love the big windows, plenty to look at and in nice weather you can even sit outside. \n\nI am a fan of the gyro and have had it my last 3 visits. My husband always switches it up, usually getting the Thursday special though or a reuben. On our last visit we had the hamburger soup which I really loved. \n\nPortions and price are fine for me, no complaints there. I always leave full and happy so I am one content girl!
