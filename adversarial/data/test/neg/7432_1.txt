Jane is a total lifesaver! When I first visited her in November 2016, my skin was in terrible shape from years of dermatologist-recommended routines (i.e. retin-a & very harsh products) and over the counter products. I have super sensitive skin (diagnosed by Jane), which means these 'normal' routines are the exact opposite of what my skin needed ---hence the AWFUL breakouts, both in pain & in # of breakouts (upwards of 30 zits at one time). In one session, Jane fully evaluated not only my skincare routine but my 'lifestyle' choices (shampoo, diet, laundry detergent, makeup, soaps etc.) and provided me with recommendations for how to heal my skin & change my life. Additionally, Jane followed up with me, without fail, for months after my first session, over the phone \/ skype as I am not local, and provided tweaks for how I could continuously improve. \n\nWithin 3 months, the overwhelming number of breakouts died down to a handful; within 6 months, breakouts became few & far between; within 9 months, the majority of the scars faded & I felt like I finally had my face back!! \n\nJane truly focuses on HEALING the skin ---if I've learned anything from working with her, it's that any product promising a 'quick-fix' is a scam & that true transformation is in the daily commitment to a regular and healthy routine. Jane gave me the best tools any skincare professional has ever provided, and believe me when I say I've seen them all! The 302 line is absolute magic & her patience & kindness is a true blessing to those suffering with severe acne. For obvious reasons, Jane deserves 5 stars from me :)
