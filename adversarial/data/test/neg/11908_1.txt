Another great experience at Thair - this time, I got a haircut with Traci and a hydrating facial with Tatjana. \n\nI really enjoyed my haircut with Traci who was knowledgeable, listened carefully to what I was looking for and made great recommendations for my hair type (long, thick Asian hair) and of course, I love that this salon is organic and encourages use of products that are sustainable. The haircut was excellent and was a great shoulder length bob that I can already tell will be easy to care for and grow out beautifully.\n\nThis was my first time having a facial at Thair and I love the beautiful spa room they have in the back. I was worried it would be noisy but it is surprisingly quiet and they do little thoughtful details including putting on relaxing spa music as well as a diffuser to create that spa feel. My 60 min facial which used Antipodes line included:\n- Cleanse and tone \n- Mud mask during my steam and extractions \n- Sheet mask with a hand and arm scrub\/massage as well as a light shoulder massage \n- Finished with toner and serum\nThe facial was very relaxing and I liked how gentle Tatjana was (I'm an experienced spa goer so I know that rough facials can actually do more damage to your skin than good with the wrong person). The only thing that would have been the cherry on top is I l would have loved hearing about the different products that go on your skin, what they do and why they've been chosen as well as skin care tips - this would have been awesome especially since the Antipodes line was new to me.\n\nOverall, an amazing experience - I love this salon and the ethos of it - everyone is super friendly and knowledgeable!\n\nTip - Traci books up very quickly so make sure you book well in advance!
