Arnold Lim is the reason for this five star rating. Arnold was straightforward, honest, and efficient as we negotiated a price for our brand new GLC several months ago. We spoke with multiple dealers across the country who couldn't even come close to Arnold's price and professionalism. He gave us the best price and was the kindest person we interacted with (win\/win). He kept us updated on the status of our car being built by texting and calling regularly. We wanted to pick up our car today and he came in on his day off to facilitate it!! We also came in with prices we wanted for our extended warranty and he helped us get the price we wanted from the financial people we spoke with today even after they told us they couldn't give us the price we were asking for. He even offered to come to our home and show us how to use the car as there are a lot of features we aren't used to (even for us millennials). We will forever be customers of Mercedes Benz Gilbert because of Arnold.\n\nArnold will make sure you are 100% satisfied with your purchase, the buying process, and the price. Our car is beautiful. THANK YOU ARNOLD!!!\n\n- the Ciens
