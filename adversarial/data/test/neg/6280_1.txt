Last year we bought our bikes from this shop. This was our first non-Wal-Mart bike purchase. We love the bikes. We probably went into the store about 5 times before we actually purchased. They were very helpful and answered all of our questions and helped guide our choices. We were able to try out many of the models we were looking at before buying. I love that I could purchase from a local business. They carry lots of bicycle accessories. We've purchased some accessories from here and some elsewhere due to price. This is also why I've given then 4 stars rather than 5: understandably the prices are a bit higher than some big box stores and online.  They also fix bicycles and do tune ups. When I need a tune-up on the bicycle, you can bet I'm bringing it here. I would totally recommend this shop to anyone who wants to buy a bike.
