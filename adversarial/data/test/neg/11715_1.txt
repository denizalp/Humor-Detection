Will NEVER go back! Hair in my son's pancakes! I showed our waitress and she commented \"thankfully it was the last bite\" I took as insinuating we did it purposely! It was not even his last bite. Been here once before and it was great, I am a very good tipper and tipped the waitress 50%. This time around was horrible. Yes they agreed to comp that plate (which was only a child's plate) I was not interested in getting it comp'd, I wish I had better service on the issue from the place! But you will not get that here especially from waitress Cathy??? I think... older lady with dirty blonde hair. Still left her a good tip as to show her it wasn't about the money! She probably was surprised! Too bad because I take my son to a trampoline place very close to this and he loved going to eat before! Well I will have to find another restaurant to spend my money!
