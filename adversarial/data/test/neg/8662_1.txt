After spending 10 minutes in the drive thru, I leave here with nothing.   The guy at the window was not friendly,  didn't acknowledge me or even great me when he gave me my drink. Then to top it off, my drink was not made correctly. \nSomeone,  please train this guy on how a Starbucks associate should treat their drive thru guest.\nI'll never come back to this one again.  Looking for a Dunkin Donuts now.
