Since I've never heard of Mexican food that would meet my California standards in Chicago, I was trusting the Yelp reviews when I tried Chicago Style Taco. I loved my chicken torta... It was well balanced with shredded chicken, avocado, beans, sour cream, cheese, lettuce and tomato in an excellent soft bun. I asked the woman who served us why Chicago was in the name and she said it was because all the ingredients were fresh. Works for me. My sister wasn't as thrilled with her tacos as I was with my torta, but they were decent. Thank you for the good lunch!
