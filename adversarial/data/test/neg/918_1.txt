I stayed here for 3 nights, I had a good experience, the staff made sure the my hotel room was clean and fully stocked with toiletries, the place is clean, a little expensive as compared to other hotels around, they let me check out at 1 pm versus 11 am for an extra $ 30, I was not impressed with that, other hotels will waive that fee, overall I will stay here again.
