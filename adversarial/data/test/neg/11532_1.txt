We received the worst experience today at this location and we are not coming back again, despite this place used to be our go to place for brunch. \n\nMy husband, my 6 years old daughter and I arrived the restaurant around 145pm today, and while we were waited to be seating, the hostess spoke to us in a rude and loud voice, \" you need to wait behind the door, you cannot block the entrance.\" No smile, like we were criminals. I said to her, but it's very cold and you have plenty of tables. She pushed the door open, said \"you need to wait behind the door.\" no smile and made the face like you are so not welcome in here. The couple behind us had a stroller and they have a baby inside, I felt bad for them because it was minus today in Toronto. It is very cold to wait behind the door. Another group of people heard the conversation and left immediately. After she directed us to our seat, she dropped the menus and Walked away, without any eye contact or saying anything to us. I looked at the seat, there's a wet table clothes left on the seat. I grabbed her attention and showed her the wet table clothes on the seat, she grabbed it and walked away. Without a word to us again. My husband was extremely unpleasant at this point and asked us to leave. I told him we had already pay for the parking and just wanted to grab a brunch and go. Spoke to the manager about the whole experience, indicated her behaviour was very unseen of and unprofessional, her service was inconsistent, because everyone that coming in after us, they are all waiting inside the door and she did not pushed them out like what she did to us. The manager offered us a discount towards the bill, she never show up and say anything to us. We visited this restaurant regularly, at least once a month because my daughter likes the kids meal here. We have never experienced anything like this before and are never going back again
