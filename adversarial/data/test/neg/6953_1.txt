The best part about the Dor Stop was that they didn't make me pay for the half cook unacceptable potato pancakes.\nWe did not accept a free meal but we had the potato pancakes removed after the waitress agreed they looked disgusting and were inedible. \n\nI love DDD so this was at the top of my list.\n\nParking is difficult and hard to come by. It's Potomac Avenue. \nOn my way in someone said \"don't order the pancakes they were terrible and half cooked\" when I asked how everything was inside. Yikes - he wasn't kidding. \nMy pancakes were undercooked and not good. \n\nWe haven't returned. It was definitely a disappointment.
