Attended on of Yvette's fabulous Cosmopolitan Connection business network mixer events. There are always great sponsors like Ocean the Hawaiian Organic Sugar Cane based Vodka...so cool. \n\nThe hotel has a cool rooftop pool feature and good view of the strip. The also have an awesome outside stone fire pit for managing those cool desert night.\n\nThe Spring hill is well managed and the common areas were very clean. I have stayed in Spring Hills in my former career when I spent 170 days a year on the road staying in hotel's weeks at a time. Spring Hill North Shore Pittsburgh has been the only one I have liked until I had a chance to see this Spring Hill. I don't know what the rooms are like but if they are anything like the common areas they are clean and well managed.
