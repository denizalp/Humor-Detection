For two years my husband and I rented a home that was managed by All Points Realty. Bob and his team were a pleasure to work with and were always professional and prompt if any issues ever arose at the property. If you are looking to rent a home I would highly recommend calling All Points to see if they have a property available in the area you want to live. Our rental agreement was clear, concise, and there were no hidden agendas or fine print that later came up during our rental period. The property was spotless when we moved in which showed the expectation All Points has of its owners and tenants. I would highly recommend All Points Realty as a property management\/rental service. I was highly satisfied with our two year experience.
