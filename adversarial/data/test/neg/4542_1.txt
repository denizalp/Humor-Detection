I came here because I needed coffee, and needed to be in this area.\n\nHowever, I would have been better off walking the 2 blocks and just getting Starbucks, which has its flaws, but hands-down better than this.\n\nThe ordering is weird, you can order at the counter (which is not the coffee bar) or sometimes at the coffee bar. \n\nBut the espresso shots - not sure what to say about it, I think my office K-cups tasted better than my $4 latte. \n\nbut the people eating there for breakfast seemed to be enjoying themselves....
