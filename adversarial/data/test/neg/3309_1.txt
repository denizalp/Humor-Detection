Bosa is just a one stop shop for most delicious snack items. Whether it's a freshly prepared delicious donut, a super tasty lunch time sandwich (they have ham and tuna- and you can get it on croissant, bagel, or English muffin), or a breakfast sandwich (which by the way are BOMB!), Bosa delivers. They have the richest and creamiest smoothies, they even have Taro and Boba which is awesome too! I'm an overall fan and can come any time of day too, which is cool because they're open 24hours.
