took a recent trip to Vegas and was excited to try this place out. Unfortunately we never got to. We were seated immediately and introduced to the menu by our server but it was all over at that point. After waiting about 10 minutes Michael the manager came by to introduce himself which I appreciated but that's about all he was doing. We waited an additional 13 minutes totaling  23 minutes and still NO drinks, NO server, I decided to quietly leave and go somewhere else.\n How good the food may be I'll never know but I do know there are many great choices for dining in Vegas to accept less then acceptable service.
