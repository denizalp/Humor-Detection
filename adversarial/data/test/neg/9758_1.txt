This place is okay. Came here for a 21st birthday. Nothing special about it. Service was okay and food was room temp\/almost cold despite the menu stating everything was cooked from scratch. However, it still tasted okay.\nThe DJ kind of sucks, honestly. The music is SO loud and it's obnoxious. Heard the same song played in a span of 15 mins.
