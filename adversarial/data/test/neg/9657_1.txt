I really like this place, and so does my family. I have only eaten in the restaurant once, and I can't really remember it but we almost always order takeout. Their pan-fried noodles are fantastic, especially when the noodles are extra crispy! Their pineaple chicken is so yummy, and the black bean shrimp is DELICIOUS!! Their fried rice is amazing, especially if you get the house fried rice with the pork in it. It also comes with 1 or 2 shrimp on the side. Really, really good. My Dad used to travel to China a lot with work, and says this place is as authentic as it gets in the area.
