I've only been to this location a handful of times, but back in the day I was a huge fan of TCA. The walls aren't nearly as high as the old place, or any of the more central competitors, but there are a ton of walls to choose from. The routes are a lot of fun, and they have a huge bouldering area. It is a very spacious area, including nice and large change rooms. They are a tad short on lockers, though. The space is also very clean.\n\nThis does appear to be a very beginner friendly place.
