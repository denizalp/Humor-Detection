Suzin L has been a staple in my family since before I can remember.  The chocolate is the best I have had - so creamy and melty.  Some of our favorites include: chocolate covered pretzels, chocolate covered oreos, mint melt aways, and just the plain old foil wrapped chocolate (hearts and eggs at Valentine's Day and Easter).  If you have not tried it, please do!  You will not be disappointed!  And now that I live out of the state, I can still enjoy with online ordering :)
