Came in and the atmosphere was great! The front desk greeted me immediately as I walked in with energy and smiling faces! The salon was clean and well organized.  They helped me and directed me where to go and my experience didn't end there.  They greeted me as I walked out and I would recommend this salon in a heartbeat!  They care that you have a great experience and sprinkle it with water and coffee! Loved it!
