I just popped in here to buy a couple things.  The store was neat, clean, and uncrowded.  What impressed me the most, however, was the customer service provided by the cashier.  My cashier clearly had a disability.  As a public teacher for CMS (who has many students with disabilities), it warms my heart when companies provide jobs to people with disabilities.  Furthermore, my cashier was exceptional.  He asked if I found everything; asked if I had a good shopping experience; told me to have a great day.  Thank you, Harris Teeter, for hiring wonderful employees.
