I moved to Arizona in 1974, long time ago!  I saw my first concert here, Kiss at the Coliseum. We don't come to the fair anymore to ride the rides but to see some concerts during Fair time. We like to walk around when the shows are over and ride the only ride i will get on, the Midway ride. Nice view from up there, you can see the whole city!  \nThere is so much to do; concerts, rodeo, rides, exhibits, farm animals, something with cars and mud. Lots of shopping and food.\nNot alot of gluten free options, that  i've seen anyway. \nThis place is a historic landmark. As long as their line up of concerts are something that we are interested in, we will be back this October.
