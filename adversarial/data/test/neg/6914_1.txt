My friends and I actually couldn't decide on a place to eat and spontaneously came to Sushi Samba. We weren't too hungry so didn't get a full dinner. I ordered the pork gyozas (and the kabocha pumpkin pure√© underneath was a really nice touch). The gyozas were realllly really good, I still think about them. I also ordered the green envy rolls (tuna, salmon, asparagus, wasabi pea crust with a lime mayo) and although it was good, it wasn't as outstanding as the gyozas. Unfortunately I did not yelp before going, so did not get to try out the fruity drinks that everybody's raving about (sad face). I did share the chocolate fondue with a friend, and it came with the chocolate already melted with no heat element under it, so we took it as a sign that we had to eat it quickly. The dipping mediums were: coconut marshmallows, Japanese rice crispies, passion fruit cake, chocolate brownie, fruits, and green tea ice cream. Overall, I really liked the surroundings, I did feel like it matched up to the Vegas environment. It was definitely a fun place for dinner before a night out!
