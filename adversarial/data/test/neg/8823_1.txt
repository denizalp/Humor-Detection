Paid my first visit to Island Style today, and will DEFINITELY return! So good! I really needed some korean food, and this really did it. \n\nSplit a combo with the bbq chicken, meat jun, and kalbi, some fried saimin with spam(best way to get it), and the hot rock (dolsot) bibimbap between two people (a steal for around 30 bucks.. PLUS LEFTOVERS!)\n\nThe chicken and kalbi were delicious, and you really didn't even need the dipping sauce that came with them. Moist, savory, and slightly sweet. It was the first time I had ever tried meat jun, and it was great. I happen to love eggs though. \n\nThe bibimbap (you have to get the one in the hot rock\/dolsot style, because you mix it together and press down to get the rice crispy!) was great. Definitely ask for that spicy\/sweet paste to add a couple dollops before you mix it in. Really legit bibimbap. \n\nFried saimin was also good. Great balance of flavors and it was slightly salty and mild. Spam is the real way to get it, you get to experience the saltiness of the spam flavor with the slight sweetness of the cabbage and kamaboko (fish paste cut into strips, the pink and white stuff), and richness of the egg. They gave us a TON of this stuff.\n\nThey also served us boiled peanuts (which were delicious), some kimchi and kimchi style raddish, and some nice palate cleansing broth. \n\nI wish I could have eaten everything. I'm definitely getting the curry or loco moco to go next time.
