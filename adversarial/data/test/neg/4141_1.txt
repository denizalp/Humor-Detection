Called ahead for bike tune up appointment.  I was told it would be ready the next day at 5 PM!  Great I thot! .....I shudda known twas to good to be true! Problems first began when I got there 15 mins after my phone inquiry and was told my beloved 2 wheeler would be ready on TUESDAY!  I told the staff member about my phone call...... he had a chat with the fellow I spoke to earlier .......Now mysterious  within 15 mins, Mr 5pm DOESN'T REMEMBER  the phone call or telling me this info. However the clerk assured me my bicycle would be ready at 5pm tomorrow.  \nLong story short at 7 pm, after numerous phone calls and inquiries, I got my wheels back. \nThere is a distinct lack of communication between both staff and customer.  Unhappy customer I am!
