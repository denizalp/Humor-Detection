Why can't people cook burgers properly.  Medium rare is not fully cooked and dry. Even more importantly, if the burger is split and the server can see it's fully cooked and not the slightest bit pink why serve it? And when did it become to much for a server to ask how is everything? I had to ask three times to get a glass of water. The two stars is because the beer selection was good. But not good enough to go back.
