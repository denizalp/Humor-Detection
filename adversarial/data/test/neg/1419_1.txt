The Venetian was so pretty to look at, seriously. After staying the ARIA we wanted to stay at a classic Vegas resort and we heard great things about the \"Venish\". The resort is beautiful from the outside HUGE and very very Italian. Walking in you feel like you entered a palace, no lie, it is so shiny and opulent with gold accents and Michael Angelo style paintings on the high ceilings. The rooms are pretty, they are very spacious like a small studio apartment; totally live up to the \"all suites\" hype. The rooms are so pretty, they are aesthetically good to look at specially the bathroom, inspiration when I build my master bathroom that's for sure. The hallways are picture worthy, the pools, the fountains; pretty much everything is picture worthy. I feel the Venetian was very confusing to get out pf at first, its designed to keep you inside spending your money. They Venetian has a great shopping center with canals and a painted sky that gives you the illusion that you are out somewhere in Venice. There are tons of shopping options from $$-$$$$$ and food options ranging from a great cafe called Casablanca that has $12 breakfast, yup that is right, a cheap Vegas sit down to the more expensive places. The only reason I took a star off was the cigarette smoke in the lobby omg, the Venetian has a horrible smoke smell in the gambling\/lobby that stained my clothes every time and I just walked through it. I think the smell of cigarette is even in the entrance areas of the shopping section. If possible they should install more vents. Anyway, if you stay here have fun and charge your phone because every where you turn their is a picture to be taken.
