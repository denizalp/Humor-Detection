After honeymooning in Tokyo and Kyoto, I thought that I would never find an authentic melon soda outside of Japan. I was elated to enjoy a Japanese Cream Soda from Uncle Tetsu's Angel Cafe.\n\nI didn't have the opportunity to go inside and\/or enjoy a live show, but ordering from the take-out window was fast. The young lady that took my order was nice. I felt a tad weird, as I was waiting for my order in the middle of the street, but that was easy to get over quickly.\n\nThe Cream Soda was fantastic, and I was so glad to find an authentic Japanese melon soda on this side of the pond!
