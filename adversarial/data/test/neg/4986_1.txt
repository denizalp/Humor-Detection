From start to finish it was amazing.  Shannon \"Brickhouse\" was exceptional.  He was flawless.  Even the manager came by to make sure everything was perfect. The food was delicious, portion sizes were a lot more than we anticipated (not a bad thing ever), and my favorite was the shrimp and bacon Mac N Cheese. yummmm. Ambiance was great. We would definitely be back.
