This location is a rip off. They overcharged, do not give you as much food. I bought a whole bread pudding and got half for 3.99 the same as everyone else pays for. It was given to me with no frosting and simply flattened out on a plate because they butchered not giving me the whole piece.  Not only did I get half of the bread pudding, they charged 6.99 for just a sandwich when all the other locations give you a small salad on top of it. What was icing on the cake was the manager acted like he was doing me a favor by giving me the small salad when I complained. DO NOT GO HERE. There are better locations. I will post my pictures so you can see how disgusting and cheap this location is. Ugh.
