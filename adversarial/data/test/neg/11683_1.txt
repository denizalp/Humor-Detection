Not sure why this has so many bad reviews. I've been here twice and have had a good experience both times.\n\nI always used to walk past this place in the mall but never went in. A few months ago, I tried this place out for the first time. All my food was great, and the staff was friendly. The second time, it was also good, yet the table I found was unclean and it seemed that the staff had not gotten around to busing it yet.\n\nGood food, friendly staff, plenty of seats. I'll definitely be back.
