Always busy, yet the lines move very fast, and I can find everything I need. Good selection of wine and beer singles. The layout is great, and I love the fact that it stays open until 10pm on Friday and Saturday nights. It is not the biggest LCBO but the best in terms of selection and cashiers that keep the lines moving when its very busy.
