I have a serious addiction to this place and always look forward to working at Terminal 1 do I can visit.  \n\nThe wraps are really decent and there is a variety of choices.  It's difficult to choose a favourite. \n\nBooster bakes are worth a try..  \n\nMostly here for the smoothies of course..  I will either choose 'Bananas a-whey' or 'Pomegranate punch'.\n\nLimited to salads and grains..  Maybe it differs from locations? \n\nSome people say it's not worth the money to pay that much for a smoothie but I beg to differ.  \n\nService for this location is relatively fast and consistent.  I would have never discovered Booster Juice if it weren't for this location at work.
