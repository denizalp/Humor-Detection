I've been coming to these guys for years now, with all my cars + girlfriend and cousin's cars.  They're just a good honest place, never rip you off.  They tell it like it is, recommend service and help you out.  I've tried out many places in town and these guys are the best.  Chris is the shop manager and if you can chat with him he's a straight shooter.
