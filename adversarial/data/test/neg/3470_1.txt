Journeyed to Glendale to see the lights earlier this week. Decided to try this place and see what the fuss is all about. They opened at 5 so we waited out front until they opened. I am sure glad we did as the line grew and went down the block. \n\nWell the service was great. Fried Calamari and pizza was really good. The chicken marsala was a bit salty for me, but was decent anyway. The wife had had a chicken and pasta dish which she enjoyed. My mother inlaw(Italian from jersey) actually loved the linguini and clam sauce. \n\nBottom line is great pizza and outstanding service by Michelle.
