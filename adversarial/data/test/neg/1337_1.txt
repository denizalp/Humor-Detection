We had the raw beef Pho noodles. Their large is the equivalent of what a medium would be. Broth could be more flavourful, as it tasted a little watered down. Vietnamese Shrimp spring rolls were decent considering the price. \nThe Viet coffee my friend has was too small, sour and lukewarm. Have had better elsewhere. Overall, decent place to satisfy pho cravings.
