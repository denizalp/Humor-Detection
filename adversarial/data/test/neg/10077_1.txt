Went here for supper and so glad we did.  Blackberry bourbon lemonade was a treat.  The fried chicken was delicious!  Chicken was juicy and skin was tasty.  I was a little apprehensive to try the kale salad but again I was pleasantly surprised.  The cornbread croutons were a great ingredient to the salad.  If I had more time that evening I would have tried the peach cobbler.  So if you are considering dessert and cobbler is a favorite then be sure to put your order in during your entree.  It takes 25 minutes for the cobbler.  I would definitely visit the Yardbird again.
