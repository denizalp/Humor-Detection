We really enjoyed our dining experience at Cyprus Grill.  Our entrees consisted of moussaka and the sheftalia dinner (Greek meatballs).  Both were large portions and they were excellent!  The moussaka was very tall - loaded with a good balance of meat and vegetables.  The eggplant and zucchini were both tender, but not mushy, and the potatoes had a nice crunch.  We were impressed with the selections on the children's menu, as well.  We have a picky eater, and there were three good options on the menu for her to enjoy:  pasta, chicken fingers, quesadillas.  This is a great family restaurant with something for everyone.  We were dining in on a busy Friday night, almost every table was occupied, but never did we feel ignored.  Great food, great staff and great Greek fries - Opa!!
