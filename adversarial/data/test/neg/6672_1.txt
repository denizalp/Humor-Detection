Very expensive for Diner Food, but the portions were huge.  They do not recommend you to share, but it is a good idea to share.  Their deserts looked magnificent, but we did not get a chance to try because we threw out too much food that we could not eat because of the portion sizes.\n\nAgain, if you do not live in Las Vegas and your staying in a hotel, share your food with one or two people.
