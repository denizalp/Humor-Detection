I needed my 3 year old carpet cleaned for the first time.  Decided to go with Noble after noticing consistently excellent reviews on Yelp.  I'm  GLAD I did!!!!!!  After the initial phone call,  I was about to get an appointment 4 days later.  They arrived on time and finished about 2 hours later.  My carpet looks, feels and smell like brand new!!!!  I highly recommend Noble Carpet Cleaners and look forward to using them next year!!!!
