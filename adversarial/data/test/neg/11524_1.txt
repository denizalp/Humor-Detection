I really liked this place. Everything was so neat and clean and in order. The dining area is small and quiet. I got a boba drink and a few donuts. I like the glaze they use here as it's not too sugary. The donuts were fresh and tasty. The lady working was very polite and friendly. Will come again with my family.
