I had a gift certificate so I decided to try this place. SO HAPPY I DID! \nWOW!! AMAZING!! \nTheir specialty pizza with chicken, artichoke hearts, tomatos, and black olives is EXCELLENT! Their garlic knots are beyond yummy and their salads are HUGE and super fresh!\nThe girl who answered the phone was so sweet and very knowledgeable about the menu items. Delivery was within the time they said and the delivery guy was nice. I gave him and extra great tip for the super service!\nThis is now my go-to pizza place!!
