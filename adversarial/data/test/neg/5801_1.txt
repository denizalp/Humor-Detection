After a tasty dinner at the Earl of Sandwich I had to have something sweet and behold I stumbled upon a Ben and Jerry's on the way to the car. My man graciously took me by the hand and offered to buy me some ice cream (he's so freaking cool). There were so many great flavors to choose from but I finally chose the Late Night Snack (vanilla, caramel, fudge covered pretzel and potato chip clusters) in a waffle cone bowl (I tend to be a bit messy). It was love at first bite...sweet and salty....my favorite. However...tasty ice cream on the strip costs ($15+ for ice cream for me and my man). I will be back if I am in the area. The girls on staff were really nice and helpful as well :)
