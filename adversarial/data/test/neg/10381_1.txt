I use to work at Hy's before they moved to their current location. Yes, that was a while ago.  Back in the day it was the place to be seen and the service and quality was top notch. I visit the new location from time to time for the memories and I can tell you, it isn't what it used to be.  First impression is good, but once you sit at your table it goes downhill fast.  It's still a good steak, but not the best in town. they wait on you like it should be YOUR pleasure and nothing is done with pride. I don't want to write anymore as it requires too much negativity to continue.  It's not a totally disappointment but it's not what it used to be.
