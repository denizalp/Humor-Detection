My Indie Coffee Passport exploration to \"The Black Canary\" was the biggest **HIT*** to date!  Oddly though- not because of the coffee, the seating... or the setup:  But because of the chance meeting with some charming strangers.

Oddly though- not because of the coffee, the seating... or the setup:  But because of the chance meeting with some charming strangers.  It was a reminder that at the end of the day.... whatever frothy, flowery picture is detailed on theces always comes down to good PEOPLE!\n \nSItting in \"VIA-Train\" like proximity across from an attractive outgoing duo, I made a conscious decision to put my I-phone DOWN for once and make a joke about the face-to-face seating arrangement.  And just like that we were off and running!  Chitchatting about venues in Toronto, projects on the do, his daughters, her Brazilian background, how cool the indie passport is... and life... complete with witty banter in between.  It was such fun to meet a fellow extrovert who was excited to connect across a vintage metal coffee table, while the rest of the cafe was plugged into headphones and free WIFI.  \n \nBut the moment was sealed-and-delievered with the man stood up and offered to get us all water... only to return with a $6 gift card to the cafe each for myself and for his girlfriend!!  He said the chat had been lovely, and that I should come back and treat myself sometime.  WOW!!   Unexpected- ! Unnecessary-! Unreal!  And 100% MAGNIFICENT!  A small gesture in the grand cosmic sense... it makes your day, your week, and racks up a BUNCH of points in the \"humanity is wonderful\" ledger.  Sometimes the little experiences one has with strangers are the most satisfying, simply because they come with no strings attached.  Life is good.\n \nWill this happen to you if you go to the Black Canary?  I can't guarantee that...  But you certainly CAN make that **magic** happen for someone else!  And it will only cost you six bucks and 20 min of your time.  Pay it forward! You only live once!  I love this CITY!
