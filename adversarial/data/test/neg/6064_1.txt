First of all, I want to say this: Jason and Katie ROCK!!!! Their customer service is unparalleled. They are always friendly and fast, plus they make amazing coffee drinks. The Kickapoo coffee they serve is absolutely delish, and their scones are unbeatable -- best ones I've ever had. The coffee in our UW building is AWFUL, so my coworkers and I walk 1.5 blocks to go here instead -- it's that good! Go now! :-)
