At the time of this review, Hop Farm is still in the development stages. They do not pour by the pint, serve food, or even have seating yet; though, I was assured that these are currently being addressed. What does Hop Farm have? 1) Great, FRESH beer. 2) Growlers (for sale) to transport this great beer if you don't have one already. (As well as some other merchandise). 3) A team which is enthusiastic about beer. 4) And a following of beer aficionados who love beer which makes Hop Farm an awesome place to fill up a growler and chat with others relishing the prospering craft beer scene which is locally brewing.
