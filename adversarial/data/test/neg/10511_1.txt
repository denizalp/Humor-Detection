I definitely relate to Jessica's experience. Owner is deceitful & unreliable. I purchased a bridesmaid dress here & was way overcharged on the original alterations quote, stood up for a fitting & made to feel like it was my mother & I who got the date wrong. She also took the liberty of adding an extra charge to our credit card without consent (luckily voided by the credit card company). This was several years ago but what reminded me of the experience was the owner's recent request to be Linkedin friends! She may have forgotten the fiasco but I certainly have not. Most stressful shopping experience of my life.
