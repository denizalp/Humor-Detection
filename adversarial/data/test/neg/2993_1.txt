I went to Flannerys pub recently and ordered a steak...I asked for it to be cooked medium...and when we got our food, the waitress walked away before asking me to cut into my steak and make sure it was cooked to my liking and it was definitely over cooked and dry...and I should have sent it back but our waitress didn't come back in a short amount of time, and I was hungry....im not hard to please as long as my order is correct...so I will go back there...but ill never order a steak ever again...
