Damn I love this Korean supermarket just two blocks away.  And the great thing about this super market is the juicy pussy clams.  The Korean bbq is pricey.  I can understand its Korean bbq.  but still the prices for the rest of the food are pretty fair.  I always come back for more.  And the soju is the cheapest place I can afford to buy haha.  I love Greenland super market.
