I came here when it was Belz, but I see it's been all made-over like? Oh. Well.... Fine. Have it your way then, Belz. \n\nThis place is (was?) ok, deals are to be had. It's not like one of those malls where you're like \"uhh, isn't this meant to be an outlet? where the deals at?\", it's legit deal-filled.\n\nHowever I do think Belz is a more memorable name. So I'm going to call it Belz.
