My wife and I have been back two more times and have sat in the bar.  We really do like the atmosphere of this place and its close to our house.  We were hoping our first visit was just on a bad night. Here is an update:\n\nThe drinks, salads and apps are always really good.  \n\nBoth times, my wife ordered her petite fillet \"butterflied\" to make it easy for the \"grill master\" to get it to medium well.  The fillet now comes well done and tough. \n\nI ordered the rib-eye both times medium rare and both times it came rare.\n\nWe are never ordering steaks here again.  3 strikes and your out.  We are only going back for drinks and apps in the lounge.   I also question the 35 days dry aged beef...  it sure does not taste like other places.\n\nIt blows my mind that this is suppose to be a high end steakhouse and they cannot cook a steak!  We recently went to \"The Broiler\" at Boulder Station (another station property) before a show at the Railhead.  1\/2 the price and they have a chef that knows how to cook steaks to temperature.
