I've never had a Thai style massage.  It's definitely not what I expected, but a great experience nonetheless. Go in with something comfy, as you won't be changing out of anything. This massage focuses on stretching as much as massaging. The pricing is VERY reasonable. The only thing I found odd was the room layout. It has 6 tables, and was more of a community room rather than individual rooms. The staff was very friendly. It would have been 5 stars but it can be distracting hearing another guest come in halfway through your massage. I will be back.
