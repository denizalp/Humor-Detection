I cannot say enough wonderful things about Deacon and Sarah!  They are such a blast to hang out with and they make the entire photography experience so much more positive and fun!  Deacon and Sarah are one of the highlights of our wedding day, and the images they were able to capture are amazing beyond words!\n\nI was a little worried going in to it because my husband intensely dislikes having his picture taken, but Deacon was so excited that it helped us to relax and have fun at our shoot at the Pinball Museum.  I really recommend the engagement shoot just so you get used to being in front of the camera, remembering to smile, and the gentle guidance offered by your photographer.  When it came time for photos on the wedding day, it was like we were all old friends.  I could not be happier with our choice in photographers and wholeheartedly recommend Deacon to anyone and everyone.
