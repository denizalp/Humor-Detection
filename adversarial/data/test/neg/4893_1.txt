Fantastic!!  Can't say enough about Jazz and her facials.  She is the best! and trust me, I have traveled the valley in search of a great skin care coach.  In fact, I travel about 18 miles one way just to see her - she is worth it!  Very fair pricing, an overall great experience.  My skin has never looked better and I appreciate her approach and technique.  You are not rushed and she takes special care to recommend what would be best for your skin.   Jazz also doesn't try to push products or other procedures not needed.  I would recommend her to everyone without hesitation.
