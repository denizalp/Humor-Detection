This was my first time here, my hubby was here before and raved about it to me. This time he said it didn't taste so great and I didn't think it was good at all. I went right before lunch rush it wasn't very busy and the food came quickly. My burrito didn't taste like my meat was seasoned at all and wasn't very big for the price. That would be my only complaint.
