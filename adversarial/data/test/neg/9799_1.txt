1st time at this spot visiting from San Diego, wanted to taste the local flavor from Phoenix. I had the Cobb salad and a Passion Fruit Ale. The Cobb salad was just as the previous Yelpers had said great atmosphere and good music. The waitress was very good and had recommendations, but my mouth was set on the Cobb based on the pictures and the previous comments. My friend had the Chicken Coronado with sourdough and he ate the whole thing with side of salad. Both enjoyable. Worth a visit if you just want to chill in the hot evenings and have a light meal with a beer in Phoenix.
