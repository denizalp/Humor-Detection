This very quaint and ideally located in Lachine away from all the  foodie hipsters was just good. I ordered the Gazpatcho to start which was probably the best thing i had. My main dish was the grilled chicken breast in a green Mole sauce with fried black beans and nicely seasoned rice. The service was very good!\n\nWhile Carlos and Pepes it is NOT...it failed to blow me away. I am pretty sure there are better mexican restos to explore in the city but that being said there was nothing bad that stood out....well maybe the $7 lattes!
