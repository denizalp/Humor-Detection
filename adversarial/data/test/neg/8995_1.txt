Our server Kristen was very nice and she deserves the 3 stars. I was ver disappointed to find out after we ordered that they did not have any prime rib, which is why I come here, at 615pm on a weekend. I asked Kristen if there was anything close to prime rib and she suggested ribeye.  My ribeye had more fat that I desired on it.  The food was also brought to us less than 5 min after our salads were delivered.  This made the temperature of our food cold by the time we finished our salads. \nUnfortunately I will not be returning to this location.
