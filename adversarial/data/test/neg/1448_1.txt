First time here, came 3 times to still see the dumpster in front (renovating). Wow, quite a menu of things here! There are daily specials and lunch specials. I ordered the fermented bean paste soup with bibimbap special. Very tangy and tasty. Got a freshly fried veggie jeon (pancake) which was still hot and crispy at the ends. Banchan was good. A very filling meal but so happy to have Korean food for a change. Definitely come with a group if you want to try more things or get Korean BBQ!
