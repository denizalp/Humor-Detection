Went there on a Saturday in late April... pretty dead. Drinks were okay, but 1 bartender accused my friend of only giving him a $5 instead of a $20 so didn't want to give her change. Even though her drink cost more than $5 so it didn't make sense. He eventually apologized and gave her the right change. \n\nAsked the DJ if he would play something other than EDM music even that our group of 20 were the only ones there... nope... he almost scoffed at us. Sounds like this place is better in the summer with the patio. The drinks were good, had their Old Fashioned. \n\nWill have to come back and visit.
