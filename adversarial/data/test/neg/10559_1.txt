This place is friendly and they are really nice, they will even do pickup and drop off. What I was not impressed by was that we took our vehicle in to fix the AC, and they charged us $225 to diagnose the problem. I have NO issue with that, as it cost shop time to do that. The issue I had is that after paying $225 to diagnose the problem they said it would cost $1100-$1400 and they said that the $1400 is worse case scenario and they hope it doesn't come to that. Well they called me and said they found anther issue with AC and that the total cost if now $1750. Listen I know stuff comes up and things happen, however when you charge someone to diagnose the problem, then you give them a range you need to stick to it. Again I understand, they have to make money but it just left a sour taste. What is the point it paying the diagnosis fee, and getting a range quote if they just bill you whatever.\n\n** update **\nNo I have the right company, it was a few months back that you did the service. If you charge to diagnose, then it means you take it apart to see the problem. Then if you give a range to a customer , you then you need to stick within the range, not charge more than the range. It means you did not diagnose it right and should eat the difference. You can still charge the high end of the range, but not more. If you didn't take it apart to find the problem, then I understand that it can be more. However I paid $225 for you to figure out the problem. You then gave me a range, high and low and regardless of the range you gave me, you charged me more. Listen it is what it is, I don't want to argue with you, as you guys are very-nice and  polite. It just gives me a sour taste for your company.
