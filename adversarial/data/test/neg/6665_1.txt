We have used Partners for two of our dogs when they were puppies, a yellow lab and a goldendoodle. Each time after the two week training course they came back calmer, attentive and more obedient.  Partners is not the cheapest option but if you commit to the expense and the follow up training sessions, you will have a well adjusted pet for your family.
