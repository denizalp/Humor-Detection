Went during my lunch break, got 10 piece chicken nuggets and they were completely burned.\nLooked like the got re-heated 5 times, so bad it was inedible. Very disgusting, they're lucky I only have a 30 minute lunch and don't have time to drive up there to show them this crap. Definitely last time I go and eat at this location.
