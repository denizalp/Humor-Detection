All I can say is, stop wasting time with Bids.  Larry's price was fantastic. And his son Corey installed my new blinds efficiently and flawlessly.   I will be using them on all my window treatment projects moving forward.\n\nIt is refreshing to see a vendor, in a frenzy and frothy market, to be so punctual and customer service oriented.  Most vendors are late or never call back. Kudos to you Mr. Black!\n \nThe final product is wonderful.
