Just took a day off work to get an oil change. I used online appointment to get a 7:30 am slot and received my email confirmation. I later called the toll free number to confirm and make sure they knew it was synthetic oil change so there would be no mix ups. Got up early drove the 30 minutes to the shop only to find out they did not receive my appointment request. They said they would need my car for a while and that they tried to call me. Email would have worked better as I don't get all of my calls and it was an online appointment. Drove the 30 minutes home. Just purchased a set of tires for $741 a couple of weeks ago and have four drivers and cars in household. Will definitely never go there.
