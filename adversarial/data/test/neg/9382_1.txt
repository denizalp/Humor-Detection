Before signing up with Molly Maid of West Glendale\/Avondale ask Jay (the franchise owner) what happens If you find your house flooded when his ladies have been left alone to do their cleaning.  Last July I purchased a house that was to be rented.  The ladies were allowed to be left alone to do their cleaning.  When my son returned later in the evening to make sure the house was locked up, he found that for some strange reason one of the toilet tanks was mysteriously cracked from the side and continued under.  Over two thirds of the house was flooded causing a clean-up and ultimately replacement of carpet, etc. that amounted to over $20,000 in damages.  Jay and his ladies told me they knew nothing about it.  Since we did have insurance, I only had to pay the $1,000 deductable.  When I placed this review on Jay's website, he has failed to post it.  So, BUYER BEWARE!!!!
