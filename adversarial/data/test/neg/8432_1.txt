tried going here on new years day.  was met with \"closed\" disappointment,  but i should have known better.  i'm glad i went back as this was my 1st trip to steves, tho surely not my last.  i took  picture of the delicious  aztec mocha .... a big cup of love as my roommate said.  and the breakfast brioche was tasty.  plus a snickerdoodle ... not a bad way to start your sunday.  the staff were really friendly and i'm sure could hold court on any conversation.  the music was laid back and loud enough to enjoy and still soft enough to speak to one another.  in a nutshell, it's always fun to find a cool coffee shop, and this one goes down as one of the coolest.  i'm guessing i am late to this discovery....  what has kept me away?  might make it a staple from now on.
