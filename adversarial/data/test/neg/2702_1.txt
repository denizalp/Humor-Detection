If you are looking for someone to do your floors, you can stop searching because you have found Travis, Lisa and the crew at Affordable Flooring. \n\nThey turned my 1800 sq ft 2 story builder grade linoleum and carpet nightmare into dream floors for a price I could not have found elsewhere. Not to mention the demo and install of the luxury vinyl planks, carpet and an entire house of new baseboards only took 3 non-intrusive days! (It took my picky self longer to decide what I wanted!)\n\nI couldn't be happier with their work, their prices and the finished product! \n\nThank you guys!!
