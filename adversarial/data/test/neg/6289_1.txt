I had a big rust spot in the upper corner above my windshield.  Mike and his staff did an excellent job repairing it within the estimated range quoted.  It's so good, you wouldn't even know it had been repaired.  I appreciated Mike's professionalism and the cleanliness of the shop.  I refer everyone in the area to Custom Color & Collision
