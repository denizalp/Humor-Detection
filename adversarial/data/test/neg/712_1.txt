Stayed here on NYE it was nice with free valet parking. The hotel is a good addition to fremont area.The hotel elevators were a bit weird down arrow goes up and up goes down.kinda strange the rooms were nice and comfortable beds the bathrooms were large with showers not bath tub. Rooms need to have an ipod dock other than that it was a great stay. It has an old Vegas feel but definately a new fresh feel.Staff was friendly and I would recommend
