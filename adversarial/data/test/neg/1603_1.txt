Our personable server, Jeff, not only welcomed us after a crazy afternoon at Daylight (needless to say, we were fairly intoxicated), but he also made us feel at home.  Very knowledgeable and flexible with menu options. Thanks to the Chef too!\n\nYou will never have been chips than Border Grill's chips!
