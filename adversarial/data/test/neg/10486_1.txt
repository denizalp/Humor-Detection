I've had Cheesecake Factory many times and each time I think the food is average. It's way overpriced for the quality served. Today I got the fish tacos, $15. The presentation looks great but the I could taste everything but the fish. The fish was unfortunately bland. I've had better for a lot cheaper at food trucks. I think everything on the menu is way overpriced and there are just way too many items to choose from. \n\nI think the cheesecakes are worth the money, they are delicious, but the actual food is really not. I'd enjoy the experience more if it wasn't so pricey. I usually don't dine here but a friend of mine wanted to for the cheesecake. \n\nThe service is so so. Our waiter smelt of cigarettes which was a super buzz kill and really unappealing because we were about to eat. He came and went really quickly just to take our orders and serve the food but we never got a refill. We hardly saw him. I'd also like to mention that the floor is always slippery at every Cheesecake Factory I've ever been too and this one is no exception. Maybe it's the wax they use but they should reconsider this as it is prone to lead to accidents and injury. \n\nProbably would only come back for dessert but nothing else.
