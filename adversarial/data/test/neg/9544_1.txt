Nice and clean doesn't always mean competent. I gave them a chance before posting this publicly hoping they would do the right thing. My dog was sick and I let them know we are on a fixed income of 22,000 dollars a year. The vet insisted she had allergies and wanted to do expensive allergy testing including telling me her dog had allergies. I was told they were the only ones who had one of the medications she needed and I was getting the last pills they had. I requested that I get the paper prescriptions so I could fill them somewhere else which was less expensive. They gave me 2 of the 4 medications so I was able to fill 2 of them for much less. They provided the shampoo for me which I could have gotten online at half the cost. My dog as long as she was on the medication seemed to be getting better but I had to bring her back and again the Dr. insisted she had allergies again telling us about her dog basically the 2nd visit was a repeat of the first. I even brought my other dog for an ear infection who was also given the same diagnosis allergies.I continued to watch my dog Lily get sicker and sicker my husband who has cancer sacrificed going to the doctor so we could afford a vet visit. My kids came to town and saw Lily and told me I should put her down she was so sick she couldn't walk. My husband saw how upset and sick this was making me and said we should bring her somewhere else and we did, upon looking at Lily the new vet immediately told me what was wrong with her watching her come back to life after watching her suffer for almost two years was incredible. I left a message for West flamingo animal shelter hoping they would do the right thing after I spent hundreds on a wrong diagnosis their response was they told me lily had a thyroid problem the only reason they even knew this was because I told them what the new Doctors diagnosis was. It was never mentioned to me only allergies and the expensive test they wanted to run. I would never let my dog be sickle that if they had ever suggested thyroid testing I would have done it.So in the nicest way possible they have lied about the treatment they gave Lily and aren't willing to see her crediting back the money I paid for the misdiagnosis. the medicine Lily needs is pennies a pill I have the bloodworm to show it. But they are willing to let my poor dog die. If anybody wants further info of how they made my dog sick please contact me my name is Donna tdwaldeck at gmail Another money hungry business, I try to not write negative reviews because I don't want to hurt anyones business over an opinion or it just could have been a bad day. But this affects health and they would rather see an animal die then fix the problem which would cost them 0 to fix their mistake.
