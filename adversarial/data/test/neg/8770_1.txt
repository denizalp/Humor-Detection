So many good things to say!\nGREAT customer service. Amazing craftsmanship. Humbled and Family-owned. Unique creations and custom fabrication. \nYou get what you pay for. \nThose who are interested, please do not try to compare the furniture you're seeking from Porter Barnwood to any prefab furniture. It's not comparable.
