I called to get some information on the clinic. The lady who answered was very professional and helpful. I was super impressed! She answered all of my questions about the clinic and had information ready before I asked to make an appointment. I am a new rabbit owner and JC made me feel really comfortable about becoming a client to the practice. I can't wait to meet the other staff!
