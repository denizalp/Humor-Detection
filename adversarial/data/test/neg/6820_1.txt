I recommend this place to everyone.  The owner is very friendly, and is very good at her job.  Janice one of the groomers is great with my pug.  My pug's anal glands need to be done almost every month, and Janice does a great job.  She always gets her in right away, and my pug loves her.  It you want to take your dog to a place where they get great treatment, I think you'll be pleased with Doggie Doos.
