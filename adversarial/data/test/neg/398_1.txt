Tutti Frutti has set a high bar for all of these other crappy frozen yogurt places that have been popping up recently.\n\n1. The staff is super friendly.  They are nice to talk to and always pleasant, whether you're an adult or a kid.\n2. They are great with offering samples.\n3. Their flavors are delicious (I love cheese cake - yum) and they have an excellent selection of fruit toppings that are fresh (most other places fall short here).\n4. They have deals, which most other places don't.  \n5. They have great hours and a convenient location to \"swing by.\"\n6. It's clean and the atmosphere is great, whether you're in or outdoors.
