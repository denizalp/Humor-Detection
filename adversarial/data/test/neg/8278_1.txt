My family just moved to this area & my son needed a haircut. Pro Cuts is literally 3 minutes away from my house so I figured why not call them up to see if I could get my son in. Ashley answered the phone and told me to come right over as they had a spot for a walk in. We got there within 10 minutes & Abner did his cut for him. I must say that I am impressed. He took his time & didn't rush through his cut. My pet peeve is when barbers push his hairline back instead of just outlining it. This barbers taper was pretty nice and well manicured. Looks like we'll be coming back here again really soon. Next time i'll bring my 4 year old as well. I watched the others exit with their fresh cuts & ive gotta say that these are some very skilled & solid barbers here. The only downer I really have is that I'm use to my 13 year old's cut being $15 & my 4 year old's cut being $12 in Cali. They charge $21 here for adults and kids the same Im guessing...shrugz ..so that means i'm going from $27 to $42 for both o_O Aside from that I like his cut tho.
