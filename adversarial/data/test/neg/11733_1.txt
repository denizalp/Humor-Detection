We waited about 20 minutes at the table and no one would help us but one did was the shining light, Cody. He was so sorry about the wait and we felt relieved! :) He was so outstanding and gave us a discount for the food too! The food and Cody were excellent! Btw, the waitress who has tattoos all over her body could help us but she didn't WANT TO- we were mad and almost leave the restaurant but he saved it... thank him.
