My car broke down in Pittsburgh last week and our first call was to Day Audi. The service could not have been better. Susan and Justin got the car in immediately and inspected. They worked hard to get the part express shipped so the car would be done ASAP. Susan communicated all changes with me and they cheerfully set me up with a rental car. If I had to break down anywhere, I was grateful to be near Imports by Day Audi.
