I've frequented Bookman's for many years. First on visits to Tucson. Then Mesa. Now Phoenix. The stores have varying layouts. They seem to take different items in trade and have different pricing for trade and merchandise. Some have more activities. But they share a common struggle. The need to evolve as the world goes digital. \n\nWe've noted some major changes over time. A shift away from books as physical books fade away, to CD's and DVD's only to see them fade, to video games, to musical instruments, to electronics and to even more random trade items to survive. Even exercise equipment in Tucson. Trade value has become a little less generous, particularly on books, and pricing of merchandise has become a little more aggressive. Clearly an attempt to maintain profit margins. So far, so good, with the transition. Let's hope they're successful.\n\nThe store itself remains a lot of fun. Sometimes you get lucky, sometimes you don't. Large selections in adult books, kid's books, CD's, DVD's, video games and musical instruments, as well as the random poster, puzzle and collectible.
