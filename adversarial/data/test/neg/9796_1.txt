Here's Maddi again with a review...Well, given that this is my very first time camping, purchasing a trailer, and obtaining a Thousand trail membership, the experience was OK.  Why just \"ok\" well, we came into the park with our trailer really late that night, so we couldn't the see the spaces on where exactly to park, so we just parked and figured that in the morning, we would move the trailer.  Of course, in the morning there was a guy that walked up to us as we where trying to unhook\/hook the trailer from our SUV, who didn't identify himself, all that he said was \"site\".  I later found out that his name was 'Alan' from a board I seen with workers names on it and he was a park ranger ( I guess).  He kept going on and on and on about how we weren't \"correctly\" in the parking spot.  Which we already knew, and we were going to move. As he walked away, I noticed a radio in his back pocket.  So, I though well, MAYBE he works for the park...? If \"Alan\" would've properly identified himself, and stopped all of his jaw-jacking, then MAYBE I would have given this park four stars.  I understand all of the rules and what not ok I get that, but there's a way to approach people and at least identify yourself if you are an employee.  No name badge was visible, he had on a navy polo shirt, black pants and a dark hat with no sign of the Thousand Trails logo.  Since I have a membership to Thousand Trails, I will have to return, but I will make sure that we park in the back and not towards that front by the ranger station.\n\n--Maddi
