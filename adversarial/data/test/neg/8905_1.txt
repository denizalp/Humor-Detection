Just moved to LaGrange and wanted to give this a try. We really liked it, the taco pizza is like my mom's taco pie with pizza crust, It was delicious! And the boneless wings were really good too, we tried mild and sweet BBQ and liked them both, though the mild was a little hotter than I expected it still tasted yummy. Friendly and fast service but it is a little pricier than some chain pizza places. It was $45 for two mediums and an order of wings. So we won't be ordering frequently because of that reason only. Otherwise we love it and recommended it!
