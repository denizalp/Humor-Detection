I guess I'm used to the PPP sauce and stringy\/meling cheese!  \n\nThis place was clean, had teenagers at the register and they were very friendly and courteous.  Service was also quick and even had some stickers for the kiddos to stay occupied as we waited.\n\nFood: The dough tastes like an earthy wheat nutty flavor.  It was good and the kids actually ate the ends from the pizza.  Wish we had sauce for dipping.  The cheese was not melty, we don't live far, so it was still warm but I guess I was hoping for a sticky cheese falling off the pizza with a little sauce coming off the sides as I took a bite.....nope, the pizza lacked a bit of sauce and some additional flavor would've been great like salt or oregano or tomatoe.  Pepperoni was super thin, like we could see through it, would've liked a little more of that as well.\n\nThe kids were excited to try \"healthy pizza\" and we had the special with a coupon, so less than $20 for a large 2topping with a side salad.  Pizza is meant to be eaten the unhealthy way though!
