My boyfriend and I often visit Flemings! We absolutely LOVE the happy hour! Their happy is nightly until 7p! They have drink specials, and great appetizers to choose from.  I always order a Debonair Martini extra dirty with blue cheese olives, and my boyfriend goes for jack on the rocks. We have tried all of the happy hour appetizers (there are five to choose from for $5 each!) We really enjoy the tenderloin carpaccio, baked brie, and sweet chile calamari. And be sure to order the bread basket- fresh baked bread served with both a gorgonzola chardonnay butter and a sun-dried tomato butter.
