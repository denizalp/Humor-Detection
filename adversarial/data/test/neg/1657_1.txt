I will certainly use this business again! We took an iPhone in for a broken glass and he quickly replaced the shattered screen and was absolutely friendly and professional.  He told us it would take about a half hour and we came back within 15mins. and he was all done!  Great customer service and let us know if we had any problems to come back in and he would check it out again.   \nGlad we found this place, I was a little hesitant to take the iPhone to a non-Apple store but I would certainly go back.
