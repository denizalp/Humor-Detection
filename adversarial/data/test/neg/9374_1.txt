Josh, our salesman, made the experience as stress-free as possible. He was knowledgable and funny. Mattress was delivered for free, and the delivery process went great! We've only slept on the bed one night, so I can't comment on the bed itself. I will say that the company policy of allowing you to try to bed for 120 days with free exchange helped me feel comfortable with my purchase; knowing that if it's not comfortable or doesn't suit our needs we can exchange with no restocking fee. Also, they said they price match for the first 30 days after purchase, so that also eased my mind. I didn't feel I was getting swindled into anything. \nThanks, Josh!
