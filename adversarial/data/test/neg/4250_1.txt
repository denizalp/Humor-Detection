I've always frequented this F&E cause its close to my house. I usually stop here for a quick meal after work. The employees are always friendly and the store is clean. Last time I was there I dropped a container of soup on the floor and it busted open. I let the guy working know and he was really cool about it. Said it coulda happened to anyone. Not too much else to say. Oh and they are now open 24\/7 yeah!
