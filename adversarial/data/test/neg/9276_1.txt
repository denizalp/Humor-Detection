It took me months to finally decide where to cut my hair months a tell you!!!! I looked up reviews about different salons and hair stylist nothing would convince me. I decided to try this place out, the hair specialist who cut my hair was Brittany. She was so nice and easy going. I showed her the picture of the hair I wanted and she is true master of her craft!! My hair looks great I've been getting compliments from everyone from work even random strangers. Thank you so much Brittany !!! I will be coming back
