ART: brgr, like most contemporary art, seems overpriced.  The burgers are indeed interesting and aesthetically put together, but for 20 friggin' bucks, this cow better come in a gilded frame, and these don't. The cocktail I had (a vodka number) was intelligent, but alas, overpriced. And contrary to a few of these reviewers whose stomachs must be the size of my chihuahua's, the portions are not that big (not a bad thing for us fat asses, but don't invest in this place with any delusions). It'll be one of the best unique burgers you've had all year, but be willing to pay for it.
