I ate breakfast here almost every day while in town for work. Conveniently located between my office and hotel, they have a simple menu of breakfast items, sandwiches, salads and smoothies. The Hulk is one of the best smoothies I've had in a while, and at $5, you can't beat it.  The employees are friendly and the place is very clean. My only complaint is that one morning, I ordered oatmeal to go. It took at least 25 minutes and ended up being quick oats, not even steel cut. The menu didn't specify, so I should have asked.
