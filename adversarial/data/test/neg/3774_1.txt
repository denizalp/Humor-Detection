Not my favorite location. The last two times I've been here, both daytime - mid morning trips - the checkout lines have been excessive. I don't mean like 3 people waiting, I mean like 10+ people waiting, with 2 registers open, while 2 people stand at the floral area chit-chatting. It also feels congested because if carts of merchandise in the aisles. Other locations are more efficient, and less cluttered...in the future I will stick to those.
