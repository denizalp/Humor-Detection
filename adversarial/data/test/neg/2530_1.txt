This place is a disaster. Go here if you want shortened time, inappropriate touching, exposed draping, and to be walked out on several times in the middle of the massage. Doubt any of these people are certified, it was the worst \"massage\" I've ever had and they slap your back with both hands at the end of the it. The place is a bunch of small rooms with hospital curtains for separation. A creepy and regretful experience. Hope this review helps anyone who's actually looking for a real massage experience. OWNER: don't even think about replying with some bs response because what I experienced was uncalled for and if you want to reply rudely like you have to others I will post both to Google as well. You guys have some nerve.
