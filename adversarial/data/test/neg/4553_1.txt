Had the mom's special and red chili today. The service was good and quick( no one else was in the restaurant).\nThe mom's special was very good and tasty. The red chili however was a let down. The red chili did not have the expected richness and had hardly any meat, the sauce was thinly spread across the bread. \nMy recommendation is to rethink the red chili or at least add more meat-- increase the price of the red chili if you need to make it more cost effective.
