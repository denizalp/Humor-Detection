Really this has to be one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. Being locals, it's hard to get us to the strip for any reason. But the only thing that continuously has us coming back is Sushi Samba. The service, ambiance, and food really is that good. Of course, you can't come to Samba and not get seabass. I love this dish so much, it's truly the only thing that keeps me coming back. The fish literally melts in your mouth and the Peruvian corn with it is the perfect compliment. If you go there and don't get it, consider it a mistake. \nOf course the sushi is some of the freshest around. I love how innovative their rolls are and you can taste how fresh things are and not imitation like the rest of the Vegas. Keep up the good work samba!!
