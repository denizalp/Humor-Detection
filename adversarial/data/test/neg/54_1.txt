Very disappointing service. Let's start there. For four people on our bill was over $200. The food was bar food at best. Our server we saw twice , took our order and brought our food. No drink refills, no checking to see if we enjoyed our meal. The service here was horrible, I have had better guest service at McDonalds. Avoid this place you can thank me later.
