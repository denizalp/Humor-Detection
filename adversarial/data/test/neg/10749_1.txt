They arrived on the scene in 2007, the same year that I went to Aroma for the first time in Israel. Since then, there have been branches opening all over the city and I'm pleased for them. While independent coffee shops are the ideal, if we're talking about chain cafes and limited options in the downtown working core, Aroma is cool beans. I would like to fight for Second Cup in this battle since they are Canadian, but I just can't do it because unfortunately, zzzz...\n\nI think the reason I like Aroma so much is because since this is an Israeli company they have more interesting (and tasty) Mediterranean offerings. What snack would you rather eat with your hot bevvy? Another banana nut muffin from Starbucks... oooor a hot cheese bureka?   \n\nDuring the cooler months, the red lentil soup (served with bread) is one of my quick lunches if I'm at work (it's also pretty easy to make btw). It's delicious, filling (don't even need the bread), very healthy and not too pricey. Another healthy staple is the Aroma Special salad (comes with a hard-boiled egg and tuna or feta) or the Warm Chickpea salad (served with lemon olive oil dressing and tahini on the side) and in the past, the Ice Lemon Mint and Ice Aroma Light have been my usual Aroma summer drinks.
