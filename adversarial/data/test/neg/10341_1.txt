Run, do not walk, away from this place!  Hot mess!  If I could give zero stars, I would.\n\n*remember this fact, you prepay for your items.\n\nI made the mistake of going there.  I had been saving up dry clean items because I hadn't had to go to court in several months.  (Yes, I am a lawyer.)  I dropped off a few items and then went to pick them up a few days later with more items.  Picking up the second set of clothes is where the trouble started.\n\nI had seven items to pick up.  The first thing that the employee told me was that she couldn't find my two pair of pants.  I was so focused on them looking for my pants, I didn't really think about the rest or if it was accurate.  I had to leave and come back for them to get my pants.\n\nWhen I got home, I realized that I was short one blouse.  I called and talked to the same employee who \"helped\" me.  She would look around and call me back.  No call that night.  \n\nI called the following day and asked to speak to a supervisor or owner.  Once I told the person who answered the phone about the missing blouse, she passed me off to the same employee from the night before.  She apologized for not getting back to me.  She was too busy.  She said she would look for it and call me back.\n\nI received a call later that day that they located my shirt and I needed to pick it up by 5pm that evening.  Apparently, I should have ran in that night.  I got busy.  About a week later, I sent my husband in to get the blouse.  He called me because he wasn't sure with how many items he was supposed to pick up.  The staff was looking for seven items.......\n\nAnyway, after he located my blouse, the employee told my husband I owed $20.  He showed her my receipt that established I paid and even had my credit card number (last four) on the receipt.  She said, the employee must have made a mistake, so let me just run the credit card again.  He said no.  She told him that he could not leave with the shirt until he paid.  He pointed out the charge was for $20.40 and I already had six of my seven items.  She wanted to argue more, but he said, I am leaving now.  If you would like to call Henderson (police department), you have our address.  Have the police meet us at our house.\n\nSince Henderson police didn't show up at our door, I assume that they didn't take this step.\n\nSummary: Lost my pants.  Then found.  Shirt lost for a whole day and then found.  Now, they think I owe THEM $20!  I WILL NEVER GO BACK THERE AGAIN!!!!
