I only give 4 stars, as it can be a pricey place for some dishes. But i was pleasantly surprised by how delicious this place is! I ordered the shanghai noodles, taiwanese basil chicken and veggie dumplings. Everything was so so tasty and delicious, this is a wonderful spot for a quick and hearty bite!
