Third trip to this place. \n\nPluses:\n\nFair prices. Seating is really good. Some nooks with two seater tables some out in the open tables and a few cushy chairs and a couch. Lots of windows to look out. Lots of comfortable seating outside. Good piped in modern music. Staff are very very polite and welcoming. Great giant cupcake selection of high quality and high satisfaction. Real plates and forks for pastries. Sometimes the barista will grind the coffee beans by the cup making for an excellent cup of coffee!\n\nMinuses:\n\nSometimes the barista will use the drip coffee already prepared in the carafe making for a stale cup of coffee.  Have to ask for creamer. Poundcake slices are dry and have a little preservative taste to them. Outside seating is noisy because it is near the shopping center entrance. \n\nI keep coming back because those cupcakes are so darn good, the staff are so darn friendly and I keep hoping that the coffee I order will be freshly ground!
