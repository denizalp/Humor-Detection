I went in with a coupon for my birthday and they did not ring my order up right and instead of re-ringing the order, they just explained it to me in a way that made zero sense. I had basically been overcharged, but they wanted me out of their way. So I insisted it was wrong and showed them on the receipt. They finally got the manager to look at it, and yes the code was entered incorrectly and he just gave me two dollars. I put one of the dollars into the tip jar. My boyfriend followed in line after me (they got his order wrong and rang him up wrong too) so I walked away. After I walked away, my boyfriend heard the worker say something about me wanting my money back and then I left a tip and then clearly said in front of him \"I don't want her tip\". This is just rude behavior and especially to say this out loud in front of customers. She should be fired. She doesn't have to worry, they will never get my service nor a tip again.
