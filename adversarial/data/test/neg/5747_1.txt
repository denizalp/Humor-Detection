So many people have already posted about the soup dumplings and it's true. They are delicious. We have visited twice and both time have ordered, and eaten, enough food for 4 people. \nWe have tried:\nSzechuan style wontons- these came with spicy glass noodles as well as the wontons. Very nice with lots of heat \nPork vegetable and shrimp pot stickers- I adore that these are steamed and then friend like a pancake and you have to break the pot stickers out. They were yummy and so uniquely presented!\nPan fried green onion pancake- Chris wasn't a huge fan. It wasn't something he would order again. Don't get me wrong it wasn't bad, but when everything else is so good you just can't waste stomach room on less than stellar items\nPork soup dumplings- these have a darker soup broth which gives them a completely different flavor than the pork and crab soup dumplings. They are filled with warm soup and really good\nPork and shrimp shu mai- these are one of my favorites. Tons of flavor, try them with some red oil.\nPork and crab meat soup dumplings- these are hands down one of the top 10 best things I've ever eaten! The broth in these is light and loaded with flavor. I would eat an entire bowl of just the broth! And then you get the awesome meaty filling. Good lord they are divine!\nWe still haven't made it back for a Sunday to try the shrimp with loofah soup dumplings, hopefully soon!
