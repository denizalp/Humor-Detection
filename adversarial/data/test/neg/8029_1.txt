WARNING! Do not eat here! Horrible food & management! My table ordered 3 pork belly ramen, 1 burger, and 1 tiramisu. All bowls of ramen came out cold, we had to send them back. On top of that 2 other tables next to us had to send theirs back too! If you are Asian or have ever had ramen from a restaurant you will think theirs is gross. Even top ramen or cup of noodles tastes better than theirs. Don't let the pictures fool you. The tiramisu was dry like it had been under a fan all day. It should ALWAYS be moist. If that isn't bad enough there was a piece of REAL CARDBOARD INSIDE MY BURGER!!! \n\nAnthony the server was great, attentive, and apologetic. It wasn't his fault. The manager Eddie came over and asked if I wanted something else. I was afraid to try any other disappointments from them so I said no and he walked away! He never introduced himself as the manager, I had to ask someone else. And HE NEVER APOLOGIZED! What kind of restaurant manager does that?! The manager, server, and cook has to work as a team. If only 1 of the 3 does their job the customers suffer. He took the drinks, burger and tiramisu off our bill. He should've comped the entire tab. When hanging out with family in Vegas we will avoid this place at all costs!!
