One star only because I have to. It was my first time here, I was asking questions to the brow lady and she seemed very agitated. She than took it out on my brows. When I pointed out a couple of errors again very rudely and aggressively she continued to over thread and aggressively rip out my brows. Let's just say, I left with really thin brows and a super red forehead. Don't waste you time or money here. I'm new to AZ, and the hunt for a good brow wiz will continue.
