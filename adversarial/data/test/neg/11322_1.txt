We dined Friday night before the show.  We ordered the deviled eggs, mac-n-cheese, and the fried chicken and waffles.  The food was good.  Out of all the items I would say that the chicken was OUTSTANDING the best item of the evening.  The drinks were average and the deviled eggs were so so.  For me the eggs had no flavor.  You want creaminess with an egg, mayo of sorts, and their eggs are almost bitter.  The mac-n-cheese was very good.  The waffles were fabulous as well.  The atmosphere was ok, but I found a  lot of the workers talking to each other and one quest, when they should have been making their rounds with all the guests.  Overall very good, but not on the top of my list to return to with so many other great restaurants in Las Vegas.
