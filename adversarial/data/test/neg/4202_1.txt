Pretty easy to rate 5 stars. I shared some industrial space with some carpenters and welders. My shop was 2 blocks from Home Depot but this is the place all the pros would head down to. \n Many of the tools here were less expensive than the Box Store prices. The selection was much better and the advice was excellent.\n The owner Mike is awesome, easy going and not pushy. They have set me up with the right tools numerous times and have my purchases on the computer which comes in handy for warranty issues.\n Most employees here are excellent A+, other than the owners son..maybe a B (Sorry Mike).\n Worth a visit if you are looking for tools and help without the attitude.
