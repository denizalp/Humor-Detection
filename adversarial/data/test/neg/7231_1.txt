We have been going to Papa Murphy's for years and were so happy when this location opened so close to home. This is the first time I've said I won't go back, at least to this location. The staff is clueless. It's Tuesday and if you go here a lot you know any pizza is $10 on Tuesday. I ordered one of their stuffed crusts and the guy told me it was $12 because the owner said they had to charge $12 for stuffed pizzas. The quality and customer service is horrible. When we called the owner Spencer he was not helpful or willing to listen. He didn't take any responsibility for his employees behavior. The service wasn't great when they first opened and we thought it was because they were new and would get better. They have not gotten better only worse. We will be going back to the Papa Murphy's on Aliante from now on.
