My first time going to stir crazy was a few weeks ago with my fiance and a few of her friends. I'll have to start out by saying i was not impressed. The place was packed people waiting out the door to get a table, which there were several open ones, and the bar was pretty much wide open. Service was slow and our server was anything but attentive, it appeared he only had 1 or 2 other tables. Took forever to get our drinks that we saw sitting at the end of the bar for at least 5 minutes and our app came out about 15 seconds before our entrees. I ordered what had appeared to be the most spicy item on the menu and again it was anything but. Rather bland when \"asian\" cuisine is know for a lot of bold flavors. Not impressed will not be returning.
