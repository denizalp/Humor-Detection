Excellent food and excellent service. Rachael is the best. The ribs and Cajun shrimp scampi were excellent appetizers. The garlic cheese bread came with the meal and was the best. We both ordered the Grand Filet. 16ozs and both were cooked perfectly and had great flavor. We've been wanting to go here for years and finally decided to go for husbands birthday dinner.  Definitely will be back and will definitely ask for Rachael if she is working when we do.
