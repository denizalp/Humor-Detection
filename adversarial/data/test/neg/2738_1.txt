Absolutely without a doubt the best Thai in Vegas and most likely LA. A must try! The food was outstanding, the menu laid out perfectly and the service was excellent! I have the Panang  and it was superb. The wine list is stellar. We also have the Cornish hen, perfect, the massaman was right on spot and the pork belly was unreal! Give their place a shot. Lotus of Siam which is considered very good and a must try had just been over thrown in Vegas and this place blows it away. I will be frequenting Chada!
