The food was \"OK\". It has great reviews so we decided to try it out. We had some tuna with mash potatoe appetizer sprinkled with raw onions and a green sauce.  That was good! The steak and plantains were pretty greasy and it actually made my stomach hurt for a couple days. I don't think I'd recommend this just cause if the grease but if you can handle it then it's a must try.
