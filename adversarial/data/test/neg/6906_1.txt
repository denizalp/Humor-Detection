Brett's Auto Service took great care of my 99 dodge ram it was having misterious problem of shutting down after reaching running temperature, Called Brett , he referred me to a great family tow company  called AzBoys towing they picked up my truck dropped it at Brett's while I was at work. So I didn't have to do anything , Brett diagnosed the problem , called me and explained it and discussed cost and and didn't start work until I understood what I was going to pay , no surprise cost or add-ons  .it was fixed the next day , he called when it was done and I pick it up .this the honest dependable service we expect and all deserve. My truck runs great . I highly recommend Brett's Auto Service five plus stars Thanks so much. If you want an honest dependable and cost conscious Mechanic service . Go to Bretts auto service !!!!!!
