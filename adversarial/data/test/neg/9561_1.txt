The most consistently great food and service in Las Vegas. This is the best Mexican food in Nevada and maybe beyond. Try the chicken fajitas as they are to die for!!  Table side Guac is equally amazing. If you are a local or in town for any reason this is a must try!  Only one complaint is they really don't take reservations unless you have a huge party. So plan on arriving early and probably waiting a bit. While worth the wait....still a bit of a pain.
