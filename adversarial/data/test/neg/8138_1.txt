Dr. Bill Bracken, of Arcadia Animal Clinic, is the best of the best among veterinarians!! He is like the Mr. Rogers of animals- he is calm,  kind to your pet, and knows what he is doing- and can communicate that with you. His entire staff is gracious and welcoming- they are helpful from the minute you enter the office.  Dr. Bracken has a great love for animals and has demonstrated it in several ways in our family- always finding time to get an appointment; providing care that is gentle and loving, and helping us when it was time to say goodbye to some of our retrievers.  We are so grateful for his services and feel so fortunate for our dogs to have him as their Dr.!!
