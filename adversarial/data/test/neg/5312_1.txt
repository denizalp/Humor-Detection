Troy is extremely professional and courteous. He came out and gave me an estimate within one week. When I agreed to hire him, he started when he said he would, he let me know when he was done for the day and that he would be back the next day to finish up. He kept me on top of everything he was doing and the work he did was great.\n\nI paid what he quoted me, no issues or surprises. I can't tell you how nice it is to be able to count on a contractor to show up when they say they will and do what they say they will do. I would definitely recommend Troy at THM Services.\n\nThank you Troy!
