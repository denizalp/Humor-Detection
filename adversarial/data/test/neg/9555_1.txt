This was a godsend to two footsore ladies with tickets to Ka.  We got a table for two where we could see the hostess stand, and since there was never a line, we had a two-and-a-half hour meal!  They were perfectly happy for us to order as we wished--the waiters were sweet and the food was yummy (and my friend loved her drinks).  The truffle potato chips were and unexpected delight.
