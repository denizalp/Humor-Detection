Great place! I've seen this place on Yelp a few times and when I come to Cleveland and I finally went to try it. The service was great and my waiter was very attentive to my needs and even a little talkative. I think he read me very well, because I was eating alone and at a table he knew not to be too talkative, but still be engaging. Soooooo, I ordered 3 ichabod oyster on the half shell plain and 3 ichabod oysters with the chorizo butter that he recommended. Good recommendation! It was tasty and cooked perfectly. Then I had a meat and cheese board with taleggio, duck heart pate, chicken liver mousse, and another recommendation of the beef sticks? It came with accompaniements like housemade whole grain mustard, honey, cherry compote? jam?, slightly pickled beets and cucumbers. The reason I like to have meat and cheese plates is that the variety of combinations you can make for your palate are so numerous. I thoroughly enjoyed each morsel. Then lastly, I had the steak tartare that came with a 6 minute egg. One of the few best steak tartare's that I've ever eaten. The only one that tops it is the one I had in Paris, which I recreate at home often. The flavors were on point and the texture of the egg went so well with the tartare. First time I've had a 6 minute egg with tartare and it was a success. The only downside was that I'm a lone diner and can only eat so much at a time! So I'm definitely coming back guys because you rocked my tummy and palate.
