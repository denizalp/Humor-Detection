I have been to SimonMed for various ultrasounds & other tests. Today when I checked in the male person ( I don't know his name), was so kind & happy. I didn't wait more than 10 minutes today, as usual. The woman who did my sonogram & has done one for me before, is so professional. She is very respectful & covers my body, just leaving the part being tested. Exposed. I always have a good experience there & I appreciate the kindness at the times I am not feeling my best.
