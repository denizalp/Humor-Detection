I wish I could break the review down to two parts - \"The Pizza\" and \"The Rest\"\n\nI have been here several times and their pizza is awesome. I personally like the \"New York\" pizza and have never been disappointed.\n\nI have also had the balsamic chicken salad a few times and it is also good, but not as good on the good scale as the pizza.\n\nWhere they fall short, starters and appetizers.  Because the individual pizza is filling, I usually stay away from the appetizers and starter items.  However, today I was in the mood for something new.  It was raining so I figured it was a good soup day.  I ordered Lobster Bisque - VERY tasty but $8 bucks for a small sized bowl.  I also thought some of the parmesan crusted artichokes sounded good.  Nope, they were not good and they were $10 for basically one artichoke heart cut into 4 pieces.  I felt a little violated here.  \n\nService is always adequate - never bad but never anything above and beyond and that's ok with me too.\n\nI would recommend this place for the pizza and because it's very good, I gave the 4 stars.  I would have only given 3 stars otherwise.
