My brother and I had a wonderful lunch today in the lounge. Beverage manager Christine ensured that we were seated at a desirable table. Our server Lori did an expert job ensuring we were aware of the specials and helped us to make delicious selections. There were no mistakes with our orders, and everything was prepared as described, to include our special requests. We'll be back. Sincerely, Art Huseonica
