First, if you have to worry about the check... just don't go. It's crazy-expensive. I went with some foodie friends and we ordered a ridiculous amount of food so we had the chance to taste a lot of the menu. The Greek heirloom tomato salad was a little to plain for all of us. Needed fresh herbs. The grilled octopus might be the best I've ever eaten with much agreement from my companions... awesome flavor and texture. Grilled vegetables:  great execution, but nothing to write home about in terms of flavor. We tried the caribinieros (large shrimp) and the dorado... cooked perfectly. Almost forgot the sashimi platter.... AWESOME, particularly the breem. Don't worry about taking someone who doesn't know or like Greek food, this restaurant is for the hard core seafood lover. Not at all a typical Greek restaurant that happens to have seafood.
