My wife and I went to Peppermill Las Vegas for our 11th Wedding Anniversary celebration. Our plan was to spend a couple of hours for our dining experience. We were promptly greeted by several people who were trying to make our dining experience amazing. We were promptly brought bread and menus. My wife ordered Chicken and Red Pepper Pasta which was amazing. I ordered the Ribeye steak, medium. It was brought to me cooked medium well or more done. My server asked to take it back. When she brought it back, it was cooked properly but was about 20% gristle and fat. The menu price listed for the steak was $32.95 but I was charged $36.95. Our out price was almost $90 and the main course of my meal was not only aweful, but by the time I finally received my properly cooked steak, I only had time to cut the fat and gristle off of it but not enough time to eat it because of an event that we had planned. The server was awesome and very apologetic. A nice lady came by and took our picture and gave us one with a very sweet note on the back.  Although all of the people were very nice and the restaurant was very welcoming, the overpricing from the listed menu price and the terrible and very expensive grisly and fat steak will keep us away.  Thank you, but NO THANKS!
