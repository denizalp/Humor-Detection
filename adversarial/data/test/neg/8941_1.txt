I love korean food, but this place was very disappointing. We were a group of 7 and we all unfortunately agree that we will never come back.  We ordered bbq meat and was astonished by how expensive it was.  We made several orders of meat, and each order is $35 but was not enough for one person.  We also ordered the kalbi beef, which was again was very small and expensive compared to other korean restaurants.  The meat was tasteless even though it was supposed to be marinated and flavoured. The UFO rice was ok, but I don't think you can mess up fried rice when you mix it with cheese and egg.  The glass noodle dish we ordered, the noodles were overcooked which you can tell by the thickness of the noodles.  I wanted so hard to like this place but it was terribly disappointed.
