I've been eating here more often than I'd like to admit (thanks, dad). \n\nThe prices are rather steep for Vietnamese and considering the area, it's not really worth it. What I do like that it's spacious and clean. Service can be iffy at times.\n\nFood: The Bun Bo Hue was not that great. I've made better from scratch with half the ingredients. The Vermicelli was better, loaded with grilled pork and tasty.\n\nNext time I will try the Bahn Cuon, since it's in their name.
