Finding superb, unique restaurants is one of the reasons I love Yelp, and this is a great example.  We wanted something light for dinner, and the menu at Roots was perfect.  Finding it in the gentrified area of Charlotte could have been a challenge, but Google Maps took us right there.  Anyway, the food was fresh and locally sourced, and the employees very pleasant.  Too bad there weren't more customers.
