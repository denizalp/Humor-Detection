I'm updating my first comment, the customer service I received from Averie after my first review, was absolutely amazing. She apologized for the confusion and made every effort to make everything right. I'll go as far to say, they will have my business and respect. Thank you again for everything!  \n\nP.s These are some awesome cookies, everyone must try!
