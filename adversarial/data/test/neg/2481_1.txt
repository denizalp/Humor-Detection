He came, he saw, and he conquered. We have had issues for a while. We were calling our old plumber who never responded. In a serendipitous moment we found a postcard ad for GMR Plumbing in our mailbox. We called and he came not only on time but ahead of schedule after checking with us. He  diagnosed the problem right away and fix it quite easily. His pricing was great. We highly recommend him.
