I went to Crêpe Bar on a whim to treat myself. I walked in and the guy at the counter, whose name I neglected to get, suggested the 13mi vegetable since I wanted something vegetarian. I also got a Moroccan latte and a lemon drop crêpe to-go for dessert. \n\nThat day, the 13mi veg had beets and (I think) leeks. It also had some pickled carrots with a cheese cracker thing on top. The veggies with the french masala was a little tangier than I would have liked. It wasn't bad at all, it just was too vinegary for me with the carrot pickles and everything. I think it would have been awesome with some parsnips in there with the beets. The cheese thing on top was good too. \n\nI got the Moroccan latte with 2% milk (finally a coffee place that has more than whole and skim!). It was good. \n\nI'm usually not a big fan of lemon flavoured foods, but because the guy (whose name I can't remember) highly recommended it, I got it. Plus it has hibiscus gel in it, so that softened the lemon flavour. It was nice. I liked it. \n\nI decided to go back a couple days later, and I got the First Time (nutella and banana crêpe) and a vanilla latte. As expected, both were good. \n\nThe employees are super nice, and the food is good. I will definitely be going back esp. since I didn't have to go far to get there.
