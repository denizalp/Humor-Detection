I like this place. My husband and myself ate there once and we found it affordable and really good. The service was great, but we were there late so not many people. Since then, we've ordered and pick up sushis from there several times and it has always been really good, although a little pricey for pick-up. Once we ordered the large vegetarian sushi plate and I was a little disappointed. It was very affordable, but not nearly as satisfying as usual.
