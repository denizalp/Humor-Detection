Update I recently revisited this store to give them another chance.  This time I was double charged for my entire grocery tab.  That has since been reversed.  Again I was overcharged for a sale item, this seem to happen mainly from the deli.  The system doesn't have the sale price.  I spoke with a nice gentleman in customer service he refunded me the difference to my debit card, it been two days and no refund yet. I was thinking about taking my issues up with the GM, but this is becoming a corporate complaint issue.
