A yumcha gem inside the Gold Coast casino! the place itself is quite small which equals a long wait but the food more than makes up for It. \n\nFrom the hagow to the shumai , everything was tasty and fresh, my only qualms is that the Lo-Mai-Kai only came with one! there's usually 2-3 :( Lo-Mai-Kai is the stuffed rice wrapped inside the leaf and my favorite thing to get! \n\nother than that it was great, price is a little on the expensive side since it is in a hotel 2.88 for (A) and 3.88 for (B)\n\nwould come again
