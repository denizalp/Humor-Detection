We came here because they had a restaurant.com.  Well, guess what.  They wouldn't honor it. Which kinda stinks.\n\nBut we were hungry and decided to eat here anyway.\n\nIt's a tiny place.  There are perhaps 6 or 7 tables.  I would guess they could fit in maybe 20 people.  It's also divey.   Those are not bad things, just reporting what I saw.  If they ever get really busy you may not find a seat.\n\nThe host was friendly.  He doubled as a server. Authentic ambiance with the TV (in Spanish) and decor.  Reminded me of a couple of divey places I've been to in Mexico. \n\nI ordered the carne asada chimichanga.  Sort of my 'standard candle' by which I assess different Mexican joints.  My wife had the mole poblano (chicken).\n\nThe chimi had beans in it.  This surprised me.  Also the meat was not evenly distributed, so I got several bites that were just beans.  The flavor was OK. However, the mole poblano was really good.  I got to try my wife's.  The chicken by itself was bland, not marinated.  In fact we think it may have been boiled.  But the mole poblano sauce was truly outstanding. The rice was nothing special.  Not bad, but not particularly flavorful either.\n\nSo to recapitulate, the chimi was maybe 2.5 stars.  Not great, but not bad.  The rice was similarly about 2.5 stars.  The mole poblano was a solid four stars.  I think if the chicken had been grilled or fried that could have been a 5-star dish.  Overall I'm going with three stars.
