Made my way to Duckworths for the first time last night. We were greeted by a friendly hostess and promptly placed into a booth. Even though the place was packed with simultaneous birthday celebrations  our server still managed to stay on top of our drinks and orders. She was very good at suggesting beers that had similar tastes to what we were accustomed to. Yea! \n\nApparently this particular Saturday night Duckworths was the Chucky Cheeses for adults. After one birthday celebration ended another party quickly came to take their spot. No worries though because that tells me that people must really fall in love with Duckworths. Plus it created good energy for the place.\n\nI ordered the Mommoos wings w\/ a side of garlic fries and my sister had the Sweet n' Bold Gold Wings w\/a side of the Boardwalk fries. The Mommoos wings were good but not great. Just keeping it real. My fries were good but my only complaint was that they came out lukewarm. To their credit my sister's fries came out piping hot so I guess it just depends. I ordered the Chocolate cake to go and it is delicious.  Overall I would rate Duckworths a 3.5. Nice atmosphere,good food and good service.Don't expect to have your mind blown but expect a good time. My only complaints were the lukewarm fries and the lack of toilet paper in one of the ladies bathroom stalls. But that stuff happens ys know? I'll be back like the Terminator would say!
