Grocery is fresh and priced very well. We love the variety of raw fish from the world over. Lots of ethnic food.\n\nThe hot food counter is fantastic. well priced and excellent. I just picked some lunch up (for 4 adults) from the dim-sum counter and paid approx $28. (I once ordered shumai at T&T and it turned out to be raw on the inside...yuck!).\n\nStaff is friendlier at the Mississauga location and may actually venture to explain what some of the dishes are ...unlike the Brampton location...
