Great movie theater but bad experiences with the staff. We have the Regal rewards card and when my boyfriend didn't use the card to purchase the tickets online, I thought we'd be able to just ask the staff there to add them to our account like I've done before at another Regal. When I went to ask the person taking up tickets he quite rudely told me I should have done it through the app and to come back after the movie and he will fix it. So after the movie (which you get double points for) I went up to him again and he again was rude and told me there was a way to do it online.  I asked him if he could show me on the movie receipt and he took the phone from me and literally grunted and said he'll just do it. Then after a minute or two, he grunted again and said he fixed it. Check back the next day and it's still not fixed. And sadly he was the manager on duty.
