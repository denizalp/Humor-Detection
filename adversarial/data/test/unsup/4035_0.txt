I see Tamika, a PA at Dr. Dempsey's office. I have always received an exceptional level of care, and the staff at the front desk has always been very polite and efficient. Tamika had a wonderful bedside manner and takes the time to listen to your concerns and treat you like a person, not just your ailments.\n\nThe on-site lab facility is also extremely convenient!!\n\nI have recommended this practice, and Tamika specifically, to friends and neighbors. I could not be happier with the professional, compassionate level of care I have received.
