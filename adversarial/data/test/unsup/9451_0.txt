Darn, they must have gotten a new chef because \"Yucky\" is the best way I can describe my last \"meal\" here.  \n\nI ordered some Won Ton soup...what a disaster. They completely changed the recipe and added some pork strips and so the won-tons ended up dyed pink and the taste? Horrible.  I spit it out. \n\nNot sure if it was spoiled rotten but it was disgusting.  \n\nThe chicken noodle soup was a boring spaghetti cheap stringy old rubbery stringy strips of chicken and plain broth. \n\nUgh, never again.
