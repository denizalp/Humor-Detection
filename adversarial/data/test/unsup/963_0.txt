It is still fun to people watch and observe the always bizarre human race. I admire the people that display their complete vulnerability at the mini-massage stations. I cannot believe how the price of everything has skyrocketed. Since when are New Balance 574 $75 at their lowest? I will stick to 6pm.com for most of my clothing purchases. Great Northern Mall will always reign supreme for checking out weird folks wandering.
