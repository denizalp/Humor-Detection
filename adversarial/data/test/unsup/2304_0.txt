I bought a groupon during Easter's ordered cake pops, not only did they made my pops but also delivered them right on Easter. The cake pops were a hit, everyone liked them.  PLEASE DO NOT CONFUSE WITH PASTRY PALACE, cause they are totally disgusting. Anyways, if you want great tasting pastry's that taste awesome. I recommend cake palace for your pastry needs.
