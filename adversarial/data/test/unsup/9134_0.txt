Was very surprised and impressed by Mesa Grill!  It's usually not my style of food, but everything we tried was so flavorful!  Tiger Shrimp tamale, Chipotle glazed ribeye, roasted corn, and chocolate sticky toffee pudding were all very delicious!  I'm disappointed in myself for not trying this place sooner!
