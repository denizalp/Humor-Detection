The entire idea of this joint: NARLEY\nThe sliders: HIT(no miss). Juicy. Abundant. Tasty. \nFries: Bomb-dig. Perfect texture.\nSoda: the yooj(usual)\nArt: I'm sitting inside the walls of a comic book and a giant crane machine of human slider fiends.\nThe folks: more chill than an ice box.\n\n\nPost sliders,\nElevated satisfaction for my scrap dollars. I noticed limited seating, but I dig the red semi-circle booths.\n \nBAM! I'm coming back for some late night eats. Come.
