Pita Island is a gem hidden in a strip mall. The fresh hummus is delicious but even better is the home made pita - wow! This is not close to my home but I will certainly be making a special trip there often. Besides the typical Mediterranean fare they also serve brick oven pizza which is fresh and delicious. Try the gyro pizza and have the best of both worlds! And make sure  to have Mike entertain you with his jokes, very funny!
