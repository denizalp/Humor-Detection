Cool coffee shop in the lobby of the Hard Rock. It's a little overpriced but it's good and it's convienant if you aren't driving while in town. They have coffee, lattes, cappachinos, etc. They also have breakfast options like burritos, sandwiches, etc. \nThey have some seating inside as well as right outside the cafe.
