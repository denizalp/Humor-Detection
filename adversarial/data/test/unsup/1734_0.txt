I laughed when I saw this restaurant was categorized as Hot & New, as nothing I ate there (in a large group dinner) was even close to being hot: \n\n- Spinach soup = cold\n- Risotto = tasteless & tepid; not really risotto\n- Filet = small & bland\n- Dessert = highlight of the night, but could've saved a hundy and gone to Cold Stone\n\nAvoid this place until they get their act in gear.
