The place is really nice and clean. There is not many people at around 4pm on a Wednesday and it's happy hour! I got an order of nachos that were different from what I expected, but surprisingly good. If you don't want to fill yourself of chips, this is a great vegetarian option. I will definitely come back here to try other things.
