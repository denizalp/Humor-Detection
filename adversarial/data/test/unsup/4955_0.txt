The Number One is my number one!\n\nFor some reason I can't stray from the smoked Gouda, caramelized onions, and bacon. I love the fresh bread and the dipping sauce, whatever it's secret is, it's safe with me. Pretty much because I have no clue what the sauce is, only that it's good!\n\nI haven't tried any of the sides, but I'd imagine they're just as good as the grilled cheese sammiches!
