Service is great. They make fresh guacamole right in front of you and give you hot tortilla chips. THE best guacamole.\n\nI love tacos, flautas, tamales, enchiladas, chimichangas, etc.\n\nBut this is a place to venture out. I really think everyone should look at the seafood section. Everything I've had here is good, with the seafood dishes being AMAZING.
