I love this place, the only complaint I have is that every time I come here for lunch, they are sold out of snickerdoodle cookies. I'm sure this is one of their top sellers, so I would think they would be prepared for the afternoon lunch rush and ensure they do not run out. Unfortunately this has not been the case the past 4 times I have gone here for lunch. All in all the service is usually really good. Food has always been really good!
