I've been to loads of art museums. I've seen some strange scupltures. Some, I \"got\" and some remained a complete puzzle. Grandiflora falls into the latter category. Two large round loops that look like stirrups at the intersection of Wendover and Randolph. What's the point? Do I feel more arty after stopping at this traffic light and looking over at the sculpture? Maybe the horn honking at me caused me to lose the imagery. I don't know.\n\nIt's art. But it's weird.
