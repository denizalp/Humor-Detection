The husband and I picked up a pizza and salad from here for dinner the other week. Both were outstanding. And we eat a lot of pizza and a lot of salads. Neapolitan isn't our favorite style but this was excellent. The salad was really simple and high quality. Even though it's outside of our 10 minute drive bubble, we'll be back.
