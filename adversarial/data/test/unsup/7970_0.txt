What a rustic gem! You walk in to a barrel on a rocking chair and beautiful bottles lined up for your trying. Greeted by Laura \"the glass washer\" who is absolutely lovely and knowledgeable about all the products. Then the owner Kim, who is male, starts pouring and describing in even more detail and funny stories about how it's made! We also received a tour of the distillery and tried a couple of his products that are still in the testing phase. Check this place out to get warm and fuzzy on whiskeys and moonshine.
