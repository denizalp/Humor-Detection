Good, bad or otherwise this place has northern comfort food. Pastrami and beef short ribs amongst other things.  (I don't know how good) For us southerners.. They don't change out their old grease often enough.  The fried food we had was greasy and not good quality. I could barely eat half of my shrimp tempura. Wife had chicken tenders (better at kfc) we split order of fries. Service was rushed and not good at all.  I'm from Houston and go out to eat all the time.
