Looked up this place on Yelp for a PHO restaurant on a stormy rainy day. It's a small nondescript store in a small strip mall. The menu had a lot of items and we ordered the #1 Pho and the Bun Bo Hue. The Pho was kinda bland and the added meats were small. The Bun Bo Hue was a little better but not one of the better BBH that I have tried. All in all the meal was quick inexpensive 2 min from the ASU field and the service was good.
