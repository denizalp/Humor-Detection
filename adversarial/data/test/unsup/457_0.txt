I'm glad I gave this shop a second chance, sometimes that's all it takes.  People have bad days. I got their signature Central Shorty, which was literally the most perfect cup of coffee I've ever drank. I still dream about it, and will probably stop by for it every time I drive through Plaza Midwood from now on. \n\nOnly thing that keeps me from giving this place a 5 star review is the lack of parking.  Staff was polite and aloof all at the same time.  A perfect hipster's paradise for coffee.
