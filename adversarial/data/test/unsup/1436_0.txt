This location sells some cosmetics, scored some Donna Karan Delicious 3.4 oz perfume for $5 almost full! Some people get very weird about this place and camp out all day to literally snatch goods off of the stock cart when the employee wheels out new stuff. Not a good look people. Always good selection on housewares and furniture.
