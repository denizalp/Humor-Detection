Ice cream + macarons = match made in heaven. Include asian flavors and you've got yourself a winner : ) Perfect Scoop is a level up from your usual ice cream parlor. I recommend their black sesame ice cream. I'm glad it is quite a drive for me otherwise I would visit everyday until I became immovable.
