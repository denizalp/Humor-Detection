Good food, terrible service.\n\nPortions are smaller than most places, tasty sushi. however, rolls have too much rice. Try the candy came roll, it's interesting!\n\nThe waitress kept taking our plates too soon, rushed us w\/ ordering & cut us off from ordering more by asking us if we are full yet. \n\nProbably won't return.
