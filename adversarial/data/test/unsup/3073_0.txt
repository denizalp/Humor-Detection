Is it any wonder that the salon has yet to respond to ANY of the recent complaints or bad business here?!? No. Because they don't care (or they can't read English). My guess is both. Interesting how all the one star complaints on here are all marked \"Funny\". I'm sure it's the morons working there. Hope the health department mops the floor with them soon. Don't patronize a shop that feels this way about their customers.
