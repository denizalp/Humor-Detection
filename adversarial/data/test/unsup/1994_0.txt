Best groomers in town :) Apparently, Vanessa is the go-to groomer there. She always makes my little guy look soooo cute!  My girlfriend  Ashley, works as a barber next door and always brings our pup to doggy day care & there for his luxury grooming. My puppy always has an amazing time there! This place always holds events for rescued dogs & Santa came in for Xmas, 10$ a pic with proceeds going to rescued doggies! Definitely recommend!
