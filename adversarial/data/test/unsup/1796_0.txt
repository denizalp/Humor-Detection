Well, it's a FedEx store, so as you can imagine, it's pretty quiet. That being said, I've never seen less than 3 staff members on hand to help out if there are any issues. I've been in and out of this joint in under 3 minutes at least a dozen times. You can scoop up anything you need to send out a package and various office supplies if you break your scissors during a mid-day scissor fight.
