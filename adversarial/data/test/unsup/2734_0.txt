Wife and I where there yesterday for late lunch.\nDeluca's is right in the middle of the strip district.\nI had the Da Burgh which is a Philly Cheesesteak and I also had fries.\nThe service was excellent and the waitress was very helpful and friendly.\nIt has been many years since I have had a really good philly cheesesteak.\nThis one was among the best I have ever had and the fries where good as well.\nI would definitely recommend Deluca's for all your diner needs.\nCan not wait too go here for breakfast.
