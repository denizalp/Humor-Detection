So glad there's a H2O Poke in Vegas! Came out here for a quick trip and was surprised to see a familiar brand that I only thought was in Socal. I am very familiar with a few of their other locations and I am happy to say that even though this one is in Vegas, quality and prices are the same! Hope to see more pop up in the future.
