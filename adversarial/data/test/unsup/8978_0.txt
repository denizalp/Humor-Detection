Place was alright. Naked guys, yeah ok... Seen that before and We can all see that somewhere else. the service was terrible! Really stuck up, they kicked my friend out because she asked for the same dancer, then accused me of taking pictures (when I hadn't) and checked my phone - PS violation of privacy. Ridiculous. Also racist! Super racist club. Worst dancers were Jason  (got my friend kicked out) and Jimmy (stuck up and useless). Managers kept picking on the non-white girls.
