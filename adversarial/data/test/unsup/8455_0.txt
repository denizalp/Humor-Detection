I stopped in not long after this place opened.  I got the pulled pork sandwich and it was so good I order it every time I go back.  I'm not typically a huge fan of vinegar based barbecue sauce but I end up drenching my sandwich in this stuff; it has just the right amount of kick to it.  I don't get to go very often but enjoy it every time I do.
