I wish I didn't have to give any stars. This place is seriously the worst ! They submitted my w-2 all wrong. I still don't even have my tax refund back. I've been down here multiple times to fix the problem but they have no clue what they're doing. It's insane. Now I have to get copy's of all of my stuff and send it in to the irs myself. And the manager did nothing for me. Didn't even talk to me or help.
