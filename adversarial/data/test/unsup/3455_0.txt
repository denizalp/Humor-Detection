So after spending 5 hours here during my last visit I suppose I can give an accurate review. there aren't allot of food options here before the gate, so make sure and wait to get pass security to get some grub. Getting a taxi at  the airport is pretty much quick and painless even around busy times, but be aware to taxi should cost you over $25 to get to the strip ( yea I learned the hard way). I guess seeing the slot machines once again on my departure just added insult to loosing all my money injury.
