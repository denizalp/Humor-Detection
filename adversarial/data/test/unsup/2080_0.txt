Probably not the place you want to walk into when you are in need of a quiet retreat inside your own head. While nice, the sales folks don't get the phrase, \"Sorry, just looking.\" they follow you everywhere & interject pieces of information about whatever, that you could care less about.  Love their products, but their staff can be overbearing. Which is why I only shop online.
