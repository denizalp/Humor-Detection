Rude hostess and owner. We came with a party of 10. First it was 30 minutes wait. Then 45 minutes. Some of the party left and tables became open but hostess refused to seat us any sooner or accommodate us while we were waiting. We finally left and went next door for a donut. O face donuts is awesome next door!  Vegas is all about customer service and there was none at Carson Kitchen.  We will not be returning.
