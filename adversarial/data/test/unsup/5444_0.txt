Very disappointing.  Most displays have very low lighting making them hard to enjoy.  There is too much on display with minimal background info making it somewhat overwhelming.  And the new addition, although striking from the exterior, is unpleasant to navigate through and not at all in keeping with the grandeur of the of the old building.
