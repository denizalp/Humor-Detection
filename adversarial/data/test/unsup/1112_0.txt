This place is more of a fastfood type. I oreder yakisoba butter noodle with beef and miso soup. The food was served on styrofoam. The soup was hot and was serves in a foam cup. I am not a big fan of hot soup in a foam cup. The food is affordable. The serting is no for dating night. If you are hungry, it is an okay place.
