An excellent place for a ice cream cone. Delicious, generous, low price. They have their own private brand of ice cream prepared by Maypole Ice Cream in Etobicoke. Brilliantly absurd names for the ice cream like Crunchy Frog for chocolate mint. Yes, I caught the Monty Python reference. Still, though.\n\nApparently they also make available discs that somehow magically contain movies that can be played in a special contraption player that predates the internet.
