This place is small and not very good with service.  Watch out for red flying fish roe!  It tasted like DDT, insects spray!!!   I have told the server and they said that they have opened a new box which did not solve the issue!!! It is terrible to know that the server did not care about the food they serve nor their customers!!!   Bad experience and bad services!!
