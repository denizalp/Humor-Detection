Came at 10p with the intention of having dinner. On yelp it says opened until 11p. Met by the hostess who says they close at 10p. Sorry. Curt and feigned apathy are not my taste. I was looking for a place to bring my grandmother for her 85th birthday but will reconsider for a more delightful reception from a hostess that genuinely cares about what is advertised. My money will be better spent elsewhere.
