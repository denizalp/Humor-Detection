I'm surprised this place is getting such good reviews. The sound system really sucks, drink selection is limited and any time I dropped by it is empty or they have a cover.  The only place I have ever paid a cover and felt it was worth it was at El Convento Rico.  This place just doesn't have it for me.  I just looked at the pictures and the place is empty in the pics lol
