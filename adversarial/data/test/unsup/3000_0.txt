The good news: the store is clean, well lit, well organized, decent craft\/art supplies selection even though it is not the largest Michae's in Western PA. \n\nThe not so good news: the customer service is awful. No smiles. No eye contact when answering a product question. Associates seemed bothered when stocking was interrupted for a product location question. Even the cashier couldn't find a creative way to put a smile on her face. Suggestion: Face paints. Aisle 3. \n\nThe final analysis:  If I haven't brought a bad attitude with me, I surely don't want to leave with yours.
