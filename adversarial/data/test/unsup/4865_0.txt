After a long day at school on the North Side, I traveled my usual route back to the East on E. Ohio St. Traffic was unusually hectic so I had time to gaze around at my surroundings. That's when I noticed this large store front with a neat interior. I parked my car and walked into the coolest tea and coffee shop I've seen in Pittsburgh. Really sweet customer service and awesome interior. The teas were just as good. I ordered the Lavenade (lavender lemonade) and a green tea. Definitely will go back soon
