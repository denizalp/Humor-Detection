The best squid ink pasta I've ever had. Gorgeous presentation and absolutely delicious. But as exceptional as the main course was, the cannoli was the highlight of my meal. Fresh, crispy and creamy-superb! The ambiance and decor is also quite lovely. I loved the open air concept. I wish I lived in Montreal bc if I did I'd be a frequent customer.
