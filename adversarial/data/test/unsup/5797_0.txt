The last time I went to this Arby's my order was not complete! I had to turn around after realizing 2 miles later- I tell the guy he didn't give me my fries... As I wait in the drive thru line the lady in front of me was trying to get the guys attention cuz he didn't give her her drink and as I pull up the the window- he sticks my food out the window and says nothing! No I'm sorry- no let me give u a free dessert for not doing my job right- nothing.... RUDE!!
