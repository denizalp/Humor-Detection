Food 4 Less and Raley's\n\nSitting in a tree\n\nK-I-S-S-I-N-G....\n\nFirst comes LOVE\n\nThen comes marriage\n\nThen comes Winco in a baby carriage!\n\nThats the first impression you get of this place (at least I do)....I'm a big fan of the bulk food section, and I like the DIY nut butters and dispense your own honey too. Produce can be hit or miss... My go to stores are still Cardenas, 168 Market and Greenland because those stores tend to have more of the types of food items I would usually shop for...ALOHA!!!
