I actually REALLY liked the food here!  I was recommended the Bar-B-Qshi by the bartender and it sure did not disappoint!  The presentation of the food was incredible, as pulled pork sushi rolls full of flavor surrounded a neatly stacked volcano made of delectable, tasty onion rings.\n\nThe service was fantastic, and the menu options are plentiful.  They give you a lot of food too, but yet it's not too much, because the food is delicious!  I will definitely be coming back here next time I'm in Charlotte!
