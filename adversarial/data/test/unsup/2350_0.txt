If you've ever wondered where Charlotte's Hispanic community does their food shopping, you can wonder no more. Compare is chock full of Hispanic specialties and imported items. I was very pleased with the beer choices, which included Modelo, Pacifico and Corona Familiar.\n\nLarge produce section looks very fresh. And who could resist the end cap with votive candles? Spanish language magazines at the checkouts.\n\nPrices were about what I expected - slightly more than Wal-Mart but much less than Harris Teeter.
