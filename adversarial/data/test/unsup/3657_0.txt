I ordered a salad and some wings and it took over an hour for them to arrive. This place is about 5 mins away from me so I think that is ridiculous. The wings were good, but the salad had bacon all over it so I couldn't even eat it. The description didn't say there was bacon and it looked good so I was disappointed. Everything seemed fresh, but I can't get over waiting an hour for a salad I couldn't eat and some wings.
