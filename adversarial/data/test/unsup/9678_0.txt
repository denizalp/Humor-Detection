Everyone that works here deserves hazard pay.\n\nThe wait is long because customers turn into low-rent gordon Ramsay's when it's their turn in line.\n\nOne time the person in front of me asked the burrito dealer to re-make his burrito bowl with a tortilla draped along the bottom of the bowl because the tortilla was off-center.\n\nI'm sure this is not the first or last time this request was made at a Chipotle.\n\nChipotle needs more rules. \n\nAnd a second location at Steelyard Commons.\n\nThis is my favorite place to shop for napkins.
