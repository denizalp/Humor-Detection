Not a crazed Bobby Flay fan, nor did I even know what Mesa Grill was before I walked in. But Wow, was this good!\n\nI was there for the brunch menu and actually just ordered a salad. The Apple Salad. For being a salad, it was amazing. Not a lot of ingredients, but a simple, yet amazing salad, can you believe it!? Even the bread they give you as you first sit was amazing, jalapeno bread, blueberry coffee cake, corn bread, and cranberry scones!\n\nBravo Bobby Flay.
