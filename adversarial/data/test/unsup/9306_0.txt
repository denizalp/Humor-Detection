These guys are superb. Long opening hours, opens every day, takes credit cards, no drama, no bullshit, great work, and even better conversation.\n\nThe conversation part is essential cause I don't even have to give them any instructions. They can tell every modification my garments need after looking at me wear them for 10 seconds.\n\nStrictly the only place in Hogtown that makes me feel like I'm back home in Manhattan. Wish more businesses in this town were as solid as this. Six stars and standing ovation.
