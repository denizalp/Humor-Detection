Another trip to Calgary, another trip to The Coup. This time around I ordered the Thai hot pot. (For those interested seasonal veggies in my case meant red and yellow pepper, zucchini, red onion, carrots, snow peas.) Mmmm, I love my veggies!\n\nThere is a good variety of things to order at The Coup, and I think that will keep me coming back when I'm in town. Not cheap (more than my work travel allowance), but healthy.\n\n\n$17.25 with tax and tip
