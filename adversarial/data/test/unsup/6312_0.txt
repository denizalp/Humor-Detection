I came here for a birthday party for my friends daughter and it seemed very unorganized and chaotic.  And after the cake cutting, the kids wanted to play more and the main play area was closed!  So, all of the guests were limited to a ball pit and a small inflatable slide. And as we were leaving(within our alloted time) another party was showing up!  Give some breathing room between parties!!!  I didn't experience the male owner so I guess from the reviews I should consider myself lucky.
