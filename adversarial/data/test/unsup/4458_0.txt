I can't really explain more thank Beatrice did in this review.\n$3 if you just need your eyebrows threaded..and they do a good job.  \n\nIf you're lucky and arrive on a weekday, your wait will be short. If you're lucky and there are ppl waiting for specific ppl, just might just cut the line even if there's a whole room of ladies waiting to get their hair plucked. call for waxing, they are cheap and do everything.
