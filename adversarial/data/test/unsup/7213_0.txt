wah wah...to the new owners of the Wah :( \n\nSo King Wah closed for like a month back in October. They reopened as promised...but under completely new ownership. \n\nMenu is the same....but the food, Its different....in a not the same tasty Wah we are used to. \n\nTuki didn't even beg for food. \n\nWe are sad, this was our go to Chinese delivery. Now we must take on the task of finding something new.
