So I finally got to try Yama after going to UNLV for how many years now. Lol! Yama has a great all you can eat menu which isn't bad based on pricing. Two rolls already covers the price so might as well get all you can eat right? Plus, you can get ice cream or mochi after your meal if you still have room. FYI their rolls are kinda dirty i.e \"Wet dream\" and \"Morning after\" however, very unique and fun!
