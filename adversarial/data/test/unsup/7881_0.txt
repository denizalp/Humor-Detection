Great local neighborhood bar! Came in with friends to watch the Chargers ...lose... But still had a great time. Reid the bar manager made our night so fun, he's great! I talked myself out of eating because I'm 1 fry away from gaining 10 lbs but the drinks were great! Love the low sitting comfortable chairs too :)
