I came here on my first day of moving to Nevada. \n\nI walked in to sign up for internet services. I was placed on the waiting list and was helped within 15 minutes. I told the gentleman I wanted the 100 Mb\/s internet for the promo rate and he had me out the door in 5 to 10 minutes. \n\nThe whole process was fairly painless and the self set up was idiot proof. Well... hopefully idiot proof
