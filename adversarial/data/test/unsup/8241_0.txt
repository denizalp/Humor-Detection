I love this Casino, it is always clean and it feels modern.\n\nThe bowling and cinema have a cool modern feel and the selection of bars are really good. As a local this is by far my favorite \"locals\" casino, its not quite the quality of Cosmo or Bellagio or Wynn, but it feels like a community casino rather than one tailored to tourists.\n\nOh, and keep Cherry open! Love the place! Only thing that would be better would be more child friendly films or more accommodating to kids in the bowling alley!
