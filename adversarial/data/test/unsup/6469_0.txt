Waited for 2 hours just to get seated at the grand opening last night (National Hot Dog Day!) and it was, as expected, well worth the wait. If you've never visited the food truck... Short Leash is known for their funky combinations\/toppings but have no fear... they are just as complex and delicious as they are strange. My personal favorite is the Devil Dog (green chiles, jalapenos, sriracha, onions) but when vegetarian chili is available the Mac Daddy (mac n cheese & chili) is going to happen.\n\nCongrats to the owners on such success!
