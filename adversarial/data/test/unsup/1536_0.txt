I just checked in.. was told by guest relations that what happened on our last visit was an anomoly and she would make it right...instead...we have to insist, even though we paid for the late checkout....and booked through hotel web site...and had the paper showing checkout 5pm...he tried to say it was 3.... Then had to check with someone else...just to give us what we already paid for.
