this place could be SO much better. remember pearl?\n\nthe selection for every medium here is tiny. the only selection that seems to be quite large is the drawers filled with letraset sheets. but i think i might be the only person still buying these.\n\ni will go here if i really need something with a quickness OR those rub on letters, otherwise i will just order anything i need from dickblick.com.
