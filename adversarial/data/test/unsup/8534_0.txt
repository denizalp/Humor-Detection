Nice waitress.  But the worst food I have eaten in 2016.  Tasteless fish sandwich on soggy roll.   With American cheese...Not good.  Very dry fried chicken sandwich.  Fries were ok.  Apple crisp delivered cold.  We asked them to take it back to be warmed, and they did.  But warmed it with the ice cream on top.  And then returned a soupy mess.  I complained, but it was still on my bill.   I will never return.
