This establishment is disgusting. The blinds are filthy. Our appetizer came out on a broken plate. We notified the manager who assured us she would take it off our bill and \"throw it at her kitchen staff.\" We kinda believed her. At one point an alarm went off in the kitchen area and the manager could be heard screaming \"who opened the door?\"
