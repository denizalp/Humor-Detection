This location was truly underwhelming. The price is so high, the quality is average and the service, pretentious. The menu has so many choices, it makes it VERY HARD to order and then you hope what you ordered is the right size fr the party size. The service is severely lacking, for these prices, I would expect the servers to smile, maybe even levitate.\n\nPlenty of other sushi joints with just as good quality in Vegas. Mr Nobu would be rolling over in his grave, if he was actually dead, which he is not.
