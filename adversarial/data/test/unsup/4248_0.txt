At first when I came in, no one greeted me or asked me if I needed help. But after a minute,  a guy came up & was totally welcoming. \nI needed help with my fat burning pill & he was very knowledgeable.. knew what he was talking about.  He also suggested healthy pre work outs, & not so fattening whey protein. \nTotally hooked on this place. Their prices are awesome too!
