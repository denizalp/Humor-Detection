Awesome place where you can purchase and take out authentic Egyptian food. Mena, the owner is a delight!! I ordered the Falafel lunch plate that comes with delicious whole wheat pita bread, hummus and veggies (tomatoes with shredded cabbage and cilantro) Super tasty and the portion was very generous.  I had enough for two meals and even shared with my husband who loved it too. The Lentil soup at a mere $1.99 was very good too. Try it!, it's very nutritious and will help by giving you energy.
