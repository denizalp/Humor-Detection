BOMB, BOMB, BOMB!! Loved Barrelhouse!\n\nIf you time it right and you can stop by for happy hour...do it! They have a lot of small dishes and you can pretty much get a whole dang menu sample and not make your debit card cry. Little artichoke bites from Heaven, savory short rib etc etc\nNice craft beer list, and the food was creative, fun and just downright delicious.  Nice dark, sexy lil' vibe goin' inside those deceiving exterior walls... yum!
