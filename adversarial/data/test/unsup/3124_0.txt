I haven't had any problems here. My food has been correct all the times I've been here and staff friendly. The only thing I can see that they could use on improvement is cleaning tables a little more frequent, but I have seen a lot worse. My kids love to eat here and the food is a lot better than eating at Taco Bell. Still can get cheap tacos here too.
