Butterfield's is one of my favorite breakfast spots in the valley. It's good every time. You get a lot of food for your money, so come ready to eat, or with a friend that is willing to split a dish with you. The service is generally very fast and friendly. The place is almost always packed and you will almost always have to wait...awhile. It's worth it, in my opinion. \n\nThe only thing that would make it better for me is if it were more local, sustainable, and had amazing coffee. You can't have it all, I suppose.
