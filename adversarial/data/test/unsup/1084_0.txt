A boring rainy night in Vegas watching pawn stars we decides to take a trip down to check it out and bring some old coins in. It was really small! Half of it was more like a gift shop. The staff was upbeat and friendly but the guy buying items was not that nice. It was cool to say I got to go there but I was hoping for some more items to see besides chum lees mug on a beach towel, hoodie, coin, dollar bill, coaster lol you name it!
