What a cool place. Came here on a brew tour and had a great time trying beers and eating food. Loved the little burgers, reasonably priced. Very chill atmosphere and love the decorations and little touches, best looking patio!!! Beer selection isn't huge of their own beer but good choices otherwise. This is our 2nd time back, will continue to stop in here when in the area!
