I went to Lulu's for lunch yesterday with friends and enjoyed an amazing falafel sandwich with hummus. Their sandwich menu is well-priced and delicious, but my friends who ordered larger entrees found those to be quite small for their prices. \n\nThis seems to be a great place for some things, but their prices are skewed. My verdict: Go there and get a sandwich!
