The new design for the Palms place cafe is the Lucky Penny. Atmosphere was great lighting and design. Staff is a lot better and very friendly and knowledgeable than what it use to be. Our server Charlie was amazing, very knowing of the menu what  are top meals. Like usual could not decide so asked Charlie to surprise me. She brought out a pork Lo Mein which she did an amazing choice. Overall Charlie was a great server for our table and when we go back will be definitely requesting her.
