This place is AMAZING! We came here for lunch so we missed out on the kalbi, but never the less it was very good!\n\nWe were sat down and served almost immediately, service was very friendly and had a bunch of great suggestions. All of the side dishes were outstanding I kind of wished they had the soybean sprouts commonly seen with Korean meals. The workers were really on top of changing out the grill plates.\n\nWe ordered AYCE lunch, it was just awesome. It's only been one day and my fiance is already asking me when we're going back!
