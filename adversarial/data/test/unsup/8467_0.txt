This place has a delish fish fry, with a down home feel.  Usually my BF and I are city dwellers, but we will make it out to Borland's for Friday  fish fry on occasion.\n\nI did feel a little uncomfortable, and like an outsider when we were there.  Definitely not a place that sees many fashionista's or women in heels! \n\nI am like 99% sure they only take cash too, so something to remember on your way..
