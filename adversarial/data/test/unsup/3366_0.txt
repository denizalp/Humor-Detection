On the way over I was arguing with my wife on the phone.  When I got there I was all pumped up.  I ordered the salad bar.  \n\nMy friend ordered a tuna sandwich.  We both had water.\n\nI made a pretty basic salad: iceberg, greens and baby spinach; red onion; olives; pumpernickel croutons; other things and balsamic vinagrette.  Those little ginger muffins they have are siq.  I had a bunch of them.\n\nI spilled my guts to my homie about my situation.  He listened pretty well.  I felt a little better afterward and a little awkard.  \n\nLunch was pretty good though.
