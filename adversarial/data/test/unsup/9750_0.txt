The night that I went, all the strippers were over 35 years old. and ugly.They were playing 1980's elevator music at this place. Now, I like 80s music but not every dam song. They don't play rap or even rock. When I'm feeling on some booty, I don't wanna listen to Elton John. Come on, it's 2017, for Christ sake.
