Apparently there is a patio that is often quite gross and has some stink issues. I almost sat there last night but was quickly warned not to. (NB: Apparently it has to do with the neighbours, and not Hurricanes.) \n\nLast night I tried their wings and Margaritas, and I was terribly disappointed. Really sweet and not very boozy on the drink front, and the wings were dry and not very saucy. \n\nI hate to do this to a place in my hood, but the time is now. You're being demoted H. Roadhouse.
