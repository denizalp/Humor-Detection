Inquired about a used tire, the appropriate size for my car was sold out.  They only had brand new for $100 bucks. I could go to Walmart and get the same tire cheaper. I was offered a used tire that was a different size from the 4 tires that are on my car for $45 without first showing me the tire. No thank you!  The person servicing me was female.  I wouldn't call it a bad experience, I think the customer service skills should be worked on a bit.
