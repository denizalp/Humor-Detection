I just stopped by here, but it's a nice casino.  Plenty of parking.  Plenty of tables and slots.  Even a Starbucks, movie theater, bowling alley, and video game arcade.\n\nCraps minimum was $5 with 10x odds on a Friday.\nPlenty of other $5 tables for blackjack, ultimate texas holdem, etc.\n\nDealers were very friendly.
