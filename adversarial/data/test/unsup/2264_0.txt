I had a friend tell me this place was really good. He said it was a hidden gem. Went there last night for the first time and he was right. The Pork and Duck Bao were awesome. The Wonton Soup was really good. The sesame noodles and pot stickers were great also.  I would recommend checking it out. I will definitely go there again at some point!
