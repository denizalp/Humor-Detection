Best Bridal shop ever! Very clean and open area for family for view your dresses. I bought a Maggie Sottero dress and I absolutely loved it! The staff was patient and friendly during the whole process. Their other dresses in the store were neatly in bags with a model picture of the dress, which came in handy. I enjoy my experience with them so much, I bought my second party dress there too.
