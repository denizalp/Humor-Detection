This place was absolutely horrible. My food arrived late and cold to a delivery man who thought that it being cold was funny. I called the restaurant SIX TIMES in order to rectify the situation and I was HUNG UP ON!!! WTF!!?? I am calling the Department of Health and requesting an inspection on this disgusting excuse for an embarrassment of a delivery service\/restaurant. DO\nNOT EAT HERE; HORRIBLE SERVICE AND A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. I'm traveling and have no way to reheat my food. Thanks a lot, assholes. Totally pissed!!! & still no response from GrubHub.
