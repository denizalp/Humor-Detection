Chandler Fashion Center is a pretty good mall.. comes in after Scottsdale Fashion Square, in my opinion. These are really the only two good malls in all of the Phoenix area. Sad. Oh how I miss the plentiful shopping playgrounds in LA. \n\nAnyhow, this mall looks really intimidating from the parking lot. I don't know why, but the parking lot scares me. The stores in here are ordinary.. Macy's, Nordstroms, Banana Republic etc. Nothing special but enough to get some retail therapy when needed.
