Great local spot with a Hawaiian flair for huge breakfasts.  Lots of pork, lots of eggs and lots of pancakes.  Tons of choices and they were all good.  I had the fried rice and chicken omelette and it was pretty fine.  The red velvet pancakes with chocolate chips and cream cheese syrup really make this more dessert than breakfast but it was a Vegas style decadent treat.  Lots of locals dining here.  Great food and cheap prices.
