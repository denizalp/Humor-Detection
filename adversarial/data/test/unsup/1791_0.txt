At our lunch of 6 people, almost every dish was polished off.  The duck rice has a piece of duck that seriously falls off of the bone.  Mixing the duck meat with the egg and rice created a creamy, just-enough fatty dish that was hard to resist.  The duck bao was incredibly, finished with hoisen sauce and a sliver of cucumber.  And the grilled cheese with short rib meat was over the moon delicious!  We'll be back!
