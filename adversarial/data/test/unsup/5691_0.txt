This gym is great if you want a place to do cardio or lift weights.  There aren't any classes or a pool.  There are plenty of cardio machines and I enjoy the variety of the weight machines. The staff are friendly.  I also like the diversity of the members - definitely not a \"meathead' only gym.  The best part is the price - $15 a month for me and my husband!
