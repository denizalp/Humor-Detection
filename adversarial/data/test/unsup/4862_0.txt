I was here for a Yelp event born in the burgh.\nThe owner was extremely nice and went thru the entire printing process as well as the history of the company, Which was very interesting.\nI was also able to screen print my own t-shirt which was really cool.\nCommonwealth Press Warehouse does small and large screen printing jobs.\nAs the owner said they will print on just about anything and they have.\nIf I was ever in the market for a large quantity of things to be printed this would be my first stop
