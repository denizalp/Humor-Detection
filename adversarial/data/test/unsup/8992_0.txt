Yo I just came from an event catered by these ppl.  The naan was not warmed, the veggies were overcooked and the cream-based sauces were bland and lacking spice.  Sorry, no good criticism for this culinary experience.  Well, maybe one - they didn't screw up the rice.\n\nPerhaps they do it better in smaller batches like at the restaurant.  I'm open to trying it, though not unless someone else is paying.
