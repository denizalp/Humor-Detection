What can I say, Primanti Brothers is Pittsburgh. Ordered a Corned Beef & Cheese and decided to include a fried egg this time. I have been eating Primanti's since I was a kid, and I'm never disappointed with the food.  This location (like most) is a crowded place with somewhat slow service (but I expected this before walking in)  The joint was clean and have a good vibe.  I highly recommend a visit if you happen to be in the area.
