Not my favorite place to be. Sometimes I go here to please others or when choices are grave. I suppose free bacon is cool. Yet, a staged line to perpetuate the space is more crowded than usual on a bleak, frigid Wisconsin night is severely uncool. \n\nThe staff here is actually awesome. Too bad they have to deal with the scum of the earth as patrons. Out-of-town and in-town douche bags litter the three floors. The third floor on a Saturday night is something out of my worst nightmares.
