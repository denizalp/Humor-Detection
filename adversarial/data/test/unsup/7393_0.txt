This bar and small casino is Awesome! Cheap drinks and loose machines! I won a 1750.00 Jackpot after only three hits into my five bucks that I put into the machine!\n\nThe female bartender \"Mamasan\" rocks with a great personality and great service, she love you long time!!\n\nWe will be back again for sure for super tasty drinks and gambling! Oh yeah and they have great juicy and fat all beef wieners! Yum!\n\nThank you Stage Door for making our Christmas extra special in winning a video keno Jackpot!
