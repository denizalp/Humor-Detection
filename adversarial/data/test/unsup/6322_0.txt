Oh Bobby Flay....are you ready for a throw down. HUGE Flay fan so of course I had to eat at Mesa Grill.\n\nOne word...Delicious!\n\nOf course I had their menu memorized so I already knew what I was ordering before I sat down. Just thinking of the spice rubbed pork tenderloin as I type this makes my mouth water. Wild Mushroom Quesadilla is a must. Chorizo-Goat Cheese Tamale sounded fantastic but was the least favorite item of the meal. \n\nGreat service, great food and a Mesa Grill cookbook for my bday = a fantastic dinner.
