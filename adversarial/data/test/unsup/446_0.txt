2nd time coming here and I'm hooked! The food is extremely fresh and delicious . I've had their chicken gyro to die for! I've asked for a to go order and it came packed so presentable and still looked sooo yummy! Everything was so delicious. I can't wait to try other items on their menu. A must try spot if you like Greek food.
