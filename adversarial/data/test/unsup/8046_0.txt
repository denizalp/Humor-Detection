$14 your first ride and $7 for a second.  Expensive but sooo fun!  I went twice and each time was just as much fun.  It shoots down really fast and does this huge loop and turns sideways and you get to see the strip and all the colors blend together... a really good roller coaster and it was not really short!  Try it!
