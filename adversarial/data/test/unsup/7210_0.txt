I've eaten here twice and I'm still impressed with how friendly the staff are! Very tasty Texmex food (best fajitas I've had on the strip), the chips and salsa are indeed bottomless, all day long breakfast menu, plenty of TVs to catch the game, and yes, a variety of nacho options. I look forward to my next visit to Nacho Daddy
