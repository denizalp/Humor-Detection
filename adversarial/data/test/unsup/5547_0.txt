It's a good gym for the price you pay. Membership varies on what type of experience you want. Like every gym it's packed beginning of the week especially Mondays (international chest day).  They have a decent amount of classes if you're into that (Spin, Zumba, body attack, etc.). The gym also has a kids club (daycare), swimming pool, basketball court, and tanning booths. .  All and all a really good gym.
