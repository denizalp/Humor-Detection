I saw a vehicle online that I wanted to take a better look at so I called the dealership and was told that it was on the lot. I drove down met with Thurston and looked at the vehicle was an easy sell for him as it was what I had been looking for over the course of several months. After dome negotiating and all was said and done I was happy with the salesman and finance team. I would recommend them to friends and family in the market for a new or used vehicle.
