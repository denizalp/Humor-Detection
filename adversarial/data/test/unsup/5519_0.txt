Drove all the way to east side from far west side and it was totally worth it. Five of us tried different entrees and we loved them all. The arapas were specially moist and delicious!! Love the customer service. The owner took his time to explain to us every dish on the menu. The service was prompt. Will definitely visit again. Loved it!!!!!
