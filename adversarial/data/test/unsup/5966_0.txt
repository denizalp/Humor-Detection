Great location with parking out back. Multiple floors with every service you can think of for a day spa. I really love all of the little nooks here.  Each area has a completely different look and vibe.\n\nI've only come in for laser hair removal (LOVE the machine they use! Virtually painless, quick, and great results!) so far but am keen to try their other services as well.\n\nFront desk is friendly and they offer you complimentary bottled water, tea, or coffee when you come in. Booking an appointment is no sweat.
