This is such a great spot in the heart of Mt. Lebanon. Their vanilla nut flavored coffee is delicious and a must try when it's available. The staff is super friendly and there's an array of seating options (large tables, small tables, couches, overstuffed chairs, etc.) to accommodate any size group.
