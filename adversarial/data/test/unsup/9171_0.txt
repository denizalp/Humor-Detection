Stopped by here with my wife after seeing the Phantom of the Opera at the Venetian.  I have never been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory so I knew walking in that I would probably have a similar opinion of this place.  Huge menu, daunting really, I had a tough time making any kind of a decision but finally settled on the lasagna.  Maybe I didn't read the menu well enough, but it came out with chicken in it?  Wasn't bad but wasn't great either.  Service was OK, nothing to write home about.
