All I have to say that this is the best Shaved Ice in Vegas. I adore the containers we recieve them in. The coating garuntees no leakage. My small Shaved Ice was so plentyful I put mine in the freezer and had some later that day.  Sometimes there is such a long line to get the Shaved Ice however that is because it is a great product.  Number one in my booK!
