This place is talked into a corner of a small strip mall. But don't let that stop you from stopping in. The service was great and very friendly. Lots of take out happening while we were there. Indoor and outdoor seating but was way too hot to sit outside. The food was very good as was the fresh bread. Just a great little place To spend an evening with the spouse while on vacation
