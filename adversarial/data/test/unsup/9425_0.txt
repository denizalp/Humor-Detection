When you first walk in you notice the aroma of a musty basement.  It doesn't get better from there.  The food appears good  on the menu and website.  WARNING!  iT Does not taste good or look good in reality.  They were out of hamburger meat on a Friday no less.  The service is the only thing I can say positive about the place.  The owner's attitude is horrible and the only thing Brooklyn about this place.  '\n\nOn the other review, I saw the thing about the credit card being overcharged.  Same thing happened to my co-worker.
