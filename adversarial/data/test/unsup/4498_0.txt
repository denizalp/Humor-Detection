I drive a new Cadillac and have it serviced there as often as needed.  Recently, my Caddy needed a spa day.  Oil change -Mobil 1 of course only the best for baby- 1 Cadillac recall to repair head lamp possible malfunction and a custom detail with wash.  Sands is always responsive and does an excellent job for me.  The detail job was better than Lund cadillac ever did.  My service manager is Derek.  He is the man.  BTW- I am not an employee, paid spokes person or family member- just a SATISFIED customer.
