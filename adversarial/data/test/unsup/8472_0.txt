Recently had my \"07 Toyota Tacoma involved in an accident and had it taken to Capitol Collision for repairs.  They did an outstanding job of repairing my truck..!!  Further they were able to save me approximately $ 400.00 on my deductible.  My truck looks and runs like new. Amazing Job.., Kudos..!!
