Walked in with the wife a d was given a sample of the chicken, sold! Moist and tender with great flavor. I ended up with the chicken and the wife had the beef, just loved the both. The sauces are made in house as per the owner ( super nice guy) and they taste fantastic! The pepper sauce is more flavorful than hot and it's just great. Looking forward to going back soon.
