Location is alright, seeing that it's right across from the light rail but the place is beautiful. Set up is nice with the fireplace outside but that's about it. The food was such a disappointment. I had the steak and not only was it a bit dry, but it was surrounded in a pool of vomit sauce. My friend and I decided to give them one more shot and ordered dessert. It took nearly 25 minutes for our dessert to come out. \n\nTo top it off, food is unnecessarily overpriced. Never going back.
