Great post workout treat! Located beneath LVAC N. Decatur\/215. They offer just enough of flavors to satisfy that frozen yogurt craving especially during the summer heat! I always try to be creative when I come here lol. I love fruits so I will make a vanilla, coconut, and pineapple yogurt base then top it with lychee, strawberries, berries, pineapples,  cheesecake bites, fruit pearls, almonds, and a drizzle of hard chocolate shell. Mmmm mmm tasty much?!
