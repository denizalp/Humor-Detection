I went here after my friend recommend this place twice. We had the chef special sushi and sashimi, perhaps I was being spoiled with good food? I don't find this special and worth the drive. Sashimi is fresh, the wait for food was so long, we kinda get stuffed into the corner, actually we did. Portion is small, need to order some noodle afterward... And it taste bland.
