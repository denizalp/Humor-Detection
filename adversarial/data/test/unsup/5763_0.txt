Food tasted good, the service was terrible: after getting set up it took them 1 hour to realize that they were out of chicken and once we changed the order they forgot a side ( and we didn't realize it either until we finished eating) \nThe waitress was very unfriendly and when we told her the food took long to be served she said we were wrong it only took them 15 min instead of 1 hour and she didn't even apologize for forgetting the second side.
