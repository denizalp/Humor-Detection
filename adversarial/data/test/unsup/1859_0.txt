We love Club Fetch! The staff and facility are wonderful. Our pup is always so excited when the folks there great him (by name) when we arrive. With so many customers, it's impressive that they remember the names of both their pup and human clients. \n\nEven though Blair is a White Sox fan, he treats our pup Wrigley very well... almost as if we had named him Konerko.
