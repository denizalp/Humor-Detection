Just visited Vegas for NYE for a week and my husband and I made it to Holsteins THREE times. Needless to say, we're a little obsessed. Great food, great service, and the shakes.... omg the shakes. ONLY downfall is they did away with their coffee and donuts shake. Was by far the BEST thing ever. That being said, the cookie dough shakes were pretty freaking amazing
