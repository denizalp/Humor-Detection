While waiting for my flight, I stopped by this location to grab a bite to eat and some Beer.  I ordered the Sliders for $9.99 and a Dos Equis.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/FTA3Qoa7C4aTx_KE75nJ4Q?select=7QswMGBsDlVMSghNg0dPiQ\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/FTA3Qoa7C4aTx_KE75nJ4Q?select=SYf4mzflGy72ly9Eo_fa9w\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/FTA3Qoa7C4aTx_KE75nJ4Q?select=Z-fST3n5e3h_JZ72td2N6A\n\nFor $9.99 you get 4 Sliders....that's a pretty good deal in an airport restaurant.  Most restaurants outside the airport charge that much for 3 Sliders.....deal!  The Sliders were average.....I've had better.  Of course, the Dos XX was tasty and refreshing....ahhh!\n\nThis place can get pretty packed and it's difficult to bring large carry on bags in here, so be wary.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%
