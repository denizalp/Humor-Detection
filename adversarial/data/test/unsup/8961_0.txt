My wife and I were invited to a high school graduation party that was held here tonight for 30 guests.  \n\nWe showed up around 20 minutes after the scheduled arrival time only to be told there was absolutely no food left.  My wife confronted one of the kitchen workers after she saw him putting away a pan of macaroni and cheese instead of serving it to the guests!  Guests who arrived earlier told us the food was disgusting.\n\nWe even had to get our own drinks from the kitchen.  This place has the worst customer service that we've ever experienced!
