Every time I'm in pgh, I make\/beg my friends to take me here lol. The view is just so magical, and it's like $2 for the ride so it's worth it. Plus- you always make new friends with the people around you so hello! Win-win. Haha. But really- if you're visiting Pittsburgh, you HAVE to stop by one of the inclines.
