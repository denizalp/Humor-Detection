Tried the blue corn enchilada and the previous reviews were right-really awesome!  The pork was very tender and the Christmas sauce was a good selection.  For sides, black beans and a vegetable melody that was very good.  Also had the cheese crisp - very tasty :)  happy hour every day 2-6 bar or patio so a good deal
