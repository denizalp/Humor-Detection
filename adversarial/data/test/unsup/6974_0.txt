I have now been to this restaurant quite a few times, and I have never been disappointed!  The food is always great!  It's one of my favorite places... and that's saying a lot considering we live in the vacation capital of the world!  Seriously, there are places on the strip that are absolutely divine, but they are very pricey and not meant for any day of the week.  Gen is affordable enough for a Tuesday night and good enough for a Saturday night, but why choose?  I think I will just go both nights!
