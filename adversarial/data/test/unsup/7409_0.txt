This place was truly exceptional. We ordered the salmon appetizer. It was as good as I had in Alaska! Ordered the fire roasted ribeye for dinner and it too was exceptional. The cooking was amazing and the staff were friendly, humorous, attentive, and quick. My only complaint was my empty glasses kept getting taken away before I was done chewing the ice, but it's a bad habit so they were probably looking out for me there too!
