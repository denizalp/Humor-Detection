What!? I, Cynthia, is writing THEE 1000th review for Studio B Buffet!?!? Oh right on!!! =)\n\nNot much to say except great selection of foods, beer and wine included, delicious, a wide variety of gelato flavors (I always get mint n chips, pistachio, and coconut. yes..in that order.) And did I mention beer and wine is included in the buffet price for all you alcoholics? ;)\n\nWeekday lunch is $15.99.
