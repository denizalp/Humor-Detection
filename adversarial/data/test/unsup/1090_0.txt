Last night we went down to VBGB to meet a friend for a drink before heading over to Osso for dinner.  This is definitely a super casual hangout spot.  I like the little ice bar that keeps your suds nice and chilly while you are hanging out chatting with friends. Since we were heading to dinner, we didn't eat on this visit, but next time, we're  gonna have to give the beer cheese a try!
