Planned on coming here to eat since I have 2 little ones with me traveling from Cali.  Didnt know it was closed because of renovations\/construction.  Had to goto plan B in regards to finding a suitable place for a toddler and baby to entertain themselves and eat.  Would've been nice if it was posted online or on Yelp that they were temporarily closed for renovations.  Then I wouldn't have had to change my plans drastically, and would'vehad the heads up coming in.   Was very inconvenient.
