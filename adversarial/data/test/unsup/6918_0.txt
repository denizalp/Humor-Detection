I have been to probably every bead store in Las Vegas and NO ONE can beat the prices at Discount Beads.   The employees and owners are extremely friendly and very helpful.   I have taken several classes from Terrie and she is an amazing teacher.   Their classes are free as long as you buy your supplies for the project from this store.  Discount Beads cannot be beat.  I drive about 30 miles, each way,  to come here and it is well worth the drive.   I hope to see some of you there one day soon.
