Food is very good and tasty, had the white meat rice noodle Pho and shrimp rolls, my two kids enjoyed shrimp fried rice. The service is mediocre, no plates cleared as we finished or more water brought to table, we had to walk to counter to take our choices and go there again to settle our bill. Luckily caught the fact that gratuity was added - maybe they should let customers know as the bill handed over? We'd return if in the neighbourhood but not rushing back again.
