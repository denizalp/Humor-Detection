Have been here many times since my last review, and it's pretty consistently decent. \n  Adding a note today tho-DO NOT GET THE HIBACHI SALMON.\n  I went out on a limb and tried it, and the quality is very poor, and although it is Hibachi style, it is covered in a sticky sweet sauce. \n  Get the Shrimp, Chicken, or Filet...all good...stick with those!\nAlso, the Udon noodles are a winner.
