I'm no Chinese food expert but my tongue knows what it likes. And it likes this place. Live in the area so decided to give it a shot and order take out. Orange chicken was crispy and tasty. Egg drop soup was rich and savory. Staff was very friendly. Also great lunch time special prices. Lots of tasty and filling  food for a low price; I'm looking forward to trying more of the menu!\n\nEdit: Kung pao chicken wasn't very good. Had no kick and sauce was thin
