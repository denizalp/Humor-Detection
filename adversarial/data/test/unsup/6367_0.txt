THE BEST chips & salsa in these parts! I grew up in New Mexico, and this is the closest I've found in PHX metro to the salsa I miss & love. Chunky, saucy, tomato-onion-chile-cilantro goodness, not like the runny plain taco sauce and\/or pico de gallo other restaurants around here serve. And the chips -- so perfectly warm, salty, and crunchy, every time! Highly recommend!!
