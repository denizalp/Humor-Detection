6\/24\/15:  Best coffee we've had in Canada.\n\nWe got:\n\n1. Mocha C$3.75 (medium)\n2. Latte C$3.50 (small)\n\nSorry no detailed notes this time.  It was too long ago and I forgot the specifics.  I just remember we enjoyed the drinks immensely and they were flavorful, creamy, and frothy.  And I also know of all the coffee's we've tried for the week after this (which we got on our first day here) we were not so impressed ever again.\n\n4\/5\n\n#canada #coffee #latte #mocha
