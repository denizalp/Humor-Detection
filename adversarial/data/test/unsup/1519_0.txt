Reasonably priced drinks & tasty selection. I like that the clientele is mixed; there are anglos and francos, the hip and the casual. \n\nMinimal set-up - picnic benches, lanterns and a parking lot, but it somehow creates the oh-so desired Berliner feel. But we all know Montreal is where it's at, right?
