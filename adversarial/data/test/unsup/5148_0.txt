The buffet here was surprisingly good here! Sam's town was a little far from the strip, but the buffet and laser\/water show was worth it. They served a pretty good variety of food here. They had some italian, mexican, chinese and all the in betweens. What was so awesome here was the variety of ice cream you could eat. There's about 12 flavors and I had a double scoop of mint and cookies\/cream. So yummy! I recommend this place! Also the price was awesome...$10 for lunch!
