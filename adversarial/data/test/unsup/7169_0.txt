There aren't a lot of Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Lea shops in NorCal we were excited to find one in the Venetian.\n\n\nAfter a night of clubbing and little sleep, tea\/coffee was in order to start the day. What really sounded good was the Lemon Chamomile tea. I ordered, paid for it, then BAM! \"Sorry, we're out\". Ugh. I ended up with the Jasmine Dragon. Jasmine tea is always good. They double-cupped it because it was HOT!\n\nThe pastry selection didn't look so good. It looked like it had been sitting there a while and came from a package somewhere.
