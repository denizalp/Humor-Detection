The good: The burgers and fries are ooooooh so good. Make sure you get it cooked medium...Medium rare was VERY rare for me. Truffle fries are tasty and fresh (but a small portion).\n\nThe bad: Had some bad service here...and the beer can be very OVER -priced for the Avon area...I wish the fries came WITH the burgers...also wish you could bring well-behaved dogs onto the patio and that they stayed open later.
