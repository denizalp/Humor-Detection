We have bought fresh salmon from City Fish for at least 4 times now. We either purchased the salmon fillet or the whole salmon(sashimi grade). My husband and I love sashimi and instead of paying an exorbitant amount of money for sashimi at restaurants, we buy from here and enjoy it at home to our heart's contend. Price is reasonable, considering we're in Calgary, far away from any body of salt water.
