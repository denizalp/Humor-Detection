$14 entrance.  Waited for the front row.  Waited until dark.\n\nIt's good, it's a must do once in a life time thing.\n\nThere's pretty much one of every roller coaster trick.  High to low drop, spiral, side ways spiral.  I felt like it doesn't matter too much if it's night or day.  You only enjoy the scene when you slowly crank up at the beginning.\n\nThe roller coaster could be a little bit more smoother.  My head was bopping against the side guards so much that I felt drunk after the ride.
