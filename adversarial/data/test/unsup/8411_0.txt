Cute little crepe place tucked inside a side street between chinatown and Kensington market....tiny place, only like 3 tiny ikea tables with 2 chairs eat\n\nAuthentic japanese place that serves ice cream, crepes and their signature crepe cake who is composed of approximately 20 layers of crepe...we tried the green tea cake and first bite is like eating a ice cream...sooooo goooddddd, price was $8.50 for a slice of cake, kind of pricy but good\nWill try their crepes next time
