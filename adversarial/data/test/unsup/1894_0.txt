flys, ants, crappy food and filth. all i can say is look for it on a future episode of Bar Rescue. The staff including the owner is constantly too busy chit chatting and not paying attention to customers,  cleanliness but sure know how to drink while on the job. Not all the staff but the female owner and 1 other older female employee had been drinking for sure.  Sad that u can't get any good barbecue anywhere.  If u do find it it is here today gone tomorrow.
