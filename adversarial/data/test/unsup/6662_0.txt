Called and ordered some gluten-free cupcakes for my wife's 40th birthday.  They proved to be very good.  I also picked up a regular red velvet cupcake while we were there and found it to be delicious.  I have only been here once and just ordered a few cupcakes so I really don't have much to go off of.  Cupcakes were solid, cashier was nice, and prices were fair.
