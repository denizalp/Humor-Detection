Weird place.  Couldn't tell if it was a nightclub or fine dining restaurant.  Everything is a la carte and was mediocre.  Chilean Sea Bass for $51 that came on a large white plate with nothing.  Ordered some sides and a salad, again, just mediocre.  Nothing really stood out.  Service was slow and not particularly friendly, both at the table and hostess stand.  Wouldn't go back.
