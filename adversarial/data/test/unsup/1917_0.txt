I have watched this Starbucks service crew go from a High School Co-Op placement level of service to the Beatles after Hamburg level of service. That's a good thing.\n\nMaybe it's the adherence to Malcolm Gladwell's \"10000-Hour Rule\" (hopefully not the case) but they are one of the tightest  run Starbucks in the city. 80 percent of the time I don't even have to request my drink, they have it in my hand before I hit the cash register. \n\nAlso, super nice people. \n\nJust wish Starbucks would add more exciting beans for their espressos.  But it's a minor quibble.
