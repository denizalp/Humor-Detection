I was in the area and needed a quick take-away meal before my famished state led me  to chomp on my own hand. The only other options on the street were: Mr. Sub, Subway, and Quiznos. I wasn't in the mood for a sandwich. I settled on Swiss Chalet.\n\nQuarter chicken with baked potato ($9 post-tax). I ate it because I was so hungry but ugh -- I feel really gross and dirty now. Like I've suffered post-clucker molestation syndrome. \n\nI think I'll have a sandwich next time.
