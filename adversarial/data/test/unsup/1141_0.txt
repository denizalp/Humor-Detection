I have been here twice. I'm a local as well. Both times the food was a success but the service I've had both times... Awful. I had to hunt the server down for silverware and water. I'm a hostess at a cafe and I understand restaurant business. But this was no excuse for horrible service. I may go back because the food and drinks are great but they need to be friendlier and more attentive. I may just sit at the bar lol.
