Maybe if you stopped spending so much money on flyers and put that money towards quality food and employees you would have better ratings.\n\nThis restaurant puts a new flyer on my door almost every other week in the 1.5 years that I have lived in this condo. And I don't even live near the place.\n\nSTOP LITTERING MY COMPLEX!!!!!!!! This is called HARASSMENT!
