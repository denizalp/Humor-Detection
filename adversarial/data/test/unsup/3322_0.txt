Why is it I keep returning here? Each time I come I'm disappointed with the shotty work. It's a car wash guys, not quantum physics, it's not that hard to get clean! Wipe on, wipe off, it's kinda easy. \nAnd stop it already with the windshield stuff, I don't see any minute, speck of a hole, stop badgering me. \nLady at the counter is nice, but the rest of the car wash biz needs serious improvement. \nLooking for a new place.
