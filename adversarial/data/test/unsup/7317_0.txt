5 stars, ALL THE WAY!! \nBest chilli chicken by far!! So much flavour and SO much food!! \nIt's like $8 for chilli chicken on rice and you get a massive portion!\nI have had knock offs of this and nothing has come even remotely close!!\n\nYes, its not like the 5 star setting, but my rating is strictly on the food. Taste is AMAZING. It's a blend of Indian and Chinese so there is TONS of flavour.\n\nOh, and its super fast service. If you call in they can have your food ready in about 15-20 min.\n\nYUMMY FAST AND CHEAP. MUST TRY!!!
