Chicken batter had no flavor. Breast cut in half counts as 2 pieces in the 4 piece meal. So cheap. For $22 I expected amazing flavor. Pieces were tiny. Deviled egg says 2. But it's 2 halves. And they look lonely on the plate sans garnish. Collard greens had no flavor. Should at least be able to taste the bacon cooked with it. Needed salt. Mixed vegetable side was okay. \n\nServer was very attentive and accommodating. The 2 stars are only because of service. Less 3 stars due to excessive pricing for bland food in overly small portions.
