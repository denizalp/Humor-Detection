So to start off the second we walked in, the owner walked up to us and introduced herself and completely explained the whole menu to us. One of the most friendly people there is. In addition the food was awesome. Such a great innovative new idea. Lastly as we ate she checked up on us at least 4 times to make sure everything was perfect. It deserves a 5 star for overall rating for sure
