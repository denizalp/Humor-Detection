Milk teas, which I usually love, don't taste good and so as tapioca. It literally has no taste at all. The original versions of bubble tea taste pretty good, and the lychee jelly is yummy! They have free wifi and lots of tables. \nIt's not as good as many other places, if you're feeling lazy I guess this one will do.
