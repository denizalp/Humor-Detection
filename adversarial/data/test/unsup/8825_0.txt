Scam artists. I would run out of room if I took the time to list everything they said and did. They literally told us they say what the customer wants to hear. We may take legal action and will be reporting them to the BBB but of course they made it difficult because the features listed on their contract are technically correct, it was how they verbally explained them that are wrong. i.e. they said we were getting a GPS system but the contract says UConnect. They explained that the UConnect included GPS when in fact it does not.
