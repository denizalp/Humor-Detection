I've heard about this Pink Box many times, so I decided to give it a try. This location is open 24 hours. It is pretty small. They have a lot of different types of doughnuts. When I went there, they had a line but it moved very fast, so I didn't have to wait for a long time. The service was fast and friendly. But I didn't like their doughnuts at all. The dough texture was flavorless and not too sweet.\nThis place is far from being the best. An overrated doughnut shop.
