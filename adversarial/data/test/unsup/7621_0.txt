Ethiopian food is one of my FUN eats! Not only is eating with fingers different, and I like difference, the food is so flavorful. I tend to like the lentils (wat, especially misr wat). I really feel like I am having a cultural experience and having informative d√©cor helps a lot. I don't feel like I am in a mundane place. Hard to beat that feeling
