Probably my favorite store in all of Pittsburgh. Could happily spend hours going through everything here. They're not just great for gag gifts, but they also carry cards and stationery, gift wrapping, jewelry, t shirts, books! (like real books), games, socks, soaps, and even some beauty products. I happen to love the BlueQ socks, check em out you'll see what I mean. They're sold in other stores too but they have a good selection here. It's always a fun time in here.
