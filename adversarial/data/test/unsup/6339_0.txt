A Gem Right In Litchfield Park\n\nA out of town friend stayed a few mights at the Wigwam Resort.  I have to admit I love the wigwam.  The Wigan is a  Historical hotel that has modernized but has been able to retain the historical past beautifully.  The Wigwam has magnificent restaurant, beautiful golf courses, day spa,  places to walk, pools, bocce courts, and volleyball.  When you stay at the Wigwam you never have to leave the resort because the Wigwam has it all.
