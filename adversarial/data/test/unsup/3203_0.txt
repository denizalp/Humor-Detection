I come here once a week generally, simply because I've grown addicted to this place. In terms of food, yes, but more in terms of socialization with the waitresses.\n\nEven the food though...it's great. Especially breakfast, the satay beef instant noodle soup is excellent. As well, even if there's a long lineup (as in outside the restaurant), I've never waited more than 15 minutes. They're that fast in accommodating people.\n\nGreat service. Great food. GREAT PRICES.
