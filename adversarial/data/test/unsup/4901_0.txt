Went here because of the positive reviews. First of all this is not a nice part of town. Not nice at all. It smells like garbage and rotting fish. I was uncomfortable for the entire walk through the \"market\". I regret wasting time here as it was so unenjoyable. I felt like I was in a third world country's slum area. If you are a more fancy type person, stay away from areas like this.
