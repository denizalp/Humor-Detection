Giant Eagle rules the roost just like the regal bird it is named after. This is yet another vast supermarket with everything a shopper of groceries needs, and they're open 7 days a week from 6AM to 1AM! Kay and I came here to pick up some things during an aborted trip to Robinson (don't ask, it was a misadventure...), and were as impressed as we've been with all the the other GE satellites. What else is there to say?\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FuO3hHwQ-Sc
