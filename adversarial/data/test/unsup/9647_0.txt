It wasn't what I expected, I always hear my friends from California talking about it  to the point I was going to make the drive out there thank god I didn't I've had much better even at the swapt meet they make delicious Sinaloa sushi... the place is too loud we even joke about it every time the banda stop playing we rush the conversation lol and it gave me diarrhea sorry for all the info but I wasn't pleased with it ...
