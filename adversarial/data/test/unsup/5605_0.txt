Make your own salads, nothing better! I got the \"belle salad\" and it came with greens, pear, avocado and carrots with added chicken. It was deliciously tasty with the asian sesame sauce served on the side and perfect after a vacation already filled with decadent meals.\n\nOverall, from a range of well crafted and theme inspired salads to customizing from the very start, a perfect place to get a light but hearty meal that satisfies any type of salad craving.
