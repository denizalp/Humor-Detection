I've always ordered delivery from Sushi Karu, so I can't speak to the physical restuarant. But I have found consistently the food is really fresh, arrives very fast, portions are great and the price is reasonable. I would recommend the Hae Dup Bab (which is like Korean poke\/chirashi don served with a spicy sauce you can drizzle on top) and the crispy and savoury karaage.
