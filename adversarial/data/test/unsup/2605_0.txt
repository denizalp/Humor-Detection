Anytime I can hop on a tram in lucky las Vegas, I'm all over it. This is a  great feature when casino hopping while we stayed at The Vdara. It allowed for ease to several casinos and cut out all the walking I do while decked out in sky high heels. Ladies, you can feel me on this and can appreciate a tram likewise.\n\nNote: Tram ride is free but hours are limited. Route is from Monte Carlo to The Bellagio.
