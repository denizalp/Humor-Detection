I give this place 5 stars for the clothes! They have all the brands I love for work in immaculate condition at ridiculously low prices. However I don't recommend going if you're in a hurry the sales women are super slow to check you out, the lack of music playing kind of made looking thru the racks feel like a chore and they don't have shopping carts so you have to start a dressing room which is frustrating when you're trying to find a top to go with a bottom you've picked out.
