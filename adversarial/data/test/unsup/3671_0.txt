Probably won't eat here again. It's pretty costly for a butfet that isn't really that great ($18.95 - yeah, I was too lazy to get a Player's card). The food is average at best. Not alot of vareity. I found the wait staff helpful though. They cleared plates efficiently and refilled drinks readily. Still - you go for the food, not for the service and I found the food to be average at best.
