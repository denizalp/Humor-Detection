Tried their menu on a Saturday night. I highly recommend making a reservation since it gets very busy and call by phone if there's nothing available online. We sat by the bar, and it was fun to watch the cooking; it was a bit hot and my clothes smelled like meat for days. I enjoyed the ambience and my meal, except for the steak which was over cooked so the meat was tough (wanted medium rare, but got well done). Desserts were also a bit too sweet for my personal liking, but I enjoyed the fries!
