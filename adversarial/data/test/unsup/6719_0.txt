Came here for a Birthday party on the second floor. Great service, friendly waitresses and very reasonable prices. We ordered bunch of apps which were okay but the entrees were amazing. Half of us had francesinha, which was huge and tasted amazing. Rest of the party got bife a casa which they said was good too. I would definitely come back here. Muito Obrigado!
