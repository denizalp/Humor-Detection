Sometimes it's good.  Sometimes not.  Don't show up after 2.  They put all the food away at 2:30 and I mean all.  They take it off the buffet and out it away.  The food is good otherwise except they stop making fresh food around 2 so it's no good by 2:15.  Sushi needs to be fresh.  Hot food is better when fresh.
