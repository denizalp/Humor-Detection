This is a quaint and small restaurant tucked away on a side street. The food is great, service is fast, and the owners and waiters are very friendly. \n\nTheir lunch menu is only available on weekdays.\n\nThe chirashi don lunch is 12.5, but it's a bit different from the dinner chirashi. I suggest replacing the salad for seaweed salad for an extra $1, because the regular salad is just iceberg lettuce with a tomato on top.\n\nVeggie Curry Don\/udon is $9, $10 for beef or chicken curry, 10.5 for croquette. Gindara $18.
