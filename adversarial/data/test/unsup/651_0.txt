We have seen the restaurant sign for many times and we finally got here late night. We ordered shrimp spring rolls. It was crispy and taste good. Fresh spring rolls was OK but I didn't like the sauce. The spicy noodle is kind of plain but it good that they have the spicy oil. Anyway, it was OK not that bad.
