Previous user could have maybe been a little more responsible in follow up. I thought I had it all figured out when I first enrolled... Here I am now with the impossible goals and results .. More than possible! In 100 days I opened my business, got down to a healthy lifestyle, raised over 115k for habitat for humanity. I cleared all the self limiting beliefs I had growing up way off and am on fire about my kids and life. Coraleah might want to follow up with anything you invest in. Just saying \n\n\nLV131 baby!!! BOOM!
