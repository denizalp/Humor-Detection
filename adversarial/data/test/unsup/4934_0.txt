Everyone raves about this place and yet I am still trying to figure out why? No offense but they really do put on way too much frosting on their cupcakes and my mom makes way better cupcakes. Don't get me wrong, for those of you that love this place, by all means enjoy, plus they are very charitable, however these cupcakes just are not on my top fav list.
