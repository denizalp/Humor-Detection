I took my Tisot 8 yr old watch in 3 times thinking it needed a battery. First 2 times battery was replaced at no charge. I did purchase watch at Ganem. 3rd time, I was kindly greeted by Laila who suggested I leave the watch with her for a few days.  She monitored any loss of time daily, called me 5 days later, saying a 3rd battery was installed.  I picked up the watch, working, and pleased to see it had been polished, looking like new.  Laila's professional customer service is greatly appreciated.
