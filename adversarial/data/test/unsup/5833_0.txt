Craziest bar I've ever been to! \n\nIt was a wild, crazy, drunk time and I loved every minute of the trash talking, bar dancing chaos! We had a blast. It's great to people watch and just be very casual and low brow...my breasts may or may not be in a photo on the wall by the men's room--THAT type of place. \n\nThe bartenders were fun, loud, crass, and created such a fun time. Thanks ladies!
