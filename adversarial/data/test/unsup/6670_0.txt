I've had a lot of bartenders make make my signature drink at a lot of bars. Some were on point, others were ok. Our bartender at the Brickyard made my signature drink and I will never forget it for all the right reasons. \n\nIf you can appreciate a good mixed drink, and you can appreciate a real bartender who knows the craft and is a throwback to a simpler, purer time, then treat yourself to the bar at the Brickyard.
