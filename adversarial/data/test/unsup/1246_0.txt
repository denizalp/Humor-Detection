Helpful Stinkweeds employee pointed this out as the place for a sandwich in Central Cenpho. It did not dissappoint. \n\nI had tuna, which is garnished with lemon, olives, and arugula. It was a perfect lunch. on a well crafted artisian flatbread. \n\nThey have great baguettes for sale, and everything on the menu looked very tempting. \n\nMy only gripe is that the menu is very scaled down. A little more variety would make this a 5 star deal for me, but I will be back. \n\nAmbiance is fantastic. Staff was top notch.\n\nWell done.
