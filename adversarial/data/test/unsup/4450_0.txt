This is our second time here and both times have been good. They have an extensive selection of seafood dishes right alongside the expected carne asada and enchiladas. I had chile rellenos both trips. They \"stuff\" shrimp rellenos and enchiladas by topping them with the protein. They tastes great. \n\nAnd they have fried plantains!
