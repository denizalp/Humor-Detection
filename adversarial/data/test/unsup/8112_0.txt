I live two seconds away and we go to this McDonald's all the time.  The employees are always really nice and friendly.  It seems like every time I go there and give them my order they are out of something. It never fails today they were out of Sprite.  Seriously they have been out of Sprite, ice, carmel, pickles. What is it poor management or what?
