After watching a particularly revolting episode of Man vs. Food, I was in the mood for a cheesesteak. When we went to the Beer Engine last night, I tried theirs, which had roasted red peppers, onions, and provolone cheese. It was fantastic! Very surprised. The bread was soft but not soggy. There was a LOT of flavor, and the meat was extremely tender.\n\nAlthough I was really craving cheez-whiz on my sandwich, the provolone gave me the opportunity NOT to feel nauseated afterwards. Thanks, Beer Engine!
