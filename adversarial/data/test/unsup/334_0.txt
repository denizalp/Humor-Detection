We have eaten at both the breakfast and dinner buffets at Red Rock. Some of the food is terrific: duck dish and the oxtail dish in the Asian section when they have it, the toffee cake dessert, the chocolate chip waffles. The service is very good. We wish they would bring back the smoked salmon and the cold whitefish to the salad station.
