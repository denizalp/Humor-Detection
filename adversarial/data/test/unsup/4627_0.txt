I made the mistake of trying something other than my trusted yellow curry here. I had the mango stir fried shrimp with rice. They dumped SO MUCH sauce it overflowed onto the food tray under my plate. I couldn't even taste the shrimp and veggies.\nNext time I'll order my meal with my sauce on the side and pour at my own will.
