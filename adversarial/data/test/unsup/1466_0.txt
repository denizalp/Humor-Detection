First time at Glam Nails for a pedicure and had an excellent experience. The space is bright, clean and modern and prices are reasonable. Great polish colour selection and comfortable massage chairs. The pedicure was thorough including cuticle clean-up and callus buffing, as well as a salt scrub and massage on lower legs and feet. Not only that but they give a mini shoulder massage when you sit down at the drying station! Definitely planning on returning.
