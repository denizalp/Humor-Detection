Another great addition to the neighborhood!  On a recent search for Hopslam I tweeted to Salud and being that they are tapped into social media avenues solidly I got a prompt response that they indeed had some.\n\nUpon walking in you get the sense this place is very much a laid back local beer shop for NoDa.  Tons of bottles to choose from and few choice brews on tap for the times you have a chance to stay a while.  \n\nSuper friendly staff and knowledgeable to boot!
