Horrible service. Don't walk but run from this cab service. Called for a cab at 4:12 am this morning to take me to the Cleveland airport. Told cab would be there in 15 minutes. Had to call the dispatcher 4 more times to find out where my cab was at. Lied to me each time I called. Finally arrived at 4:55. Driver stated he received the dispatch at 4:45.
