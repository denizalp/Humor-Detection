I purchased a vanity light. They notified me within minutes that they had to cancel the order as they were unable to fulfill the order. Then they did NOT refund my payment. I had to call them, argue with them, again and again (one time being placed on hold by 'Shea' for over 20 minutes!) with them yelling at me at some point that they would get to it. I only received a refund after initiating a PayPal DISPUTE!\n\nSeriously NOT a reputable company.
