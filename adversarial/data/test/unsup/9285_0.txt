More like the Cupcrapery.....\n\n1. Pretty and sparkly on the outside, nasty in the inside.  \n\n2.  I didn't read YELP first.  Fail.\n\n3.  Basically the same as what everyone else said.  Dry cupcakes.  Frosting is gritty sugar.  Not even the fluffy or creamy kind.  Just gritty.\n\n4.  I had the oh my gosh ganache, kir royale, coco frauline, and strawberry shortcake.   Out of the four the ganache was the most tolerable.  So I gave it four chances at least.  4 bucks on each cupcake.  Fail again.
