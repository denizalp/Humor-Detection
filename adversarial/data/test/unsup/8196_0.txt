Cavernous, dimly lit, full of stuff. Old school vintage resale. My favorite place to drool-browse atomic-to-vintage era sofas, side tables, etc. Some seriously choice pieces, reasonably priced.\n\nYeah, prices can climb - but haggle, if you really want it, sometimes, she'll go for it.\n\nI love the kitchen set up in the back. Makes me want to replicate it, fixtures, appliances, and color, when I finally own a place.\n\nClothing is very varied - sometimes there's a ton of tempting wares, sometimes it's a bit picked over. But there are gems hidden everywhere in here. Lovely way to spend an hour.
