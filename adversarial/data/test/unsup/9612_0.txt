My company held the annual sales meeting at this place, so I stayed there for a week. Due to all day presentations and meetings I didn't test the spa, but could enjoy the conference facilities and food.\n\n\n Everything was very well organized. The food was fine, with a big choice (buffet) and of good quality. The room was large (compared to European standards at least) and the general setting and surroundings just marvelous.\n\n\n If I could afford it, I'd come right back for vacation.
