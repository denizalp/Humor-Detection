Feeling like an 'elite' watching this movie before everyone does!  \n\nWhat a great movie!   Definitely got me thinking more about protecting my personal data going forward. \n\nI arrived early thinking the movie theatre will be packed and I really don't feel like getting stuck in the front row straining my neck today but that wasn't the case at all!  There were just the right amount of audience in the theatre so pretty much everyone got good seats. The movie started promptly at 7 with no previews.  Bonusssss!\n\nThanks again Evelyn and the Yelp team!
