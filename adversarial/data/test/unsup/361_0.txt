The food is okay. The service is actually really great. It's actually really fabulous apparently. So fabulous that their staff decides how much they think they deserve as a tip. I wrote down a one dollar tip on a tab for one beer. When it cleared in my account, another two dollars was added on. Apparently our bartender felt she deserved a three dollar tip on one beer. Incredibly inappropriate. I most definitely will not be back.
