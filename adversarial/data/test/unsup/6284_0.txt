We three women friends found this very special restaurant on Yelp and are SO glad we did!  Truly delicious vegetarian meal where each one of 8 vegetable dishes was perfectly and uniquely seasoned.  The sambussas were superb and spicy, and the shiro truly delish.  Friendly people rounded out our special meal.  PS Perfect macchiatos, too!
