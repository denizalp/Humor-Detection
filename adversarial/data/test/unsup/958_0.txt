This man has surely earned his spot in heaven. He has devoted his life to praising The Lord and Saviour. He has brought faith back in my life and saved me from the temptations of Satan. I can only imagine how dark and evil Dundas Square would b without him. \n\n Only 4 stars out of 5 because He's the hero Dundas Square deserves, but not the one it needs.
