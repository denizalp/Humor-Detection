I was going back and seeing restaurants I hated this year. I couldn't believe my eyes when the place is actually still operating and has 3-stars. God bless the fake reviews or ****. Anyways, the place deserves nothing more than closing, (not even 1 star).\n\nALSO. WITH DUE RESPECT, I WISH I GOT A MESSAGE FROM THE OWNER OR SOME MANAGER. I GAVE LEGITIMATE REASONING AND SUGGESTIONS FOR CHANGE. \n\nAnyways, if you want to ditch work or school, come get food poisoning! \n\nBest tip for anyone wanting to come? Steer clear, go to Metro Pizza next door if anything.
