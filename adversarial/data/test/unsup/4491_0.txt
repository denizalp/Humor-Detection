Good Bye Funky Munky Cafe!\n\nIt was such a privilege that you were in my neighbourhood though it was just for a short 2 years.\n\nYou were just so different and so Funky compares to all the other franchise coffee shops in the immediate area. I could see that all the students from the nearby High School loves all your drinks and always have a good time!\n\nGood luck with your future venture! And I hope to spot your Funky pick up truck again somewhere soon.
