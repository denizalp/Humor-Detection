We had the alaskan roll with salmon on top,also salmon and tempura with was very delicious,the ambiance was really cool from the decorate to the chef's everytime some one come in they would say( Kangei ) which is welcome I think..If I am wrong somebody please let know,oh yeah the bath room was extremely clean that have a check off sheet on the wall when it was clean last,for us no disappointment here.
