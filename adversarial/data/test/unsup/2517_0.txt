Good value, good location, good prices. But whoa!! you guys in the kitchen ... take it easy on the sugar! I do have a sweet tooth, but I prefer to have my sugar in my desserts, not in my entrees! I've eaten here many times, mainly because my swim team comes here often after evening swim practice, and I've ordered different things each time. And almost every dish I ordered seemed to have sugar as one of the main ingredients. I guess they figure that's what the American palate expects in food, even Asian food.
