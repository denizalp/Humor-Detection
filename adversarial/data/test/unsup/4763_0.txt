Worst water service company I have ever dealt with. First, the water tastes like crap! Really, like tap water. Second, billing has been an issue since day 1 with this company. They will charge you for bottles you never received or received with leaks. Third, the water bottles they deliver look like they have never been washed, which is really concerning when it comes to drinking out of them. When I contacted the company about the issues they never resolved them. In fact, the employees are rude and uneducated. Go through someone else. Trust me on this one!!
