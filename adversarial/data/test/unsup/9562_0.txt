I thought the atmosphere was excellent, lively, fun and inviting. Hostess, waitstaff all friendly! Good was average at nest. The pretzels with fondue were tasty but not exceptional. The cheese on the grilled cheese sliders seemed to be American cheese which I wouldn't have expected and the meat on the Mac burger was way under cooked, and I mean raw ish. My kale Ceasar with crispy shrimp was good and the pierogies at our table looked delicious!
