Consistently good food.  I'm not asking for frills here, just consistency with flavors and repeatability.  I understand they're not doing Gods work here, but what they do, they do well.  Kung Pao Beef?  Solid.  Egg drop soup?  As it should be.  Not every dining experience needs to be earth shatteringly brilliant, and thats ok.  If you like the basics of chinese cuisine, come here, as they wont let you down-  Unless you're a hipster douche, and cant be satisfied with something unless foie gras is involved.
