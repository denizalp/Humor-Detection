Fantastic show! Kept my wife and I smiling and entertained the entire show. Terrific singers, sexy dancers and excellent full ensemble orchestra. \nWe also attended Zumanity during our stay in Vegas, and although they are completely different types of shows I thought Vegas! The show was much much more entertaining than Zumanity.\nI also prefer the smaller, intimate venue to the larger ones.\nOverall I'd recommend this show to anyone.
