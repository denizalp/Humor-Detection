Probably the most over-rated sandwich\/soup restaurant I've ever been to. Ordered the French-onion soup, which was way too salty. Also ordered the grilled cheese, which wasn't grilled properly (and had burnt edges), and the processed cheese looked like it was thinly spread cheese-wiz. Everything was completely over-priced for the quality of food they serve.
