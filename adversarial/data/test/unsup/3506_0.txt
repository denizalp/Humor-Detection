It smells terrible in there. It smells like a locker room full of old women and fish. The men's bathroom smells even worse. I was there during the day time. Out of seven girls, five were ugly. All the ugly girls kept coming to me for some strange reason. I don't think it would of made any difference if the decent girls came to me. The place smelled so bad, it just killed my mood. Grown ass people in the place and you got place smelling like a 1 year old boy's shit stain draws. Embarrassing.
