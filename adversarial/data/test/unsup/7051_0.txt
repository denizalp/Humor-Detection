Small park along the greenway with benches and a water fountain. A large grassy area that's well kept, almost like a putting green. Several swinging benches and other spots for sitting and resting.\n\nA couple of Pokemonners (?) came by on their hunt while I hung out.\n\nThe highlight here is the Spirit of Mecklenburg statue.
