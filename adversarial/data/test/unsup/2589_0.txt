I had the same experience as one of the previous writers. I have a female cat, called spay center and left a message in December, 2010. It should have been 2 months of wait time. It's been 2.5 months and I have not received any call back. I called again today, and the wait time is, guess what, 4 months for cats, and up to 8 months for dogs.
