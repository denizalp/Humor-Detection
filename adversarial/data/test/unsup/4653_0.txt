First time eating here. Had the 4 course dinner....cheese dip, salad, steak, chicken, shrimp and  a fruit platter that is all fondue style.  The experience of cooking the food at the table was good, it didn't take long to cook at all. I would go back again. Also the waitress Jessie was very pleasant, helpful and made our first experience more comfortable.
