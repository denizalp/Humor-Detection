A small place located beside Garden Basket. The staff here are very friendly and helpful!\n\nWe had a pychee lemon tea and an iced coffee. The pychee lemon tea is a passion fruit and lychee lemon tea. It was way too strong in flavour, and too sweet for my liking but some people may like it that way. For the iced coffee, it was good. Nothing special, but would order it again. Prices were fair. I would definitely come back to try other drinks
