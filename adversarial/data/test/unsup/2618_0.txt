Second time here and I wasn't disappointed we sat outside and it was a good choice. We ordered calamari, chicken nachos and poke nachos big portions and also got the seared ahi sandwich.  There was no happy hour tonight it's only Sunday through Wednesday 10-closing.  And they also have one during the day time.
