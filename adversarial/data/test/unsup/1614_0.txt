As long as I've been working in an office I've been shopping at NY&Co.  Its affordable clothing that lasts the test of time and they have really good sales.  Like the day I came here I bought dress slacks - buy one get one FREE.  I also wanted a 3\/4 sleeve blazer that I found online but they didn't have it in stock so I went to the NY&Co at Chandler Fashion Square.  \n\nThis store is very clean and orderly, the sales staff was great.
