I love this service. I have been a member for about 2 months now and it has been fantastic. I love getting fresh local produce, meat and artisanal foods delivered to my door. Every person I have either met or talked to via email are professional and proud of their products and service. If you want excellent service and product and a way to support local NC farmers, this is the way to go.
