Very good food and ambiance.  \n\nI think Mayor Goodman sucked all of the charisma out of his sommelier, because she was more dry than a New Zealand Savignon Blanc.  \n\nThe service was outstanding, and personable.  Very much what you would expect from Oscar himself.  Try \"Crazy Phil's Onion Soup\" to start, and definitely save room for dessert.  \n\nHigh marks for the latkes and the schnitzel from the table.  Go early to get a view of the Fremont Street experience, or ask for a table with a view when you make your reservation.  Certainly worthwhile.  Enjoy.
