Came in with a couple of friends and it was super busy! We had to wait a little while for our entire party to get there but the wait wasn't bad at all! Once seated it did take awhile for the server to come to our table but once we did it was fine! I tried to ramen I wasn't a fan of it. Everyone else at the table loved their sushi! I  would definitely come back and try something else!
