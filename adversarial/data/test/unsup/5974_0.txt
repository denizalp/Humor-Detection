We waited forever for a table and were sat where people stand. I didn't need a side of a$$ in face with my breakfast. \n\nThe eggs over easy I ordered were over well done and had to eventually search for the server. \n\nWe're staying in the Encore Tour Suites and it's sad because, \n\n******Steve Wynn REALLY needs to step up his dining establishments. Mizumo, Tableau, Society were all disappointments. ********
