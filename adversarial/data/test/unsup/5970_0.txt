Delicious!!!!  Simply delicious!  If you like a more authentic flavor and good portions, this is the place.  I don't often like Chinese food and this place is a gem!  If you are eclectic in your taste, then this is the place to visit.  The Tofu and mushroom Noodle soup was amazing, as well as the Hot Pot, the best and heathy!!!  My new favorite place!
