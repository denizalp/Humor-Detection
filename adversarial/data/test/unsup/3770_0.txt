ok so when you first pull up you are going to be like hmmmm.\nbut once you go inside it will bring a smile! it's lovely inside and it vibe is very calming. I got the tom yum with chicken and OMG YEEES!!! so good!!!!!\nmy husband ordered the papaya salad and wings. the wings were  cold in the middle that's why I didn't give 5 starts but everything else was very yummy!!!!!
