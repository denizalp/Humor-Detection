I do not like going to dentist.  Dr. Hahn and her entire office made me feel like family.  From the minute I walked in I was greeted by friendly smiles welcoming me to the office.  Dr. Hahn was very friendly and  gentle but very professional and efficient.  My teeth look great and there was no anxiety or pain.  I will never put off going to my dentist again.  Thanks Dr. Hahn!
