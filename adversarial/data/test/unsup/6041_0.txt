The Las Vegas Strip where all the huge Hotel\/Casinos are located so many of them to see with their own themes and uniqueness. On Fri and Sat are definitely the worse days to drive along the strip since it's so crowded and congested. This is must to see though if you are a first timer in Vegas so much to see and at night it's a light show all over the place.
