This review is mostly for Taco Tuesdays when a fish taco is $2 after 2:30. You'll find me there often! The size is big enough to fill me up & if I'm really hungry I add a small bag of chips. Then I really take advantage of the salsa bar & load up with fresh salsas.\n\nBe sure to join their birthday club & receive a free entree during your birthday week. Thank you Rubio's!\n\nP.S. Dear Rubio's: I would give you 5 stars if you had the taco special all day on Tuesday! LOL.
