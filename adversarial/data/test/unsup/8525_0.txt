Daniel and his team did an outstanding job moving my mother from Peoria to Sun City, AZ. The entire move was orchestrated from Florida and Daniel responded to  every email, text and phone call in a timely and professional manner. Daniel and his team arrived at the appointed time and even called to let me know he was on his way. My mother was extremely pleased with every aspect of the move. Everything was handled with loving care; nothing was broken or damaged. The cost of the move was very reasonable. Highly recommend Dignity Moving Company..
