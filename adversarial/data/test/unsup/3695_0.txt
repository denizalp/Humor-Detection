I was house\/dog sitting for my cousin an was being lazy so I ordered in. I found this place on Eat24 and decided I'll try it. Everything was hot when it got there, tasted great, and all that I ordered. The fried rice was my favorite! Will order from them again! I only gave 4 stars because there wasn't anything that was just \"OH MY GOD YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS\"
