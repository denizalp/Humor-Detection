Dr. Amel is very caring, conscientious and knowledgeable. My husband has eye issues and was not getting the care he should've at his previous provider.   It was such good fortune that we found her as she has helped him and truly took an interest in bettering the problem.  Also the staff is extremely pleasant to deal with - which is not always the case at some doctors offices!
