This park offers so much to do whether you play softball, soccer or basketball or simply enjoy walking and socializing.  Their dog parks are very well maintained and fenced off nicely to allow us to isolate timid or hyper dogs from the majority if needed.  Their double gated entrances are very helpful in giving us leash area.  Everyone here seems to do a great job picking up after their dogs too!  Overall, this is a fun place to hang out and meet new people!
