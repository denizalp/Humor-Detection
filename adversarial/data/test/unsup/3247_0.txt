I would give this place a 3.5. I thought the staff was alright and we were sat right in the entrance of the restaurant. It wasn't very comfortable. I didn't feel accommodated and was told we should have made reservations for better seating... The steak was decent and I've had better. The only thing that saved my filet mignon to giving it some flavor was the truffle butter. The asparagus and shrimp was plain. Considering being in Vegas, this food was decent. Make reservations before dining.
