Needed a cute updo done for a wedding.  I was running so late because our president was visiting and all the freeways were closed. By the time i got there i was definitely in a time crunch. \n\nHaley was wonderful!!! My hair looks freaking amazing and she worked fast enough i was out of there on time,  even though i was 30 min late. \n\nShe rocks!!!
