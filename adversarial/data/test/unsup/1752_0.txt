NO REFILLS NOT RETURNING. So charge me $1 to refill my $6 soda and call it even? These refill nazis wont refill popcorn or soda! I spent $30 on candy soda and popcorn and now you need another $6? Dont make me choose between a cold drink with ice and a warm drink  thats enough for the whole movie. Also the seats are dated and worn and just kind of disgusting. The theatres are never clean and the staff are rude. WELL worth the drive to Town Square where they have customer service AND common sense.
