I am bumping this up to 5 stars.  My buddy and I came here 2 days in a row for lunch.  I got the sopresetta sandwich each time and I found a new appreciation for it.  It is so darn simple, yet so damn tasty.  The mix of the slightly greasy\/salty meat, combined with the flavor of the roasted red peppers and sharp....almost hard.....provolone cheese, stuffed in between that delicious bread they use=in my top 5 favorite sandwiches EVER!
