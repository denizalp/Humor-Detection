NIce place (the inside is better than what the outside would imply)  ... VERY clean ... Pino the owner (from Italy) seems like he's always there and KNOWS his customers ... and comes off as a real nice guy ... but saddly I found that my Pepperoni Pizza had virtually zero flavor ... the pizza looked GREAT ... the crust was fine ... but I'm totally into sauce and there was no flavor to it ... bummer ... still have yet to find GREAT pizza in Phx :(
