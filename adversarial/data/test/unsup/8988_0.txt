I love this place. This restaurant is truly Vietnamese authentic food. the restaurant is, super clean, beautiful and very open...the food is always consistent and so good.  The waiters are very friendly. Best place for Vietnamese pho.  I highly recommend everyone at least try this restaurant once.  You will not be disappointed
