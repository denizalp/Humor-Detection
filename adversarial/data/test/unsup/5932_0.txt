This place is like one of those little diners in the midwest. traditional unhealthy breakfasts made JUST RIGHT. I had the french toast and it was 2 HUGE slices smothered in butter and syrup. It was awesome. \n\nI want to go back and try the homemade shakes and their lunch menu. \n\nThis place is not a healthfood joint. But if you grew up in the midwest anywhere, you will enjoy a little slice of home with these breakfasts!
