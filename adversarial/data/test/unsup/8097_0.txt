Decor and ambiance leaves much to be desired, but the patbingsu (Korean shaved ice) is delicious and affordable. Perfectly refreshing on a hot summer day. I got the mini size, which is actually very large! Honestly I think a mini size could be split between two people. They sell drinks here too as well as some food like instant ramen. I'll probably come check this place out more often for their patbingsu.
