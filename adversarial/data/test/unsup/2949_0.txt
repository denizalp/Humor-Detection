I love everything about Pet Smart..have taken four dogs there for years at the Mayo location...love the organization.  They do so much to help rescue dogs.  I was so excited to have this location open nearer me to use for various reasons.  I just have to say that the employees, especially at check out are not very friendly or helpful.  I have taken my dog there to be groomed a few times and they do a good job and the groomers are nicer...but it would be nice if the employees were more friendly.
