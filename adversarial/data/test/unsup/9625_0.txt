Went for a business meeting.  Business was brisk. Lots of seating. I ordered their portobello mushroom roasted garlic with feta. I admit. I'm a feta freak!  The crust was very thin, cracker like. It was light and delicious. Also had their unsweetened berry iced tea.  Try flavorful. I had been to another location and it too was delicious. You can't go wrong.  Also their cilantro hummus is to die for!
