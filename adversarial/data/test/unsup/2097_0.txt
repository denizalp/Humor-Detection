Ordered the turkey pastrami pretzel bun sammi which is always bomb, the did forget a topping; however, they re-made a brand new plate even though I finished the fries is about 5 minutes. Little things like that happen in the restaurant biz but customer service in those situations are what make the difference. Our server Jon Jon definitely took care of us and the atmosphere was awesome like always
