Love to try new breakfast places and this one has just gone to the top of the list. \nMary Ellen was our server and what a nice lady. I ordered the wild mushroom frittata and it was delicious. Husband enjoyed the Tuscan scramble. I would have given it five stars but our order wasn't quite right. \nThere's also a meeting room available for large parties.
