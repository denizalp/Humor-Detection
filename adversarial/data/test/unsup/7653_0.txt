Such a cute bakery to visit. Pricing seems a little high, but admittedly, this is more of a review on creativity factor, as I have not yet tasted the adorable eats. Very much a Disney-themed bakery, they have items that are not Disney-related, and can also provide greeting cards, decorative platewear, and other novelty gift items in a pinch. Next visit, I hope to try the delectible-looking Confetti Cake.
