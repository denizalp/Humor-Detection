This is the second time I have gone here to see a movie spread by about 5 years. It is an OK place. I thought the seats were comfortable enough. With these new multi screen theaters there really are no bad seats and both times I sat in about the middle. I noticed my shoes were lightly sticking to the restroom floor.
