The front desk just called and said we were using too many towels! They said we can have three sets, yet the reservation was made for my wife and three little kids in a large room. We had asked for enough towels for each one of us--five sets. \n\nI've never encountered this kind of pettiness in a hotel. Never! And I've stayed in many, many on business. \n\nWith all the choices in Vegas hotels, why would I ever come back here? I recommend the Venetian or Paris, where I've had great experiences.
