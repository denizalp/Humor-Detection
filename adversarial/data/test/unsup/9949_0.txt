Went recently on a Wednesday night. The dip (not sure which one but it had marinara in it) was delicious - the waitress added extra pita bread - we were hungry but not starving for a full on meal so late. \n\nWhat was annoying was the live music. I love music and can always appreciate great music -- but this place had a horrible sound system - it was just TOO loud and overbearing.
