I am a huge hockey fan from Michigan. So of course I have to go to see the Red Wings when they come to town. I was impressed with the arena. Of course its not Joe Louis, but it was the right temperature and had adequate restrooms for the ladies. The prices are what you expect them to be when you go to a concert or sporting event. I plan on going back tonight to see the Coyote's play the Stars. This time maybe they will win.
