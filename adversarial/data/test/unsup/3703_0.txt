Not so \"Lux\" (2.5 - I'm not a fan of commercial chains and it definitely wasn't my choice to come here). Value wise, it sux's because It's in Vegas. It's pricey for what it is which isn't much. If it was in suburban Hoboken this would be a happening spot. I can just picture some Jersey chicks chain smok'n and downing the best eva' flat bread sandwiches... oh my gawd.
