This place sucks.. Our server had friends that had sat right next to our table and was not professional at all.. She ignored us! We kept waiting for service but everyone was too busy fooling around. There was even a hair on my bahama mama's pineapple. . Gross I told the server all she did was take the pineapple away.. Hello! I wanted that pineapple! Anyways the food here is too expensive for their service :\/  ..
