When I was younger, I used to HATE going here. For one thing, my mom loved it, so I felt like I was here weekly. I would temper tantrum out, in screaming, stomping fits of tearful rage until we either left the store or I'd convinced her not to go at all. \n\nI've grown up a lot since my early twenties.
