We went to Southern Accent last night for a large Birthday party. A large party is a challenge for any restaurant but they were ready for us. The food was great & the atmosphere was fun. The menu had something for everyone. (You do have to be a fan of southern food to start or at least open to tasty food)\n\nThe Hurricanes are REAL and somewhat lethal as a good hurricane should be .
