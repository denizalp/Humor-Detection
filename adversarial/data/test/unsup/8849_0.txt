This place is terrible! The quality is horrible, they forgot one of my fries to my meals and then I get home they put ONE pickle on each of my cheeseburgers and put like a dab of ketchup on it. After a long day of moving and being hungry, this was the only place open and then they give us horrible food. Super disappointed, the management needs to crack the whip on their employees!!! I only gave it one star because I had to to write a review or I would have put zero stars...
