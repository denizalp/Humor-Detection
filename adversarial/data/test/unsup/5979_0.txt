Stopped in here for a quick morning bite to eat.  The menu is simple but the right amount of options for a morning meal.   I got a breakfast sandwich and my wife got a breakfast burrito.   \n\nBoth came out quickly, were well made and most importantly they tased good and hot the spot.   \n\nThe only downside is I though $18 for two breakfast sandwiches and two drinks is a bit pricy.
