I'll admit that the first time that I ventured into this store last summer, I spent some time picking the brain if the salesclerk. Could the car manage to go the necessary long distances in the West? How would that work out without the required stations?\n\nI also asked the obvious question that everyone else probably asks: \"How did you get the cars up here?\" \n\nThese guys are great, patiently answering all the questions in the hopes that one of us will actually be a real buyer and not someone coming in just to admire the cars.
