After a slow start, Abe's has become the premier deli in town.  Far, far better than Chompie's.  Four of us for dinner this past Saturday evening.  Everyone had something different and everyone raved how good their selection was!  One couple from Chicago and one couple from New York area, so we are certainly experienced deli diners.  We will be regulars (not so easy, since it is a hour drive from the Surprise area).  Service was a little slow in the beginning but our server finally got his act together.  The Abel family has a real winner here!
