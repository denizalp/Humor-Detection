Wow! Walked by and saw this place pretty busy. Heard nothing but amazing things about it. We popped in to grab dessert. We were greeted by Becca. She was such a sweet heart and made and excellent dessert and wine pairing for me. She made my boyfriend some amazing cocktail and it made his night. The chocolate souffl√© was like eating chocolate Air. Top 5 desserts I've had here since living in Vegas. THANK YOU BECCA!
