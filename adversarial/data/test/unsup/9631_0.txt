I happened upon this local mexican restaurant today and i must say, i am impressed!! I ordered the chicken burrito and enjoyed every bite. Usually I am pretty picky when it comes to mexican food (my last roommate was Mexican so i know a thing or dos lol!!) but this food was great. Always love trying new neighborhood places!! Hope Chipotle is here to stay xoxo
