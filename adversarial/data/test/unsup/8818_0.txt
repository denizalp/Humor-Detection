I was very disappointed in yeti nails. I got a shellac mani & pedis- the application was awful- mine was on my cuticles and actually peeled off the next day. The pedi was similarly disappointing- polish off of the nails, very minimal exfoliation. A nice leg massage though. The staff were very nice, but it's not like the prices are that cheap where the quality should be as poor as it was.
