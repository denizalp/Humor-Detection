I think McCarran gets a bad rap. I have never really had a bad experience here. I always find parking, the ticket agents are pleasant, its easy to get through the terminal, the security lines aren't awful (however, I did find out that some TSA agent saw me naked through that new security scanner...hope he liked what he saw). Overall I am a fan of this place because its WAAAAAAAAYYYYYY better than flying out of Philly or LAX.
