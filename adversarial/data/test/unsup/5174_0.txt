I've been coming to Studio Z every time I visit Wisconsin and this was my worst experience to date. I went in for a simple color and although I do really enjoy my color, I was extremely unimpressed with the quality of service I received. In the dead of winter my stylist did not blow dry my hair completely. She also did not give me a \"blow out\". She simply brushed my hair while holding the blow dryer next to it. I will definitely reconsider before coming in again.
