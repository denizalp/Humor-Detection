I've never had anything at Olives that wasn't completely fantastic.  Drinks are delicious, too.  \n\nMinus one star since it gets very loud.  If you want a cozy, intimate dining experience, this is not the place.  Fabulous food, though.  You won't be disappointed if you are looking for a delicious meal.
