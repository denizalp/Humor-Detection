I came to this location with a group of friends. The service was slow. I ordered an iced tea. The waitress told me she was brewing fresh tea so it would be a couple minutes. It was actually closer to 15 minutes. She never came around asking if we were ready to order. We ended up having to flag her down. \n\nWe actually got our orders in a timely manner but my toast was burnt. I know the cooks saw it. Obviously there is no accountability and no one to monitor quality control. \n\nExtremely disappointing.
