Ok so I didn't know I did my review but like I came here after so many months thinking it'll improve but still I'm not amuse to that tocsilog chicken and rice the chicken taste like its raw I mean it seems cooked but I guess it's just the flavor idk what it is then the rice it's kinda hard like its been in the pan for too long so yeah and I ordered with leche flan but didn't get it so I guess I'll just cancel it. So yeah oh well it's very disappointing ..
