My friend was getting married in Las Vegas and I needed a cupcake tower for their reception. I contacted Sassy N Classy and she worked with the bride and I ever so patiently from Los Angeles. Their service was so warm, accommodating and professional. Delivery was on time with a beautiful display and everyone loved the cupcakes. Cannot recommend Sassy N Classy enough!!
