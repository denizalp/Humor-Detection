For vintage instruments and hard to find boutique gear, there is not a place in Las Vegas that can hold a candle. Mark Chatfield runs the joint (and also slings guitar for Bob Seger). Mark is very knowledgeable and fair. They also have a great service\/custom shop, and Rod REALLY knows what he is doing.\n\nIf you are a gear dork (like me) you cannot miss this hot spot.
