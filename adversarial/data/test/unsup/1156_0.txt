I've been to so many ayce Korean bbq's and this has to be the best value for your buck. $20 for dinner gets you unlimited appetizers and meat to choose from. What place does that? None. They need to open another location in the southwest area of Las Vegas please. \n\nI can order their KFC chicken and japchae appetizers all day. Along with the pork belly, beef tongue, beef brisket and spicy pork bulgolgi.\n\nI also love how there is no overhead exhaust fan and instead inside the table so you don't leave smelling like crap all day.
