STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOSPITAL.  I am currently in the emergency room and there Pregnant CT tech decided she was going to accuse me of slapping her.. The sad thing about this is no matter how many times I tell them I didn't slap her they will always believe her before they believe me I hope once I have an investigation done on this incident that she gets fired and people involved get fired it is against the law to be accusing someone of something they done when they didn't do it,  it's called false incrimination.
