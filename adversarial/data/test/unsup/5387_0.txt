This place has a great vibe, food and liquor! Me and my Daughter came here to eat after our drive up from Moreno Valley Ca. I loved the reviews that said they are a \"great place to eat \" anytime of the day. When we got there it was Happy Hour\/Dinner! But the food was really good. I would love to come back and try brunch next time I am in town!
