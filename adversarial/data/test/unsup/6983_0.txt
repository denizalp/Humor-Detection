Have been to the other location a few times and loved it so we tried the new location. I had lobster bisque and a new roast beef sandwich. They were great, the bisque was much more than just bisque with lobstr and veggies. Great food and very friendly. Before people find it its great and not busy weekends, unlike the othr location. You wont be dissapointed.
