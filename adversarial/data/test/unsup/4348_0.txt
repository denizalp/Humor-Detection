This was the low point of our  week long stay in Scottsdale.\n\nIt's a good thing this place is closing. Not only is it dirty and the food meh (as other reviewers have noted), but we had a horribly racist experience.  It was shocking. If they weren't going to close, we'd report it.  As it is,we are just letting other Yelpers know, because it is totally unacceptable in this day and age.
