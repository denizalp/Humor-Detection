The drive through person tried to be nice and patient.  I got a little upset at the fact they wouldn't take two separate orders and pay for the two separate orders.  So, I just ended up getting one order.\n\nFood was just slapped on, not very well made.  It kinda looked like a two year old created my food.  Won't go back!
