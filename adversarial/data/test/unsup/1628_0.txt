Ordered 100 lumpia for my 50th birthday party.  The roll had too many layers and was tough to bite through.  I saw many of my guests unrolling layers so that they could actually eat it.  I ended up throwing 80% of them in the garbage.  What a waste of my money and effort and I was really looking forward to eating some good lumpia.
