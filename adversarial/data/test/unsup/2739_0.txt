Heard about Fat Choy's on DDD.  Realized that my office is not more than 5 minutes away, so got one of my co-workers and we went over there today.  I had the pork belly bao and she had the sesame noodles.  Food was amazing!  Cannot wait to get my husband and go back to try different dishes.  Our service was great, and the restaurant was super clean.  Even the Eureka Casino, an old, small casino, was absolutely fine because all you do is walk through it.  Great experience and great lunch!!  Looking forward to the next time.
