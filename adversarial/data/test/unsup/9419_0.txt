For those claiming they had the best brisket in their lives, settle down.  The tri tip was pretty good but overall this place is average on TX standards - I guess add 25-30 percent premium bc it's Vegas.\n\nThis place is decent - I'm prob more harsh bc if you're gonna have TX BBQ in your name I expect them to back it up
