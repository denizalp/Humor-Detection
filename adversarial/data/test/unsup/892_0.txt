It's pretty good!\n\nI don't think their spring rolls are that great but it's not bad.\n\nTheir meats in their dishes all seems to be sliced really thin if you like that. Kinda like a Mongolian BBQ. \n\nThey charge a bit too much for some things like the appetizers. $12 for Lettuce Wraps app etc\n\nReasonable for other things such as Bon Mi at $5.50\n\nWorth checking out. The service was a little odd. Seemed like high schooler Vietnamese kids. Not super professional.
