Great spot in the biltmore area. You will love it if you're from Chicago or just looking for some Midwestern hospitality. The bar has some Chicago eats plus a Chicago skyline that retracts! I loved my Italian Beef! I got it wet style and was delish! Found out they have private room and catering available. Great lunch specials and happy hour! They even have karaoke on Thursday nights! Heyyy!
