I wasn't very hungry so had the beef carpaccio. My god what a mess!  Unfortunately the chef has taken a classic, simple, delicious Italian staple and tried to turn it into a Vegas extravaganza but got 'un disastro' by covering great quality beef with a slime of sauces.  Underneath this Pollockesque creation lies a few greens on a cube of fried polenta. Oh it pretends to be Italian so lets chuck a bit of polenta in somewhere.
