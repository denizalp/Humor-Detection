What a disappointment. Overpriced so called Mexican food. Only way to describe this place is that it's overpriced bad Mexican food that sucks. I expected so much more from an Arizona Mexican food restaurant. The food was less than average, lukewarm, and way too expensive for the slop they put on your plate. Service was bad and you constantly had to flag down people. The salsa tasted like Pace Picante and the food was the forgotten step child of the lowly Filibertos. I will not come back or recover the time I spent eating here.
