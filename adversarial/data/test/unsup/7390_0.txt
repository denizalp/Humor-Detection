I stumbled onto Fresh Mint as I was heading to the Subway sandwich shop for a salad (I swear!). What I great find for a healthy fulfilling lunch.\nI ordered the curry and brown rice and it was perfectly cooked and portioned for a lunch special. I would have preferred it to be a bit spicier and will request that on my next visit. \n\nService was very good as I was checked on a number of times and was able to get in and out during a lunch break. Yupper Fresh Mint goes right in to the lunch rotation.
