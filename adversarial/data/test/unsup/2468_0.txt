Very good museum with a nice collection of Native American art, specifically Hopi, Navajo, Apache and Pueblo. It is not a very large collection, so make sure to take the tours, which will fill you in on everything related to the Heard Museum. \n\nI was lucky enough to visit while they had a Frida Kahlo & Diego Rivera exhibit. I lucked out!
