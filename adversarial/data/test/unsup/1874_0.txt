Dang I wasn't ready for Trapp Haus- those wings are FIREEE. I ordered the dry rub crack wings and they ARE ADDICTING. \nI was driving by and literally had to make a U-Turn to try this place out. Wasn't looking for it, never heard of it, BAM! An act of God.... the doors were open and the smell of BBQ lingered in the air. \nDo yourself a solid and stop in.. I dare you not to order.\nMy only mistake: not going on an empty stomach to order more... it all looked finger lock-in' good.
