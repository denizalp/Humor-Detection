Been in their shopping mall many a time Rolling thru town \nStill a good area to hang, but not finding as many good quality stores or merchandise to shop for here in the mall!\n Plenty of hotels around area, most good but a few have changed hands & I wouldn't put a stray dog up there for the night. Plenty of eating in area as well.
