Dr. Domingues is great! My beagle Sadie has never loved going to the vet. Everyone here is friendly and cares about your fur baby. Sadie gets treats and so much love when she's here that when we walk in she has her tail wagging and is excited to see them. We have been here for shots, teeth cleaning, blood work,and a growth removal. Sadie is in tip top shape Because of the amazing crew here. I wouldn't take her anywhere else!
