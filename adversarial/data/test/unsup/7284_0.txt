I ordered Chicken Satay and Beef with Mixed Vegetable to go.  Service was fast.  The mixed vegetables were fresh and crunchy, the beef was non-existent, literally just scraps...but edible.  The chicken satay was absolutely horrendous.  1,  The chicken in proportion to the skewer were identical and they only give you four as a oppose to six in most Thai restaurants, 2.  The chicken was sour!!!  2 stars for the fresh veggies, unfortunately I will not return.
