This place was surprisingly good. Their sushi was fresh, and you really can't expect more for this area. Unless you go into Charlotte, this is about the only place in town, besides one other smallish place that I always can't seem to find. They had good variety and the prices are more than fair. \n\nIf for some reason you find yourself out in Gastonia, first ask yourself, why? Secondly, get some sushi here.
