The only thing I didn't like was that it was loud and the TV was very sport-focused (at least when I was there). The seating is also pretty tight, you might seat next to people you don't know, close enough for it to be awkward or people's loud conversations interrupting yours. If you don't mind the loudness, it's a good place to eat! Good price for the portions you get. A lot of options to choose from!
