Great little restaurant for the area. Salads are a cut above the rest. I recommend the salad with the filet mignon. The servers are all very friendly the 2 that I remember are Jonah and Pierre. They were very professional and helpful every time I went in. Technically the salads are Low carb options if\nYou're on a diet. If you're not dieting try their BLT croissant. It's more of a bacon and avocado sandwich.. very delicious.
