Scot is an amazingly competent \"fixer.\"  His work ethic is the highest, his knowledge is the highest, his ability to \"solve\" a problem with my pristine old bike is unsurpassed.  Scot takes great pride in what he does and it is a pleasure to be one of his lucky customers.  I am in Calabasas, CA (91302) and Scot comes to Los Angeles 1 week each month so you have to be sure to book him in advance when he is in town.\n\nFrom the simplest to the most sophisticated repair or modification, Scot is the BikeSmith!\n\n\nMark Geyer
