I went in for the first time last week. There were two people talking at the counter. I assumed at least one person was on staff. I wandered around the store looking to see what they had... Nice locally made pots that I could not afford, other stuff I didn't need. Not once did either person ask if they could help me with anything.  Besides the two folks talking, I was the only other person there. Hrmpfh.
