I passed up Starbucks because the line was too damn long. I'm not a fan of The Coffee Beans coffee so I got a Pure Chocolate Ice Blended Drink, pretty damn good, almost like a chocolate milkshake. I also got a Blueberry a Muffin, it wasn't the best muffin I had but it was decent, tasted like a packaged muffin. Staff was nice but it was a super slow wait to get waited on and to get my drink.\nI'd return.
