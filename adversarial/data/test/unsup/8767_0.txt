Very good restaurant. Cozy and warm. Great service. Good ramen, very tasty and full of flavor. One of the best in Montreal definitely. I had the miso based ramen, and though I considere it was too heavy for me, the balance of flavors and textures was to the point. \nOn the contrary, the matcha homemade ice cream was not good. Too creamy and with an artificial matcha taste. Gave the impression it was nos fresh.
