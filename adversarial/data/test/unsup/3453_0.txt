You'd Buddha Go Here Right Now!!!\n\nTHE UP-SIDE:  Pretty great artifact-like stuff for super-reasonable prices.  They run the gamut of all types of religions and other fantasies.  Great fun for a good browse, and a nice place to shop.\n\nTHE DOWN-SIDE:  For once, I can't think of one.\n\nTHE SUM-IT-UP:  If you're meandering around Ohio City one day, stop in here to check it out.  They really do have some pretty nice stuff!
