Okay, I admit it!  I'm an Eat N Park junkie!  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know.  It's a chain and probably not worth more than three stars.  Hey, the food here is dependable if nothing else.  There's no better basic lunch than an Eat N Park BLT topped off with a great cup of coffee.  Hits the spot every time!
