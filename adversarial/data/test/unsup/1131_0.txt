This is a pretty old fashioned hardware store. Not polished and neither are the people that work there, but they've been really helpful when I've gone. There is an impressive amount of stock. We bought at baseball there! The hours make it hard to get to sometimes (closed on Sundays). Overall, not for everyone, but an essential neighbourhood store that I like a lot.
