Disappointing atmosphere and disgusting food. Tried this place based on the good reviews. It was a waste of time and money.  The sushi was served almost warm, bordering on tepid, and the texture was very wrong, all chopped up and mushy, (in particular the salmon sushi).\n\nPrices were not good, even taking into account the sub-standard atmosphere.  The food was horrible, worst sushi ever.
