It was OK.  Not great but not bad.  Best thing was quality of the sushi and that was very good.  The decor is a bit drab and the sushi bar was packed with cheap display pieces like a mountain waterfall.  How nice - but what we need is a place to set our water & sushi! Oh yeah, no alcohol on sundays!!
