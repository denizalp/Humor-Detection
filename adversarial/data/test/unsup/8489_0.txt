Went to Fame @ The Linq\n....got 8 cream puffs from beard pappa's\n....they packaged it in their cool looking box\n....in the cross walk, walking to parking lot, bottom falls out of box dropping all my cream puffs into oncoming traffic.\n....note to Beard Pappa's, ****PLEASE PUT THE BOX TOGETHER CORRECTLY**** never mind the $28 for 8 cream puffs, I really wanted cream puffs!!!!
