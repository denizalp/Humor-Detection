The food I actually got to try was excellent however the staff was down right mean and nasty. I was verbally attacked for no reason I just wanted to try the fried chicken and watermelon I had seen on kitchen nightmares all of the sudden I was being very rudely told to leave by the staff it was bizarre they didn't even ask for payment just insulted me and forced me to leave. I won't be going back even if the food is great.
