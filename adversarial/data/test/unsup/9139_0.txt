Had an 830 dinner reservation, and was seated at 9:15. Ambiance is very chic, nyc like. Loud music, dim lighting. They brought out delicious garlic bread with marinara that was amazing. My boyfriend and I split the chicken parm, which was enormous, as well as a pizza. Both were delicious ! No sides came with the chicken parm, so a little pricey for 32.00, but it was plenty for two to split and well portioned. Nice atmosphere, delicious food, not ideal if trying to have a conversation. This is a place to be scene.
