I chose the crack pie shake because it sounded like crack pipe. Being in Vegas I thought why not. Props to the clever naming. It ended up being some salty and sweet concoction that filled me with regret. I regretted it as soon as I received in, in some dingy plastic cup. For all the fanfare that came with the decor they could've at least thrown some whipped cream on it or had a plastic cup with at least \"Milk\" written on it.
