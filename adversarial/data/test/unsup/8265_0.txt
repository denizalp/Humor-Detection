Mediocre food in  quick serve environment. After I ordered they told me they were running low on carnitas so ended up giving me what was left and filled out the rest of the order with carne aside. The carnitas weren't bad -- subtle sweetness, tender and savory. The carne aside on the other hand, wasn't very good. The quality of meat looked poor and it wasn't seasoned enough making it really bland. Rice and beans were basic. Nothing that you couldn't get at a million other Mexican joints. They do have a drive thru for those on the run.
