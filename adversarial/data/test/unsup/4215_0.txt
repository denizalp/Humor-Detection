First and last time here! Took over 25 minutes for a simple lauriat chicken combo...I had to go up and ask, TWICE, and believe they forgot my order. SERIOUSLY?! Extremely rude service, laughing at me because I asked if a simple pre-Made order took almost half an hour. They didn't apologize.....oh! And the missed part of my order. The food is very bland. Don't waste your time at this establishment. I will not be returning.
