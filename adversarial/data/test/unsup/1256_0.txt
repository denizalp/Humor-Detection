I honestly don't know what the hype is about this place. My husband and I stopped here for a bite to eat. The line was long to order and it took forever to get our food. The food was not good and everything had the same flavor. I'm from San Diego and the tacos I've always enjoyed in Tijuana taste nothing like this. Pricey for what it is. \nThe garbage cans were so close to the seating area and stank so bad they were attracting tons of flies that would not stay away from our food. \nNever again.
