Finally decided to call and complain after numerous on demand movies haven't been working.  The answer they gave us: There is a high volume of people using that service on the weekend so it's just backed up.  For real?  I don't know how they get away with charging as much as they do when there service barely works. Oh wait, I know they're a monopoly. Please city people, get a new provider. \nDon't even get me started with the internet...
