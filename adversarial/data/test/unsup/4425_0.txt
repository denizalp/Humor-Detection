OH its a SBUX chain! What can you say with a million of these stores but if you don't like your coffee let them know. I don't mind any kind of coffee but if I'm feeling not to drive around I'll go to any of these chains. This location is good, It's inside the Albertson market. Workers are pretty cool here. Shared parking.
