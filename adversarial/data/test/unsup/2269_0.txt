We stopped by Skyfall to enjoy a late night snack. The outdoor patio offers romantic seating and heaters to combat the chill in the air. The view was gorgeous!!! The service was perfect. \n\nWe ordered calamari, chick pea fritters and a tiramisu for a sweet treat. The calamari and chick pea fritters were oily, bland and boring. The tiramisu was almost completely cream and a pretty poor excuse for a decadent dessert. We excused all of this because it's a lounge not a restaurant and the atmosphere created a completely perfect way to end a lovely day.
