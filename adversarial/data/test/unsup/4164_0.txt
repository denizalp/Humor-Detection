This steakhouse was absolutely to die for!!! The food, the service, the ambiance- everything was spectacular! The highlight was John!! He made the evening over the top!! His recommendations and attentiveness can not be matched elsewhere! Will be back again every time we are in Vegas- and will only sit with John as our server!!
