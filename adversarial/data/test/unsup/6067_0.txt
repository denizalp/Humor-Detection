I love cupcakes as much as the next kid (giggles). \nyummy frosting with different toppings and sprinkles on a sweet moist little cake.\nYes Please!\n\n~Cinnamon Sugar\n~Chocolate Marshmallow\n~Dark Chocolate\n~Red Velvet\n\nThese are just some of my personal favorites.\n\nThe cupcakes are a tad pricey about $4 each but they make up with that awesome 'Cupcake ATM' machine which is nothing short of Amazing.\n\nDo check out the ATM if u haven't already.\n\nCheers!
