Going to the DR's office is bad enough, but this place takes it to a whole new level of low.  Seriously, I interacted with about 4 or 5 different people (because that's what happens when you get herded like cattle) and only the PA that finally saw me could crack a smile or be the slightest bit friendly.  No kidding, all the assistants, receptionist, billing person, EVERYONE had something seriously shoved up their you-know-what.  I mean come on people, you're working in a doctor's office, you could probably get that checked out??\n\nI will NEVER return.
