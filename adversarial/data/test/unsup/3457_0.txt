The staff that work in that office are extremely rude and unprofessional it seems like someone hired those two women off the streets they have no knowledge of how to manage an apartment complex and are very lazy especially alma. I feel sorry for people that are trying to rent a place here but have to go through  unecessary bulls***  because those two can't seem to get off their fat a**es and make moving process easier it's ridiculous and pathetic never seen anything like this in my life.
