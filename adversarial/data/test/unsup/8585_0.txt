It was alright. My friends ordered burgers and club sandwiches, their food arrived earlier than mine. I was sitting there for a few minutes waiting for my quesadilla that I thought was very simple to make. Finally my food came, it was very greasy, I did not enjoy my food at all. Then my friends ordered a 2nd round of beer, the waitress kept on passing by our table only to find out that she forgot my friends order. Might not probably come back here again.
