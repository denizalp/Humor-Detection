I came to Jean's with a group of 8-10 people, and the food was excellent. My favorite was the cheesy beef rigatoni---it was very seasoned and flavorful. The fried chicken was also very good. The seating is open and comfortable. This place is great for groups to come. Plus, we were served buffet style which allowed for second and third helpings.
