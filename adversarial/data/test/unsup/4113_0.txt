I personally enjoy living here. My only concern is safety. The community is supposedly going thru massive renovations , including gating the place . I like how much I am paying for rent, especially considering utilities are included ,  I completely feel I am getting my money's worth ! Very  close to McDonald's and a couple of gas stations . I'm satisfied w the location . As soon as I see the place gated I can upgrade to four stars !! Also maintenance fixes repairs quickly ! Thank u
