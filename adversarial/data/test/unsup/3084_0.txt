MMM.\n\nI stopped by Queen Of Tarts to pick up a quick takeaway treat and I was overwhelmed by the beautiful presentation of every tart, square and pie in the display case. Everything looks SO delicious and I have no doubt that it's impossible to make a wrong dessert choice. \n\nYou can also buy starter cake decoration kits and various baking supplies (like different sprinkles and metallic dragees for cupcakes, etc.), which is pretty handy if you're in a fan of Midnight Procrastination Bakingâ„¢ (as I clearly am!)
