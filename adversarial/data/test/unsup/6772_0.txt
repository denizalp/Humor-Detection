The food that my wife and I ordered was terrible. My wife got the lobster bisque which was so salty that it was practically inedible. It seems like the soup was heating all day and probably burned off and got saltier by the end of the day. I ordered the southern fried chicken and it was clear that the chicken was re-fried because it wasn't crispy and tender but rather dry and soggy. Definitely, this isn't what I expected of a $26 dish. I will never be coming back for their food.
