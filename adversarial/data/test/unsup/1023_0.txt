The service department is great. They did a whole inspection on my car after the hybrid battery on my Prius died. They Got the problem fixed faster than I expected and were friendly and professional throughout the entire interaction. The total price of the repair was astronomical. But I guess that's what you get with all this new technology. Luckily I mentally prepared myself for the expense and everything went smoothly. Very happy with my experience here.
