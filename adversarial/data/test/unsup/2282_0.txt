Was not happy with this dr I guess I wanted someone more personal that would sit and talk about my problems. What I got is a walk in lay down and crake me, told im fat and need to exercise and that don't expect any dr to fix you unless you do the foot work. Will be finding someone eles. My job is very physical, lifting 45lbs repetitious for 8hr graveyard shift yet in need to go exercise. Had no intrest to listen to my situation at hand.
