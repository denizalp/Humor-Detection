The little brunette teller was wonderful, I absolutely adored her, otherwise I would give a one star. I asked to change my pin and the manager lady said it would be a few minutes. THIRTY FIVE MINUTES later after being told this six times, I finally ask the same manager what is going on. She ends up telling me their machine is down, and has been all day and she recommends I go to a different Chase... Wish she would have told me that immediately instead of putting it off for almost forty minutes.
