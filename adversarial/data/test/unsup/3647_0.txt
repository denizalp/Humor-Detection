Avoid! Watched one woman leave crying and she still had to pay full price. \nI had a groupon, was 5 minutes late which they said was 15 and charged me an extra 15 to pay for the extra time, but I didn't get the extra 15 minutes as promised.\nAnd the girl who did my wash and blow dry was as dumb as a post. \" So I am pretty new to styling hair, ok\". Right don't touch my hair then.\nI will never get that hour of my life back...!
