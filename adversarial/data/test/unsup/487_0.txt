Pretty good. I'm a thin crust pizza fan. This crust is almost too thin, in a cracker kinda way. Prefer the crust at Fired Pie. Similar setting and toppings as Fired Pie. Friendly staff. 1 kid wasn't a fan of the traditional tomato sauce. Would eat it again but would stop at Barros or Fired Pie first.
