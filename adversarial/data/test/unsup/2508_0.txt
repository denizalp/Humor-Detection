I really, really want to dig this place, but every time I've been here with a group (around four people or so), the service was slower than New Edition's excellent slow jams. Also, when we asked to have seperate checks, the server looked at us like we told her we stabbed her mother. I would understand, but generally the process of splitting checks is criminally easy.\n\nRegardless, the food and beer selection is good, and there certainly are worse things than sitting outside on a cool summer night while slowly getting drunk with friends.
