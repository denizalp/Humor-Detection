Really want to give this five stars for making my xmas shopping so effortless. I found some fun hair clips and knee socks for my wife and her sis. Lots of hip wallets, change purses, belt buckles, and hosiery to browse. The purses were cute, but a tad expensive. The clerk was very friendly and not judgy like you would expect someone with(as she described it) \"Cruella\" hair. The exotic dance wear all around added a nice element of naughty to the holiday shopping experience.
