Update: not very filling. I got 10 boneless wings but they were small. There would have to be a real reason for me to go back to this place instead of going 1 mile up the road to Buffalo Wild Wings. They tasted good it just wasn't very filling as a meal. \n\nUpon arriving 10 minutes before they close they were very friendly and a little busy still. A clean nice establishment. Everyone was smiling. Nice that they were open until 10 on a Sunday night\nNot a less expensive option though\n10 boneless wings $12.95
