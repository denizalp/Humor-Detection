Hmmm, this show is a combination of awesome, weird and burlesque! So I guess there is something for everybody, and there's also something annoying for everybody. Just get a drink and be patient for the first some 20 minutes, it's gonna get better! You'll see some of the nicest tricks you would expect from Criss, but some are too long or too \"watered down\". Some you have an idea how he does them and some will freak your mind, like the last levitation act which is unbelievable!
