I've been here a few times for beers and a casual dinner. I really love the grilled cheese - they have a few different options, but my favourite is havarti, avodcado and jalapeno! I've also had the vegan sandwich with avocado, hummus, sprouts and veggies - it's delicious. All the sandwiches come with soup, salad or crispy shoe string french fries (you can also half salad\/half fries!). Other menu options are poutine, perogies, burgers (they have yves veggie burgers too), chili, asian noodle bowls, and all-day breakfast.
