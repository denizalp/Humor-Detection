a great little location on the east end, surprised I am the first one to review this location. \nright off the highway which is a great location to stop off and coffee up! or treat up! the service is great, the store is clean, not a lot of sitting area, and not a lot of area to park. a tiny parking lot, but this store is serviced by the 506 carlton streetcar.
