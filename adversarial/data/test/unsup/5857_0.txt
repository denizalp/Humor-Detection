After contemplating if I should check out The Birthday Suit, I finally did.  I am very satisfied with my choice.  It's nice because it's close to home.  The ambience is warming.  Customer service is great and the prices are very affordable.   They offer specials so look out for that especially if you're a first timer.  \n\nJasmine is my aesthetician and she is friendly, knowledgeable, and professional.  She made me feel comfortable during my waxing time.
