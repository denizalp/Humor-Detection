To be honest, don't remember much from my meal here. No no no and it's not because I had been drinking (#VEGAS) lol. It was just a standard every day burger, but at the Las Vegas strip prices. I do think the inside was decorated super fun though! Lots of cartoon cows lol. \n\nMy friend's onion rings were PERFECT though, so if you do end up coming here I would recommend them a lot.
