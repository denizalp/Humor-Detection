Best Pizza in Streetsville, Meadowvale area. Only problem is its a take-out and they are very busy. Love their potato pizza \"skinner\". The dough is traditional and cooked in a wood fired brick oven and not oily at all. Must try brick bread. The website does not say its a take-out only and also does not indicate they deliver, but they do.
