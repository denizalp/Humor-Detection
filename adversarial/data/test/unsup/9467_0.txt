It was a great hotel.  Great colors and art.  I felt like it was still trying to revamp and an old smell from like 10+ years ago lingered in all the rooms and hallways.  Not a disgusting smell, but a smell that you wanted to open a window and get some fresh air.  Too bad my room didn't have windows.
