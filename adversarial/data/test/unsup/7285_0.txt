On the expensive side for what you get.  $6 for 3 small springrolls - so not worth it.  That's like $2 per roll - what a rip off - and there is nothing special about them.  I had the vegetarian pad thai - it was very bland - nothing special.  I was expecting something special given the price - but it was so off the mark.  The decor was nice.
