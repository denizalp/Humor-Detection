This company is unethical. They placed a lien on my personal property becuase my builder didnt pay their supplier. I ended up having to pay the bill twice to have the lien removed. The worst part of this whole story is they had my contact info and failed to even call me to let me know the situation. When i called to ask why they didn't bother to call the person if affected the most, their response was \"How many people are we expected to call?\" ummm, the ones that matter? Totally horrible, rude and unethical.
