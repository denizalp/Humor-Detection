My family and I were a tad lost on The Strip. We found ourselves at The Cromwell valet area. The supervisor, George, was super sweet to me and my family. He gave us water, a map and kid-friendly recommendations. He and the rest of the gentlemen on shift on St. Patty's day represented The Cromwell *very* well.
