Seriously, how did the negative reviews come to be? My only experience with Sprinkles is based on 4 day old red velvets from the fridge at work and my holy god they were scrumtious. The flavor was rich and yummy and the frosting was divine! I almost couldn't eat a second one due to the richness...almost.
