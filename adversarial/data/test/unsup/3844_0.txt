Pretty good butcher, but expected better. One thing we were looking for was bacon, and they only had one kind, and it was not smoked - something else we wanted. The prices were reasonable (e.g. 2 porkchops for $6), but not great. There are two sections to the store - on the right it's the main shop where they have all the meats. On the left portion of the store you can get cheese and cold cuts. \n\nMy bf saw that they sell half a pig and this made his day. :)
