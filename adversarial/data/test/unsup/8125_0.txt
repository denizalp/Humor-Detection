I have never reviewed Golden Turtle? Are you kiddddding me. I have had more take out pho and BBQ pork with rice from here than I care to recount. \n\nRecently, I popped in for a sit down meal with myself, a man and a tiny baby in a clip-on high chair. They were super nice about our awkward stroller maneuvering, and the warm Vietnamese goodness was as great as it always has been. If the cold has you down their pho ga is sure to fire you up.
