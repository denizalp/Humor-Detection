Awful. Management should be ashamed. They cannot put mustard on the dog in the restaurant which nullifies the entire hot dog eating experience. Means they put the sauerkraut on them you have to put the mustard on top if you want it. Only alternative is for them to give you the kraut on the side.\n\nReally.... Is this a legit hot dog stand?
