This PA wine store caters to a lot of restaurants, but I can often find some great selections I don't see in the other stores.\n\nThe staff is fairly knowledgeable and helpful, especially if you are looking for a specific wine or a recommendation.\n\nParking is a issue, although it's a lot easier after 6 pm or on a Saturday.
