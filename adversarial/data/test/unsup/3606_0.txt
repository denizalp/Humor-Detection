Quick and easy for emission testing. Got an email today that my registration was needed so took it in for emissions.\n\n-no paperwork needed\n-small charge $17\n-printed paperwork you receive then you go online to renew your registration with ADOT.\n\nI went on Tuesday at 3pm and was in and out in 10min. They do update their wait times on their website so you can check that before heading down. It can get busy especially for the older vehicles so try to get there early or before people get off work.
