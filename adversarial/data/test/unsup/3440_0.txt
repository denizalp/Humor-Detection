* What time? \n= Sunset.\n* Yaaas, it's a date.\n\nThis is my walk, my time alone, my no cell phone distraction, my forgotten city, my laying all my chips at stake, my vocalization practice, my waiting for the American kestrel at the pole, my blue sky eye massage, my strawberry lemonade canyons, my forever seeing new stacks of rocks, my many things...\n\nTo be continued...\n\n* Same place tomorrow?\n= Yaaas.
