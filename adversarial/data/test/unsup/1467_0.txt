This place is great!! I've heard good things about it back in LA.\nThe food quality is great! Not only their meat, but also their appetizers. They have a wide selection of food on dinner menu too.\nThe service is great too! My waiter, Yuhao, is very friendly and attentive. I'll definitely come back with my friends!
