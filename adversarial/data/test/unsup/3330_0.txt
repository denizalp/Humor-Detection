Just like eating at a food truck off the beach in Hawaii. \n\nLove the Kalbi,  Bugulgi, BBQ Chicken and Chicken Katsu. \n\nLots of choices but generally get the Chicken Combo #3 and then get a side of Curry to dip the Katsu in or mix it up with rice. Eat the macaroni salad before it gets to warm.\n\nEvery once in a while will get the spam roll but the last time the seaweed wrap was overwhelming. \n\nI like how they also sell the tiki punch soda and other Hawaiian sodas.\n\nGood stuff brah!
