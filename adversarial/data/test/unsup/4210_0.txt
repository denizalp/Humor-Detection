Although it's not the largest Kate Spade Outlet in town, I feel like it's the friendliest. \n\nGreat selection, though if you are looking for clothes and shoes, North outlets are probably your best bet. I'm too chubby for Kate clothing though, so all my Kate dollars are dedicated to jewelry. You can't beat outlet pricing on their earrings!! \n\nJessie at this store was so helpful! She helped me select the perfect bag, and helped me search for some specific items.
