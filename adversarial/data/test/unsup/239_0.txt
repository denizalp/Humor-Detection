This meal was AWESOME! From the unique and delicious Irish Nachos to the excellent Bangers & Mash and amazing Shepherd's Pie to one of THE BEST Reubens I have had in a long, long time, this was a wonderful meal! So delicious and tender. We will DEFINITELY come back here again. Also, the service was perfect...great advice on food choices, attentive and friendly service, and a wonderful attitude. Awesome!
