This is a restaurant that's trying to provide a 4 star quality and didn't quite make the mark. Open concept kitchen with poor ventilation. My eyes burned from the smoke. Food was average and didn't live up to the descriptions listed on the menu. The brie and caramelized onion tarts are lovely and well worth the $8.00 purchase. However, for what we paid for the rest of dinner, the server should not have been chewing gum.
