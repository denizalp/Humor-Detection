I stopped into this school to see about student enrollment and learn more about the school. The front office staff virtually ignored me for about ten minutes before I finally said something.  When I asked about the school, I was told everything I needed to know was online. The counter ladies were extremely rude, did not make eye contact, and dismissed me like I was bothering them. Since I have much higher expectations of my children's learning experiences and the people that work with them, I went elsewhere. I recommend you do the same.
