Dang. When people, newspapers say this place is good, they're so lying! ITS AMAZING.\n\nI was willing to take a 25 mile drive over to this place after realizing that this place has the 5th best ice cream in the US! I just got the peanut butter somethingy and it was super tasty and 100% original. The ice cream is a little pricey, being as one scoop of ice cream is about $3, though it's worth it!!!!\n\nTurns out the Food Network came to this place, so this place is a 100% MUST COME. NOW!
