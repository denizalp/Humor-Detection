Awful! Much of the staff is inexperienced and they have challenges with the simplest of things like styling with a curling iron and following directions. 4 visits. The first 3 were average or below, but nothing too bad. my cut last week has left me thoroughly disgusted with this place. Asking for a \"trim of 3 inches with some movement\" Got my waist length hair up to my shoulders with poorly cut layers. Very unhappy and sad.
