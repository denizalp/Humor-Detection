This place is OK, but I expected more from a steakhouse. If they charge $120 for a cut of meat, they should know how to cook it right. My boyfriend ordered his new york strip wagyu to be cooked rare* and what he got was a chewy browned slab with little to no amount of pink on the inside. Of course he sent it back. He might have risked getting his food spit in but he will have it cooked right, dammit!\n\n*Note: rare steak should be charred on the outside and bright red in the middle.
