I thought this place was ok. It was way too crowded. My friends and I were practically on top of one another, however still struggled to carry on a conversation because the music was so loud. Beers were reasonably priced but I can't really comment on the games because it was too busy to play. The only things I did get to play were the pinball machines, and the Simpsons one wasn't even working properly.
