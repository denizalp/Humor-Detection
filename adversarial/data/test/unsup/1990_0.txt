With the out-of-town supermarket opened next door, this Teeter hasn't needed to step up its game by much to stay clean, bright and relevant. This is a busy market area with those folks and the \"red circle\" people on the other corner, so the competition is rather fierce.\n\nLots of beer coolers, a really good wine section, top notch produce, excellent butcher and fish counter. The shelves are well stocked, the shopping carts all have working wheels. What's not to love?\n\nAnd speaking of love, the pharmacy here is excellent. There's something awesome when they remember your name.
