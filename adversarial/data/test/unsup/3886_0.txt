Food is good and reasonably priced. Just look at all the photos posted here!  The staff is very pleasant. We were very pleased with the service.  I was afraid they couldn't accommodate a party if 6 because the place looks so tiny from the front, but there is a decent (small sized) dining room in the rear.
