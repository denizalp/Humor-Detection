I met Krista working for an event at The Mint a few weeks ago. I had never had a spray tan before and was quite skeptical. However, Krista was so helpful and answered all of my questions. The process was super easy and my skin did not turn orange at all! I got so many compliments on my tan for an entire week! I just booked my second appointment!
