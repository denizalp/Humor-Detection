I found my favourite ramen place in Montreal.\n\nThis tuck-away ramen restaurant is a hidden gem of Montreal. While it is not that it, the limited seating creates the perfect atmosphere for small parties to enjoy a casual meal.\n\nTheir ramen is very flavourful and authentic. I enjoyed the broth very much and the noodles were perfect. I highly recommend the home made green tea ice cream as well!
