lunch special for under $9?! I'm in. \nThey make their food FAST. Have an hour lunch break and need to be in and out? Pin Kaow gets crowded, but the service never slows down. \nLunch special comes with a spring roll (sadly NOT an egg roll), a fried triangle thing, soup and your entree. Pad thai is large enough that I could take some leftovers home. \nSpicy level 2 isn't spicy at all. I prefer the 2 rather than tasteless 1, even though I'm a weakling when it comes to spices.
