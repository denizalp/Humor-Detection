Pretty cool place. The owner was there in front he's cool, you give your license there then fill out some paperwork then get called into the next room to do the prints. Overall walk in takes about 20 min or so for everything. Cost me $68 for real estate fingerprints. Right off the freeway too so pretty easy access.
