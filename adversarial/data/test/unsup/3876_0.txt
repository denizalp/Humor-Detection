A really good place to hear a local band. The stage is well-positioned and there's an actual dance floor. There's a tall riser for the drummer so you can actually see him (or her) play. Drinks aren't expensive, and there was no cover the night I was there.\n\nSadly, the woman who dragged me out on the dance floor ended up crashing into a speaker post and spraining an ankle. There were RN's in attendance who improvised an urgent care center on one of the barstools. \n\nIt's that kind of place. Enjoy.
