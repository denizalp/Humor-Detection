We stayed at the CLE Airport Marriott and the lounge was closed se we were offered  a breakfast buffet in the restaurant which featured an omelette station and more.  We also had the opportunity to order dessert.  The food and service were solid and slightly better than expected from a hotel restaurant of this type.
