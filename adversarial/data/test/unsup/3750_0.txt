There is nothing bad I can say about the Wine Bar. Its quiet, romantic, and full of the best wine you can get in Cleveland. The staff can recommend a good wine depending on your mood and taste (esp Nick). Their light appetizers and desserts are absolutely scrumptious. \n\nI recommend:\nAny wine on the list\nBaked Brie\nTampenade\nChocolate Truffle Cheesecake\n\nAvoid:\nLarge groups \n\nOverall: Raise your glasses and toast to Market Avenue Wine Bar
