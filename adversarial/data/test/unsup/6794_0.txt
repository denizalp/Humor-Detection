Great selection at (formerly) reasonable prices!\n\nUS Autoweapons is conveniently located next to the Scottsdale Gun Club on Northsight and offers a wide selection of both handguns, as well as rifles, and as their name implies auto weapons.  \n\nYes, they have AK-47s, as well as M-1 Carbines and a pretty good selection of SIGs and other 9 mm\/ .40.  But bring your checkbook because that Audie Muphy looking M-1 will set you back $3,000.  \n\nMy law enforcement friends really seem to like the place, so it can't be all bad.
