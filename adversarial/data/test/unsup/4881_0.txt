The general manager is a stinkin tard.. Lied to our faces that they did not run my credit. I went home created an account with transUnion and bam there it was jimmarsh.  They did not want too honor what they offered as a sale price so they said I wouldn't qualify for a loan.....really with an 846 credit score???? Jerkface!!! This is not the end of it!!!!
