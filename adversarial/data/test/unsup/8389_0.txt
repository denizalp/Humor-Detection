I'd give less if I could. You like to swim? Sorry the pool is closed about 80% of the time. Enjoy spinning class? Yeahhhh, the air conditioner is broke and let me tell you people, its hot, really really hot. Want to work on machines? Get in line, to bad half of them are broke. The free weights are in hiding, embarrassed to show their face in such a low class gym. The people who are members call it the ghetto LA fitness. Do yourself a favor go to 24 hour fitness.
