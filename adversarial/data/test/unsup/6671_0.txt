I always liked fox 10. They are very informative but I don't get the  outfits of Andrea Robinson. She wears the most unmatched- too tight and inappropriate outfits. She goes sleeveless tops in winter months and it's 40 degrees out !  Skirts and dresses  are short - she talks about her workouts all the time too and flaunts her body image.  Syleste is so much more classier and appropriate
