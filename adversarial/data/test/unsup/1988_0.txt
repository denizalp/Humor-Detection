Lola's Kitchen is a neighbourhood restaurant that is doing everything right. The food is amazing, the art, the tables aren't crammed together and the service is brilliant. The washroom is upstairs instead of in the basement, it's clean. Honestly, I can't think of anything bad to say!\n\nThe Summer kale salad made me a kale addict! The Kale Caesar is just as amazing!! I've taken clients there knowing that the food will be amazing and the service will match. \n\nThey have wonderful lemonades, cocktails and wine. \n\n**If you go, call in for a reservation, they are busy...and for good reason!**
