Kraftmad Kay found out that a Jo-Ann Fabric store was in this West Mifflin\/Jefferson Hills shopping plaza and had to drag me along so as to get her fix. \n\nI thought I'd be bored...until I saw fabric with Star Wars designs, vintage Marvel and DC comic book covers... Star Trek characters!!! \n\nKay wants to make me pajamas and pillow cases to rest my geeky bald head on. \n\nI'm so glad I enabled her addiction the other day.
