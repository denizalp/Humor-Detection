Solid place for casual dining.\n\nYou get a lot of food for the price.\n\n-Recommend the the Vegetable Combo Plate with Meat ($12.99).\n-Wouldn't order the New York Steak.  Steak was dry but fries was good.\n-Comes with pita bread\n\n$25 for 2 and you come out completely full with leftovers to take home.
