Nothing compared to O'Hare.  This place was busy, but that's no excuse not to be clean.  I used two of the nastiest bathrooms I've ever seen while waiting on my flight (my husband said the men's bathroom was equally bad) . \n\nAnd what kind of an airport doesn't have a McDonald's?!?  Everything was WAAAAY over priced (food wise, $11 for a cold cut prepackaged sandwich!). Give me a break!  \n\nWon't be flying through here again unless I don't have another option.
