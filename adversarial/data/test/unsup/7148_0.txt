I've been to Silver Eagle to eat several times and have yet to be disappointed. They have solid food that is reasonably priced. Their fish fry is good. I had the walleye and really enjoyed it.\n\nThey also do a good job with breakfast. It's nothing fancy, but it tastes good and is cheap. I usually go with the scrambler. They also have a bloody mary bar on the weekends.
