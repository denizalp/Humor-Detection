One of the best pizza places in Pittsburgh. This is the second of two locations. While it's cleaner and much newer, I still like the old Pittsburgh dive vibe of the other location just a little better. I would describe this locatoon as more family friendly thanks to more space and coloring books for the kiddos. Either location, it's delicious pizza. The crust is subtly sweet thanks to Sprite in the crust, and the pizza is always loaded with cheese and toppings.
