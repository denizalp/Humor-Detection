Was here for lunch on may 30th 2016 at 1145am. We sat in the patio.  The atmosphere was nice. Husband order the burger and I order the tuna avocado sandwich.  We also ordered calamari.  My sandwich was OK.  His burger looked fine until he opened it up to add in some ketchup.  For a $15 burger you would think they would use fresher lettuce.  As u can see from the picture it didn't look too appetizing.  We won't be returning here again.
