Baja Fresh is soooooooo good...drunk and sober! But it's freakin excellent when you're wasted off your ass! Honestly we ate here non-stop, those burritos and tacos soak up that alcohol and gets you good and ready to enjoy the day's events. \n\nWe stayed in Tower ll and it's super convenient to that side...cheap prices, GOOD food, different types of salsa. Oh mi oh my!\n\nChipotle? chile please...Baja Fresh is where it's at! God I wish they'd come to Texas
