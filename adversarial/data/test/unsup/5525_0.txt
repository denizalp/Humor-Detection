I have known David for a few years and have had a pleasant experience each time. This last time I went in and by luck the Kaeon rep was in at the same time. I was able to check out most of the glasses that they had in the catalog and walked out with 2 new awesome pairs of shades.\n\nI also had a great assistance from Monica who was able to help me decide on which eyewear pieces fit my face....
