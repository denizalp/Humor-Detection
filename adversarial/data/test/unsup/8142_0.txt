$25 dinner buffet at Las Vegas?? Whaaaaa? Food must suck right? Wrong.\n\nEverything I tried that day was delicious and flavorful! Surprisingly, they didn't have one item of food I didn't like. Although they may not have as much selection as other buffets, its definitely worth the price.\n\nEspecially that dessert bar. Omg. And I don't even like sweets. That's saying something. \n\nThe only downside is it's about 20 minutes from the strip. But hey, it's worth driving that far instead of paying $$$$ for crappy food right?
