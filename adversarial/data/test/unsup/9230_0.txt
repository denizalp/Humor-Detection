I went back to this place yesterday for more candy and realized this is a great place to buy gifts. They have extra large pez with Star Wars and Shrek characters, fun retro lunchboxes and all kinds of vintage candy bars.\n\nInterestingly, they also carry British food like crisps and mushy peas. One of the flavors of crisps (potato chips) was roast chicken!! It probably tastes good even if it sounds weird.
