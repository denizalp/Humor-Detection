I've been to curry zen too many times to count, mainly because I love their prices, their food tastes good, and I can always get in and out for a quick lunch. \n\nBut this location has its problems. First is the open view of the kitchen, which kinda spoiled the magic for me. Seeing them microwave unwashed vegetables... Kinda gross. Then there's the fact that half the time there's a funky smell in the place that smells like a gross mixture of sanitizer of methane.
