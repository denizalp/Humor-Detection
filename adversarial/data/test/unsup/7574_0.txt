Fantastic tasting pizza and a little something for everyone. I highly recommend the deep dish. I typically have it delivered and have never had an issue with them- the only place in Surprise that can boast about this. The one time there was an order mistake they more than made up for it. Note-they are a little pricey and if you have fussy children, like I do, you may want to double check if it is crushed tomatoes as opposed to traditional sauce.
