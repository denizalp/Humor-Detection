Chicken is kickin, sauce is the boss, the toast is the most [finish their catchy slogan here]!\n\nDefinitely a fan of this busy, fast food joint! Chicken tender is always moist and breaded just right. I've noticed that the sauce has changed over the years but still very good! The toast, coleslaw, and crinkle-cut fries are also great sides!\nCARB & FAT overload!\n\nWARNING : MAY come with regret! :P
