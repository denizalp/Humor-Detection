Costco food court has been a staple since I was a little boy. \n\nYou can't beat the hot dog or full size pizza. All are great food options and the ice cream is fantastic.\n\nCons: hot dog and soda - they don't sell just the hot dog and we don't drink soda. Recent change to Pepsi fountains - ugh. The food court is often completely dirty and blown out. Yes people can be messy slobs - but it's necessary to provide enough staff to keep this area clean and stocked.
