This is a fun themed hotel. I personally have not stayed here but have dined here & spent NYE 2014. This is a fun hotel with things to do for the kids, casino, shoppes & plenty of places to eat. But the smoke is strong, they need to work on their filters to eliminate 80% of the smell. Valet is efficient but they do have a separate self parking garage. Its also a nice place to take photos because of how they decorated the hotel. #DineSavorRepeat
