Just picked up my Irish Wool sweater jacket from Elite. This garment was so stained on the front I really didn't expect it to come clean. In fact, the clerk put so much red tape (to identify stains) on it, it looked like a candy cane by the time she was done. Well let me just say- it looks FANTASTIC!! Looks better than the day I bought it in Ireland!  I highly recommend Elite!  The service was prompt, friendly and reasonably priced.
