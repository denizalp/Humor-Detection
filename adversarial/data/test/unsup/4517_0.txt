It has been about 3 months since I got my breast augmentation done and HANDS DOWN I preach about Dr. Smith's office!   Dr. Smith, the anesthesiologist and whole staff are so welcoming and friendly with utmost professionalism.  They have exceeded my expectations and I love the new me!  It literally feels like a million bucks going into a store and buying dresses, clothes, and swimsuits that I fill out now that I couldn't before.  If ever I get more work done I know exactly who to go to!  NOT ONLY THE BEST IN VEGAS, BUT WORLDWIDE- Dr. Lane Smith
