First-time visitor despite living in the neighborhood forEVer. What a hidden gem! Walked right in, no wait (ok, it was Monday before lunch), and the manicurists were so sweet and pleasant. Not a massive collection of colors, but I found exactly what I wanted. They did a beautiful job (standard pedicure, for $18), with a nice long pumice-stone scrub-down, and I noticed the technician cleaning the basin directly afterward. Lovely employees, good hygiene, and an impeccable pedicure at SUCH a good price. Central Nails will be my new go-to pedi place!
