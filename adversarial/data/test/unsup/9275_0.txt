I'm the receptionist at the tattoo shop in the same parking lot as Jackson's, so I swing by every now & then after I get off work for their Prime Rib special on Monday nights. This place is always vibing! Full of football fans during the season and neighborhood locals. The staff are always very friendly and get to know you. Not a bad place to spend your evening if you're in the area.
