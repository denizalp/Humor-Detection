This place is just ok!\n\nIt's no Popeyes but I love their French fries. Something about crinkle cut fries brings me back to childhood lol\n\nTheir chicken needs some spice and seasoning and Color. It's cooked but its so pale, it lacking seasoning I think.\nIt's no Popeyes lol\nI like the honey butter glazed biscuits! \n\nThis place is just ok. I would go if I was on st. Clair didn't want to spend much money and was Starving!
