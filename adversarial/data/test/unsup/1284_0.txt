I'm not a fan of AMC at all. I always try to stick with Harkins, but I was forced to come here with friends on a Saturday night. If your a person who tries to buy locally, go to Harkins. Harkins is a local theater with their HQ in Scottsdale. AMC(American Multi-Cinema) is a subsidiary of a Chinese company. All that aside here is what I think.\n\nPros: \n-Nice lobby\/Interior\n-Nice surrounding area\n\nCons:\n-No military discount\n-No souvenir shirts or cups\n-Prices are terrible\n-Parking is a nightmare\n-Teenager hangout\n-Loud teenagers texting\/talking in theater.
