Dump\n\nI was scared for my life, You would be hard pressed to find a place more scary and sketchy in Las Vegas...\n\nI had fun playing Bingo, but when we were leaving, I thought I was going to get shot as a police situation and manhunt was unfolding in the casino as i walk out the door I see two guys urinating in the bushes and one vomiting just steps from the police car... \n\nMy first time playing bingo since I was a kid, if i have to deal with this scene no thanks...
