Oooh Loving Hut you are so good for the soul! As a non vegan I'd like to report everything here as satisfying and yummy. So fresh and nourishing!Everyone who works here is so sweet and genuine, what an amazing team! The curry is awesome, as well as the rainbow salad, golden rolls, the flan is my favorite, and don't forget the lemongrass tea. Support local and eat healthy! So happy to see more locations being added so everyone can enjoy the deliciousness.
