Very nice museum, doable in an hour or so if you take your time to read everything. There's no photography allowed, supposedly, but nobody ever said anything when I was Snapchatting away (oops and I'm sorry!)  My favorite exhibit was the Sam Francis installation on the third floor. His story and his work is quite inspirational.\n\nCome on the first weekend of the month if you are a BoA cardholder and admission is free. I also suggest coming right at opening time so you can enjoy the space in tranquility.
