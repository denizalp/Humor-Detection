Wow, I work as a Concierge so let me start by saying I go to many shows.  VEGAS THE SHOW IS OFF THE CHAIN PEOPLE!  I can't promote or sell enough tickets to such an event!  You can get Cirque, Broadway shows like; Jersey Boys, Blue Man Group, and Comedy anywhere in the Country, for that matter almost anywhere in the world.  Vegas The Show only plays here, and you get an entertainment Histroy Lesson there with all they bring to the stage!  A MUST SEE WHEN COMING TO TOWN, OR EVEN FOR LOCALS!
