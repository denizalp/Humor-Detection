I work nights so im always looking for a good place to unwind after work. Since this homeplate opened its my favorite place to stop for a drink and something to eat late night. The menu has plenty of options, everything comes out quickly and tastes great. They have more than just your typical bar food, staff makes great recommendations-salads and salmon are amazing- when in the mood for pizza and wings homeplate has me covered as well!
