Now called FAMILY HAIR..... Thought i was lost for a minute there... Lol. Staff is super friendly, trim on my bangs\/front section of my hair was faaaast, and looks great for cheap! They did exactly what I wanted without the fuss. No push for the upsale. Most places want you to buy product or talk you into adding hilights or color... Not here. They do exactly what you ask for and that's it. Thumbs up Family Hair!!! :)
