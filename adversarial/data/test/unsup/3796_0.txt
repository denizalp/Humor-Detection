The Short:\nPizza so good that it graces God with its existence. I think they sell other stuff but I'm to busy worshipping the slice from my last visit to find out. \n\nThe Pro:\n- Everything. Just ... EVERYTHING (almost). \n- You could tell me their food is made out of people. I'd still eat it.\n\nThe Con:\n- Some of their younger employees have bad attitudes and an allergic reaction to work.
