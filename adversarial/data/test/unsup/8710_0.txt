It was my first time coming here and our server, Kiersten, was super helpful. She recommended I try the spicy cucumber margarita which sounded really strange to me but I ended up loving it. I also got the Thai nachos which were also a little spicy but delicious. My boyfriend got regular nachos but I think the Thai were a lot better. I'll definitely be back
