This by far is my favorite buffet in Las Vegas.  There is a wide selection of food served in smaller size portions to insure fresher food. Buffet includes beer or wine should you desire.  The desserts are so worth it.  I always leave more than full.  The line fills up fast so get there with time to spare.  It's worth the wait.
