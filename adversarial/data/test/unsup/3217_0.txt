This is a decent take on American food.  They have a fairly diverse menu of different kinds of meats and sides.  A lot of your typical American fare- pork ribs, mashed potatoes, etc.  The food is flavorful, but prices are a bit steep for what you're ordering when you consider a lot of it is basic US offerings served at Canadian sized portions.  But with the fun atmosphere and friendly service, it's a nice place to eat next time you're in Complexe Desjardins.
