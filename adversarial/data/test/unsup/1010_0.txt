I have been to this place 3 times and each time was a great experience. Please make an appointment with Angela.  She is amazing and gives close to painless brazilians... IM SO SERIOUS!\n\nThe establishment is clean.  The waiting area is comfortable and there is even a play area should you have your kids.  \n\nThe prices cant be beat. They are the most affordable in town....where else can you get a brazilian for $35?  I highly recommend The Birthday Suit!!
