Crowded and compact.\n\nThe only thing that makes this airport cool is... you guessed it: slots in the terminal! lol! \n\nOther than that, I a feeling of being almost \"closed in\" here with all the people and the narrowness of the hall space. It's a high traffic airport as well, which means a lot of messiness and some areas just seem downright unclean - especially the bathroom (see my pic).  Not really my favorite airport, but at least it gets me into a great city.
