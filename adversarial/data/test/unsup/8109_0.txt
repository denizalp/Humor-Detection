Nothing special here. Only stopped inside because Mexican place had closed down already next door. The sliced Chicken breast wrap was average, good in a pinch, but nothing I would ever go out of my way for. It had semi sliced chicken heated with salsa, some cheese, onions and lettuce. Wheat wrap was healthier, but at 7 bucks it was a bit overpriced. Not much else, except they have a nice patio out back to enjoy the winter sunshine.
