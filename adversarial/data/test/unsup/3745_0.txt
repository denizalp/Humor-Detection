My husband and I stayed here a while back but I forgot to review them til now. We were in town for a concert and found a great deal on this hotel. The staff got us checked in quickly and even informed us about their shuttle service. The hotel seemed a bit dated but was extremely clean. The location was convenient to downtown and was close to the lightrail. Overall , no complaints and would recommend if the price is right.
