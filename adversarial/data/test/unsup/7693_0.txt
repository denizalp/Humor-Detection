STK was a really great experience. Overall I've been here twice since coming to Vegas and enjoyed both times equally. The steaks are great, even though I've had better at other spots on the strip- but the ambiance makes this place! Really cool decor and great drinks set it apart in my mind. Try it out if you happen to be staying at the Cosmo!!
