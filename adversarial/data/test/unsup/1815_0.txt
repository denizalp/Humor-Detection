Can I give it zero stars? Horrible food, horrible milkshakes, horrible customer service, horrible wait time. Don't waste your time. Go to the Chickfila, and if that is closed, just go home because this place really shouldn't exist it's that bad.\n\nI came at 9:30 pm and waited for my food for 15 minutes. The workers were impatient and rude and the lady at the window didn't say a single thing when she handed me my food. I couldn't even ask for napkins because she had already closed the window. This place is a disaster.
