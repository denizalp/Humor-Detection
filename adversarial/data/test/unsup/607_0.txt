The Nauti's Happy Hour is on point.  As a matter of fact that's the only thing I am qualified to review because even though I have been here a few times, I was on a specific mission: Pumking on tap for $3 at Happy Hour is a rare pearl indeed. Such a great beer, such a great price. And half a dozen Blue Points for $5 didn't hurt the Happy Hour cause either. They were fresh and delicious. The staff is also laid back yet eager to please. Win.win.win.
