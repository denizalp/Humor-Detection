The feeling walking in was amazing. Great music and vibe.\n\nThen we sat down at the bar. \nTerrible service with no sort of personality at all. Except for the tall girl, she had a lil happiness going for her. The rest of the bartenders seem that they don't want to be here. And if you want to pay 15.00 for a crappy version of totinos pizza, go right ahead. The crust is a tortilla and their sauce tasted like ketchup. Great feel but that's it. And this place is supposed to be nice?  It'll be nice not coming back here.
