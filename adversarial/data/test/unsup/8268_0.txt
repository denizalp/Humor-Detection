This place is disgusting. My coworkers warned me, My friends warned me, but I wanted to try it out. Never again will I think of staying here again. \n\nThe towels are yellow and some are stained, the shower overflows, there was an empty bottle of water on the floor when we first entered the room. There are no mirrors in the rooms besides the one in the bathroom. \n\nThe place smells like sweat covered in febreeze aroma cigarettes. Wow. This place is the worst hotel in Vegas. I do not recommend anyone to stay here.
