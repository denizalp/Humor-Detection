Best experience so far at any KBBQ establishment. Our server Michalina was quick with everything especially the proteins. The portions were very filling and I stuffed my face until I was in pain. The KFC that Michalina recommended  was awesome as well as the rest of meat recommendations. The flavorful marinades really shine through. The Cajun shrimp is good as well as the Red Wine Pork Belly. Come here early and leave late. No pictures because my hands were full the whole time.
