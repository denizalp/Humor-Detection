Good food? Check. \nGood drinks? Check. \nGood atmosphere? Check. \nTornado, where have you been? \n\nThis place dished up the best late night burger I think I've ever eaten in a hip atmosphere that made me feel like a super cool cat. Add an onion ring to whatever to order for a buck. A buck for an onion ring? Yah. But it's mammoth!
