I'm sorry, but give me balsamic, bread, and crayons, and I'm happy.\n\nIt's probably not technically the most chic place to go, but it sure is fun after work with co-workers.  And to think the waitstaff learned to write upside down in two crayons.  That's talent.  I always seem to get an awesome wait-person and the dishes are satisfactory.\n\nBig group of tired, overworked adults = crazy jokes and semi-loud laughing.  And we didn't even order any alcohol.  The staff didn't seem to mind us there, so we were ultra comfortable making our lunch last longer.
