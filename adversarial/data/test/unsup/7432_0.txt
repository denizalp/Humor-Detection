Great meal especially considering the cost and location.  Staff was great.  Went over the menu and specials and answered all our questions.  They had a great 1\/2 off wine special when we were there.  Charcuterie board was very good (especially for the price compared to other restaurants on the strip)  The Ravioli was incredible and I could eat the Sopressata Pizza every day.  Loved it and will return often.
