Went here for lunch recently and the prices were decent for a casino and when I ordered coffee they brought a full thermos and left it on the table for me. So... of COURSE, my amped up self is going to give this place a good review. The grilled shrimp salad I had was good and just big enough for a lunch entry. Eggs Benedict were about an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10.\n\nAtmosphere was loud enough for my kid to sing and not really be heard.
