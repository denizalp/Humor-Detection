Never had tried anything like this before.  Really liked it!  \n\nI'm from Wisconsin where we like our ice cream to be real and creamy, so I was a little hesitant to try something that was shaved off a block of ice!  \n\nHave to admit, this hit the spot.  Lots of flavor and really refreshing.  Don't think it will replace good old fashion ice cream, but on a hot day this may be a great option.
