Lego my Lego. Wait, isn't that a commercial?\n\nWho doesn't love Lego? Possibly the ultimate kids toy. It also builds all kinds of skills as well. Unfortunately when they start putting stores in malls owned by Lego, you can predict what's going to happen and indeed it is so unbelievably expensive. We checked it out very briefly as part of our walking tour of the Beachwood Mall. It was pretty cool, but pricy.\n\nThe stores are very cool for kids, and even some adults, for sure, but I mean.... $$$$$$$$$$. Yeah.
