The Mr. Rogers exhibit was incredible. I was hoping the other exhibits would have more substance. There were nearly the amount of artifacts I expected. I do wish there had been a teacher discount since many of the other museums offered one since we just had our National AFT Convention in Pittsburgh and this museum was one block from the convention center.
