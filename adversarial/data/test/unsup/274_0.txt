Went to my cousin's wedding on Saturday,the manager was soo polite and helpful,she was doing everything in her power to make us feel special on my cousins special day! What a treat, everyone was super polite and service was fast and elegant, meats were hot off the fire and super delicious,don't know why all the bad reviews,they did a rocking job from start to finish,oo and the salad bar is gorgeous! Great job everyone,we will definitely be back to try the brunch.best night ever!!thank you
