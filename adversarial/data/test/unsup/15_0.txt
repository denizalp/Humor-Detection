Went there for my 21st birthday...was terribly disappointed by the food that we ordered. Everything was extremely greasy. The only plus this place has is the beer. But if you're looking for good food, there are plenty of other places around. Also, service is sub-par, with the waitresses not knowing much about the menu and not checking on the table as often as they should.
