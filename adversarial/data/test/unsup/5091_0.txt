Went at 8 pm on a Thursday night and it was almost empty  when we got there.   The place looks nice but the host was wearing a Tshirt, which I thought was oddly casual.         While we were there, a large group came in and raised the energy level of the place.\n\nService was quick and friendly, and the food was good - perhaps a slight salty.     I probably wouldn;t seek it out, but would be happy to eat there again
