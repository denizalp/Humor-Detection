Caught Pawn Stars all weekend long randomly when we were actually in the hotel room, so on the last day we decided to go find the place. \n\nThe place definitely looks nicer on TV than in person but we did spot a bunch of items that we had just seen in the aired episodes so that was kinda cool. There was a lot of stuff that just wasn't that interesting or you'd had to be into a certain collectible to understand. At least it wasn't crowded but none of the cast were there either.\n\nStill love to watch the show!
