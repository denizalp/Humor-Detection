The facility is clean, and well kept. However, the selection is really small, and the very few study areas offer no privacy at all whatsoever.  I found the library to be pretty loud, as there was a large number of mothers with their kids.  The \"quiet zone\" tucked in the corner does very little to shield the noise.  Also, there aren't any outlets in the seating areas, in case you want\/need to study with a laptop.
