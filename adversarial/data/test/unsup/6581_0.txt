I guess this food would be good to you if you've never had exceptional Chinese (Americanized) food. I've tried their fried rice, lo mein noodles, pot stickers, steamed dumplings, egg rolls, egg drop soup, and hunan chicken in two separate visits (wanted to give them a second chance). \n\nThe customer service is adequate. They're not blatantly rude, but they don't go out of their way to be helpful (this includes the delivery guy). \n\nThe one star is literally for the chips that come with the egg drop soup. This review is not an exaggeration. Good luck!
