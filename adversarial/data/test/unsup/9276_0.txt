Delicious tea, better than most teas that I've ever had. Great smoothies and milk teas with boba as well. Same is to be said about the staff. Truly more friendly and helpful than most stores I've ever been to, bar none. The environment is very trendy and inviting. Highly recommend over something more chain like such as the usual Starbucks or Dutch bros.
