SCAM, SCAM, SCAM!\n\nI booked a room at this hotel using their website, and months later, called to confirm the reservation only to find out that the website was made by a third-party, and that they had no record of my reservation.  My credit card was charged $200 but they wouldn't honor the reservation or the rate even though they had rooms available.  Management took absolutely no responsibility!\n\nDON'T STAY HERE!
