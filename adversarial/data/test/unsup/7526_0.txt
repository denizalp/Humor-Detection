The service and the ambience are most enjoyable. In fact, if those are your two greatest needs, I would go here. They also offer valet service for \"free\".\nAs to the food. No true complaints just a heads up...some is exceptionally ordinary but the atmosphere and service and all I suppose give way to the upcharge. \nIf and when I go back, I would make sure to order something I do not make or cannot get down the street.
