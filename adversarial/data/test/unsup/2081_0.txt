Honestly, the worst service and hibachi I have ever had. And I am never one to actually complain about anything at a restaurant. The service was unprofessional and almost nonexistent. And the tables were covered in sauce. We waited 15 minutes to even see our server. When we finally got our food, it was barely warm and completely flavorless. Very disappointed when expecting a nice dinner and then overpaid for food we barely ate. The only thing I will recommend is the sushi. The three rivers roll was perfect.
