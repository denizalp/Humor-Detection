Is this the only airport in the world with actual slot machines? For some strange reason I always get a good payout here - this is Vegas' way of saying \"please come back asap, Sebastian\".\n\nThe airport is close to the South Strip hotels (around $15 via taxi) and $20-25 to the northbound hotels. The closest hotels are probably Tuscany \/ Mandalay Bay \/ Excalibur.
