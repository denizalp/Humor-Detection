Definitely one of the coolest bars in Phoenix.  Hidden, so you'll never know about it unless you know about it, and even then, will probably walk all over the wierd office complex it is in to find it.  But once inside, it's dark, woody, hip, just perfect really.  Even the crowd is not so douchy, it seemed.
