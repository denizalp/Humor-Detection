AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!!! I've had cake pops and the white chocolate cake. I was thinking about that cake the next day, and the day after that. One day I wasn't feeling well, and hadn't eaten all day but I still wanted that white chocolate cake!!!! The cake pops are soooo good. I've had other cake pops but these 'TAKE THE CAKE' literally. You haven't had a cake pop or white chocolate cake until you have 'Tasted and Seen' that it is GOOD!!!!!
