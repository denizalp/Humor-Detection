Ode to a Sunflour Bakery\n\nWake me up -\nCoffee in my cup -\nSee a muffin or a cinnamon roll and they're both bigger than my coffee cup! \nVegetarian options galore -\nMake my tummy happy and my head soar! \n\nGuys! Sunflour Baking Company is cleverly named with a little pun to make them extra fun. If you haven't been to Sunflour yet, there's no reason to delay your trip!
