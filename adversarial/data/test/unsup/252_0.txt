This is my third visit. The first two visits were great. Everything is clean and organized. I always am happier if the salon uses the disposable liners. The manicurists do not rush and they do careful work.\nThey have options as well. I've done the Firewalker\"  and the \"Icedancer\". Both excellent.\nI still like to be able to walk in instead of make an appt cause I'm spontaneous when it comes to my nails. So far on my 3 walk-ins I've been very pleased with the results.
