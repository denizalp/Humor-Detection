So glad they now have a location on the west side. Doesn't matter if you are a professional pit master or a backyard burger flipper they will have whatever you need. The selection of rubs and sauces is awesome and mostly local. Also be sure to check out upcoming cooking and smoking classes. Nothing but top notch. Bob at the Arrowhead store is always a big help
