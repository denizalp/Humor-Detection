My sister in law was hit by a school bus one morning!  It was a terrifying time for our whole family.  Eric Marshall showed up immediately at her home.  He calmed the situation.  He took care of it all!  For months she was able to focus on recovery and he took care of all the headaches!  He was heaven sent!  So friendly, sincerely concerned and patient!  I highly recommend Eric Marshall and his law firm!
