I was wondering why there weren't many lunch reviews... cuz they are just ok. \n\nI had a steak burger, cooked medium (blech) salad and beans. \n\nSalad, sad little boring salad with packaged Blue cheese, even though they serve blue cheese crumbles as a topping for the burger. \n\nBurger was fried, I would say well done but still juicy, no seasoning.\n\nBeans were wonderful. \n\nBisquit was good. \n\nAll-in-all \"GO FIR BREAKFAST\". (you like my country slang?)
