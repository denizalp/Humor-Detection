Kensington Market might be a little touristy sometimes but I like how the neighbourhood been evolving. \n\nEvery time when I am down there wandering around, there are always new places to eat and drink. New coffee shops to chill a little or new place to pick up some snacks.\n\nMade me feel like a tourist myself too!
