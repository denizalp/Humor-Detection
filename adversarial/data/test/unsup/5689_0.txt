My favorite place for frozen drinks on the strip. They have a variety of cool flavours with fun names.\n\nLocated in Ceasers Palace casino.\nIt is a walk up bar. Besides the frozen drinks, they also have mixed cocktails, beer and the shot of the day.\n\n They add the alcohol to the cup, then add the frozen mix, then float a shot on top.\n\nI had a purple haze with 2 shots of grape vodka. It was amazing!\n\nKeep your cup for refills as this will save you a dollar.
