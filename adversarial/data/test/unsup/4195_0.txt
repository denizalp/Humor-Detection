POSER ALERT! These 'bertos bite so hard, they even have almost the same logo as Filibertos. It fooled me...I swooped in for a lard infused breakfast burrito to feed my third chin. It wasn't good, which weirded me out because I thought I went through a Filly-Bs, and everything there is good. I looked at my cup, saw the rip off logo, and started sobbing. I had been taken! Like 'drop the soap in the shower in jail' taken. And who wouldn't cry if that happened? Anyways...this place is NOT Filly Bs, so don't go. Freaking POSERS.
