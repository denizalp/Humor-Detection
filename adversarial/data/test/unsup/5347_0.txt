I was really looking forward to trying this place, but it was a disappointment. The fish wasn't fresh at all honestly, and the rice and fish ratio is way off. I did like the udon from the AYCE, but I'm coming here for the fish not the side dishes. \n\nAlso our waitress left and no one checked on us for 20 minutes. When someone finally came we ordered our dessert, I got a strawberry mochi. I asked the waitress if I could have a pair scissor to cut it and she told me they don't have scissors... ok.
