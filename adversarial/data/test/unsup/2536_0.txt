Stayed at this hotel for a conference. The parking was a nightmare as the garages surrounding the hotel were all full and I was constantly having to move my car to different spots each morning and each evening. The hotel was not helpful with this issue. The staff was not very friendly during check in or check out and was not able to provide a receipt for stay. All around bad experience and I would not recommend this hotel.
