I come here the few times a year I see movies and it is just a generic movie theatre.  For the price I figure it works just fine for me.  The seats don't seem too disgusting and it isn't terribly over crowded so it works for two-hours.  Now that I am writing this review I'm thinking maybe I should branch out a bit more and see if there are nicer theatres near me- maybe I'd go to the movies more?- but this place is convenient to get to...
