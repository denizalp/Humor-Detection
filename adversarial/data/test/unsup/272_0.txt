This Starbucks is always busy and there are no spots for parking. If you don't park in one of the \"Starbucks Only\" parking spots you will be booted. The signs are not clear either and when I went there were no available spots. I parked next to one of the Starbucks spots and I got booted within 5 mins. My $3 latte turned into $85. Not worth it at this location. Go to one of the other Starbucks.
