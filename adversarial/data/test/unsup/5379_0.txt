Probably the worst manicure I've ever had. She did not soak my nails for very long at all, and then proceeded to forcefully push back my cuticles and pull at them with her clippers.  I told her she was hurting me, and she said it was because my cuticles were dry.  Her paint job was sloppy, and my nails are rough.  Total waste of money.
