Came here  to check out some macaroons . I got the Choux La Creme - Strawberry Lime & Coconut. My friends got the Matcha Latte, and the tea.  My choux La Creme tasted nice and was presented well.  I will be back with friends for Macaroons and  to relax while charging my phone .  The lounge downstairs is quiet, peaceful and perfect for a nice afternoon tea.
