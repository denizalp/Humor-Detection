Went in for a consultation and was able to get my tattoo that same day. Was even lucky enough to have it done by the man himself, Terry \"Wookie\" Hoffman!  I knew I wanted script but was undecided on font. Terry helped me find a font and size that would look best for the tattoo location I chose. Super friendly staff. Very clean shop. Would definitely recommend and return for my next tattoo.
