Extra friendly service and honest feedback when I request a smoothie or juice for what I think my body needs. I'm satisfied every time. Decent price for the quality bevs. I was a little apprehensive about the Chocolate Veggiechino...  Coffee and greens, what?! but the guy who rang me up said \"If you love coffee flavor, you'll like it.\" He's right and I am actually quite impressed!!! I wanted something for an immune system boost + energy + cals. This tastes delish and hit the spot. Good on you, G&P!
