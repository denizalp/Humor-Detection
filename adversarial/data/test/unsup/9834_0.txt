This is where I stop every morning for breakfast. It's very hit or miss here. I can tell by who takes my order if I'm going to need to check my drink before I leave the drive thru window. Overall they are decent and my drinks taste the best here compared to other locations but the drive thru is insane. I have gotten stuck for 20 minutes (and since I can't leave) I was pretty annoyed.
