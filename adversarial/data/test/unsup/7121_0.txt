In the category of 24 hour diners, Dianna's is superior to Denny's.  Don't vary to far from the DTS (Diner Trinity of Safety,copyleft, Jim W):  Burger's, BLT's and Breakfast Food.\n\nOverall, a passable and basic place to eat but that's it.  Don't go looking for great service, sparkling cleanliness or delicious and wonderfully fresh food at Dianna's.  You won't find it.  2.5 stars on a good day, 2 at 4 am on a Friday night rolling into Saturday morning.
