incredible store design and branding\/ packaging!\nThe cupcakes are great and the concept with the color \/dot coding them is cute too! A little pricy but I get that it's also a trendy place.\nI really liked my cupcake here, could have had a tad more frosting\/ cake ratio. It was simple and tasty! I bought a small box to give as a gift to the host that I stayed with and she was so thrilled also!
