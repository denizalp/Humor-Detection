I came in for lunch. It has its own self- salad bar which had cheese balls. I have been to many other brazilian barbecue restaurants and they have the servers to serve you the cheese ball which is little inconvenient that you have to ask every time whereas this place you just go to salad bar and grab as much as you want. They have bacon chicken wrap which i thought would be not juicy but it was actually really good, very juicy. You cant go wrong with top sirloin. I had great experience!!!
