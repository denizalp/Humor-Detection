This ice cream shop is the best little gem! Not to mention the surrounding shops, cafe and seating. There was even love music playing last time I went. Always fresh flavors, like lavender honey! Each flavor tasted EXACTLY like their names which is very unique because a lot of times flavors can be hard to taste. Strawberry is made with real, never frozen strawberries. Also, tons of toppings and sauces. You can get either a cup, cone or an ice cream sandwich which is ice cream smothered between two warmed glazed donuts! Best ice cream I have every tasted!
