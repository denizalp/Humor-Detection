Where to start.. The service was rather quick, and the waitress super welcoming. The food came out really quick. But let's just say food had no flavor. The omelette tasted bland, the potatoes was the only thing I liked on my plate and that's after adding pepper, salt, ketchup and hot sauce. :( my BF ordered the chicken and gravy with French toast and eggs... Mediocre food! The bathrooms were disgusting! Will not be coming back here
