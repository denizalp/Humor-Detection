Wow is all I can say about my Breakfast Sandwich !!!\n\nPlenty of parking, a very friendly staff, who will walk you through your order especially if it's your First Visit. \nThe Breakfast Sandwich was Delicious w\/scrambled eggs, bacon & cheese. A tasty sandwich w\/apple juice all for a Great Low Price !!\n\nMy only complaint about the Restaurant, is it's in Phoenix and I was only visiting for Five Days. \n\nI'll be back next year and it will not be just One Time.
