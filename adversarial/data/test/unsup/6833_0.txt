$12 is not a bad deal for a round of mini golf and laser tag. What brings down my review is the fact that the area is so small. I understand. I am a grown ass man trying to traverse a play area meant for kids. I don't need to be reminded of that. What I do resent is that I cannot get my Barney Stinson on and lay the smack down on some kids. \n\nThe mini golf course is surprisingly fun. All of the cannons and tracks add an element of wonder.
