I'm not a burger person at ALL, with that being said this place is my number one resturant by far.... I discovered this jem almost two months ago and I've been here 10 times since. I know pretty crazy but everytime I have been here the burgers just keep getting better! The owner is fabulous and so is the staff I can't get enough!!\n\nIf you are looking for THE BEST burgers and sandwiches in Phoenix look no further!
