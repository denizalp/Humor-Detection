A pre-made sandwich from a refrigerator case and a bottle of water for my 5 hour flight was just under $20. Not unusual for airport pricing. Turkey club sandwich was just okay, hard bread topped with a ton of avocado, which made for a messy mid-flight meal. \n\nI vaguely remember having a burger here once during a flight delay at their dine-in counter, and it was unremarkable. Might be better for liquid libations instead.
