I've only been here on the weekend, and in all honesty when I've had too many; but it has always been a fun experience.\n\nThe Rock is in the eclectic Melrose district and is adorned with friendly rainbow flags out front. On the weekends catch the funny and talented drag performers in their extended room, and express your own inner diva with karaoke in the main room. Wish they had more space for dancing, but ya can't have everything.\n\nAdded bonus: Filibertos is right next door if you need a big burrito to soak up the booze
