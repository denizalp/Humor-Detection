I have never been to any kind of base before .. its like another world out there.  I have the upmost respect for the people that fight for our Country. So with that being said, I went into a housing unit, was like a ridiculously small studio hotel room.  It sucks that they have to live like that, they should have mansions to live in for what they do !!! \nOn a funny note.. its very beige there, they need a splash of color !! lol
