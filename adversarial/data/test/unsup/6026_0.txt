Normally I would steer clear of chain restaurants like this while on vacation. I can visit Buca di Beppo at home, why would I go to one in another city when there are so many other choices right? After a long road trip and getting in very late we didnt feel like venturing out however. Service was great, waiter was very friendly. Food was great as well! A little on the pricy side, but they serve family portions which is why. Don't be fooled by the \"small\", its still A LOT of food
