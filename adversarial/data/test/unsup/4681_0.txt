Just called today to order flowers for Mother's day for my Aunt and Godmother... I was worried I wouldn't get what I wanted since they had already over a hundred orders and had limited selections. They delivered a beautiful flower arrangement, very similar to the one online even though they couldn't guarantee it at the time. And was delivered within a few hours since I placed the call! Incredible service and beautiful job!!!! Thank you sooooooo much, you guys are very talented and professional! - Sylvia Krajewski
