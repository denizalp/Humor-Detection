Great Korean food and lots of it!  Of particular note was the fine service.  Our Server was a very nice young gentleman named Julian.  Great young guy...helped us order, brought plenty of menu items, always there to refill the drinks...and just plain helpful.  Julian made the whole dining experience nicer...give this guy a raise!  We eat here often...will definitely come back soon!  Best Korean food in Las Vegas...and it's not in Korea Town...it's at the Galleria Mall!
