Ummm...no thanks. Unless you are 20, prob don't want to hang here. Typical college bar, but not fun. As a happily married 30-something, wow did I feel out of place. Like I might get arrested just for being there, under some sort of age-mandated \"Creeper\" law. \n\nCheap drinks just can't save this place.
