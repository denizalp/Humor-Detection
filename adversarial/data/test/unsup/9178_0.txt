George did a wonderful job converting my old 3 handle showers to new single handle units.  He is very hard working and pleasant to deal with.  I received a detailed estimate prior to all work.  We communicated via text message which I prefer.  \n\nHe was in my home for 5 hours converting 2 showers.  Did a great job, cleaned up after himself, and honored the estimate.  Highly recommended.
