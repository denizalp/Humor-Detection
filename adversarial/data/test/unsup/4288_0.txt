Some stuff is a little pricey as far as lower quality brands go (like Walmart brands where you can get them new for close to what they charge), but the prices on name brand clothing makes up for it so it evens out. My son grows out of sizes within a few weeks so I definitely love coming here for clothes! & so does my wallet!
