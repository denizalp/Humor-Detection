I purchased two smoothies: a mango and a peach one. Both of them were watery and sour. I dumped both of them, we just could not drink them. \nI have been to other Jumbo Juices, but now I am wondering if they have changed their menu, ingredients  or is it only this particular place. I can't continue experimenting and throw away $6 per smoothie just to find out.
