Sure, it's a little tattered and maybe it's off-putting to watch a film trying to maneuver to see the screen, but it's got a certain je ne sais french about it.  And it kinda feels like you're watching in your rich buddy's home if you lived on the set of Stranger Things or some other retro throwback.  Except with better pizza.  Seriously, the pizza is actually not bad.
