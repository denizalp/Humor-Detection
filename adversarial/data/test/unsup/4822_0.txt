Not too many Asian markets in this side of town (close to Thistledown casino). Very large parking lot which I have never seen as full. Good sized market, walk in and to your right there's a little caf√© that serves boba drink, fresh crepes or hot food items. To your left upon entry, is a section that sells health items, shampoos, knick knacks. After this section is the market itself. Doesn't have a pungent fishy smell like some markets have. Nice vegetable\/fruit selection. Served all my needs to prep some Asian meals.
