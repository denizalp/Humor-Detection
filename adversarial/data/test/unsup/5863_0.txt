Great food, service, and prices. Love this place especially because they are very helpful if you are a vegetarian or vegan. The pineapple rice is a favorite along with the Pad Tai. The veggie\nSpring rolls are alway hot and never greasy which has been a issue in other Thai Restaurants. close to home is a bonus for us.
