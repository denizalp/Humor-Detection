The rollercoaster at the New York New York is just alright! If you are as big of a roller coaster fan as I am and you love places like six flags and what not then this roller coaster is like a meduim level type of ride! Although I will say that the fact that it's on top of the hotel and whipping and weaving throughout is pretty cool!
