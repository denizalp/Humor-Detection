Stopped by here for drinks at the bar. The drinks were fabulous! It was the first Old Fashioned I actually approved of during the whole trip. The location makes it absolutely perfect for people watching. (My friend and I had a selfie-stick count for the night. Try it, its fun. BTW 6 is the answer.) I didn't have any food but the menu and dining room looked so good, I will be sure to stop here the next time I am in town.
