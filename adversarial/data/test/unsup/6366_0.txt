People saying this is great sushi have not even had good sushi. Sorry, I'm a food snob. Actually, I shouldn't apologize for knowing what good Japanese food looks and tastes like.  SakeBomber is another addition to my \"Asian food in Phoenix disappoints\" list. Oh and I won't embellish on how annoying it is to wear a wristband upon entry if I'm even just contemplating ordering a drink through my meal. \n\nPS: I'm not as bitter as I sound right now.
