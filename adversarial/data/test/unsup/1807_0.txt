Always great customer service here. I have such a hard time choosing a flavor because they have so many! I had a bad experience with boba before and kind of swore it off but this place changed my mind. Their boba is really fantastic here! Soft and just the right amount of chewy. And if you are looking for a delicious and refreshing treat, try the diamond ice. It's super tasty!
