I'm convinced that all parking garages defy the laws of physics in more than one way. How these labyrinths can go both up AND down at the same time and have two of every floor is nothing short of black magic. I like to leave a trail of bread crumbs to find my way back. \n\nThis one is conveniently located near the theaters and we parked for a $6 flat rate for the evening. \n\nWe were almost hit twice while exiting because of some crazy people flying through the center cut-throughs. Just be careful. That's all.
