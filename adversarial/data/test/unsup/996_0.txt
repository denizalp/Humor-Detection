It would seem as of late the nearby seven eleven has entered the competitive gas market. Don't get me wrong, it's not a new station, but they used to keep their prices .2 cents below the big name station across the road. Lately though, they've been 3 cents cheaper at least. Keeping pace with the other cheaper gas price stations in the Vaughan, but closer to home. \n\nNow they just need some competitive prices in the store.
