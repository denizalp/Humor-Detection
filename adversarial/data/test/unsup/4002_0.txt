First time in vegas as an adult and someone recommended this place for a quick bite \n\nI got the chicken spinach and bubs got the pepperoni of course\n\nI kid you not, the pizza was the size of my face!!!!! \nThe slice was equivalent to 3-4 regular slices! \nI was unable to finish it. \n\nThe taste was 3\/5. Mediocre\nThey fire up the pizza slice so it's nice and toasty. \n\nWill be coming back when I'm in vegas again. \nYou definitely get your money's worth
