While the store is nice and the selection vast, the cost of doing business with this company isn't worth whatever you're buying. They will email you repeatedly after being asked to be removed from their lists, and apparently have no idea how their advertising\/marketing systems work. Being brushed off for being contacted against my wishes isn't my idea of how a business should be run, especially if they want repeat customers. \n\nBasically, you may get the product you want but they're going to spam you and not respect your privacy. Save your money and your inbox- use Ebay.
