I've had other services from other companies, and I have to say that Platinum Rides has offered me the best this far. Frank made everything so easy, from making a reservation, to payment, especially with the driver. The driver showed up 10 minutes before scheduled, and gave the kids a great experience. Definitely recommend going through their service.
