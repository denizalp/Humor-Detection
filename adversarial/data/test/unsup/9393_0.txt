Great company that is not only friendly and professional but works with you on the pricing. Just bought my first home and it had an old wooden flip up garage door with an old busted opener. I called Company One Services and they came out the next day to remove the old door and opener, and replaced it with a nice new insulated rolling garage door and new opener. I've had the new door for nearly two weeks now without any issues. I would recommend Company One Services to anyone looking for garage door assistance.
