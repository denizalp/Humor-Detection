First the good, as nothing was great... the pulled pork is good. The mac & cheese is good. The mashed potatoes is\/are good. The baked potato is good. \n\nNext, the ok...the baked beans are ok. The cobb salad is ok. The bbq sauce is ok. The smoked chicken is ok. \n\nFinally, the eeewwwch...the brisket, the ribs, the hot links were all gross. And the ribs, in particular, had an \"off-putting taste\" about them that caused me a great deal of distress. \n\nNever again.
