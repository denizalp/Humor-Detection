I echo the earlier review stating: This store is the best for a new pool owner.  Alex the manager honored NPS\/Leslie's warranty on my pool pump and helped me get the service appointment set up so it was fixed in 5 days by Leslie's courteous and prompt repair service - under warranty no extra cost.   Excellent customer service!   I am a customer for life.  Haven't received that kind of caring and courtesy at any establishment in a long time.  If you have pool needs and questions they have the solution with a smile. - Mark G.
