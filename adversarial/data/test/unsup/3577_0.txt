Horrible. Ordered  a chef salad and it was just lettuce topped with mozzerela cheese, turkey lunch meat that looked old, and a slice of american cheese, and chopped tomatoe.They cut it up in cute little triangles so presentation was attempted I guess. The pizza was very greasy ( cheese and pepperoni) and it tasted like pure tomatoe sauce. Very disappointed.
