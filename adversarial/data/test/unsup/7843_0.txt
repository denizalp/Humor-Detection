So very disappointed in this place. While in line a man was also in line with the \"f\" word all over the front of his shirt.  There  were so many young families in there. We complained to the manager and let him\nKnow that we found it highly offensive and asked that the man be turned away. Management did nothing. He told us that his hands were tied because of freedom of speech.   Unacceptable.  \nI will never eat here again!
