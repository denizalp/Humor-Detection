this friendly, unpretentious shop has great coffee and the best vibes in town. I come here to catch up with my neighbors, enjoy a latte, read the paper and work on my laptop. In fact, I'm posting from inside the shop RIGHT NOW (oh yeah, they have free wifi). \n\nSome of my favorite menu items include the bagel-egg-cheese-smoked salmon melt, the house-made chai, their quiches & the italian tuna panini. and of course the coffee is fabulous. they have quiet music performances most weeks, and they're usually pretty good too.
