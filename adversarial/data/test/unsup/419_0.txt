After orchid garden shutting down several times for health issues . We've found this place and it's been our GO-TO ever since . The food is really good , but the service is really what has us coming back . The owners treat us like family , they recommend different items and also give us samples for being loyal . BEST DIM SUM PLACE IN VEGAS HANDS DOWN . Don't let these other yelpers fool you .
