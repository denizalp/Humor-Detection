We a group of 4 were seated at a booth. They brought our drinks and told us they had a party of 8 that walked in an we needed to move to a small table. How rude is that. They just wanted the 18% gratuity at the cost of loosing customers. They did not ask kindly they just wanted us to move. Unreal to be treated this way. I guess we will never go back.
