I ordered the orange chicken with fried rice & it was good, but they got my order wrong. They gave me white rice instead of fried rice, but i understand that people make mistakes & maybe she didn't hear me correctly thru the drive thru. I would have went back to correct the order but I already drove back to work. Anyways, it was all tasty & the portions were great. The girl at the window was also pleasant, so overall a descent experience.
