I have had my nails done in this salon since they opened. I have always had excellent service. Since i have had been going to salons for 25 years and have only used repeatedly less than 5. They do an excellent job. They came highly recommend after using a  salon prior that was  sold. I strongly recommend Toni and Tina. Cleanliness is never in question. I recommend my friends and they are all more than happy and are now regular clients.
