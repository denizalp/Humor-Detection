It has been 3 days since we dined at LaFonda Del Sol and I can't remember much about the food except the chips and salsa (which were very good!). \n\nThe ambiance is hole in the wall-esque. The food and service were obviously not too bad because I would have remembered that but also not so awe-inspiring that I have vivid recall about what we ate. \n\nThe concierge did not lead us totally astray but it is safe to say that the restaurant is eminently forgettable.
