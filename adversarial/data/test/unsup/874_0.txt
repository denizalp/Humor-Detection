Horrible customer service. We ordered two sandwiches and two types of dip. We were told the dips were going to take a while and would be brought to us. We sat down and were asked to move 10 min later because they needed to clean the area we were seated in. So we moved, no problem. About 10 min. later we asked to move again, for the same reason. All while we're still waiting for our dips. We then asked us where our dips were... they then brought them to us in to-go bags?????? Absolutely rude!
