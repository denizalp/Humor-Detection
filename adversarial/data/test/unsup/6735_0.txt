Overall - 3.0\/5.0\n\nWas looking forward to this place given the high reviews but in the end I felt that it was quite overhyped. \n\nSure, their dishes were packed with flavour but overall the execution was a bit lackluster. The whole meal was just a mouthful of the same few spices from start to finish and did not leave a feeling of satisfaction and comfort.\n\nThere were a couple dishes that were decent such as the lamb ribs, house labneh and the yogurt mousse cake. \n\nService was great and the waitress offered their honest opinion about the dishes on the menu.
