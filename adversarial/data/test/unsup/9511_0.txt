It took a couple tries, but I think I found my favorite stylist in Pittsburgh, Katie! She took the time do a full consultation and understand how stubborn the auburn in my hair can be and did a wonderful job on a blonde balayage and haircut. The staff is super friendly and I will definitely go back!
