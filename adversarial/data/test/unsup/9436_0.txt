Took the 4 for $10 deal and got the strawberry, raspberry mint, Blackberry lemonade, and watermelon-kiwi pops. What makes these ice pops special is that they are just so fresh. I took a bite from each one and you could really taste the fruit itself, no artificiality. Definitely sticking with these ice pops for the summer.
