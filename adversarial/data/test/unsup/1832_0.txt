Just unreal. \n\nI'm a guy who uses groupon, yelp deals and restaurant.com so to spend over $400 on a meal for myself and my date and believe it was worth every penny says a lot.\n\nOne of the best culinary experiences I've had. \n\nThe world's best chefs coming together in one place. \n\nAte til I was in pain...had to sit in my car for 10 minutes before I could drive.\n\nOn my bucket list is the event in Aspen...maybe next year.
