Fun.  Free.  Good laughs.  \nThere was no line when we got there.   Most of the items that I saw on the show were probably already sold since I didn't see them displayed.\n\nUnfortunately I did not get to see any of the show's stars.  Some pretty cool stuff in the display cases.   The most expensive item I saw was a NFL Superbowl ring.   They were asking $100k for that piece.   crazy.\n\nLooks like they film daily.  If you happen to bring an interesting item in the store then looks like you will get your 15 minutes of fame.
