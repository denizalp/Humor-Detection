I would give this place 0 stars if I could. The owners are complete assholes. They are always really rude, don't care if you're waiting at the register. One time the owner was sick and my mom suggested he go home and get rest so he doesn't get customers sick, and he said \"What? Do you live in a f*ckin' bubble??\" \n\nThe owners years and years and years ago were SO nice. We miss them!
