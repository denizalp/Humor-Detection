Beard papa is a chain from Japan. They have tons of locations in Cali but now Vegas has one! It's here finally and inside FAME at the Linq. \n\nPrices aren't the same as Japan. They average about $1-$1.50 but here it's $3 for one. So I'm probably not going to frequent it as I do in Japan but maybe once in a while. If you've never had one then it's a definite must try!
