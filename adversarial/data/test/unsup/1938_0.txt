We got the groupon for Pampas and still feel like we overpaid. We got the surf and turf option and the surf part was awful. It'd either gone bad or been over cooked or something else; we didn't eat beyond the first bite. The meat was pretty fatty and we had to wait and ask 2 times for the pineapple. The buffet part was okay but that's not why you're here. With all of the other better options in Vegas, don't waste your time here
