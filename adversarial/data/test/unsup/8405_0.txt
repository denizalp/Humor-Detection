This is our absolute favorite breakfast place!  We used to live just a couple of blocks away, but now we live on the North East side of town and still drive over often.  Ronnie's has the best potatoes I've ever had in a restaurant - EVER!  Portions are huge, never once have I cleaned my plate, although I wanted to.\n\nService is always warm and friendly and prices are low by comparison to most breakfast places.  Seriously worth the drive if you don't live in this area of town.
