Horrible place to do business. If you value your safety or your vehicle I say go somewhere that appreciates your business. \nNot going to write a book about my experience but the manager here has no control over the quality of the service. Apparently he can't understand the mechanics speaking Spanish so issues arise and corners are cut. Go someplace that really cares.\nEnough said\n\nFollow up:\nI contacted the Franchise owner with my issues and his reply was \"sue me, I've been sued 5 times and won all 5!\"
