Great place...HUGE menu....maybe read it online before you stroll in...or you will stand there like it's 1995 and you are trying to figure out what movie to rent from Blockbuster. \n\nAll our sandwiches were great. Fries were good, nothing special to me. \n\nGot really busy towards lunch time, very limited seating. Not a bad thing though! Place is booming.
