I went into this store today for a few items that my son needed for school.  I was trying to speedy and grab everything without assistance.  The aisles are so well marked that I almost did it.  I only needed one thing that I couldn't find- a small quantity of card stock.  The helpful girl at the copy center walked me to it.  She intended to please.  I managed to get in and out of the store very quickly with everything I intended to get.  The store was very clean.  Check out was simple.  No complaints.
