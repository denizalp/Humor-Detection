I have to agree with the previous comments. These guys have their heads up their rear ends. No one in office talks to each other so you get 5 calls from different people for the same thing. Frivolous charges for items not the tenants responsibility.... The list goes on and on. \n\nWe will make it a point to steer away from these clowns in the future.
