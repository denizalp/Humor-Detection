I couldn't have enjoyed this dining experience much more.  The menu was a bit scary at first.  A million dishes usually equals mediocre food.  This was not the case for me.  I am a firm believer in going with the flow when it comes to restaurants.  This means...ordering what they're good at...or what their niche is.  I did exactly that...and loved it.\n\nThe price was as expected...not cheap...but not wallet busting.\n\nDrink selection was decent.\n\nThe wait was reasonable for a Saturday night.\n\nI can't wait to go back again
