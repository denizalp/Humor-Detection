A great way for tourists to schlep about town without having to rely on the cutthroat taxi Nazis or braving the absurd summer heat. I've stayed at the far end of the Strip for a conference and used the monorail to get back and forth to more relevant areas. The wait has always been consistently short, prices are reasonable (especially considering other options), and it's always been clean and easy to find. I would love for the monorail to be extended to service a greater area, but I won't hold my breath.
