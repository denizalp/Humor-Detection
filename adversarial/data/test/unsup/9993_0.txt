Food was VERY OLD and stale. Went through the drive-thru (big mistake) and ordered a Club sandwich and Kid Fling Meal. The chicken had to have been cooked the day before. It was that old. The Texas toast used for my club sandwich was so hard I could have broke a tooth. How can a restaurant that is only 3 months old be this bad?
