This restaurant is best suited as an after-work place to gather with co-workers to have a few drinks and, maybe, eat. As a destination for food, alone, it is \"OK\", but not high on my list. \n\nDuring our first, and likely only visit, the best part of the experience was the service. Concierge staff greeted us with a positive, friendly manner. Our table server was attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. \n\nI would like to give a 4 stars, but the food was simply too average.
