Delicious donuts, very good falafel. I had a potato dish that seemed a little on the old side. They shouldn't have served it if it was past due. Gyros is good quality. My advice is come here and order high-turnover foods. Very nice people and the food is well-priced, definitely worth supporting over all of the awful chains that line this stretch of East Washington.
