I heard about Apex tint through Groupon.  After doing some research on the company they seemed to be very reputable and had good reviews.  I called the owner Ron and explained I had purchased the Groupon.  I figured they would be book solid and they were!  After explained to him I was going on a road trip and desperately needed tint he agreed to get me in for an early appointment!  I was blown away by his level of customer service and would recommend Apex tint to anyone!
