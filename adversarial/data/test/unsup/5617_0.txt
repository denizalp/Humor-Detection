Elly's hit the spot. Came here with a group of 8 and everyone enjoyed their breakfast. The little piggy in me loves that you can get a pancake on the side instead of toast. My omelet was basic (egg white veggie) but good. The iced coffee I ordered was superb. Our server was patient and attentive, quick to explain items on the menu and quick to bring the check.\n\nI can see this in my brunch rotation once they get a liquor license.
