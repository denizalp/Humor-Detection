Rudest people that can be found in Toronto but their pizzas are good enough so that people come back. Begrudge paying such unhappy, rude people but I do get a pizza from Gigi's once in a while and it's decent as far as pizza goes. When they are busy pizzas can take a while longer than they tell you. No apology of course. If you don't mind a complete lack of customer service or even friendliness, give Gigi's a try. If not, stay well away!!
