The guy at the counter was nice, the cigar, not so much. However, he didn't bother showing us anything, other than the Vato cigars on the front counter, and didn't bother coming around the counter to highlight any of their other choices.\n\nI had one of their $15 house cigars and was very disappointed. It would barely stay lit, had a horrible draw and was so dried out it started falling apart on me.\n\nAfter all of the positive reviews I was seriously disappointed and the reason for the 1 star is the cigar was barely smokeable, the first half anyway.
