Shared an order of pork and chives dumpling (steamed, 15 pieces) and an order of Singapore fried noodles with the bf. The dumplings were very fresh and soupy inside. The noodles were ok, I've had better but it's not bad for the price. \n\nDefinitely should come here for fresh, well made dumplings!!
