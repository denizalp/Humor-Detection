If you have high expectation like me, you will be disappointed. I went there because I want to try the ramen noodles, but their \"tonkotsu\" is not tonkotsu at all, not even close. It tastes like some sort of Chinese style pork soup. \n\nWhoever making this \"tonkotsu\" should at least go to Sushi Ken or Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe to see what \"tonkotsu\" is like. Or better yet, go to the Ramen Museum in Yokohama, Japan to see the real deal.\n\nOn the plus side, the ramen texture is good, very hot when served. \n\nI will not return to this place.
