We had Daileny do our hair and Alana did our makeup. These girls were so amazingly talented and beyond sweet. They arrived early, set up then got right down to business. They were very socialable and witty and it made it that much more fun. My sister and I looked like movie stars when they left! My wedding day experience was beyond wonderful with them. They even went above and beyond to let me know about a traffic jam outside the hotel so I wouldn't be late to my ceremony! I highly recommend them!
