The service was very good.  Restaurant decor was pleasant.  \nI ordered the lobster bisque.  It was terrible.  Earthy and strong in flavor like a crawfish bisque.   The waiter said they put sweet potatoes in in it. WHAT the blank. \nOn to the salmon, it was good but tiny in portion  along with the glass of wine.\nSo if you want small portions with a sizable price tag go to essence.  \nWith some Many options in Montreal I recommend move on.
