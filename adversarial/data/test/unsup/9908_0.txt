place is a bad rip off if you own a dog. I was looking at studio apt in lake delton wi if you own a dog thats 50 dollars more so we have 550 know plus want 500 dollars more non refundable deposit for the dog so you are paying 600 dollars more a year for your dog plus the 500 you are not going to get back for deposit you left  The place has some bad reviews and that is what changed my mind stay away frm this place run dont walk
