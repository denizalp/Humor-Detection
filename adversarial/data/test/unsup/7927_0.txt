This was my first time going into a Metro Diner and I will for sure be back. It was very busy in there and I was very nervous we would have a long wait but they sat us right away. Our waitress Ashley H was AMAZING! She was by far the most attentive and helpful waitress I ever had. She let us know all about different menu items we had questions about and let us know all the different choices we had. Everything we got we loved and Ashley made our experience spectacular. Highly recommended!
