Robert C Wesley Jewelers has the friendliest staff and best customer service i have had at a jewelry store! I needed to get an appraisal on my Rolex for insurance purposes and several jewelry stores in town wanted $100+ and a 2-3 week turn around time. Bobby at RCW took great care of me and had my appraisal emailed to me within 24 hours! I definitely recommend this jewelry store, and i can't wait to make my next watch purchase with them.
