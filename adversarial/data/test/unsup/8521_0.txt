Great Happy Hour but very crowded. Dinner is overpriced and the service leaves a lot to be desired. Had the Scallops ($26) and got 3 of them with 3 pieces of asparagus. Not worth the price. server for got to order one of our four entrees. We told them to forget it, we didn't want to wait. Go for the happy hour menu, but don't stay for dinner.
