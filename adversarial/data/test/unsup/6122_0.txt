I went here to pick up some Sailor Moon things for my friends birthday. A very neat little store with all sorts of merchandise.\n\nIf you like Hello Kitty, they got a whole wall of it. \nThey dont just have anime things though, there's various appliances and make up and candies. Made me feel like I was in a real store back in Japan!
