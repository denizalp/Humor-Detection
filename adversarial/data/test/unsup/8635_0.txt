The meal I ordered was just a huge plate of sadness.   If you like sharting please visit this place.   It'll leave you speechless.   The few bites that I ate of my lunch has rendered me sterile.    That's right I can no longer have children.   Thanks Woody's Taphouse for bringing garbage to the table.\n\nI'd write a longer review if I didn't find myself sprinting to the bathroom yet again.
