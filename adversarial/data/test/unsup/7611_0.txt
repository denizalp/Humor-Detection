This place absolutely SUCKS!  It's super expensive for crappy food. The bartender doesn't know how to make a whiskey sour. The server I had was named buddy and he was crap too. Such an expensive place and they still hand you a to go box instead of doing it themselves. Real classy. What a horrible redone place. Beef eatery atleast was good.
