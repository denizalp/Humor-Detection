This was an outstanding dining experience!   Being from New Orleans we are true connoisseurs of the perfect dining experience.  Always in in search of The Best!  Mastros\/ Scottsdale exceeded our expectations!!  The Blackened Chilean Sea Bass was the absolute best I've ever had!   Great bar experience, live music while waiting for our reservation.  Nick was the true professional waiter.  Smart, informed, helpful, social and non-intrusive. #5star
