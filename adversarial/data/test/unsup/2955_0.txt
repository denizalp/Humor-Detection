I'm seriously in love with Meraki. I have eaten here on several occasions and every meal is better than the last. The food is always fantastic. Service is friendly the restaurant is very clean and nicely decorated.\n\nI have tried several different items and they are all fantastic. I will be back soon to try more of the menu.
