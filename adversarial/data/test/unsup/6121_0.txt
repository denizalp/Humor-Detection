Dr. Frohlich is my eye guy!  \n\nMy 81-year old dad and I had our appointments today. He's the consummate professional and is very patient especially with seniors. \n\nWhat I find pleasantly unusual is that he never rushes you 'through' your appointment. Dr. Frohlich spends the time to understand your situation, make recommendations, and genuinely cares. \n\nHe offers a wide variety of frames and is great at adjusting them to ensure you get the 'perfect' fit.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Frohlich.
