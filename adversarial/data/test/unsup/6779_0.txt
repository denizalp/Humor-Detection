Their donut holes used to be a dozen for $1. Now they're almost $3\/dozen and don't even taste great. Mine were cold! \nBosa Donuts has definitely lost their quality over the years. \n\n\n\nUpdate: the business owner thinks my review is a joke. How professional. All these other reviews are fake because tell me why they're posted a day after my review. I have proof of the amount charged to me just for those donut holes. Their receipt doesn't include the item description.
