Sat at the bar last night (Saturday)  and ordered a prime rib dip. The sandwich was horrible. The meat tasted and looked like rubber.  (Just a couple small slices tucked in were edible.)  I would have liked the chef to come out and taste it in front of me AND  I should have returned it for something different but I was needing to get home quickly.  My dogs enjoyed it however.
