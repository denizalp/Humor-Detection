I love The Himalayan - for take out, delivery and eat in. They are so polite, accommodating and friendly in the restaurant, it's such a great experience eating here (and they deliver quickly and efficiently and the food doesn't suffer - how rare). The food is incredible. My favorites are the Veggie Momo, Chatpat and ChauChau. Honestly everything I've had here has been great, so just go for whatever peaks your interest.
