Delicious.  The crepes are great, although I must admit I can't think of a time that I've ever had a really awful crepe.  The interior of the restaurant is fairly small and basic.\n\nThe prices are very reasonable - sweet crepes start at $3.25 and go up to $6.  Savory crepes are about $5 - $7.\n\nI highly recommend the chocolate and walnut crepe - great combination.  They also make a fantastic mango smoothie for only $3.50.
