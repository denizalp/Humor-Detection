My girlfriend and I come here about once a month for late-night sushi specials (happy hour starts at 10:00pm most nights). The sushi is excellent, especially the specialty rolls. We're usually greeted and served by the very attentive and charming Wanda. Try the dark circle roll for an especially unique, complex and tasty treat.
