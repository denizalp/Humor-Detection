Legitly, one of my favorite places for coffee!\n\nThough the donuts are denser as a raised donut, the flavor combinations are wild. I'm obsessed with their Iced Rose Cognac Latte and come back almost every week and the great service from the gals working the registers is too inviting not to come back.\n\nI love the living room space and work in there for hours, it's perfectly air conditioned and quiet. Definitely an under appreciated space, but I'm okay with that if it means I get it all to myself! \/evillaughhere
