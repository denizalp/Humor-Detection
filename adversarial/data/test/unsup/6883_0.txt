I have not been to a Rubio's in probably 10 years. They have definitely improved the quality of the food. Still corporate but much better. Definitely prefer a mom-and-pop taco shop but they do a good job plus when you sign up with your email you get a free Entree. Plus other specials. I had the chicken and steak burrito Especial.
