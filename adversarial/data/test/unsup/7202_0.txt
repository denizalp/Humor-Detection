This place is almost always poorly run. It has to be the owner because the staff is always different. I guess it is on me, since I keep coming back and expecting different results. Today I am waiting 12 minutes for chicken, because they didn't have any mild ready. At 443 pm dinner time! All I can do for any satisfaction is complain on yelp and hope management pays attention. Now i just found out they forgot to drop the chicken. It seems there is a shift change, not sure who to be pissed at. Wow.
