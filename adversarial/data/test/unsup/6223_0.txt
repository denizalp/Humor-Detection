Let me begin by saying that I'm so picky my own daughter who is a beautician won't even bother to do my hair. I am new to Vegas and looked at several places and reviews. I came across this place with several comments about Jen. She listened to me, sectioned my hair the way I like it, nice cut and styled. Very pleased and found my girl!!!
