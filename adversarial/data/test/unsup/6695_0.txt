Been going here for 20 years and overnight they sell out. One phone call to this Machine they tell you what they cannot do and how much it is going to cost you.\n\nNeed a physical  they will do it but list 20 things they will not be responsible for.\n\nNeed Lipitor on that physical Noooo you will need another appointment for that and it will be another $140 \n\nDr Campbell was a great family Doc, now just a machine,
