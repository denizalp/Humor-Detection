When you witness a server change his\/her habits (in relation to taking care of your table) you know that prejudging, stereotyping, and (not so subtle) racism still exists in America. I had a terrible experience at The Still Restaurant, located inside The Mirage Hotel and Casino last night.\n\nDoug, the manager on duty, and Catherine, a different server, did what they could to fix the problem; and I thanked them both. However, the damage was done.
