I can't rate this place any higher until they learn which wall-mounted instrument is the thermostat. I like Chipotle a lot, but come on. \n\nTurn on the f-ing heat. And pass it on to your other Chipotle bretheren in the Cleveland area.\n\nI've been to many cold-weather located Chipotles, but only in this area are the employees unaware of the need to keep the dining room at a reasonable temperature (above 55 degrees).
