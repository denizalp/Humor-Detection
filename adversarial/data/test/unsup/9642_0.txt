What does Chipotle have to do with Nothing Bundt Cakes? They're right next door to each other. If you eat lunch at Chipotle, then NBC is going to be on your mind. You can decide if that's a good thing or a bad thing. \n\nChocolate Chocolate Chip is their best cake. Don't just take it from me; the girl behind the counter said it was their best seller. I'm sure there's a reason for that. Vanilla Cake is my second favorite. But I'm a vanilla kind of guy. \n\nHighly recommended.
