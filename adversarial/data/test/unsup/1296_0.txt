Their exterior made me want to go in. The red and yellow made me salivate. \n\nThe guy at the counter looked tired. I ordered a california burger. The beef was very flat. The lettuce was 14 times thicker than the beef. \n\nThe french fries were shoestring-like which is a good thing but overly salted which is not..\n\nI went home with a mild tummy ache.\n\nNot sure I'd go back.
