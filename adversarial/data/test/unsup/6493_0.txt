This place was the first stop of the night for the bar crawl event and I wasn't extremely impressed. The bartenders were not personable and even though we showed our VIP badges they weren't offering the special pricing for drinks.  The fun feature for this night at least was the decorate you own cupcake. Probably the most fun I had there.
