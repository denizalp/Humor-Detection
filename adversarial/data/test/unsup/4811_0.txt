For what your paying for; This place deserves a 3 star for their variety in hot pot food selection. Is it worth $35? Nope. Their meat isn't all that good either. The chicken and beef is too dry and rough. If you decide to eat their meats, pick the pork instead. \n\nThey have a good range of broths to choose from and now they are open until 3am. If your hungry after a night out of drinking and you need some hot pot, this is the place to be! Just eat until you throw up!
