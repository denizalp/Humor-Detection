Had great Peking Pork, Mongolian Beef, and Orange Chicken. They have delicious sauces here! The staff here is also very friendly and welcoming. Place is very clean and professional. I really like the fact that their kitchen is open for public View and very neat and tidy. Would definitely come back again.
