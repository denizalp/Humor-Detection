Here's what I love about the Peacock Boutique:\n\n- Conveniently located in Kensington\n- Great service\n- Attached to a fascinating store (New Age Books & Crystals)\n\nHere's what I don't love about the Peacock Boutique:\n\n- The styles of clothes are not what someone my age would wear\n- The clothing isn't as expertly displayed as it could be\n- The prices are hit or miss\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't shop here, but I can see the appeal for some.
