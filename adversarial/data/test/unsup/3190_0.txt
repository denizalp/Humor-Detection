I discovered this Starbucks when the other Starbucks over in CityScape was closed one morning due to an electrical fire. Desperate for my fix, I Yelped the downtown area and noticed another was apparently nearby. \n\nLong story short, I've made daily trips in here now and haven't looked back. This Starbucks is FAST compared to the other one, and they quickly learned what I like. My fave SBUX downtown!!
