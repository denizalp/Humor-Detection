The Dover sole is very good I get it a lot. I like the music during dinner. It is loud so not good if a whole group is trying to have a conversation. The waiter was very attentive. The cocktails are very good too. Everybody liked the strawberry cobbler martini. The cream corned was prepared a way I have never seen. It was like a cream corn whip.
