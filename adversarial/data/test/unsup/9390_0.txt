I felt like a python when leaving. I may not need to eat for another 3 months.\nWe got the suggested sharing menu for two and it was a shit ton of food. The appetizers were so so. Great naan. They really showed their true colors in the entrees & sauces therein.\nNicely spiced but not clobbering you over the head with the spice. very nuanced.\nIf we didn't have a personal recommendation from our inn keeper, we would have walked right by.
