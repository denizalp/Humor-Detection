only 5stars Max , but I wish I can do 10 Stars for this newly opened restaurant in the heart of Las Vegas Chinatown on Spring Mountain.   Had an amazing spicy BBQ fish dish, amazing chicken wings to die for, and some of the best spicy steamed clam dish, and also mini fried Steamed Bread with dipping concentrated milk.  \n\nAlso to cap the night we had the use of a huge karaoke room.  They did a great job with the Karaoke System offering complimentary Karaoke when reserving the private dining room.\n\nCan't wait to go back!
