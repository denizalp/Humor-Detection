Food was decent, I ordered the Maui Wowie pizza, it was ok, I've had better. One friend ordered the calazone and one ordered the cheese steak, also the same reaction with ok, had better. The service was beyond slow.  It took over an hour to get our order and it wasn't busy.  Too many other good restaurants out there to revisit Mellow Mushroom.
