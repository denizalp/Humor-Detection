I was extremely pleased with Two Men and a Truck.  From the initial phone contact to set up the move, to the actual move, this company was great.  I hired them to move the heavy furniture and Shonfee and Don were great.  They took care of my furniture and completed the move in a very timely manner.  I would highly recommend Two Men and a Truck to anyone who has an upcoming move.
