I have been in the service industry for many years. With that being said, it has allowed me to visit many extravagant places all over the world and especially allowed me to experience my neighborhood upper scale lounges\/restaurants. Tonight for the first time, my boyfriend took me to Different Ponte of View and we had the pleasure of receiving service from Lenny and Austin. Both servers were kind and attentive, leaving our dining experience above average. Anyone who visits this place would be lucky to have Lenny and even more lucky to have Austin.
