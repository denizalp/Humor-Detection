I have been here many times with my dog since in good weather they have tables and chairs outside and you can enjoy your drink with your dog.  In the past year, I have noticed that depending on the barista, my latte can be too cold and too milky so I haven't been back as often.  The baked goods are tasty though.  If you are looking for a consistent coffee place nearby, I prefer going to Spark Espresso and Fresh Bar.  If you are out with your dog, then this place would be more convenient.
