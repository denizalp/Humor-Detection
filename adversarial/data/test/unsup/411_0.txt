Oh del taco how my heart has a soft place for you. Probably because I used to work here in high school. If you want to know how things are made, feel free to ask. I know all the secretly good items too.\n\nThis one in particular always has my order right an the graveyard cashier is always friendly, quick and funny. It's important they don't lose their customer service which many do since the late hour always brings jerks and drunks.
