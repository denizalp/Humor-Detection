This is a simple workout place for a cheap membership. Doesn't cost a lot of money to get a good workout. This place has the basic machines for a good workout. If your a Lunk or hardcore gym rat this gym may not be for you. The staff here is friendly and are very helpful. I like Planet Fitness just a basic gym to get a good work out in.
