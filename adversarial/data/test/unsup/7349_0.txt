Been here twice & wasn't satisfied with products he recommended. They are friendly however. I requested an indica Vape & some bud for my anxiety. Unfortunately the Vape was just low quality IMO & overpriced for what it was. It also made me EXTREMELY hungry & sick because it completely threw my metabolism & digestive system out of whack. Same with the bud unfortunately! :( I found exactly what I needed at NuWu since they are more knowledgeable & spend more time trying to find the perfect product for your needs.
