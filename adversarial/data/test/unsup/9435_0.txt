We had a late dinner here. Was recommended by my niece. Enjoyed the ribs cole slaw was the vinegar variety... very nice sauce on ribs nice sweetness and tang. Also a margarita pizza very simple well done!  Friendly quick service. Would recommend for pub food! Atmosphere modern, clean. Had small group playing not to loud could have conversation...nice
