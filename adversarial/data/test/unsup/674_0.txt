Located at the McCarran rental car facility. I heart National Emerald service. I bypassed the rental counter and headed directly to the Emerald parked cars and picked a brand new Dodge Charger and was on my way! No lines or waiting.\n\nSince we have a corporate account with National I'll be using them again.
