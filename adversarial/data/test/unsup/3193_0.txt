After being told at another location that we had 24 hours to use our day pass and that it could be used at any location we found out that was not the case. We spoke to a man named Dan who was incredibly condescending and literally would not do anything to help us. As a person who works in the customer service industry myself I am very disappointed by the poor treatment and unwillingness to fix their own mistakes. My mother as of today has canceled her membership.
