CHEF'STORE is a great restaurant warehouse. It has restaurant supplies and is great for buying items in bulk. I come here once a week to buy a pack of oranges and maybe some cauliflower. It reminds me a little bit of Costco because of the concept of buying in larger quantities. If you need to buy items in bulk or feed your family of 12, this is a place for you to go. \n\nNote: they have gel ice packs for free!! I take extra for my lunch boxes. Hehe
