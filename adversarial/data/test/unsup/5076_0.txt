My daughter wanted me to try her favorite sandwich and picked up The Kali Mist for me on her way home.  It ended up being pretty good.  All ingredients were fresh and I love when a turkey sandwich has a lot of flavor, which it did.  My only complaint would be that it was drenched in mayo.  I could've done without that but overall, a pretty good sandwich.  I checked out their menu and it looks like they have quite a few yummy options.  I'll definitely be back!
