I was looking for a true Israeli food for a long time. Had hummus, Moroccan cigars and baby chicken in a pita. All the portions were huge and and tasteful (specially the hummus), but beyond that... the service... absolutely WOW. Super nice people and doing the best and beyond to make you happy. I don't remember ever getting such a special service in any restaurant.\nI will definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas
