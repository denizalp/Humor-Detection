You get what you pay for! This isn't Paul Mitchell Salon, or a Salon on the strip. Not sure why these other reviews expect a $100 job for $50 lol I bring my 5 year old here because he's a basic buzz cut. The ladies are all nice and sweet and already know what we want done from our previous trips that they put the info into the computer. I recommend checking in online before coming especially if it's a weekend.
