First, my wife is from a family of cattle ranchers so she knows beef and she loved this STK! \n\nFrom the oysters to the bread to the main dish, this is one fun, loud, happy place. \n\nThe burrata salad was fantastic, the potatoes were great as was the wine list...I don't a single bad word to say. \n\nAmbiance=5\nFood=8\nService=12\nDrinks=8\n\nIt's off the charts good!\n\nGlad I went. Btw, not as pricy as people say. And worth every penny!!!
