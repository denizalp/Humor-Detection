This large playground has toddler and big kid slides, sand pit, all kinds of climbing structures for wide range of age, see saw, a real bathroom (not a portapotty) with unclogged sink, vending machine, 2 picnic areas with plenty table\/seats, multi-level playground, a rocking boat (not on water but feels pretty real). A lot of things to do. \n\nMy tot has been coming here this whole summer, and she can still spend 3 hours easily without eating bored, unlike some of the other smaller playgrounds.
