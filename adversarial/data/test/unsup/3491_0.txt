Had dinner there 3\/23\/14 with some my family members & the food was not good. My cousin order a screaming orgasum sushi roll a got salad version of what he ordered. So he talk to the owner who was drinking( beer) at the counter area  an the owner him self did not have any costumer edict in response to my cousins complaint. An the waiter him self did not have no edict at all through out the night.
