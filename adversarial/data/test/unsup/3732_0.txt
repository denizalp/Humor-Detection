I've been here about four times and each time I tell myself that I'll splurge on something THIS TIME. It never happens because I feel like an idiot just for considering...the rip-offs seem overly obvious when products I can buy down the street at Sunny Food market are marked up nearly 300% here. \n\nI'm sure there are a few speciality products that taste good, but I just can't identify with anyone who would spend $400+ on a small bottle of Balsamic vinegar.
