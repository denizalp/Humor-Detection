This review is only for Uber Eats \n\nThe food came very fast and was packaged neatly. I got a wrap that had arugula, sweet potato, bacon, and italian sausage as an added meat for $1 more. The flavors were very complementary and pleasantly surprising! The ingredients were also very fresh.\n\nThe price was very reasonable as well, at $9.50 (+$4 for UberEats delivery fee).
