I really enjoy the bean dip that they make here. If I come in and there isn't any I will ask and they will make it for me. Purchased some over the 4th of July weekend and it was a crowd pleaser. I also like shopping here when they have sales. I'm anticipating the opening of a new store closer to Berewick.
