Love this spot. I'm a fan of family-run restaurants, so it's always a treat for me to stop by. I've been coming here for years, so I'm a regular. They already know how to cater to my family's vegan preferences so it's always a win. The fresh veggie spring rolls with tofu are a fav. Flavorful and a must have. I'm also a fan of the lemon grass tofu stir fry. Delish.
