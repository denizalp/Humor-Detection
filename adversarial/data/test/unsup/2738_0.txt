This place sucks donkey balls. I didn't get anything to eat because the food that I saw people eating looks really subpar. \nI'll put it this way, if you have a Donald Trump sticker on your truck, you like going somewhere where you could possibly get into a fight or buy some drugs, if you're a 21 year old guy with mud on your boots who's desperate to just stick it in somebody, this might just be the place for you.
