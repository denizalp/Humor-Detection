Been here a few times. The place is really small with one person only working the register. It's like all the yogurt places. Good yogurt. Good toppings. \n\nI don't know how they keep it so clean with one person working there but kudos to them. The one disappointing thing about this place is the girl working the register. She's always just standing there taking you're money. Not a lot of emotion. \n\nBut hey. It's in the perfect spot after shopping or dinner to get a nice refreshing desert.
