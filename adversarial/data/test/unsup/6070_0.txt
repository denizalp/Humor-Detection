I wasn't super impressed the first time I tried Five Guys, so I figured I'd give them a chance to redeem themselves.  Alas, I'm still pretty \"meh\" about them.  Burger was okay, but the fries are SUPER oily.  I know it's peanut oil, so it's supposed to be better for you, but seriously, by the time I got home, the paper bag was pretty much soaked through.\n\nAnd, side note about this location, overall very clean, but no toilet seat covers in the restrooms?  What are we, heathens?
