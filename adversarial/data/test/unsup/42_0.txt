First time here. Love the food and atmosphere. There is a big screen at the booth area, which makes it a great place to watch games. Even though the restaurant was full all the time, as you sit down, you won't feel it's loud or chaos. The service was quick and friendly. Our server Yuhao and Bo always check with us. Even though there were lots of AYCE policies given at the beginning, I didn't see anyone really check if we follow the policies. That makes me feel really comfortable.
