Great lunch choice for those that love chicken (which I totally do). Their signature combos come with fries and a drink and is therefore a super great value! This particular location is near UNLV so it does tend to be very busy at the lunch rush but I have never waited longer than five minutes for food. The toast (Texas toast?) that comes with the meals is absolutely delicious. Would come just for that! Definitely try their house sauce as well.
