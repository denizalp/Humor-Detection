Started off with Calamari that was the most delicious tender Calamari we've ever eaten.  Cheese Ravioli was delishiously creamy and cheesy and the Chicken Marsala was amazing!\n\nOlive oil, vinegar and bread was fabulous too.\n\nTV in the bathroom was a nice touch!  Ambiance and Service were stellar too!  Hope to be back soon!
