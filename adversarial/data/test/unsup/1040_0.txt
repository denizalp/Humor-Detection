Quite a departure from the sad little Wendy's this location used to be. It's very spacious with a sleek, sophisticated interior. Ordering was easy, my drink was made quickly, and the seasonal drink (Iced toasted graham latte) was smooth and lactose free with the addition of coconut milk instead of regular milk.
