Upfront disclaimer - it's been several years since I've lived in the area and used Steve's.\n\nBut when I was there, Steve's was the only place to go for basic dry cleaning needs.  Inexpensive, items finished when promised, decent customer service - what more do you want in a dry cleaner to do your regular stuff - shirts, slacks, ladies blouses, suits, slacks and skirts?\n\nI'd find a specialty cleaner for something like my wedding dress that I wanted to preserve for 20 or 30 years.  But for the day in and day out stuff, Steve's was the destination!
