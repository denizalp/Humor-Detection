I can't imagine Charlotte without Jack's. I can't imagine myself without Jack's. The number of days and nights I have spent at this friendly neighborhood bar are far too many to count. I have eaten here, drank here, sang Meat Loaf karaoke here, played trivia here, had a birthday party here, had a jukebox singalong here, and had many unforgettable nights here. There are many local spots that are doomed to be bulldozed in the name of progress, but this one hurts the most. #SaveJacks
