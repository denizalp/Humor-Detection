Their mimosas were decent, not too sweet and mostly dry for those who don't like sweet drinks.  I forgot to take a pic of the main meal.  I had the Savor omelet with Mac and cheese and they were delicious!  Then last but not least, their Coca Cola chocolate cake pictured was amazing!  It was moist AND dense.
