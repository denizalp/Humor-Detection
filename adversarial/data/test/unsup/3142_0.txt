We frequent this buffet when we are on the west side of the valley. Good solid buffet, price is very reasonable, if you use your player's card you are given a discount. \nStaff is friendly, at times they do seem a bit overwhelmed. However they do seem to bounce back quickly. \nThe carving stations carry grilled veggies which personally I find a huge plus! Salad station is nicely appointed. Hubs feels the Asian offerings to be acceptable. \nDessert station is okay for off strip. \nThis place is worth the price.
