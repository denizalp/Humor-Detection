Extremely rude management. When a customer complains about the order they got being incorrect you just fix it to what they were expecting. You DON'T say that is what you ordered and turn your back on them and refuse to deal with it. Busy or not, as a manager part of your job is fixing issues not ignoring customers. In the end an employee fixed the issue, with zero thanks to the so called \"manager\". Corporate Starbucks, pay attention to whom you put in charge of your locations.
