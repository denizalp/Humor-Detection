We were here on a late Tuesday night, and when we got there it wasn't very busy at all. The value is great, for approx. $16 you can get a big sushi combo and the portions are huge! All of us struggled to finish our combos. The sashimi were very thick slices and there was a variety of fish.\n\nThe restaurant started to get more busy when it was almost closing time that night. The only bad part about our experience was the looong wait time for our food.
