This is the only place I can go to get a haircut. Every student there will ask you how you're feeling every step of the way. The atmosphere is great and the people are very nice. \nThe students are very impressive. Other salons with established hairstylist cannot compare to the people who work here. They are all very skilled in their specialty, and I can't complain :)
