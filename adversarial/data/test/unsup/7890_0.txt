I tried this place twice.\n\nFirst time my order mysteriously got canceled and nobody notified me. When my pizza never showed up I called and found out. I had to resubmit my order, it took me close to four hours to get one pizza.\n\nI decided to give them another shot. It took two and half hours to get my pizza delivered and i was told 45 minutes. I received no apologies or explanation as to why it took so long.\n\nThere are plenty of pizza places in the area. Do not go to this one.
