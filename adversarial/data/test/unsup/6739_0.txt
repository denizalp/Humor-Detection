Probably my favorite night club is Las Vegas! I love how it has 3 separate floors that accommodate a wide variety of guests! The bottom floor has a dance floor playing primarily hiphop music (whooo!), the main floor has a dance floor playing primarily house music (eh), and the top floor is for those who are just too cool to dance but love to sit around to chat :) There is also a pretty awesome view of the Strip from the balcony!
