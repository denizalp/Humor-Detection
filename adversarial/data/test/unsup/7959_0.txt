Amazing cappuccino.  Truly awesome.  Free wifi and a place in the back to work.  All good.  Prices as unreasonable as any other coffee shop.\n\nThe bad:\n\nSloooow service.  We were made to feel like an inconvenience.  This is Old Town, not Beverly Hills.\n\nWeird vibe.  Surreal and silent.  Kind of a cold feeling place with no one smiling or laughing.  I felt like we crashed a funeral.  \n\nI will go back for a coffee to go.
