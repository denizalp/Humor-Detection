No reservations, so get yourself there early and put your name on the list. Walk down the street, have a pint, and come back for some delicious pizza.\n\nService? They got you.\nWine? You know it.\nThe reason you came. That Za?\nForget about it.\n\nNeed more?\nSit down and order the 4 maggio. I don't even know if that's what it's called. Cheese. Truffle oil. Honey.\nCome on.\n\n*mic drop*
