Had a few beer on the patio so this is not a reflection their food. \n\nI will say the menu did look expensive (9 bucks for egg fried rice....$3+ for chicken?). \n\nThe art inside is right up my alley (slutty\/gothic-rock). The bottled beer tasted like bottled beer. Patio was big enough, but I can imagine with a few smokers it may get gross. Give it a shot, I guess.\n\nI'd give 3 pats, but... half the people in there sort of looked like degenerates. One dude looked like the love-child of Charles Manson\/Rick Rubin after a stomach staple.
