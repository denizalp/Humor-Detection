If you've ever been to Normans Rare Guitars in the San Fernando Valley, you've been ruined for all other guitar stores, especially the likes of Cowtown.\n\nWalked in, not greeted by the guy behind the counter. He seemed busy repairing a guitar or something. \n\nWalked around, saw a lot of great guitars but was never at any point asked if I needed help. \n\nWalked out, guy behind the counter didn't even look up. \n\nI might have made a decent purchase there, if someone had actually acknowledged my presence. There won't be a next time.
