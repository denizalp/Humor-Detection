What we had:\n1. smoked salmon eggs benedict (with fruits)\n2. eggspectation omelette (with home fries and fruits)\n\nThe benedict was excellent: fresh, juicy, and rich in flavor. I strongly recommend this dish.\nThe omelette probably is their feature omelette (eggs with mushrooms, onions, green\nand red peppers, bacon, sausage, ham) tasted great, but the eggs might have been cooked too long, so the texture was a little bit \"old\". Even though this was disappointing, this was the only disappointment. I would strongly encourage breakfast lover to go for this place!
