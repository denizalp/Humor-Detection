Wow! That was a serious carb loading breakfast ! Met some friends & had berry pancakes , New Mexico skillet and California scramble . Everyone loved their dishes ! Side of fruit was a delicious mix of blueberries , strawberries and blackberries . The fresh orange and tomato juice , very good . This spot was jam packed , jelly tight ! Although every table was full the wait was only 10 minutes!
