We were excited to try the neighborhood taco bar.  After moving here from Texas last year, where tacos are just a staple\/way of life in everyday food, I have been searching for a good go to taco joint to fulfill those cravings.\n\nTaco Tontos is not that place for me.  \n\nI have to admit that I liked the location, and the fact that they had good beer on tap.  But, the food was wicked bland.  Seasoning people....season the food.
