Last year I was shopping around for a new property management company and was referred to Rosenbaum Realty Group and I am so happy with our decision to sign with this company. This is THE MOST accommodating management team I've ever worked with. I own an apartment building and they take care of everything for me! From maintenance down to the most irate people that I'm sure we've all dealt with. Daniel, Tiffany, and the rest of the staff is so friendly and responsive. Great team, great company! Can't give anything less than 5 stars.
