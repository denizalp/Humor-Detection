Prices are pretty good, food is fresh(high turnover at this location). I dunno it's Chipotle so I'm just going to assume we all know what their two or three menu items are at this point. Solid food but nothing to write home about. I still think Chipotle really needs to get some Queso into their restaurants. If only I could combine aspects of Qdoba and Chipotle to make a much better chain.\n\nThis location can get pretty busy during lunch hour so just be prepared to wait.
