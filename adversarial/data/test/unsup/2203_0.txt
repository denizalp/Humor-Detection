I bought after market ATV trail lights for one of the two ATVs I bought here, and I couldn't use them on my ATV. I had to return them unopened and was charged $10 for a restock fee. I thought that was ridiculous seeing all of there parts were right there all they had to do was put it on a shelf for sale. Besides that there hours suck, they close at 3:00 p.m. on Saturdays.
