The place really disappoints. Their sauces are actually great but the noodles are limp, lackluster, and tasteless. Perhaps I am spoiled because I am from a city where there are some amazing noodle and ramen places but this place is does not come close. I honestly just go there to pick up their side salads (which are awesome) and just skip the noodles all together.
