Yes, this is the place from the opening credits of the sitcom \"Alice\" from the 70's.\n\nLocated near downtown and roughly 15 minutes from the airport, it's in a seedy part of Phoenix and surrounded by industrial type buildings.\n\nOpen only for breakfast or lunch, in this area, you could do much worse.  Food is diner food with plenty of calories and grease to go around.  Stick to the basics (not that the menu get's complicated or anything).  Eggs Bacon Hash Browns etc...  A cheeseburger at lunch.\n\nNot exceptionally clean.  Use the bathroom somewhere else before arriving.
