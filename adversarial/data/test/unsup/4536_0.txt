Truly awful!  Got the bandit burger, Asian chicken salad, grilled cheese, and boneless wings.  Took a maximum of 3-4 bites of each before throwing them out.  \nThe burger was dry, uninteresting, and the chili that was to be placed on it likely came from a budget seasoning packet.  \nGrilled cheese comprised of Kraft slices and lousy burned bread.  No flavor!\nAsian chicken salad had little redeeming value, the dressing was thrown out after a couple bites, chicken soggy.  \nThe boneless wings were wet and had no sauce, unfortunately the best thing ordered, but still very disappointing.
