What a great, non-traditional way to spend St. Patrick's Day!\n\nLast night was the second time I've been to Lost Leaf and it just solidified my love for this place. Groovy to the max! Their assortment of beers is obscene and beautiful, and the prices are wonderfully affordable. There isn't much more to say, other than I really do have a hardon for this bar.
