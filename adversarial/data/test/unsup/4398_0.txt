I find myself coming to this branch fairly often when I'm in town,  mainly to help my daughter cash her checks when she doesn't have an account.  The tellers are always pleasant and efficient so I have no complaints.  Of course they always try to convince her to open an account there and I always nod my head in agreement.  One of these days....\n\nParking is not an issue since it's inside the Albertson's so there's a huge lot.  And most of the time there is not a line.  They have suckers for the kids.  Unfortunately my grandson knows this.
