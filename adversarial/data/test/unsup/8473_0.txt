How do I rate my first experience with empanadas?? I found it A-OK!\n\nFor $3.99, my beef empanadas is big and filling!! \n\nThis place is so busy and it took a long time to get my food... But I wish they warmed up my empanadas a little longer since it was still a little cold inside.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is small and cramped.. I can barely slide myself into the chairs.. or maybe I just been eating too much??
