Well I went in this morning to get a Tea and a muffin along with my daughter. \nThe muffins were old tasting and stale.. We left 5 min the young lady didn't want  to refund me money saying don't refund because it is over 30 mins when it was only 5 mins..I will report this to the health board letting know your selling spoiled food to the public...Shame on you...
