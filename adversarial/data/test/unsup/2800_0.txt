Forgot to finish this review! \nCame here last week Thursday with coworkers to take advantage of their Winterlicious menu.  I must say for a first timer to Quinn's, the ambience is really cozy pub-restaurant you can take a date to.  The staff are actually from IRELAND! and they're always accomadating to any requests.  I ordered the set menu, Beef Barley, Steak Frites with Cafe du Paris sauce and Chocolate brownie cake for dessert.   Overall, the dishes were cooked to perfection, and complimented my glass of rioja! I will definitely be back again Quinn.
