Good food enjoyed the philly cheese steak, the appetizer cheese mozzarella would probably not get again, loved the Mango Maggie! Only real complaint was the blaring music over the couch\/tv area near the pool table for the first 2 hours we were there. We asked the guy if it was possible to turn it down and he said he doesn't have control over it. After 2 hours the music got louder while they adjusted it then it got normal volume and much more bearable. Unfortunately we were ready to head out by then.
