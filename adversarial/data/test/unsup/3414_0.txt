I enjoy the chicken at El Pollo Loco. I do not enjoy the wait for the chicken at El Pollo Loco and I was admittedly indifferent to the hair that I found on my chicken at my most recent visit at El Pollo Loco. I had waited for ~ 15 minutes for 3 chicken breasts and a wing (no sides, no drink) so I decided to pull the hair off my chicken, remove the portion of skin that the hair was sitting on and have at it. I will say it was still delicious albeit less than sanitary.
