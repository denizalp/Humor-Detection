Fried green tomatoes- best on the planet!  Food was beautiful & packed with flavor.  Our server, Aaron, was the sweetest soul, so happy to be here.  Great place - could dim the lights a bit.  Past that, loved it.  4 stars not 5 - for a lot of sugar in all of these fantastic dishes :)  will r\/t ASAP.
