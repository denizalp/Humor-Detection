This is my family's go-to place for delicious halal meats. We drive from Brossard to get their amazing grillades. The filet mignon, kebabs, chicken breast skewers, etc,. are great to serve at dinner parties and if you're hungry while you wait, order their kebab, chicken or filet mignon sandwiches (I'm literally drooling just thinking about it) or plates. You can also get their pre-marinated meats to cook at home. Everything is delicious, you won't regret it.
