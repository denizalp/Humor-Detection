Because I'm tired of their attitudes- I went to goodwill, I bought nice trendy clothing. Maybe 4 sweaters, 3 shirts and 1 pair of shoes. And sold it to them for more money than what I spent  I'm sorry but if ur going to fuck people over for their money I'll do the same! :) this place is just waaaay to overpriced for secondhand items lol
