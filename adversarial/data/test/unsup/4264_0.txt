The TSA staff hasn't stolen anything form me at this airport, so that's a major plus, although the slot machines do take one last drop of blood as I exit hell.  Great place when flying in even with the obnoxious cab line, but the flight out is usually a mix of the Iraq draw-down and that scene in last man standing when everyone gets it.
