If the bar from the movie Coyote Ugly had funnier and raunchier bartenders, this place would be it.  \n\nOur bartender was amazing.  She engaged us, made us laugh, was attentive and, quite frankly, was entertaining as hell.  \n\nWill definitely return on my next trip to Vegas. \n\nOh...and hot chicks dance on the bar. Yum!
