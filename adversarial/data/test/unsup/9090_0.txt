Rubio's is ok when I want a chill place to relax while I'm having lunch either on the patio (if you don't mind the noise from the road) or in the dinning room.\n\nThe fish tacos are in a heavy batter and are decent. I also enjoy the chicken burrito. I do think the pricing is a skosh high considering this is more like a fast food place.
