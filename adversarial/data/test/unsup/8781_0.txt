After a long, anticipated, prolonged wait for this restaurant to open, we were very disappointed when it finally did open.  The food is horrible and overpriced for what you get.  My family and I recently went last weekend and I ordered the cheese enchiladas and found they were made with cheese sauce instead of real cheese - very bland tasting.  My wife ordered the seafood enchiladas which consisted of grilled shrimp which were overcooked and dry.  For $80 for three people, we expected much more.
