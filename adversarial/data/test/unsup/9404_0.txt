The store itself is nice but the banfield is terrible the doctor is rude and  assistants always give wrong information. Not only do they screw up my appointments but gave my dog the wrong medication twice. They didn't even know what my dog had an appointment for And almost brought him back for the wrong issue. They have no idea what they are doing. Cannot trust them with my pets
