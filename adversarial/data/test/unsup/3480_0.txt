Kid Friendly, good layout.  The entire staff here seemed happy.  The food was excellent.  A bit too expensive for me to go every week, but it was worth it.  Ordered a large with pepperoni.  It was fantastic, the cheese, the sauce, the crust, all perfect.  My wife thought it was burnt when she first saw the pizza, but she loved it too.
