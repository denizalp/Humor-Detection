We are visiting rom Cali and got excited to try some AZ mex food. This place was not Mexican at all. the salsa was more like a spicy ketchup. The beef was cooked well and very tender but had no seasoning. I hate to add salt at a restaurant, But this stuff was bland. Latin food is not always spicy but it should always be well seasoned! I guess if you live in a bubble, this food would be passable. I don't understand the good reviews. If you're a foodie in any way, I would not recommend this place.
