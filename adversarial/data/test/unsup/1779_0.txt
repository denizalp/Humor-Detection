We traded our 2008 Chevy Tahoe that we purchased at Fairway Chevrolet today at Ed Bozarth Chevrolet, to come and find out our truck had been in an accident in the past...! Fairway never disclosed this info, and for that...they are shady! Mike Calahan was the sales person that sold us this wreck... Beware, and ask for reports on used vehicles before you purchase anything from these people...
