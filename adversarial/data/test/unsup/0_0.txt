Best cigar bar in the valley. Their prices are so good, they stay competitive even with online cigar retailers. Drink prices are good and you can drink fancy or cheap. They have a sweet place and new amazing heat busting patio. Seems like their motto is \"keep the prices low and people will keep coming\".
