I love this place.  I actually worked here for quiet a few years and despite eating it probably more than once a week for nearly 6 years, I still thoroughly enjoy it.  I will say that at times you can get an under\/over cooked pizza, but not that often.  They personally look at every pizza that goes out so unless it's an especially busy night (friday evening rush or a holiday) you'll probably be safe. I suggest any type of pizza (though i prefer plain), pasta (best sauce) or an Italian pocket.
