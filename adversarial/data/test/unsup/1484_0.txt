Very nice steak. They got the medium rare perfectly. Very accommodating on changes when I didn't want certain things. The place is also very pleasant, the atmosphere is nice. Super slow to bring the food, though. I didn't care for the \"pecan torte\" (otherwise known as pecan pie lol) - nothing special.
