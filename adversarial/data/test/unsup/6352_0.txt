This place is awesome.  Very dangerous for me seeing how it's at the top of my street.  I've had the pulled pork, brisket, hot link sausage, ribs, and bacon on a stick.  All of the BBQ is incredible, very tender and tasty.  The staff is very friendly as well.  Lakewood really needed a BBQ joint like this.  Proper Pig will be around for a long time.
