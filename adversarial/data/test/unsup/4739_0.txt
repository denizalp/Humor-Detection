Dr Wagner is awesome.  However, his office staff have no bed side manner. If they answer you are lucky.  If you have to leave a message they do call back but very rude.  Good luck getting a same day appointment.  Took over a month to get in.  I am definitely going to be looking for a different Dr due to this horrid experience.
