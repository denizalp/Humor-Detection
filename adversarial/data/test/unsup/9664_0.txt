This place is awesome.  As a Maritimer, I know fresh seafood and this place is excellent.  Really good turn over of product so you know you are getting quality that is ready for your plate!  And don't forget to try their prepared food.  The fish and chips were light and crispy, with hand cut fries representing.  \n  I can't wait to try the PEI mussels next time I need a lunch or maybe the PoBoy...so many tough decisions!
