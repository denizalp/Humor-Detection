Literally the best haircut I've ever received. There was a new employee who initially starting cutting my hair, and she did a great job, but Boris was very attentive and made sure to check that she was cutting my hair properly. I felt like both Boris and the new employee actually cared about how I looked and Boris definitely takes pride in what he does. There's no better feeling than walking out of a barber shop with an amazing haircut. You literally cannot find a better deal than this place. I'll be back for sure.
