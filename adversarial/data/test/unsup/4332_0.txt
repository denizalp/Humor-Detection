I needed to get some new dish towels and I decided to check here.  They had a fairly good selection but the prices were Triple B prices--too much.\n\nI walked around the store and looked at the other items they had.  You never know.  The store is about the same as it was when it first opened and I was getting things for our house.\n\nAfter a quick look around the store, I left and got some nice towels elsewhere at a reasonable price.\n\nI've always found the employees to be quite pleasant.
