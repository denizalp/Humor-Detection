Given the number of bars in uptown that don't have a cover I'm shocked that They do. We paid $5 per person to go inside to a much too crowded bar and never even make it through the crowd\/line to get a drink before leaving. I'd much rather go hang at Murphy's that doesn't have a cover and has a lot more space to spread out.
