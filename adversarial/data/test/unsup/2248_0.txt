I would have given it 2 stars, but they stayed open the latest at the PHX airport, so they get a little love.\n\nThey wouldn't serve us food, so we had to go next door and get a crappy hotdog from a make-shift Nathan's hotdog stand. (And trust me, I like Nathans, just not here). You get to choose from all of 2 or 3 beers, and watch sports. Well, try to watch sports, half the TV's weren't working. \n\nBlah.
