Love the location of this establishment. The walls\/windows open up so it really gives a great feeling in the summer. Super nice place to have a meal. Food was great, I would recommend both things we had, Cesar salad with chicken and the meatballs. The server was kind too, she was helpful in recommending a bar for us to visit after!
