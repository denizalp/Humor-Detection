Poor service and very mediocre meal. You get what you pay for here$13 chicken Parm was rubber and pasta over cooked with blaw sauce. It was hot though! Make sure you get Parmesan cheese to give it some flavor!!!! Won't recommend unless your desperate for Italian. \n\nService was slow and server was not attentive.
