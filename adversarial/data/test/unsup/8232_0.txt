My stay was pretty great. The front desk staff were sweet, the one cleaning lady who dealt with my room mostly was amazing, so sweet and made sure I had everything I needed. It's right across from the C Train which was great as I didn't have a car. They upgraded me to a suite no extra charge as I was staying for a week. I had no issues with my stay. \n\nI however didn't like the lack of things to do around the hotel. Not a lot of good choices\/ shopping
