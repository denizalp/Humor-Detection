Food was pretty decent quality. I ordered the New York strip steak in a medium, and the steak was delivered quickly and perfectly cooked! Not too rare, not too cooked.... perfect medium steak.\n\nThe waitress was extremely polite and had great conversation. The service was top notch and it makes me even happier that the food came out faster than expected. The steak being perfect was just a cherry on top.
