Boy it sure looks like DD is trying hard to be a Starbucks or anything but a donut shop.\n\nSure it's all fancy and cute but the donuts are totally forgotten about. \nThis store has the typical \"order here\" and \"pick up\" there ordering process. But at the end of the counter but the donut case, meaning you get to pay first  then wait in line and then pick out your donuts.  \n\n\nDude, I just wanted a effen donut.
