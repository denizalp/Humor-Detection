if you are cool with losing your deposit when you move out... this is the place for you!\n\nWe bought a house and surrendered the apartment 3 weeks early (paid for) and in spotless condition.  The manager said everything was fine in the walk-through.  Then, we get a letter stating that they were deducting over $300 in cleaning and damages.  Yet, the manager had said everything was fine.\n\nRediculous charges and horrible excuses for customer service.  Do yourself a favor and find a complex that hires people with a little class.
