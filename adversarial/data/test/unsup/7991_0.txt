I consider myself extremely lucky to work within walking distance to New York Flavor. This is one of the most awesome places that I've ever been to. While I can't get myself to get anything other than the Little Italy sandwich, my husband has also been there with me and raves about their Coney dogs. The people that work there are super friendly, always fast, and make your orders as you order them. It's a must try for anyone!
