I was craving for an Acai bowl after exploring Red Rock Canyon. Found this place on Yelp and boy was it a great find! It is hidden in a shopping complex. The inside is chic and a very homey feel. The customer service is super friendly. I ordered the Acai and it was delicious! I would highly recommend and of course would come back again!
