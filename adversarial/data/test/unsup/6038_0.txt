Arizona Roof Rescue completed a new tile re-roof on my 25 year old Peoria home in April 2017, but I waited till now to post a review because I wanted to be sure it made it through the monsoon season with no leaks.   Well....after all the recent rains, everything is great, no leaks, no issues, no problems.  Even though some of my neighbors had damage after these August storms, my roof stood up to the horizontal rain and high winds.  Alan's top notch crew, and team leader Hector were great to work with.
