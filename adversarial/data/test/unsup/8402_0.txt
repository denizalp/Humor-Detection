I would not recommend Marquee Dayclub, unless you have a table or know the DJ because the pool is soo tiny and dirty. You can go behind the DJ booth in the bar area for free and see the DJ up close which is cool, but otherwise stick to EBC. Marquee Nightclub was fine though. Don't forget to stop by Secret Pizza for drunchies!
