Amazing food. Amazing deli.  Amazing bakery. Amazing produce.   Amazing meats. Everything just plain rocks with this place. \n\nThis isn't the Piggly Wiggly.  The quality is much much higher. So be prepared to pay a little more. But it is SO worth it!!   Your food won't rot after 2 days like stuff from \"that other place\". \n\nGreat selection.  Good prices.  Awesome service.  In a nutshell: shop here. You'll love it.
