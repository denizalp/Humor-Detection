One of my new favorite Wingstop locations in Phoenix. This is a newer Wingstop that is spacious compared to the other location near my home. The staff has been super friendly every visit. They also bring you your food. Same menu as all other locations as well as same great taste. My food has been consistent to the other locations while hot and fresh. Open till midnight this is another great late night find. TV's throughout the venue to keep you entertained while you wait for your food. \n\nDraft beer at this location.
