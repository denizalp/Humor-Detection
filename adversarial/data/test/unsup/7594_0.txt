Was on the hunt for the perfect, well-priced love seat as a gift for my mom and ended up in this store after many unsuccessful stops at other department stores\/furniture stores. We were greeted warmly and were helped by a man named Tim who was outstanding at customer service and answering every question we had for him with enthusiasm. We actually ended up buying a full sofa (not a love seat) within 25 minutes of being there! My mom loves her new couch and we are thankful for the great customer service! Highly recommend this place!
