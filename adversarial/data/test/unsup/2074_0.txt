Lane swimming here is HORRIBLE.\n\nGranted, most people do stay in a lane appropriate to their speed but.....swimming in the fast lane is like driving south on the DVP during the morning rush with a car crash blocking multiple lanes.\n\nWhen you swim here, expect tailgating, jostling, and general passive-aggression with no lifeguard intervention. \n\nIf you want to actually be able to swim during a lane swim, go elsewhere.
