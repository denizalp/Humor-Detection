Now that they've opened a Q'doba in Old Town, we don't come to this location very often.  However, they seem to make larger sized portions at this one.  The Queso Sauce is still very addicting....I crave it from time to time.\n\nWe come to this location when we don't feel like driving to Old Town and dealing with the late night tomfoolery down there.  This one is situated in a normal shopping area.  As long as it stays open, we'll keep coming back.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%
