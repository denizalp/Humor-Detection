I go here to see Barbie for my lashes. She is soooo good! I always leave completely in love with my newly filled lashes.  She is never on a time clock and works on you until your lashes are filled, unlike many boutiques that charge for a set time limit. I would recommend her for anyone wanting lashes.\n\nI also love all the clothes in the front area of the salon. They have THE cutest dresses and tops for very reasonable prices.  The staff is always friendly and salon is very clean.
