My friends and I go to Joey Sherway every once in a while after work for drinks and appetizers. The service is always really friendly and non-pretentious and the restaurant has a nice, fun atmosphere. The food and drinks are good; albeit a bit over-priced. Try the sushi cones and the Supersonic Gin Tonic because they are exceptional.
