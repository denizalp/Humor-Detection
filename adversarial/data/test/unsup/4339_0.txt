Great atmosphere, warm and cosy. The hostess are extremely friendly and helpful.\n\nTried the calamity, they were perfectly cocked, \"al-dente\". The breading was light but with a slight spicy bite. The duping sauce was awesome with its own kick.\n\nThe muscles are also highly recommended with a Spanish twist adding chorizo.\n\nI would definitely  come back for the food.\n\nThe only thing they are missing is a dance floor. The music was great and several patrons were dancing in their chairs.
