It's a quiet place???  Are you kidding? I couldn't hear the people at my own table it was so loud.\n\nI have only been there once but probably won't go again. It was crowded. We had reservations but had to wait for 20 minutes and there was no place to wait. The server was not very professional and didn't seem very motivated. The food was okay but not great. Actually I was sick for two days after but there's no way to know if that was coincidence.
