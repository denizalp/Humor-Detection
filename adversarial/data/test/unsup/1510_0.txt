I can't say enough wonderful things about polished. They have a ridiculous amount of colors to choose from, they always have email specials, and the shop is clean. What more could you ask for? I always come in with random Pinterest designs and they always accommodate. Polished is a great nail salon and I recommend it to all of my friends and even strangers when I get compliments on my amazing nails. I love polished!!!
