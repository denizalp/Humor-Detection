I recently adopted a 3 month old Chihuahua puppy from the Animal Foundation and I was given a list of vets we could go to for a free checkup. After Yelping the vets on the list this was the best reviewed. Although it is far from my house in Anthem Highlands, I feel it is worth it.. The staff is very nice and Dr. Knighton is great with very good credentials. Also, Upon our second visit for booster shots, they waived the check up fee of $55 and only charged us the $35 for booster shots. WIN.. Recommended!
