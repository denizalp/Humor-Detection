Good for the price\nBed was OK. Cleanliness was OK. Staff were friendly and helpful, but did not tell me on check-in that the free breakfast ends at 9:30 am, so I missed it. That seems like an early end, to me. My upstairs \"neighbours\" were very active, seemingly stomping around, until 1:30 am. Other than that, quiet and comfortable.
