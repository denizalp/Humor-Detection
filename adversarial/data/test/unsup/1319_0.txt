Ok, I'm not from Phoenix, but I get it. It's not the same as their main location in town, the service might be subpar (which I didn't experience), and it might take a while to get my food, BUT THESE ARE SOME DAMN GOOD CHICKENS!!!!\n\nThe $19 price tag for my whole combo is a bit excessive, but considering it's at an airport, I'll take this any day over the $12 refrigerated turkey sandwich with wilty arugula at SFO.\n\nThank you PHX, and thank you Lo-lo's, for making my 3-hour transfer so fat and so enjoyable.
