We have been ordering from here for 4 years and LOVE it!  This is the only place my husband will order from since they do not use MSG. Large portions. Great flavor - I've never had something bad from here.  I always go in, order, and take to-go, but there are a few tables if you prefer to eat-in.  I have not used their delivery service as it started after I moved out of Summerlin, so it would be too far.
