The food was not good at all plus it's located in a shity part of town filled with meth heads and it wasn't that long ago somebody got stabbed at this place. To be honest the only reason i really used to go was because there was this waitress i was trying to get at who I thought was cute but then one day i seen her with no makeup and i was like wtf! So now i will never be going back.
