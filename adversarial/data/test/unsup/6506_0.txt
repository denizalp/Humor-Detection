One of the best buffet in Las Vegas!  They have a variety of selections from\nItalian, Mexican, international, asian, salad etc\nService is great here!  The waiter was very m√≠ diff when our Bev was getting low and the plates are always cleared.\n\nJust be mindful, there is a LINE?  So plan accordingly.
