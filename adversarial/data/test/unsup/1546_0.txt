Jennifer and Jerry are a great team there at Storage West. We needed a storage unit in a hurry due to Mother moving to town with a whole lot of stuff that she just couldn't let go of. So Jennifer & Jerry helped us to get our unit. The property is very clean and new. Nice landscaping even. Something I like to see.  You will not be disappointed if you go there for storage. And tell them Hello for me will ya!
