I eat here almost every day. It's such a great healthy option and it's very close to my gym. My favorite drinks are the wellness juice and the green smoothie. Watermelon is great, too! The bison cheese steak is delicious in a spinach wrap! And the make your own option keeps you mixing and matching every visit. The teriyaki sauce makes any of them taste good. You HAVE to try the sweet potato mash. The service is wonderful, as well. Y'all are always so friendly : )
