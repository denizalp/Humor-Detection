I met my boyfriend here for dinner one night after work. He grew up in this area and remembered the restaurant, although it had been years since he was here.\n\nHe got a bento box and sushi boat, and I ordered off the menu. Portions were good and the food was also good. I liked the ice cream balls they served after the meal.\n\nThis is a good option if yo're looking for Asian food in the area. I'd come back again.
