Simply the best place to buy AND have hats serviced in Phoenix. These stores are few and far between where you can buy a quality hat from many different manufacturers.......Bailey, Stetson, Stacy Adams. A dying art, and it is truly an art, is cleaning, blocking, reconditioning hats. Anyone who loves hats should be thankful we have a shop like this in town. Believe it, some places don't. I will be returning very soon.
