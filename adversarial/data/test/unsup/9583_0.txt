I could not recommend Minit Maids more highly!\n\nRick, the owner, came personally to check out my apartment shortly after I called. He made suggestions for a first-time deep cleaning and helped me set up subsequent cleanings. \n\nMy schedule is particularly erratic (I rent out my place on Airbnb and often need to schedule cleanings at short notice), but they've been able to accommodate me each time. \n\nThe office staff is responsive and courteous, and the cleanings themselves are thorough and detailed. The value they provide is absolutely worth the money. 5 stars all around!
