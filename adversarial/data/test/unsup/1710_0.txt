I adored Uptown Coffee as a middle- and high-school student, mostly due to its proximity to the school.  It is a great, mellow place to hang out for hours.  Their drinks and desserts are always delicious, and they used to serve sandwiches.  They seem to have gone through a makeover since I graduated, and now it is much better lit, though the much-beloved couch is no longer.\nUptown Coffee is a great alternative to Starbucks and a great place to spend a few hours catching up with friends.
