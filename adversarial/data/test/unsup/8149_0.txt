Best Pepes in Vegas. Owner actually has priced everything fairly. All the other locations have gotten greedy and almost double their prices. This location has gone up but at a reasonable rate. Also I have noticed that it is consistently delicious where the other locations have from time to time been a let-down. I give kudos to this location and wants to tell the owner how great of a job they are running this business
