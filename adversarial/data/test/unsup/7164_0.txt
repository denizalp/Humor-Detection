The new Encore Players Club is perfectly located across from Surrender and has 23 big screens and a pool table... If you're not planning on getting into the Club but still want to check out the eye candy, this is a good place to situate yourself with your friends. \n\nThe comfy sofas will keep you lounging for a while. Blackjack, craps and roulette will keep you entertained too if that's your fancy. \n\nBe sure to visit this new spot if in the Encore or at the Wynn.
