Gave them a 1 only because it looked like a nice place to eat. A woman abruptly asked us if we were picking up and we said no. It was 10 minutes before closing. She said \"we're closed\" and asked us to leave. \nIt's too bad because there are hundreds of mini-mall pizza places. We were hoping to find a good one in our neighborhood. If she is the owner, she should read some of these comments. Looks like we aren't the only ones that think their customer service skills are lacking.
