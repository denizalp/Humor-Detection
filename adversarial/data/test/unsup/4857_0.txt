There are times where you just can't seem to find the energy to get fancy looking for a night out, but you really don't want to stay in. If you're looking to relax, have a cheap drink, meet some down to earth folks, and play some pool then this is where you need to be. The bartender is the coolest little lady I've ever met. Told me all about the joint. I wish I could share but after a few drinks well I forgot! But go on in and ask for yourself!! Don't forget to bring cash!
