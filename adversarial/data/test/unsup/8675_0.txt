I didn't realize that Menard's decided to make a specific store where the employees act like stuck up assholes, managers have heads up their asses, and employees are encouraged to dump trash all over the floor and shelves.  Oh wait, that's the merchandise!  And don't forget to check out the \"Rape Me Aisle\", in case you haven't seen the so-called lumber area thats dark and damp like the serial killers basement from American Horror Story Asylum.
