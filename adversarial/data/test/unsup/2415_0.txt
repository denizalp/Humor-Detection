i love soccer.. and did you know that the American Outlaws hang out here and it is liek a Soccer Palooza for all of the matches. WHAT WHAT.\n\nThe Environment is on point. Best Atmosphere I have ever felt for a soccer match. Love it and always want to come here.. but YES THERE IS A BUT..\n\n$18 for 2 beers.... $18 for 2 beers. Let that sink in. I dont understand how $18 could cover 2 beers... 2 regular sized beers. NOT A FAN.
