Chuckling at a previous Yelp description of \"Weird abandoned sort of loosely themed Hawaiian homeless hang out\" it seems not much has changed at Hawaiian Marketplace in the last two years, the recent opening of Rockin Rice Puddin & NY Pizza perhaps a reason to stop by if one is in the area...though the fact that two vagrants were splitting time between a dance off and trying to sell drugs will probably be a turnoff to most.
