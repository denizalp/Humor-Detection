Owned and operated by Koreans.\nFood is aright to the average person, bit on the high $$ side though.\nI'm a picky eater, so I'll have to say I can't rate them high on the taste or quality.\n\nService was outrageously bad though.\nWe had a very nosy Korean Waitress,\nand she would interrogate my group with personal questions.\n\nbtw; this is the same nosy waitress that used to work at Mido Sushi.\n\nHoly crud, save me from her!!! RUN.
