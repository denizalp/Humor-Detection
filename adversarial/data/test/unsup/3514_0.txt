Overall loved the location and the fact that I was not ignored I was helped right away and my sever Crystal was great friendly and fun! Without missing a beat she refilled the drinks at the table even though the place was packed. Also Jeremy was really helpful on helping me make up my mind! The wait time on the food was a bit long, but because of the service I received I will be coming back for sure!
