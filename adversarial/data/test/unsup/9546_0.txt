I have to say that I really love buffets in general and this one is pretty dang good. There's a wide selection of sushi from good to bad ones. However, there's so many that you're bound to find something that you'll like. If sushi is not your thing, there are also other options as well that are so so. \n\nWhen you come here, expect nothing spectacular, but expect to be full and happy!
