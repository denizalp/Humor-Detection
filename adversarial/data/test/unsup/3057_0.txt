Great service & super friendly workers! Our servers name was OZZY and he was by far the BEST server I've had since I came here. He made the experience so awesome! He deserves an outstanding award by his managers! His hard work and dedication to this company shouldn't go unnoticed. He made sure we had everything we needed and more. Very patient, and quick! Thank you again OZZY and Gens workers! :) will be back for sure!!!
