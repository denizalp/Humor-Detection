Bland franchise with a terrible uni color scheme and brutal logo. Other than the one season Jake Delhomme did not play like the mediocre QB he is, that's it. I defy anyone outside of Carolina to name a player on the Panthers. Julius Peppers does not count as he just left.\n\nI do love one thing; Coach Fox likes to call the onside kick at the most unlikely times and they often work.
