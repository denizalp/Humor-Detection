This restaurant is a great addition to Penn Ave. The tapas menu is big and everything sounded delicious. My boyfriend and I decided on a grilled romaine salad, chestnut gnocchi, scallops & ravioli, and lamb meatballs. My favorite was the chestnut gnocchi, but everything was fantastic. Our table decided on the \"breads and spreads\" as a starter, with homemade warm baguette. The service was fantastic, and the chef\/owner came by twice to say hello! For dessert, our table shared a cookie table, which was served with milk in shot glasses and was really fun to share.
