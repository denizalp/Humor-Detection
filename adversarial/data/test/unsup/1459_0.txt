This place has an ingenious business philosophy.  If we open an establishment that\n\na)  Looks good\nb)  Serves alcohol\nc)  Has food that doesn't make people sick\nd)  Doesn't have competition \n\nthen people will keep coming back.\n\nThrow something else in there about serving $9.00 margaritas that taste like cough syrup, too.\n\nBad service and $15 salads made with iceberg lettuce.\n\nYou haven't fooled me, Burntwood Tavern.  See you again when it's 90 degrees in January.
