I find the food to be just OK. Nothing special. The service is actually sort of weird...in that the waitress stares blankly and is generally unhelpful. An real conversation that occurred...on TWO separate occasions:\nWaitress: \"White or brown rice?\"\nMe: \"White\"\nWaitress: \"We don't have white rice here.\"\nMe: \"Um....?\"
