Chef Jacob knows his way around the kitchen. Very skilled and great flavor profiles. \n\nBeen here three times now and every time I ask Chef to make me the best burger of the day. Garlic mushroom burger once, green chili burger twice. The green chili has a nice smoky flavor with a good amount of heat. Patty is cooked perfectly. The fried egg on top gives it such a decadent, rich finish.\n\nPlace may look like a hole in the wall, but step inside and you'll see why this place has so many 5 star reviews.
