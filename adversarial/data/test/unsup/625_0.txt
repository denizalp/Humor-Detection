This bar is an enabler, and I am thankful for that. \n\nFor all of my (underage) drinking that occurred here when I lived in Pittsburgh. \n\nIt's cheap, tiny, and awesome. Rarely crowded, or it used to be rarely crowded. \n\nPlus they have an awesomely shitty pool table where your cues won't be straight and the table is probably uneven, and it's impossible to line up a shot without hitting the wall.
