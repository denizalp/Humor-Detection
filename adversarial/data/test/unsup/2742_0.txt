Great place to come with friends. Food is quite good as well. Their pizza is thin crust and was quite delicious as were their pasta dishes.\nThe covered patio is one of my favourite features (but I do dislike having to take the stairs all the way downstairs when needing a bathroom). It is pretty in every season and it feels like you are outside but in fact it is warm and covered.\nIt is a casual place, trendy with good food and drinks and a perfect place to hang out with friends\/coworkers, casual date, etc.
