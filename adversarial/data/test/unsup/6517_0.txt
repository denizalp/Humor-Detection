Review for the club:\n\nOpen bar from 11-12 with wristband...Michael Jackson medley for about 30 minutes....dance floor an ok size but still pretty packed...this place is a definite pre-party spot do not recommend for rockstar types....\n\nAlso many sinks to wash your hands in from the entrance of the club to the bathroom ..no im not kidding....that is all
