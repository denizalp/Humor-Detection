Well.. I order a Enchiladas with adobada meet \nWas the most nasty adobada meet I eat \nThe waiter was nice when my husband and I arrive \nBut I'm still waiting still for my refill she never bring me anything\nI am very upset I did not enjoy my dinner was horrible \nThis location in Arribas  I don't have idea what they sale but I'm sure Mexican food they don't sale NASTY
