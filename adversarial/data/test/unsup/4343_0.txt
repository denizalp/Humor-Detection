Let me start by saying the restaurant is beautiful. The food is presented well, the tables, everything is visually appealing. Unfortunately the food? Not so much. I ordered the shitaki mushrooms and fried dumplings, the portions were crazy small for the price, and seriously lacked flavor. Everything was either really bland or entirely too salty. Our server was really helpful and friendly, but that did not make up for the lack of tastyness unfortunately. I have to say this was just not a win for me. I will not be returning.
