Great fish and very friendly and efficient. Great mom and pop operation. Excellent halibut. My only criticism is the fries. They are a bit soggy and get worse when you get them home (we live 3 blocks away). Otherwise their fish is superb. We have a cat that  NEVER eats people food and he loves it too.
