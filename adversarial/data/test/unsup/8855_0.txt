Beautiful building and grounds.  Lacking the big stores you depend on a mall to have, especially one referred to as \"Arizona Center\".  Maybe the black hole of shopping malls.  Might I suggest that Arizona Center start wooing some of the retailers your visitors come to expect in all major American malls? The Gap, Gymboree, Nordstrom etc.  I needed a pair of black pumps.  I guess I must depend on Amazon.
