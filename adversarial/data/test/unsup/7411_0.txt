They are spending $100 000 per LRT car to put air conditioning on the c-trains for the 4 days of the year when it actually gets WARM (not hot; that never happens here) while doing absolutely nothing to heat platforms for the 150 days when it actually gets cold. If Mexico City's subway can deal with no AC and Tokyo with a conservative use of AC on the JR, I think Calgary Canada could get by, too.\n\nThat's it, I'm moving to Chicago.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.chicagonow.com\/blogs\/redeye\/assets_c\/2009\/11\/westernheat-thumb-640xauto-32122.jpg\nhttp:\/\/www.chicagonow.com\/blogs\/redeye\/assets_c\/2009\/11\/westheat-thumb-640xauto-32126.jpg
