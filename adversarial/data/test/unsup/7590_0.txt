Came in for dinner tonight. I love the atmosphere. Our waitress Crystal was adorable and on point. We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table but it was worth it. The cornbread was delicious. We wanted more of the apricot jam to take home! The burger was cooked perfectly and has great flavor. My boyfriend had the chicken fried special and I had a few bites and it was great as well. Definitely be back. Only suggestion is get more wit beers and hefewizens on the drink menu.
