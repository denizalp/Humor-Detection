Chocoholics unite! I came here to redeem my free chocolate bar coupon I got from a Yelp event and to pick up some last minute goodies for Christmas. I was surprised on how big this place was! It was filled with all different varieties of chocolate and if I had less self-control I would have bought so much more!\n\nWant to know the best part? Getting chocolate samples with my purchase! Yum!
