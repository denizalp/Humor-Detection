TKRE is a good a good concept since Toronto does not have many Kathi roll places. However, the execution is not good. I initially planned to dine in but as I got there, the place was super stuffy and smelled funky. I ordered the chicken tikka roll and some chaat to go. The food tasted good but was way overpriced for the amount of food I got. Definitely not worth the money and I'm not quite sure if I will be going back. I wish Downtown Yonge had better Indian restaurants!
