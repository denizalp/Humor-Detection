I have come here numerous times with friends and have never encountered a problem.  Except seeing how rude some of the people are to the staff! The food is good and the servers have always been great to us. Never a problem getting seated or collecting our bill. We even have a favorite waiter (Waters) now who greets us with a hug. The food is good for the price. The restrooms are clean and parking is never a problem. It's Applebee's but it fits the budget!
