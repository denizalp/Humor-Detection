Unreal. Lon in Electrical is amazingly knowledgeable. He is a great listener and helped me pick out the perfect items. \nEverything you hope for when you walk in with a vague idea and zero skill set.\nI hate home improvement because it always means I end up making 3 trips. \nLon makes me look forward to needing his help on a new project!\nSarah in paint was also a Rock Star. \nThanks!!!!!
