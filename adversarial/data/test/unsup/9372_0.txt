The food here was very good. I had the chicken and the egg and it was amazing. Definitely not your average chix biscuit. The cucumber salad went very well with this dish. There are plenty of menu items and baked goods to try from and the staff is extremely helpful when ordering. Great hospitality. Will definitely return soon.
