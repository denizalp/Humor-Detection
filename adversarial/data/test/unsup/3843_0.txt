Came here for the first time and it has a really cool vibe inside. They have a DJ and they do karaoke competitions. Inside is very spacious with a dance floor. We ordered the Caf√© De Cebu Fried RIce and Kare Kare. I was lowkey disappointed with the menu because they do not have a lot of food to choose from. But the fried rice was delicious with the bits and pieces of lechon in there and the kare kare was very flavorful. I would come back here and try something else off the menu.
