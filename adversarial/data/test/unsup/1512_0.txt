They did such a great job!! It was an extremely hot day and there were no complaints whatsoever. They were so pleasant and made the process a much less stressful experience. I had never hired movers before, but I will definitely do it in the future and I will especially recommend Five Star Moving to friends and family. Excellent service for both the moving and the cleaning.
