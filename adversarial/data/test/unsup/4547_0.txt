Came here to interview a prospective MIT student.  Place was packed at 09:00 on a Saturday morning.  I had to wait in line about ten minutes - biggest complaint I have with the place and the reason it has four instead of five stars.  Baristas just couldn't seem to get it together.  Ordered a small chai latte, and it was quite tasty and served well.  Place is small, so there is limited seating.  Parking is a problem - need to park on the street, and there are a couple of homeless guys who hang out in the nearby area.
