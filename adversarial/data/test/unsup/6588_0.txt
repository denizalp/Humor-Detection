This is a great new addition to the offerings at the Cosmopolitan. They opened today at noon and while they are still figuring out their systems, they are putting out an amazing quality of treats. While I only had the crack'd boozy shake, a crack pie milkshake with liquor, I will be back during my stay. The only thing that would make the experience better would be Christina Tosi feeding us from her hands. Looking forward to all the options they are offering.
