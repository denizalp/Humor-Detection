I went there with a friend for the second time. Both times the service was excellent, and the waitress was friendly and very welcoming. The food is probably the best kept secret in the neighbourhood. There are plenty of bars around this neighbourhood and I have probably visited them all. Dollar for dollar I feel this is the best food for a reasonable price with amazing service. \nWe are hooked. We are now regulars.
