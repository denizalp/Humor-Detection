A surprisingly and organized airport for being Las Vegas. I'm so relieved that I don't smell like cigar smoke when I walk out of the airport. Which is good because once you walk out of the airport you are immediately slammed with the unforgiving, brutal, heat of the desert!!!\nThe taxi line is ALWAYS horrendously long!! Just like a line in Disneyland, an endless supply of taxis are ready to take you to your destination and you're off having the time of your life in the adult version of the most happiest place.
