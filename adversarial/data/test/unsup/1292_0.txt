I absolutely love the mozzarella sticks! They hit the spot every time! I also really enjoy the slice and wings combo, for under $10 you can get a slice and wings (bone in or boneless) AND a drink! I've gotten the big party pizza multiple times and shared it with about 10 people at a neighborhood party. The customer service is outstanding, the employees are always ready to take your order and answer any questions you have!
