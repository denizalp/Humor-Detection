Worst experience ever getting an oil change. Not only the most expensive in the valley, they never put air in my tires, never checked air filter, which was black, said my belts were fine when the serpentine belt was full of cracks, but yet the guy that checked them was busy changing spark plugs for cash out in the parking lot. He spent a total of 30 seconds looking at my truck. He slammed the hood and left they other guy to finish up so he could go back to his side job. Never again
