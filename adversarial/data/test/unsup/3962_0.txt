Excellent coffee- Mandy actually knows how to make a perfect dry cappuccino! And they have introduced me to a Dirty Chai Latte for those days I want tea but need espresso! The staff is super friendly and I can't say enough for their breads, scones and muffins. So glad this location opened-so convenient and a nice alternative to the chain coffee shops!
