This place is waaaay overdue for a makeover.  I always end up going here on someone else's request and always end up disappointed.  I just don't understand why people think this place is so great.  My only theory that makes sense is that it used to be good at some point and became a regular place for a lot of folks.  Now, they continue to go because they're loyal and don't know any better.
