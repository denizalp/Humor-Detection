After my roommates bet me I could not eat 10 doubles we took the beautiful trek to the Regent st. McDonalds. After getting into an altercation in the parking lot with a 70 year old woman about how it's not proper to cut in the drive thru line, we ordered our 10 doubles and a few other meals and went home. Burger after burger they were cooked to perfection. Seven burgers later I felt stuffed. I felt like sh** for the next two days. I think that they poisoned my food. I give it 4 Stars.
