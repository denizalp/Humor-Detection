Okay here is the thing.\nThey are racist. I got so embarrassed when I got there. No welcome with blunt face.\nWhen I asked him to add an eggs in my sandwich, he told me \" what? What? Do you want eggs?\" He kept his fucking attitude again and again. He didn't smile at all when we're facing. He didn't wanna talk with me.\nJust looking at vegetables on and on. Lol\nI've been in many place in vegas and everybody is nice. \nIt's horrible place I never been.\nFucking white guy ass hole. -_-\nThat's why it's really scary to talk with uneducated person.
