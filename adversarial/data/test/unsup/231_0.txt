Chick-Fil-A is so addictive (I swear, there must be narcotics in the breading or something). \n\nAs mentioned by Ben H., the service at this particular location is impeccable. I think it's really sweet that they have fresh flowers on their tables and by the sink in the rest room. Very good service, always amazing food served hot. What more can one ask for?
