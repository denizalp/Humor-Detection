Keeping it short and sweet much like the store:\n\n- they seem to carry only one of every size (S, M, L) which makes the selection all the more unique\n- despite their small size they have a great selection (perhaps due to the fact that they only carry one of every size and therefore have more space left on the rack)\n- seem to be quality garments\n- staff are super nice\n\nI often find myself browsing around in Girl Friday, it's funky and fabulous.
