What's not to love about a real deal dive bar!\n\nRan into this bar by accident--going to event nearby, stumbled upon this spot and had to give it a try. Total tiki\/tropical theme. Enjoyed a couple of tropical cocktails--umbrellas and all. Loud jukebox playing jams. All that was missing was a white sandy beach and ocean waves. \n\nReasonably priced, friendly service. Will definitely be coming back. If you're anywhere even close and looking to grab a drink, do yourself a favor and come through.
