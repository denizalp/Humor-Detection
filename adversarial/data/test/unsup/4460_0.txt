I normally have great service & love the deals at Nordstrom Rack. Yesterdat they were having a problem with their scanners they use throughout the stars by the clerks to allow for easy and quick paying via credit cards. It took nearly 20 minutes because of the service problems, but the amazing Kate Spade purse at a great price was worth the wait!
