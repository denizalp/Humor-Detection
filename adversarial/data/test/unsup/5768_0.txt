A sales associate came and introduce himself to us. We told him that my boyfriend was just looking for a new car. My boyfriend asked if they had anything sporty.. the sales associate said \"what about the Honda Accord\".. I'm sorry, but I don't know what made him think an accord is a \"sporty car\" .. sorry but we will take our business else where
