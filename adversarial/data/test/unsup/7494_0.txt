The view is amazing. Pretty noisy environment so if you are looking to have a quiet conversation or conventional 1st date (I'm not exactly conventional but most people want that), this might not be the spot. Otherwise, it is a fun environment with great food and drinks. It is definitely something different! I would recommend it!
