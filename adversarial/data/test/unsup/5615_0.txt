A cool little place that brings both quality and quantity into a nice bundle with its AYCE Korean BBQ. The interior actually looks like a high end restaurant with comfortable booths and illuminated lights. The server was super kind and made sure that we were constantly attended to. This might actually be one of the best AYCE Korean BBQ places in Vegas.
