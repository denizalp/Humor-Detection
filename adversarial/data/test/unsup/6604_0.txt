Be careful. The bartenders will not give you your change back after ordering a drink.\n\nEither they're too drunk, or it's a way for them to get some extra cash into the bar (I'm guessing the latter). \n\nI ordered 2 beers, handed her a 20.00, and she walked away and didn't come back. I had to yell over at her, and she knew right away and gave me the exact change back. So that leads me to think she wasn't thaaaat drunk. \n\nI will not be coming back here.
