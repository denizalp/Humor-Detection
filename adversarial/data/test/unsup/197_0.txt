Go hungry and order AYCE!!!\n\nThough the sushi is decent, this place is better suited for the cooked entrees. \n\nI always get the squid appetizer; usually four portions. Great Korean dishes.\n\nI do enjoy sushi, but confess there are a few places in LV that do it a little better.\n\nNo complaints on the service, but you do get better served when you sit at the sushi bar. \n\nA good place for a date, and certainly, a good value to take visitors.
