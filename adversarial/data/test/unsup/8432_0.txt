I was in the mood for a change so I made an appointment with this salon.  I saw Jessica and she was great.  She was able to match my previous color nearly perfectly and she took time to review my options.  They are competitively priced and gave me a couple of coupons for my next visit.  \n\nThe salon is nice inside and easy to find.  Parking is a breeze.  I will definitely return!
