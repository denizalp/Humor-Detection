I'm afraid I'm going to have to call rank on the issue of sushi. As a person who has lived in Hokkaido, Japan for a number of years (an island regarded by many as having the best Japanese food) this place is awesome on many levels! It has GREAT sushi!\n\nPersonally, I like to order from the underground menu, just ask for it...it has some really great rolls listed. The hardest part is going to be choosing just a few...you're gonna want all of them. Most recently I enjoyed the Sasquatch Roll.
