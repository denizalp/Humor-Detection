Undiscovered jewel of Calgary! Who knew there was such a fabulous restaurant tucked away in Heritage Park? We went for the \"Sunday Dinner\" (lovely salad, prime rib with yorkshire pudding, fruit crumble dessert) -- wonderful in its simplicity; brilliant in its understatedness. The place is warm and inviting, the wait staff are relaxed and welcoming, and I look forward to their patio opening up.
