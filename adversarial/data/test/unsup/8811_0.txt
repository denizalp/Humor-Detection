Happy hour is the best time to go here.  Ohh the Squid salad is top notch.  \nHappy hour is 5-6:30PM and all day on Tuesday or all night, I forgot.  I'm going to happy hour in less than 15 minutes.  Also they don't consider Fat Tire a domestic beer when in fact it is made in CO, that's why I didn't give then 5\/5 stars.
