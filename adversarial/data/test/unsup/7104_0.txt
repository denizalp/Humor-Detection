I was referred to Robert Pho at Skin Design Tattooos  by my friend Big Bad Onxx from KushTV.com and couldn't be happier.  If you want custom work done, Robert Pho is your artist.  He's usually booked months in advance so if you want to make an appointment, call him up AT LEAST 1 month before your planned date.  You can check out his work at www.skindesigntattoos.com
