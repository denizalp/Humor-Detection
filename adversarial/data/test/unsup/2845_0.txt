Stumbled across this place after leaving Pam Anderson's bday party and was sold after seeing people swinging....yes SWINGING inside!!!!\nIf you want to feel like you're in a reality show or rock video this is the place to be!!\nDuring the summer it gets JAMMED PACKED, if you're lucky you will find people handing out VIP tickets and trust...it's worth it\n\nLike Jager well this is the place to get BOMBED!!!!\nDrinks are cheap and full of thrill in your mouth\nIf you're real lucky you can hop on the  bar and table dance for all\nthe hot messes you see inside
