Don't go here.   This is the worst strip club in Vegas.   Each time I go I am promised one thing and then over charged for another.   Of you get a private dance, you will be quoted one price and then charged at least another $40 for for drinks you didn't want.    You WILL be ripped off here.  Ask ANYONE that has been here before( don't trust the taxi driver or limo driver that was paid to drop you off).
