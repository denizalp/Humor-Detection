$15 for 2 pretzels & 2 small drinks (kid sized drinks)........ did I wander into the movie theater on accident? LOL! The pretzels are ok, but not AWESOME in my opinion. \n\nIn a fix when I need something & don't want to face the food court, I have been known to pay for the luxury of not facing the crowds. It's an option :)\n\nThe pretzel place shares a counter with Mrs Fields Cookies, so just veer off to the side towards the 3 little tables just inside & you will see the sign.
