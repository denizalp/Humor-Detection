Having to pay extra for chips and salsa at a place called \"La Salsa Cantina\" is bad. When they are served broken into small pieces and crumbs is worse.  The food is your standard Mexican fare and is average at best. I might be hyper critical because I'm from Los Angeles.   I suppose if you were visiting from Peoria you might think it's the best Mexican food ever. Las Vegas is a melting pot of visitors from around the world.  Angelinos should not eat here.  It's not El Tepeyac.
