Went here with friends tonight for the very first time. Very good service & great food. Really good ambience. I had the Teppan Yaki Chicken & a side of shrimp. \n\nI wasn't crazy about the Miso Soup, but the salad was good. The chicken & shrimp was very tasty. Our chef was hilarious & had us in stitches! Very entertaining! \n\nI will gladly go back again!
