I was super excited to see there was a breakfast spot near me that served grits. The atmosphere and service was great up until the moment I pulled someone's hair from my tooth. I was instantly mortified and expressed my concern to who appeared as a female manager. After I shared my discontent regarding the hair fiasco she begin to laugh and tell me her cooks wear hair nets. Lets just say I will never return to this establishment.
