I totally agree with Nataly K. He's the ruddist individual that I've ever spoken to on the phone. Also, very unprofessional. I'm forfeiting my \"buywithme\" voucher and taking my business elsewhere. I've written a complaint to the headquaters of BuyWithMe about the lack of customer service (waiting for a response) with Neal Kirsch's business
