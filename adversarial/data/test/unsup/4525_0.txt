You guys, they are updating their menu and had a \"Lamb Burger with Feta and Curry Mayo\" to try as a special that they are adding.  It. Was. Awesome.  Seriously, so tasty.  You need to go here, and get that burger, and then die of happiness.  Been here several times, and although service is a tad slow during lunch, they're always very friendly and the food is great, so I don't mind.  ALSO - check in on Yelp... you'll be glad you did :)
