The location is lovely and probably the best thing about Ill Fornello - especially if you get an outside seat watching out onto the lake.\nWaiter service was very friendly, helpful and understanding - we had a young child with us. \nI got the Chicken Alfredo and the pesto sauce was scrumptious! Plus - I was starving and I gobbled it up like a Hoover. \nThey have a good choice of wine too which is great as wine and pasta is one of my favourite combos. \nPerfect for a light meal after a stroll around Downtown or Harbourfront.
