I don't know why this place is getting low reviews. All of the food is fresh, and the hibachi is delicious! The guy who cooked my ribeye cooked it to order (medium rare,) andseasoned it with Montreal steak seasoning. It was sooooo good! All of the other food was good too, and the table service was excellent! Give it a try!!
