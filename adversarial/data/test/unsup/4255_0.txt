We had a good time, loved the ambiance and our waiter was fantastic. He recommended some good wine and really knew his stuff. \n\nMy gf's salmon was kinda funky though... very fishy, I didn't think it tasted great at all. My steak was excellent and so was the  bread and shishito pepper appetizer.  The tiger prawn tamale was tasty but make no mistake that those were not tiger prawns.  More like something you get at grocery store. Meh.
