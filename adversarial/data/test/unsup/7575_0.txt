I have to say I really like Panda Express. Most of them are very good.\n Clean and quick. which will always make one happy. \nAlthough they did not have the items that I really wanted, I still got what I liked.\nThey give you a few options on rice and noodles.\nNice and hot. Place looked pretty clean inside. Even though they were busy.\nI got it to go, so everything was great. Parking is a little tough.
