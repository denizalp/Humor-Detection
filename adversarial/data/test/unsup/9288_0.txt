My daughter and I had an appointment at 9:30am to get one manicure and one pedicure. My daughter got her pedicure, I was there for three hours and all they did was take off my old nails and never gave me a manicure, they said it would be another 20 minute wait. I would not recommend this place to anyone especially if your time is precious to you. I am very annoyed and upset. Didn't want to give any stars but wouldn't let me continue without at least one star.
