I ordered delivery and they were out of poutine so they called me to ask if they could send me something else, which was fine. However, when the food arrived it was cold and soggy, also the sauces they gave me had a best before date of a month ago. I tried to call the restaurant to let them know they were serving expired food, but no one answered even though the restaurant was still open.
