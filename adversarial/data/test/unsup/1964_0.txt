Omg this place is legit. People speak French, and so do their pastries!!! \n\nThe best and most moist phyllo dough croissants I have ever had! Their sandwiches are delicious and the coffee is spot on. Brings me back to France. \n\nThe interior decor is so cute, classy, but also welcoming.\n\nLove love love it!!!!
