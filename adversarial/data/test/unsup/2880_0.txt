So I have already been there 2 times in a week. Food is really done well with a lot of really cool vegetarian items like chilequilles with tofu. I also loved the triple decker tuna sandwich. My kids love it to with little baskets of toys to keep them busy till the food comes out, which doesn't take long at all. The service was great. Andrew was top notch and made sure we had everything we need. I am sure I will be back on my next day off.
