Park was a nice place when it first opened with security guard. Recently it has become a very rough area for the high school children to cut across during the weekday. There has been robberies, and assaults from getting beat up to electronic gadgets stolen. Nice Park 4 the weekends with water feature and covered BBQ areas for family parties. Definite adult supervision recommended at all time for children especially around bathroom areas. Nice spacious dog park area but could definitely use some shade.
