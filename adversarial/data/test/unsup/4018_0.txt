Absolutely clueless. I sent them a request for info based on content listed on their website. I get a recruiter calling me today with an attitude, who tells me what's on the website is wrong and they don't offer the program I want anymore. At that point he just hangs up. Dude, you missed an opportunity here to sign someone up as I had other interests besides the one you called about. \n\nOne Star, and even that's being given under protest.
