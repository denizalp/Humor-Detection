I work in the area and recently discovered Olive Tree Delicafe. I wanted something light and quick and this was the right place to go! \n\nThe service there is amazing. No matter how busy they are, they always have a smile on their face. \n\nThey have daily specials. The sandwiches and soups are always fresh - always made on demand. The Ruben sandwich and cream of broccoli combo is my favourite. \n\nHighly recommended!
