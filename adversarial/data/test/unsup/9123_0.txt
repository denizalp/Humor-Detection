If you like to play tennis in a court with a net, this is not the park for you. If you are like me and have a daughter in the United States Tennis Association. This park is definitely not for you. Unless you just need to practice your swing on a backboard. Maybe this might be for you. If you need a hiking trail or picnic tables. BBQ pits or a big playing field, then you will probably enjoy this place. Plenty of parking and restrooms are available.
