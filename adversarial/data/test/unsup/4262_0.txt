My co workers and I go here at least 3-4 times week and we LOVE it. Whether they are serving a large or small party of people  they always serve our food quickly. the sushi is delicious and there many other entrees as well. Everything here is reasonably price. We typically stay here any where form 1-3 hours at a time. I absolutely adore Simon and Kassie as waiters. I will more then likely be here tomorrow or the next day and many more after!
