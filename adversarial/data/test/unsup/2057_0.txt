Omg!!!!! talk about cookies!!! I've never in my life enjoyed a cookie the way I did that day lol. My bf & I enjoy traveling just to eat and this is the biggest thing we regret is not getting more cookies or trying the ice cream. Previous to this trip we watched her on Netflix on how she started milk. Forget about all the cookies and ice cream spots you've had. This is def a must try!!!
