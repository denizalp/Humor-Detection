Sam's Club or Costco.... Which To Choose.\n\nI have memberships at both  Costco and Sam's Club . However, Sam's Club is closer to my house, so when I am short on time Sam's Club  is usually my choice. In General, while Sam's Club and Costco offer good value I think Costco sells better products and merchandise and has better customer service.\n\nOn a positive note the gas at Sam's Club seems to be the cheapest in town as compared to the gas at my local Costco.  However, both are good clubs.
