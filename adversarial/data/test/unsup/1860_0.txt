Came here with my boyfriend on accident (put in the wrong address for a restaurant we were going to eat at) and we stumbled on this place. Seeing as how we both are big bubble tea connoisseurs, we decided go! He got the Hokkaido and Okinawa and I got the sea salt green tea latte and let me tell you...AMAZING!! I wish I lived here for this place. Amazing selection of ice creams as well as bubble teas and other cool desserts. Vegan friendly! Oh and they use honey boba! Yum!
