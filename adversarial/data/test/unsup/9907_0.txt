The wings are the only reason why I come to this place. They have self sitting along with self service drinks with CocaCola Freestyle machine. \n\nBut the place looks like no one wants to clean unless asked to, or perhaps begged to. The staff isn't that welcoming when you first come in either. Once they take your order, you won't see the waitress check on you.
