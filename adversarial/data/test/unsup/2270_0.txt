I had been waiting for a special occasion to try this restaurant as I always stay at the Bellagio.  Well, the time came to try it.  I ordered short ribs.  My meat was not soft at all - and also not flavorful.  The others in our party were also not very impressed.  We were seated by the kitchen, but had a great view of the fountains.  I won't return however.  there are many other great places in Vegas.  Don't waste your time and money here.
