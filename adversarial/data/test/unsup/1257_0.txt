Okay this I literally the old man bar of Arizona!! I felt so weird coming here watching s baseball game! \n\nThe staff was awesome though! The bartender Alex kicked butt! She was very personable and very attentive.\n\nPSA THIS IS A CHICAGO BAR!!! I hate the cubs so I didn't love the ambiance or vibes. \n\nThey offer a great happy hour. Personal pizza (just okay) and chicken fingers plus 7 beers only $40!!! \n\nIf you don't mind old men (or you're one yourself) this is the place to be.
