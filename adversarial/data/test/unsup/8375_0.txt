Variety, turnover (foods changed out regularly), and flavor are three words to describe this buffet. I went on a Saturday around 3PM, 12\/2014. The holiday price was a shocker, but well worth it. I recommend the Studio B Buffet at The M Resort Spa and Casino. The price is significant, but worth the food (all kinds of salads and meats, seafood, and dishes with Greek, Asian, and Italian influences), drinks (including specialty coffees with liquor, wine and beer taps), and service (ask and receive, our waitress was excellent).
