I used to work around the corner from this place. The one and only thing I miss from that job is that it was around the corner from this place!\n\nThe tofu teriyaki rice bowl was my all time. \n\nVery, very friendly and clean. And for some reason my lunch hour seemed to last 2 hours here. I'm convinced that they have a time machine in the kitchen!
