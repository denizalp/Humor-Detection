For the price, I think NYNY is a great place to stay if you're just looking for a place to sleep at a reasonable price in a centralized spot.\n\nDecent hotel without the bells and whistles... \n\nMy only complaint is that there are two sides of the hotel and it was pretty confusing finding our room. The fitness center is also located on one end so if you are staying at the other end you have through the casino to get there. \n\nNot many good restaurants in the hotel as well.. but again no complaints for the price paid.
