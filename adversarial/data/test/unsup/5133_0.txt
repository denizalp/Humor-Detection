I've been coming to Nora's on and off for at least 8-10 years and it is always consistently good.  I love this place for lunch and is extremely reasonable for lunch ( ribeye steak with a salad for $12.95) is a steal!  The chicken marsala is great as well as the garlic bread.  I would highly recommend a reservation for dinner!
