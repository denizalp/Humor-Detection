Great park to bring the little ones to! I nanny a 1 and a half year old and a three year old and this park is great for both ages. It is securely fenced in so I don't have to worry about one running into the street. Awesome sandbox as well. It's a great place to bring them to get some of that energy out while feeling that they are safe!
