The best community coffee shop on the block.  The staff remember you, they're personable and sometimes sassy but fun and friendly. The flat whites are my current drink-de-jour, made perfectly. The owner'll recognize you, too, and take the time to say hello. \n\nAn enjoyable spot to read, get some work done and.. people-watch.\n\nBike parking on the street side. Lanai\/patio. Wheelchair accessible. Wifi.
