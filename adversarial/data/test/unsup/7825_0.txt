No harm, no foul but Boulders is not for me. It's a place for a quick drink and a taste of their waffle fries. But not one where you can linger. It's a large space broken up into a few sections. It's dark and if your nose is sensitive, it'll pick up that \"je ne sais what\" smell. It greeted me at the entrance and I got a little concerned. But not enough to be deterred but I knew I wasn't staying long enough to hang my hat.
