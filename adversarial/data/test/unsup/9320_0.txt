My family and I love Pampas. Every time we go to Las Vegas , we go there for lunch. The food and service is excellent. My favorite is the grilled pineapple. We were there for the Fourth of July weekend and Marcos N. was our passador. He provided excellent costumer service. He was very friendly and helpful. There are no words to describe Pampas. Best Brazilian Churrascaria!
