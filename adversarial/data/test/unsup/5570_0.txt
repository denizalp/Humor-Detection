It's funny how this is my neighborhood Krispie Kreme but, I've never been inside. Low and behold, this particular location has the donut-making-elves in there. \n\nYou can watch the conveyor belt of donuts from freshly boiled to drizzled in chocolate to sprinkled with sprinkles. \nIt was quite fun for my niece and donut-loving-self :) \n\np.s. The donuts are delish. But, I'm sure you already knew that!
