Not just a breakfast place.  Have had lunch there a few times and it was fantastic.  The absolute BEST prime rib french dip anywhere!  The meat is so tender it melts in your mouth.\n\nVery friendly wait staff and fast service.  Have never had to wait for a table.  This has become one of my very favorite restaurants.   Will try breakfast next time.
