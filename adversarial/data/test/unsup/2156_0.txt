Was able to get a soda and a slice of pizza for $2.50 just before midnight.  Arrived at the Hyatt Regency at the Arcade too late to order room service, but was starving.  This location was right next door to the hotel.  This is not gourmet food, but for $1.50 a slice and $1 for a can of pop, what can you expect?  The slice was served hot and was just enough calories to get to breakfast.
