holy moly. david is the most unprofessional \"business owner\" i have ever encountered in my life. he is first of all sloppy in appearance, is disrespectful and does not know how to talk to customers. he (david, fat business owner) talks down on customers. he should be nice and courteous not disrespectful and belittling. i do not wish anyone do business with this slob!!! please do not give a rude person your hard earned money.
