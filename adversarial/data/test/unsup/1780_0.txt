Ok,I am not looking to be snob about looking for the best hotel in Las Vegas,but who goes to Las Vegas to stay in a hotel room  all day.I don't care if you want the best hotel there. You just need a decent room with no stains on the sheets to lay your head on.If you meet someone believe me they will be happy with the quarters you have.\n\nGambling,free drinks 24\/7  and a decent bed.How can you go wrong.\n\nVegas=lack of sleep.\n\nGotta luv it.
