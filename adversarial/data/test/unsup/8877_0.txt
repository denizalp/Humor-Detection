This place always makes consistently good food. All the dishes are pretty simple (same sauces, different combination of ingredients), but they are all tasty.\n\nMy favourites are the pork bone soup, tofu soup, spicy squid, and the beef bulgogi. Again, not much variation in the menu but always consistent. Their Finch location is probably the best.
