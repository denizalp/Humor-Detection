This is a hectic airport especially Southwest's section. But when you get the amount of people they get coming into and leaving Las Vegas that's to be expected. \n\nI love my global entry pass because I always get TSA Pre-check. I also love the kiosks where there's no line and you can print your boarding pass. If you get to the airport in good time and are not silly and arrive too late this airport is excellent. \n\nIt has great shopping and lots of slot machines to entertain you while waiting for your flight.
