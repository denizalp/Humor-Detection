We rented a truck for the day for a project that we needed to do a large pick up for. We reserved online and then went to pick it up. Staff was very friendly and very helpful. Would definitely recommend this place. Truck came with a moving pads and a hand truck. Was close to home so overall is was very convenient. If I need a truck, I would use them again for sure. \n\nBonus: their sign is hilarious if you drive in from the south side on Maryland.
