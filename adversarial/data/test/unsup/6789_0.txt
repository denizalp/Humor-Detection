We came here after a hike on a warm day. They have more than just smoothies here, but today we just got smoothies. I got a 12 ounce with strawberry, pineapple, orange juice and lime. It hit the spot. The smoothie was cold and refreshing. Next time I'll get the lo-cal smoothie made with Splenda. We sat inside which was annoying due to the noisy smoothie machine running every 30 seconds. We will be back after another hike and maybe try one of their sandwiches.
