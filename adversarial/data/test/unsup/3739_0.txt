Stopped to grab a Value Size Fries in the limited time I had and glad I did.\n I was the only one there and about the time I started to wonder what took so long she called me up. Not a boy did they make them fresh, hot and crispy with salt melting, she upgraded me to a small for free!\nSaid thank you for waiting and I looked like I needed to smile.\n I did, I am again now just thinking about it!
