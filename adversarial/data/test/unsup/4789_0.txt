My love for Bobby Flay is validated. Great food, great service. I had a margarita. It was one of the best I have ever had. I also had the Mesa burger and the caramel chocolate pudding. I didn't want to eat the entire burger but I couldn't stop myself. I would have licked the bowl with pudding, but I don't really believe what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. I wish I had more time here and a bigger capacity for food.
