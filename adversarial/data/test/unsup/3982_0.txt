Didn't see the main guys because they weren't filming but the staff were extraordinarily kind and helpful here. Line was about a half hour wait but once inside, was great to browse around. I bought 3 silver rings at great prices (15-25 bucks) and a souvenir shirt for my bro... 30 bucks. Eeee. Still. Worth and value type of deal. But yea, was none of that. Haaaaa..!!\n\nDone. Off my list now.
