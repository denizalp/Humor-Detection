Service is slow AF on a Monday ... And my straws never came lolzzz.  However the food is good chicken pot pie bomb the crust is puff pastry with a creamy pot pie filling and the pasta sundried tomatoes and mushrooms will not disappoint.  If you like mixed drinks the margarita and calypso mojito tall drinks are good as well.  Just don't come on a Monday -_-
