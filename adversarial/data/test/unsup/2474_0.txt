This could be some premium all you can eat sushi... but def not worth the price. I ordered the momo plate, tart, and the crispy Hokkaido roll. TBH I think sushi bong sushi rolls are better than this. I would rather go to jabistro (pay 10% more to eat something that's worth the price). I don't recommend this place at all. ALSO, they need better staff. They dropped the plates like 3 times in an hour...it was a very unpleasant experience.
