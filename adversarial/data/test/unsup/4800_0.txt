I enjoyed my dinner here on my last visit. We were a party of 3 & got up sample a few dishes. The portion of each dish was very generous. The sushi was fresh & tasted wonderful. They showed creativity with plating. The service was fast & friendly. I love the edamame for starters as well. \n\nDefinitely will go back whenever I'm in town.
