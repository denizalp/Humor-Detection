Ever wonder where everyone gets those ridiculously large drink souvenirs? Look no further, get them here! \n\nI managed to get a daquiri in the shape of a football but was there any alcohol in it? I mean i finished the whole football and no buzz? It was more of a fruity drink that just tastes good. Overpriced drink NOT to get f'ed up!
