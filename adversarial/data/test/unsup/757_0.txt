My daughter, my son in law and myself all wanted to get tattoos during the holidays. We contacted one of the \"big\" name shops on the strip and got nothing but the run around. We are big fans of Noelin so we contacted Bssilics. Vic got right back to me and made several suggestions.\nYesterday 5 of us went to the shop to get tee shirts. Everyone was great. My daughter actually got a small piece from Dwight. He was great. I will definitely be back!!!
