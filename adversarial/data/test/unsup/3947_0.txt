Wow, not sure what the deal is here.  It's effin weird!  The vibe, the people, the combination of items being sold...add it all up and you got a strange ass place.  A Hawaiian vibe is NOT being projected here at all.  \n\nWe actually came here to go to an Indian food restaurant inside (never ended up going there).  The inside of the building was dead...lots of empty stores and odd outdated Hawaiian decorations around.  We ended up leaving since it was so trashy and creepy.  \n\nThe only pleasant thing was the mist fans outside.
