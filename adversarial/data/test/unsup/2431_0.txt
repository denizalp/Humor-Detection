This used to be my favorite chain restaurant. Unfortunately, they got rid of the Parpadelle pasta and the spicy shrimp pesto pizza. Still trying to find a dish to compare to those from the older menu! (Please bring them back!) \nI tried the swordfish tacos- they were pretty good with all the flavors but an extremely small portion as you only get two.
