I got a gel manicure\/pedicure here. The pedicure was perfect. But after less than a week the perfect pink manicure I received bubbled and fell off. This place would be a five star for me, but the gel just didn't last as long as it was suppose to... Otherwise this would've been the place I would keep going to for my nails!
