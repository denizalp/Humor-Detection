Food is very good however the prices and service are horrible. $20 for some noodles and potstickers for one person. The employees constantly frown and are extremely uncommunicative. You place your order at a counter so there are not any waitresses. The decor is minimal. The food is simple so why the inflated prices? They need to post the prices on the menu board. I swear they make up the prices as they go. Nothing is itemized on the receipt. I felt ripped off.
