Really like this place to meet friends for dinner or to grab a quick drink. The atmosphere is super laid back and the bar is so swanky. The food is yummy. The bar tenders are chatty (but not too chatty) and super nice. Also, the wine and beer selection are quite good, especially for a bar on Butler Street. I'll definitely return!
