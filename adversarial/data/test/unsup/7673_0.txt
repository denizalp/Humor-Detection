This baseball stadium has a few similarities as the Wrigley field in Chicago, but not so much of it only few... This park is fairly new, and the smartest thing they done is built a shade on top of the bleacher, so during afternoon games it.won't too be unbearable to stayout under the sun. They have a big bar to order for fancier alcoholic drinks other than beer. lots and lots of vendor walking around for sellings drinks so won't have get up to get your drinks. lots of variety of food and drinks.
