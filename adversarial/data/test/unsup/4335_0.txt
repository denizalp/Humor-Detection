Nice Italian restaurant located at the Kierland Common, I frequent here for business lunch. \n\nService here is always good, all the servers I encountered is really professional and efficient. \n\nFood here is always good, never had any bad meals. I tried most everything on the menu and all are equally good. \n\nThey have good desert menu and I like their tiramisu here.\n\nThis review I wrote here is so generic, it's not really helpful but one thing I can say is I can always count on their consistent service and food. So reliable that I frequent here for business lunch.
