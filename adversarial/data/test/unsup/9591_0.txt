I've eaten here a few times and this is my favorite Greek restaurant that I've found since I moved to Arizona two years ago.  The food is delicious, the portions are huge, and the staff is great. We came in last night with a large party and they were very accommodating and happy to have us.  The gyro platter is my go to every time.  But one of these days I'll try to the flaming cheese!
