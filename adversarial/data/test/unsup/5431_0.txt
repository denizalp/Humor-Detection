This club was tired! Tired remixes of mediocre songs from irrelevant artists.Tired go-go's who weren't so much dancing as they were just running in place. Tired trannies, fag hags and ghetto blatino boys (not the good kind) all made me want a refund on the $20 bones (each) my bestie and I shelled out to get in. That's $1 for every minute we spent in this awful place before we just couldn't bear it any longer. Don't bother.
