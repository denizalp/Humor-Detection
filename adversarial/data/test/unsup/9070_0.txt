Came here for breakfast & service was amazing! The scorpions in the tank at the front of the restaurant are SO COOL. \n\nChips & salsa was pretty great. I love the option of mild & hot. Our waters were refilled every two minutes. I got a breakfast burrito with bacon on the side. It wasn't the best, but it was pretty damn good after a night of drinking. Huge portion of bacon on the side (5-6 pieces). \n\n4 stars. I recommend & will be back for dinner.
