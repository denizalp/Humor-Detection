Left a few messages for management to \"discuss my visit.\" Have yet to hear back from them. Still holding onto the receipt w\/ the bartender's name and transaction # in case someone ever calls. I wonder if they're just too busy fielding calls about said bartender or they really just don't give a crap.  \n\nMaybe I should just make a public service announcement and put the shady a** bartender's name on here!?!
