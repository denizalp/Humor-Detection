Insanely delicious food !\nSeekh kebabs were Delish . Lamb seekh was spicy with lots of green chilli and chicken was kind of mild but still both of them unique in their own ways .\nLamb & ckn kebabs were kinda pricey @ $4 and $3 each .\nChicken samosa with minced chicken was great but insanely oily . \nKadhai chicken was extremely tasty with chicken cooked to perfection in wonderful spices but it was greasy too .\nOverall delicious food & great service so I would totally go back .
