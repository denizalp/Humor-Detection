VERY imitated, NEVER Duplicated, Red Mango is the only real-deal Holyfield\nFro-yo place in Vegas. Totally good for you, and better for the kids...Yogurtland? How bout Yo-MAMA! U-Swirl? are U-SERIOUS????\n\nWe needed to beat the Vegas heat, we stopped by this location..\n\nGot the Vanilla with Strawberry and Mango Popping Boba....Yes, Popping Boba finally exists here in Vegas, but not at any Boba Tea joints(at least not yet) but is available at Red Mango(Boulevard Mall) and at other Wannabe fro-yo shops in town...ALOHA!!!
