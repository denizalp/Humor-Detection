This place has it all!\n\nWith places like The Cheesecake Factory, California Pizza Kitchen, The Melting Pot, Nordstrom Rack, Crate & Barrel, Dick's, Giant Eagle Market District and The Capital Grille and L.L. Bean coming in early 2016 just to name a few, there's something here for everyone and every price range.\n\nLegacy Village is a perfect companion to the upscale Beachwood Place.\n\nParking can be a real pain at times though as unless it is a nice day and you just walk from store to store you with be on a constant hunt for a new parking space.
