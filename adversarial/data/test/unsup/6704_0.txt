Just spent over $1100.00 and out order was inaccurate - twice !   Plus they ran out of the special on Friday night.  \n\nThe manager tried to comp us dessert only  to make it right.   \n\nRight?  \n\nWrong!\n\nGood service should accompany good food (which it was).  Alex and Maria did what they could.    Mistakes happen - that's a given.  What you do to make it right is what counts.
