Fidelity was assigned to me by my home warranty company when my dishwasher broke.  I originally scheduled the appointment for 9-12 on a Wednesday morning but at 8 that morning I called and asked if I could change the show up time to 10 which they accommidated no problem.  My service tech Spass, a nickname he told me, showed up around 10 and quickly diagnosed and fixed the problem and had me run a load of towels to make sure it was working correctly.
