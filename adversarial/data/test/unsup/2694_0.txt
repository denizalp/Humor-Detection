I don't know where to start.. This restaurant was the bomb dot com!! I loved all of their dishes! I even ordered some to take with me to Chicago! The place was nice except the big window was a little bit of a problem. The flies were coming inside. \nThe owner's son was so adorable. He came to us and started interacting. He gave us kisses on our cheeks before we left. We came here twice and third time was for to go. Will definitely come back if I visit during winter break. Already missing this place.
