Honestly, this is some of the best mexican food in town!\n\nIt's connected to a gay bar Charlies and homo's are not going to eat half rate food...so needless to say it's amazing. Gay, Bi, Straight, Tranny....it doesn't matter, everyone is welcome!\n\nSuggestions: Chicken or Steak Quesadilla, Nachos, Bean Burro\n\nGo....go now!
