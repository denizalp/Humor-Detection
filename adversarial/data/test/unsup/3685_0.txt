This place and Kim Po, outside Times Square, would compete for the best pho place in Richmond Hill.\n\nThis place I like due to the more diverse options available, especially the different soup bases they have. Ask for the tomato soup base on your pho, and you shall not be disappointed. This place also wins in terms of service; more friendlier than Kim Po.\n\nHowever, the noodles is where this place loses. There's not enough water content in the noodles I find, so it feels thicker and drier. So Kim Po beats it for that.
