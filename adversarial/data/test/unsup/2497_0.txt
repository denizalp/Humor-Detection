This show was one of the funniest shows I have seen in a long time. Not only was the cast great, but they can actually sing. (I'm not sure why that surprised me.) It was a great time had by all in the audience. I recommend paying extra to sit in the splatter zone., well worth the money and SO MUCH fun. You will laugh out loud.
