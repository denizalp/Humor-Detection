Excellent option for those willing to do the skimming and brushing yourself which isn't bad. Once a week to do those things is not enough because you will get debris everyday. As for the chemicals they are great at testing and treating if you have issues but won't do anything unless needed. Best economical solution for people with pools. They also don't have a problem answering questions for those who want to learn about maintaining their pools on their own.
