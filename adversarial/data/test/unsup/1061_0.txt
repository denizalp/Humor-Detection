Go elsewhere.  These guys will smile at you as you leave knowing that they'll be sending you a bill months later for totally unneccesary and overpriced lab work.  I went there to have a tiny, harmless mole removed for aesthetic purposes and they tried to come at me months later for $150 in lab work to tell me it was a tiny harmless mole.  No sh*t?  How about giving the customer a head's up you plan to pick their pocket?  Would've turned right around if I'd known they were going to screw me.
