I really like this PT's. The layout is definitely one of the better ones. Large square bar. Elevated pool table area. Some tables and booths. Not too dark. Very clean and well-kept. And Molly, one of the bartenders, is super nice, friendly, and attentive. Otherwise, it's a PT's. There's on across the street and one up the street. And then a few more down the next street. But the vibe is particularly nice at this one and Molly was a standout bartender.
