We arrived around 5 for an early dinner before a movie.  There were two other families dining.  We ordered and waited 30 minutes for our pizza that arrived at room temperature.  We had heard great things about this place from friends. The crust and their marinara are very good, but were so disappointed with the \"not hot\" pizza.  A pizza is not a food you can send back to reheat and we could have asked for a new hot one, but were not going to wait another 30 minutes.
