Our new favorite because of Taco Tuesday! Yummy amazing Delish Fish, Chicken, pork belly Tacos! \nDrinks we great! Only issues was mine came with a long strand of hair from the bartender! but the were quick to make good with a fresh one. They even went as far as to not charge us for my drink! Well done and excellent fix! Definitely coming back!!!
