Labels carries discount fashion clothings for both men and women at a affordable prices....\n\nHow affordable is affordable?! They have tops for $1.99... dresses for $10... cheaper than my lunch specials...\n\nYou always get what you paid for... when it is cheap.. the material, cutting, workmanship are all cheap......\n\nLabels feels more like a thrift store than a fashion store.\n\nThis location used to be Zellers so it is huge.... at least you won't feel overwhelmed.
