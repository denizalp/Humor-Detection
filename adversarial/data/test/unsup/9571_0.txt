This mall is close to my home and has a wide variety of stores.  From Sears to Nordstroms to Dillards, Sephora, Aveda, and the new Disney Store it's the place I can find almost everything I need and then some.  And it's not full of snooty Scottsdale folk like Scottsdale Fashion Square.  I would love to see a LUSH store in here too. When the temps are above 100 you can find lots of people window shopping.  There are plenty of options for dining too as well as Harkins Theaters for movie going.  This is my mall!
