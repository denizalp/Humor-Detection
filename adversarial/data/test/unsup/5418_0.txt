Typical Dollar Store. Very large selection of cards, balloons, party stuff.\n I love the randomness of the selection. I was able to walk through the entire store without a single word from any employee.  :\/\n We found two things, but decided to wait and go to one that has friendlier people.\n It is very well organized, no spillover or messy floors from people just dropping things.
