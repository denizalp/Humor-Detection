Penske's truck rental experience was much better than what I've had with UHaul. Next time I need a truck to move I'll be heading back to Penske.\n\n1. Clean, basically brand new truck (26 footer)\n2. Competitive price\n3. Penske lets you have the truck for 4 full days\n4. Pick up and drop off took less than 10 minutes each\n\nRental location was pretty shabby on the inside but it's not important to me.
