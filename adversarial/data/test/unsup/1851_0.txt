Manager Chris is lazy. I didn't get something from my order, called back when I got home 5 minutes later, and he said he could not do anything because we did not have a receipt. He could have looked the order up. They just lost a customer for something that would have cost the company nothing because my chicken nuggets were probably sitting in the food to go out tray.
