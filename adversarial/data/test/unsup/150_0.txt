We found this place on Yelp and it's definitely worth the try. The staff is extremely nice, the food is amazing and their especial desert is phenomenal.  I've had Peruvian food in the past and got my wife to try it for the first time. She loved it! We r definitely coming back! This place is a diamond on a hay stack!!
