One of my favorite places to get a dog, they are quick and not to bad in price.\n\nTheir truck is actually a small trailer and they have have bottled soda in a bucket of ice.\n\nMy favorite that I order all the time is the \nBratwurst Moki. The Bratwurst is placed on a pita flat bread and topped off with the Moki concoction that includes roasted green chilis, saut√©ed onions, tomatoes, pinto beans and cheese. The combination is perfect and a treat to eat.\n\nNo frills and a good amount of food.\n\nWill come back again and again.
