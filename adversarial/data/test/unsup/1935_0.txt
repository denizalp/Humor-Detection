Nothing short of amazing.  Chef Bruno visited our table and helped us customize our dinner experience just to our taste.  The bison steak was so tender you could cut it with a fork.  The seabass was perfect and the roasted veggies were so flavorful and comforting. Everything from the fresh ingredients to the well thought out pairings were amazing.  I could not have asked for a better date night with my hubby.
