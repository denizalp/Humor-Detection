Parking is a nightmare. Lines to order and\/or pickup may be long. Tables may all be full. It is cash only. And, it's all absolutely worth it. The sturdy crust and gooey cheese help put this place in my top 3 pizza places. The pepperoni sends the pizza into another dimension, and their hoagies are pretty fantastic too (I ask for extra Italian dressing). If you want gourmet and a chic, modern appeal, this isn't for you. It's for those who want their tastebuds blown and to be left intoxicated by this pizza.
