I ordered my 2014 Ford Explorer Sport from Ford Lincoln Gabriel. Great costumer service! They kept me updated with emails (copies of shipping documents and photos of the car) from when the car left the factory, to the time it arrived at the train station and finally arrived at the dealer. They even helped me get my license plate, since I'm not a citizen and needed a dossier no.
