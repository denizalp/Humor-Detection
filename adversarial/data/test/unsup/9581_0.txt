This place... Really bad... Really bad... Sashimi tasted so fishy and sickening. I think they tried to cover it by putting tons of wasabi! Crazy. I paid 45$ for garbage sushi and sashimi. The rice wasn't even done properly. \n\nSeriously, with all the sushi place in Toronto, you can't survive if you serve this kind of shot quality. Plus, they don't even have a liquor license! Lol \n\nJust don't go here. Don't waste your money or your time. They truly messed up my palate. I had to go other truly good sushi restaurant to restore my taste.
