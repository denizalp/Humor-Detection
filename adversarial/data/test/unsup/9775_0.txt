Absolutely delicious and authentic.\nFree refills on cabbage, white rice and miso soup.\nI always get a lot of cabbage refills to make myself feel less guilty because Tonkatsu is super high in calories. Try their ume dressing for your cabbage. It's my favorite because it's light. \nSometimes they have Inaniwa udon and it's delicious, too.\nLast time I ordered tako sunomono, tako tested old and too much vinegar. So minus 1 star.
