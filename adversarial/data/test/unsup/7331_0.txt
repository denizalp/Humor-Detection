The lady who works there is very rude. i asked for price on couple of the items there but she was too busy chatting with her friend. I paid for couple of things and as i was leaving i said \"thank you\" but she was already back to talking to her friend and got completely ignored. I will be going to the sambok market in the strip district from now on.
