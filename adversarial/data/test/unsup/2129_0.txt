Decent place to get your haircut.  Avoid the MVP scam as no dude I know is going to pay extra for some girl to use a weird \"massager\" on his neck.  The middle package comes with the hot towel face thing which is also very weird while the lady shampoos your hair.\n\nI am not sure what happened to the good old fashioned barber shops around here, but I will find one eventually.  This place does play sports which is nice, but let's face it there usually isn't much on while we are out getting our hair cut.
