We were so excited to find Grecia and Luna Day Care!  She is so warm and caring with our son (16 months).  She feeds the kiddos wholesome meals, and has an outstanding set up in her home for learning and playing for the children.  We've had a few instances where my son has had a tummy ache or acted more tired than usual, and she is always very quick to communicate these things with us.  She is also very flexible with my family's changing schedule needs.\n\nI wish I could give her 6 stars. :)
