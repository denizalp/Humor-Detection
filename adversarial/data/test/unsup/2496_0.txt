This is the kind of shop mechanics bring their car to.  I like the no B.S. feel, the guy at the counter may have just come from installing an exhaust system. This is the fourth time I have used them.  On one of the occasions I had to bring it back and they were happy to stand behind their work.  \n\nWhat it is:\n- Good craftsmanship\n- Honest estimates\n- Good prices\n- Fast service\n\nWhat it is not:\n- Pretty retail space\n- Easy to find\n- Fancy
