My food was fine.  I came here once and felt sketched out by the dark, looming location.  The parking lot is no well lit, and it's just scary.\n\nThe staff was ok, didn't seem to care much about anything, oh well...it's Pizza Hut.  \n\nThe store is sort of dirty and I just really wanted to get out ASAP. \n\nProbably will never try this location again.
