Michael and his team did my bridal shoot and my wedding and I they were amazing each time!! Very responsive and communicative. Easy to work with. A GREAT photographer. And a fun team that gets the job done! I wish I could do my wedding day all over again but I can't wait to see all the photos!!! \nI highly recommended hiring Michael and his team. They are passionate and creative on top of professional and fun!
