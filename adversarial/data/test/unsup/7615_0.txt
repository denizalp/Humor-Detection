Wow, so professional and fast!! Waited 10 minutes and was out in 30 minutes. Frances Breed was amazing and knew what was wrong and gave me exactly what I needed. She was understanding of stomach issues and was able to inject. Also left with all relevant info (4pages)about visit and helpful information including today's treatment. Other unnamed doctor was pumping me full of strong antibiotics. Being new to Arizona I so appreciated short wait and her expertise. Highly recommend them.
