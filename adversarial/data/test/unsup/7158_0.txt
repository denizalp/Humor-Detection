Okay. I gave them one more shot and they definitely redeemed themselves. \n\nDelicious food as always, and delivered ON TIME. Woohoo! That's all I am asking for, folks. And they got it right this time. \n\nI will continue to order from them. As long as they keep up their end of the bargain, I am a happy customer once again.
