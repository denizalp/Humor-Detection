The cleanliness here left much to be desired.  I watched the guy answering phones at the front desk dig for gold up his nose with a bare finger and then walk right back to his manicure station without washing his hands.\nThe tools that should be one-use, throw-away items (files, etc), are reused between customers (in NY, where I'm from, this is against the law).\nThe service itself was not bad--the man who did my pedicure was very nice, though I felt a little rushed.  \nI just can't give this place a nice review, I was so unimpressed.  :(
