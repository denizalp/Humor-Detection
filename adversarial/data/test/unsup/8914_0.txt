Love love Leslie Nail Spa! Leslie, Johnny and Chris are all ROCKSTARS!! This is my second time there in a week time. From Gel Pedi\/Mani to a waxing, everything was great. I've lived in this neighborhood 5 years and finally found a spot I will continue to go back to, knowing they are Friendly and everyone does a great job. \n\nThank you Leslie for opening this great Nail Spa where guests can have a relaxing and enjoyable experience!
