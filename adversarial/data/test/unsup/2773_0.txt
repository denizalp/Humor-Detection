Step inside and you feel as though you're in a little corner shop in Greece. \n\nThis place has got a great selection of middle eastern groceries (dry goods) as well as fresh made naan, pita, hummus, tabbouleh, and baked goods. \n\nI cannot stress enough how wonderful this place is for a quick lunch though. Sandwiches, wraps, stuffed pita, grape leaves are all available to eat in house. Made daily, it's the definition of fresh! \n\nMy favorites were the vegetarian grape leaves and the pistachio baklava. \n\nYou will not be disappointed, my friends!
