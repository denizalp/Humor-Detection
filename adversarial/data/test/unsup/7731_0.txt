We have been to Morning Squeeze several times. It has never disappointed. The food is always good, the service friendly and lively, and the place has a colorful uniqueness of its own.\n\nOf the many places we have eaten in Old Town Scottsdale, this is one we keep going back to. Everything I have had there has been really good, but one of my very top favorites is their Scottsdale's Finest Hash. It's different. It's delicious. It may well be the finest, a fair claim on their part.\n\nYes, we're fans!
