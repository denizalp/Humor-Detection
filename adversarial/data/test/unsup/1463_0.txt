I just called the Rolfs Salon at Gainey Village, what happened to Delores Leiva? Something sounds weird, called to make an appointment, got transferred to Connie who said Rolf is taking over all of Delores clients for the next year. Delores was nothing but professional and always spoke very highly about the salon, she wouldn't have left.  Bad business decision Rolfs, you have lost a client and I'm certain i will not be the only one.
