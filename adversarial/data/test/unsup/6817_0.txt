We felt like cattle being herded and stalked out of the store with plenty of time left for looking. Apparently they close 15 minutes before they say they do..and we're completely rude and unapologetic . If I were the owner I would teach my staff about customer service. We will never go back to experience the unwelcoming and uncomfortable atmosphere.
