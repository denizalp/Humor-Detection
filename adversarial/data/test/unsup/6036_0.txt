Poor business practices at Encore! Beware, they will charge your card without obtaining authorization from you. You CANNOT charge a persons card without consent from that individual, no matter what the situation is. There is nothing listed in the paperwork that says you operate this way. I was accused of just not wanting to pay-how about I just didn't want to pay with THAT card? Money is not an issue. If I had the time I would take them to court just to prove my point.
