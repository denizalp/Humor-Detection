Ok, yes I came here cus of the TV show....but\nI watch nearly everyday, big fan. Great show.\n\nSo maybe you don't get to see the actual Pawn Stars, but who care the shop is freakin awesome! Lot's of cool shit, expensive shit, and of course souvenirs. Line wasn't too long either. + they had misters outside.\n\nGo if you're a fan!! (or if not)
