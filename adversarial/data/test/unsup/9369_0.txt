We just moved to the area and found our dryer vents were completely clogged with old lint. I called The Duct Man based on his other Yelp reviews and he did not disappoint!  He was at our house within hours, literally, and fully cleaned our dryer vent. He was personable and professional. While I hope I don't need another cleaning for a very long time, I would 100% call him again and recommend him to others.
