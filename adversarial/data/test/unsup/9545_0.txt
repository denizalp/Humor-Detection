I went here with my family based on a word-of-mouth recommendation. I got the feeling that things were a little bit \"off\" that night- the waitress was new, business was slow, etc. The portions were generous, the food was fine, and the prices were fair, but I felt a bit underwhelmed in the end. I'd be willing to give it another chance or two- maybe experiment more with the menu. (For what it's worth, I got a linguine and marinara with sausage for my meal.)
