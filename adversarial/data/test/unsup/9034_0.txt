I love Pita Jungle. Everything I've ever ordered at Pita Jungle has been delicious. This particular Pita Jungle has a really nice modern interior. They have great happy hour specials too. Order a few small side dishes and get a glass of wine. \n\nEven my 4 year old likes the food here and she's one of the pickiest eaters ever.
