Diner category 4 star joint.  Tucked off the beaten path unless your path happens to be a flight plan.  This place is busy on weekend mornings.\n\nI've been a couple times for breakfast.  Good basics:  eggs, omelets, toast, potatoes, etc.  They are capable of cooking to order which is better than many places these days.  If you ask for your eggs scrambled lightly that is what you get.  \n\nThe atmosphere is diner meets aviation.  To get to the entrance you have to enter the hangar area close to the runways.  Fun!
