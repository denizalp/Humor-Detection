I went there on a Friday night. The floors were greasy and dirty, not only in the kitchen but the dinning area as well. \nThe customer service wasn't that great. The same guy making my food was taking my money?? \nThe quality of the food was great. However, I ordered a Calzone with pepperoni and mushrooms. When I got home I discovered a Calzone with some other ingredients in it! They gave me someone else's food. \nIt's not in my plans to go back any time soon, but who knows!
