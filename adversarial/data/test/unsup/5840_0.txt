I've had pretty much everything on their menu and it is all very good. I regularly get the pulled pork and the beef brisket.\nTry the beef brisket with the house bbq sauce and the pulled pork with the onion jam.\nThe fries are perhaps what they do best, they remind me the old school chip truck fries which are hard to find nowadays.\nService is always polite and very quick.
