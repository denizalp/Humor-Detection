I gave this company 3 chances to prove themselves. First visit they did a good job. After that it was absolutely pointless and a waste of money. I called to cancel service 24 hours before the next due service and they went ahead and still charged my credit card. For a 4 hour service it cost $225! I expected a lot more.
