We usually stop in every 2 weeks due to grocery shopping. My family have been coming here for like 4 years! Their bread and bubble tea are HEAVEN! I have never tried their desserts, but they look adorable and similar to New York's cafe! Their service is friendly as well. Definitely recommend this place!
