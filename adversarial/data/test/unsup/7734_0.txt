I got the normal gyro and the girlfriend got mildly adventurous with the buffalo chicken gyro.\n\nMine was STUFFED with meat to the point where there was hardly anything else on it, which was good enough for me, though I can imagine some people might want more tzatziki\/onions and such. \n\nHers was \"meh,\" the one thing she said about it was \"Well, it's not really a gyro.\"\n\nFairly cozy and diner-esque on the inside
