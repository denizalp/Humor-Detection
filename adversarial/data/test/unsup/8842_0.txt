I know ... I know... \n\nI really like this place for what I use it for. \n\nI do not go to dance, find a mating partner or to have a guys night out. I go to drink $2 captains until 9pm. Listen to some great karaoke and some bad karaoke. I can spend $20 bucks and be very drunk. As opposed to the foo foo places $20 get you in the door. \n\nThe bartender Katie on the karaoke side makes sure you are taking car of. Thanks Katie..
