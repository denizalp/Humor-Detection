Went with great expectations, left with great disappointment. Started with a margarita that should have been a warning of what was to come. My complaint to the waiter informed me they used Lemix. The signature drink for a Mexican restaurant tasted like a can of cheap soda. My wild boar was poorly seasoned, the 16 spiced chicken overcooked to dry and stringy, the braised beef brisket barely acceptable, but the pork belly and spinach was very good even though the pork belly was chewy. The kitchen needs some talent. We won't be back.
