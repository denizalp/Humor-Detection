Nice place for a pedicure. The staff is mostly friendly. The first time I went here I got a hot rock pedicure, but the last time not so much. I'm not sure if there is a price difference, as I didn't even think to ask about it. \nThey also have a kids pedicure chair. It's pretty cute. Always nice to see a little girl getting her nails done. \n\nIf you are in the area, I'd recommend this place for sure.
