I really just didn't like it that much. The Pad Thai was like Sweet and Sour instead of Peanut Sauce, and the curry was waaay salty. On the bright side, the Mouchi was really good, and you should definitely get it. This isn't the best town for Asian food, but you can do better. I'd recommend Vientiane (or something similar to that). The service was quick (almost too quick) and the staff very friendly.
