Incredible! We were recommended to try this place from a few friends and we were not disappointed! The owner and staff were super friendly. They allowed us to try practically every flavor before deciding on what to order. I am tempted to say it is the best ice cream I have ever had! If you are in the area, you HAVE to stop by and get some Novel Ice Cream!!
