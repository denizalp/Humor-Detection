One of the worst Harvey's I  have ever visited.  This store has serious issues starting from the management all the way down.  The person taking my order walks over to take a drive through order in the middle of taking my order. Then they get the order incorrect, but argues with me that I told them incorrectly.  This happened not once, but twice.  In both cases the place wasn't busy.  Shame on me to give this particular store a second chance.
