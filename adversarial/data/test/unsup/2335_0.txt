So. Good. We ordered the NY strip, tempura green beans, and oxtail risotto and it was all amazing and cooked perfectly. The hosts were super accommodating and made great recommendations. Would definitely recommend sitting at the bar for dinner to watch the chefs while you eat. Also, doughnut bread pudding.
