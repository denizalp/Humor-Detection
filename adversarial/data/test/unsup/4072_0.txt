Stayed in nearby hotel for a week, walked here twice to get takeout. Food was great both times, extra bread and dipping oil both times without asking, offered a soda while we waited both times as well. Consistent, friendly and fast for take out. One less star because first time they told us pick up later than necessary so food was a big cold and had to be heated. Generous portions, both times the leftovers made a full next day lunch.
