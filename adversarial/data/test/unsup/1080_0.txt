Not the most amazing way to spend a hour, but the men wanted to take a look.  Parking is atrocious, so bring your patience.\n\nStand in line outside, wait until some people leave, then go into a small-medium-sized store full of stuff.  Mostly jewelry (rings and such), with guitars and other crap in the back.\n\nOverpriced show merchandise in the back too.
