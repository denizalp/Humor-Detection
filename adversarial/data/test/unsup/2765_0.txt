Last time I was in, I enjoyed my meal.  I really like a good green chili cheese burger.  I ordered a medium rare green chili cheese burger.  A well done burger was dilivered with no chili and no cheese.  The waiter tried to make it right. My conclusion is the foid is highly variable.  I tip well.  When it was all said and done it was 42 dollors for two cheese burgers and two beers.  I did not enjoy my meal.
