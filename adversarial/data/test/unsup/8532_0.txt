I hope they'd have enough seating for those waiting for take-out. The waiting area was so cramped. We had to decide to sit down, eat and order our take home. \nThe order took more than 40 minutes to be served. A couple behind us cancelled their order and left. \nThey should do something address the wait time for dine-in and take-out. It can't just be all, take, take, take...! Think about ways to improve your customer service wait time. \nThe counter top was also littered with used glasses. It's in the same area where new orders are served.
