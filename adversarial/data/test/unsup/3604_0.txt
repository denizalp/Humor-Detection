After being recommended by a friend, I took my car to Mike at Airport Auto and he made me feel very at ease. I was really nervous, because I had a bad experience with a different shop a few years ago. But Mike really came through! My car looks brand new!!! He helped me with dealing with the insurance company and did everything he said he would. I had ZERO complaints. THEY DID A BEAUTIFUL JOB!!!!!!!!!!!!
