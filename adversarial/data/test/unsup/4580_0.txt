There was this really nice server there. I don't remember his name but he's like the most respectful and attentive server I have ever had at Denny's. It was awesome! I think this Denny's is better than most Denny's in terms of atmosphere since I think most Denny's are terrible. Food was ok. I had the grand slam but it was nothing special. I really don't know why people don't go to other pure breakfast places to eat breakfast food that's better tasting. But then again, good breakfast places usually close around 2pm. LOL,
