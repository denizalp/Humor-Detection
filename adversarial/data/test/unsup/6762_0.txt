decided to go to dinner for my 21st birthday. worst experience ever. we brought in a table of 14. spent over $300 and they wouldn't serve me one drink. obviously if you turn 21 on a saturday you can't go to the freaking dmv.  thanks for ruining my birthday red lbster with your stupid policy. every where else has at least a 10 day grace period to update your id. manager didn't offer any compensation for our  inconvenience. overall food and server was satisfactory.
