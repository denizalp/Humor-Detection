I have to hand it to Las Vegas for still trying to milk you dry before you leave by having slot machines in their airport. \n\nYay for free WiFi when you cannot read another useless magazine or not in the mood for a book. Otherwise, this is an ok place. A tad annoying and disorganized but whateves, there's still free wifi. I've seen worse in Indiana.
