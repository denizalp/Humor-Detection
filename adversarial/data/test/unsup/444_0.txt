This place was way too ridiculously crowded. You should avoid on weekends. It is really a great space- 5 stars for the concept but there is no place to park and it took 20 minutes on line to order food. I guess this is a weekday, go early, type of place. Maybe over the summer when places are dead but then it would be way too hot.
