My garage door had something against me - it would never open or close unless someone else was watching and could prove me crazy. Bill took a look and immediately fixed the problem by installing a new circuit board. He didn't have the part with him at the time but he came back and fixed it right away. Very knowledgeable. Very professional. Very reasonably priced. Definitely recommend!
