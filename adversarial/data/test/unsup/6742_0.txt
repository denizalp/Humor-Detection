WEAK&$$$.  If you don't want Alcohol then this place would be good. \n\nI got their \"Comfortably Numb\" which is their version of a Miami Vice, $18 for a 32oz full of SUGAR..I drank the entire cup hoping to get at least a little buzz, I think I just ended up closer to developing type II diabetes.  \n\nGO TO FAT TUESDAY, add $1 for an extra shot of 151 or 2 shots and get your happy on!
