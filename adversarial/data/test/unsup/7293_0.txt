I went there for the HCG diet. They did not provide the background, theory, or timeline. They gave a single sheet of paper for instructions and all the hormones up front (that runs the risk of them degrading as they age or becoming bacterially contaminated). They did not adequately address exercise, so I wound up gaining weight on the program and being chronically lightheaded.
