I've never been disappointed when I come to this location. I always get the same sandwich (#9) so I never venture out but it's always delicious. Exactly what I come in for. The employees have always been nice and move rather quickly so we don't have to wait long. They heated up my deli meat when I was pregnant with no problem and I appreciated that.
