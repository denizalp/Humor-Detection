I'll make it simple.... after receiving our meal, we requested our money back and walked out.  Tuna burger was FROZEN, and the burger was a sopping wet mess that left a giant puddle of water and grease on the tray. \n\nAlso, if you have to explain your ordering process at every step of the way, you're over thinking it. \n\nIf they can't figure it out, this place will not make it.
