I am glad we have another café other than Balzacs and the Americano at Furbo is excellent.  They have a nice selection of baked goods in the morning, and the cheddar chive scone is to die for!\n\nI love the atmosphere in the café and the ever changing artwork make it an interesting and sophisticated space.  Kevin, the owner, always greets me with a smile and knows my order inside and out.  \n\nOverall, Furbo has been an excellent addition the distillery, and it is definitely worth a visit.
