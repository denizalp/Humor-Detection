That have advertised on their window burgers for .49 after 3pm what u don't know is that it's after buying a reg priced meal. Besides false advertisement I've only done drivethru and every time I go I've waited over 20 minutes at the window for my food. I went this morning bc on yelp it says open at 8 am well the girl there said they aren't open til 9 so that was a waste. Other then this they have good food and I know some employees that work there are good ppl
