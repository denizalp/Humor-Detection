Fair prices, friendly service, & decent finds (sometimes).\n\nThis place is located NE of Camelback and 7th Avenue.\n\nI sometimes find something when I've stopped in, not so much recently.\n\nNo funky smells either. This place is clean and organized with just the right amount of merchandise to rummage through. Not much clothing. Mostly a lot of 80's furniture.\n\nThe proceeds go to Hospice of the Valley.
