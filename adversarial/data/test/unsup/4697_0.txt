The pizza here is great - I've had the babe Ruth with no onions and that was terrific. Tonight I had the Hawaiian which isn't on the menu but they have ham and pineapples.  I don't get all serious about the Canadian bacon like a few of my friends.... it was all excellent. I would check out their online specials first to see what works with your budget and appetite. Delivery can be over an hour at times so heads up for that too.
