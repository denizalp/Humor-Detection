I have been going to the SA since it opened.  First 8 months it was incredible...great prices..things moved so there was always something new...now things have changed and its a SHAME...SHAME ON YOU!!  The prices are seriously ridiculous now....purses ate 25 bucks...furniture over $800 for a sofa....geez you get these items FREE...isn't the purpose of this store to help folks who are struggling get a foot up with some decent furnishings????   Beyond disappointed and now embarrassed when friends have gone there and report back that it was TOO EXPENSIVE!!!!\n\nSeriously...sad...i hope your district mgmt looks into this
