It took over a decade...but SW vegas is now fielding enough competition that the standard of food has elevated greatly and this place is no exception.  Fresh high quality ingredients executed at a high level at a reasonable price with friendly service. The gyro and chicken kabobs are first rate as are the accompanying sides.  By far the best Greek on this side of town.
