WOW!!!\n\nHold on a second, I don't think I said that loud enough. \n\nWOW!!\n\nIf your in the area and in the mood for some incredible Italian pastries, or even a tasty espresso, this is THE place. I had four different pastries and they were all mouth watering good. And the espresso, really hit the spot. \nI can't recommend this place highly enough. I'm definitely coming back.
