Was treated to this complimentary lunch plate from Paina Cafe. Fried Saimin Mix Plate with Bulgogi and Kim Chee. \nFlavor was on point, meat extremely tender. \n\nFinished it off with some delicious sweet treats from Ono Sweetz. Really enjoyed this place. They do pok√® too, that's what I'm gonna go back for next to try
