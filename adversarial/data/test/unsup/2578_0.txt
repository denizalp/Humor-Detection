I think the little vegan place with the weird tv propaganda should at least get two stars for setting up shop across from McDonalds.\n\nThen allot one more star for the drinks, especially the rose lemonade. It has rose petals sprinkled on top!\n\nBut i can't justify even a half star for the  food. I guess it qualifies as being vegan, but I'm not sure if it qualifies as food.
