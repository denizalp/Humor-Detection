I'd heard about Leroy Fox and had been wanting to check it out.  Believe me when I tell you LEROY FOX DID NOT DISAPPOINT!  We of course had the fried chicken (1\/4 North).  It was amazing!  The flavor was great. Even in the usually bland breast meat, the brine they use gave it great taste.  The skin was crispy and was seasoned beautifully.  For a side, I tried the zucchini fries.  They were recommended and well worth it.  The rest of the menu looked good.  But I can't wait to go back for more fried chicken!\n\nOutstanding!
