It appears that while the Whitehall Location is remodeling and I've relocated to this Starbucks to hang out, they have upped their game from my previous review.\n\nWhitehall is still my favorite (and I look forward to seeing it after the remodel) but the staff here at this location are now much friendlier than my previous visits here. Also it appears that the speed has improved! My drink was made in a timely manner today!\n\nI don't know if there was a change in management or what, but I'm now quite a bit happier at this Starbucks location!
