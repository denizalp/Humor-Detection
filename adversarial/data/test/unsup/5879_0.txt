The Lin Garden UYE reviews by my fellow Yelpers Danielle, Sarah, Chris and Christine have hit the nail on the head here.  \n\nThe overwhelming bland MSG gravy packaged (with bright food colouring) was too much.  We sampled each dish and left most fully intact.\n\nThe best overall summary of this place is the pic of Sarah L attached...her face really captures the true Yelp review of Lin Garden.\n\nGo to Szechuan Gourmet instead (http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/szechuan-gourmet-restaurant-north-york).
