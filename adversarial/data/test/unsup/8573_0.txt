why did I go back here?? I have no idea, but I will not be back ...ever!\nOrdered the buffalo chicken bites and the chicken was so overcooked that it was hard as a rock..yuck!\n\nAnd also there was only one server..which was ok because they were not busy, however, she decided to go out to have a smoke and then returned to our table to see how we were doing and the smell made me sick..do not go smoke and then return to a table smelling like that..very gross.
