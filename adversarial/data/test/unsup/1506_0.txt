***This Barnes & Noble is a pretty big one and it is attached to the upscale shopping mall Eton: Chagrin Boulevard; in many ways, this Barnes & Noble is a lot like all the other Barnes & Noble locations out there, but you will find a huge life size chess set right outside this location's front door***\n\nYou can find free parking in Eton's parking lot; unfortunately, the parking lot (at least at the front of this mall) is not that big and it can be difficult finding an open space.
