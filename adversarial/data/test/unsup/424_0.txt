I lived in Sumerlin for a long time and never visited that location. Now I live in Henderson and this Windmill location is close. Been there twice. Loved it both times.\n\nThe first time we went with a custom pizza. White pizza with a few added elements. Also ordered a large salad to go. Second time was a thick crust meat pizza.\n\nWill become a regular for sure!
