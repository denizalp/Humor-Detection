Gen is absolutely my favorite KBBQ spot in Las Vegas! I love the atmosphere of the restaurant and the superb service I always experience. My waiter, Ozzy, gave wonderful meat suggestions and was always attentive to our needs. Sometimes there's a wait to get a table but I think it's definitely well worth the price. This place is definitely worth a try if you're considering KBBQ!
