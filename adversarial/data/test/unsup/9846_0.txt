We made a reservation to eat here for one of the nights of my sister's bachelorette party, and we are glad we did. The city view and sunset makes it totally worth it to drive out and eat dinner here. It was busy, but the service was still great. We got the bistro steak, short ribs, chicken, and salads. It was a wonderful experience thanks to the manager Kaitlyn for setting it up!
