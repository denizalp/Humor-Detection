I was very excited to try this place after all the hype... and there were definitely stand out dishes! The portions are small and meant for sharing, so avg 2 dishes pp is fair. I wasn't big on the labneh but I loved the barbari bread that accompanied it! (Which was extra tho). I wasn't a fan of the lamb ribs as it was kinda fatty. The crispy duck confit rice and NY striploin were delicious! (See pictures).
