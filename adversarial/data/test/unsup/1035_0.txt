What an awesome venue for an event!\n\nMy sister and I had tickets for the Mr Olympia event on September 16, 2017. \nI was thinking that traffic and parking was going to be a nightmare like most big events in Las Vegas...but I was wrong! No traffic and parking was so easy that I was shocked! Also, no line at the check in door, very nice employees, super clean, easy to move around and the air was nice and clear. Im impressed!\n\nWill definitely go back for future events, Five Stars for best venue all around. Good job Orleans!
