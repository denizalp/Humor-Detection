I'm definitely a fan. My favorite dish is the mac and cheese. I actually have a hard time ordering anything else. It is even better with the bread. But on occasion I'll order the pick two and get the Apple salad or the new wheat berry salad. Both are pretty good. \nI'm not a fan of their pastries. I'm not sure what the issue, but they usually taste bland to me.\n\nFree wifi is a plus. They also have a few tables with outlets for charging (laptops or phones) and a pretty good iced tea.
