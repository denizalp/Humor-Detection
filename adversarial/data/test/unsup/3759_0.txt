I had surgery here in February 2014. The facility was clean and spacious. The staff was magnificent in pre-op and post-op areas. I don't know anything about the surgery because I slept through the whole procedure. My recovery has been better than I ever expected, thanks to my surgeon and the staff at Seven Hills Surgery Center. If I ever need surgery again, I would not hesitate to return.
