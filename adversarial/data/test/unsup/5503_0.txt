As sport bars go, this one is quickly becoming one of my favorites.  There are plenty of televisions, a private room for parties, comfortable seating and one of the better bar menus in town.  Their happy hour $5.00 happy hour specials are a steal - try the calamari or the ahi, or sample their version of poutine.  The portions are large and worth every penny. A welcome addition to the Henderson area.
