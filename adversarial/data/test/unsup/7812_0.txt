Ordered:\n5 Bbq meat, $7.\nSiracha chicken wings (5), $7.\nLarge House Pho, $12.\nSpring rolls, $5.\nAvocado smoothie, $4.50\n\nI don't think that it is an authentic Pho restaurant.\nPho was bland and lacked substance:\nHas 1 tendon and 4 strips of meat.\n2 beef balls.\nThe 5 Bbq patties were ho-hum.\nThe spring rolls were crispy but tasted bland.\n\nThe avocado shake was ok.\n\nThe place was clean.\nThe service was alright.
