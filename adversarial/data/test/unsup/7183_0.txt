(I wish you could do half stars.)\n\nSandwich was good, and the hand cut fry's are delicious. But for $10 I only got 2 tenders, which seemed a little pricey. \n\nBoyfriend had a meatloaf sandwich, which was really good (not traditional meatloaf flavor, it had a small little kick to it) and some garlic mashed potatoes (which were very dry and tasted as though they came out of a instant bag).\n\nAll in all not bad, we will probably return.
