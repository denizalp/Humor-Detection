\"If the $5 featured pizza sub special starts in May, why is the sign posted on the door in April?\" That is the question I am asking after spending $12 on it.\n\n   The store is clean. That's good and all. But they should pay enough attention to the customer as wiping the counter.\n\n   What about the featured sub they will be promoting in May? Very sloppy. Two napkins are insufficient.\n\n  Lesson learned. I will pay closer attention to advertisement signs at businesses. Even at fast food places.
