I had higher expectations based on their reputation. The foods very rich, but falls short for their price point.\n\nThe service was sub-par. The general manager looks all of 25 (maybe). His inexperience shows in how the staff was trained, which I assume was not very well.\n\nThere are too many new restaurants in Pittsburgh to try this one again any time soon.
