27 Tattoo Studio is a place I would highly recommend. Very clean & great customer service. Jen Imler did my coverup and she did a amazing job, she is TRULY a artist. Jen listen and understood exactly what I wanted. As a Interior Designer I have a very picky eye, and I couldn't believe how talent Jen are, I'm so  happy I found her. \nI would recommend her to 100% There are good tattoo artist out there, but Jen has that extra talent of making it into perfection.
