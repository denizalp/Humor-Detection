With these being on almost every other corner in town you would think they are the same, you would be wrong. I order mostly the same items when at Roberto's and I can say this location makes them the best. I am a breakfast burrito fan and create my own version of their menu item. Some extra bacon, no potatoes, and just a little cheese, this item has me coming back quite frequently.
