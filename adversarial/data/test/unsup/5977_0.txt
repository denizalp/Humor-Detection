She is a great masseuse! I feel massage drunk after i leave her place LOL! Not a typical spa cheesey massage place, very cool hip place. I love her decor and the music- very relaxing and trendy in the same! My husband and I both go here and she gives fantastic massages and its great therapy as well- not just the touchy feely stuff.\nGo see her- DO IT! Very worth it! :)
