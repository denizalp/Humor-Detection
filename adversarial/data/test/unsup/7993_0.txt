We came here for dinner with friends and enjoyed a nice relaxing meal.  We started with some antipasto, the Buongustaio and the plate was plenty for the 5 of us.  Then we ordered our entrees,  We had the Cacciatore pizza with sausage, special pasta of the day, little pillows, salmon alla griglia (salmon with spinach), Zuppa Reale, a delish spicy Italian bouillabaisse with seafood and a tasty broth, and I ordered the Tagliolini ai fruitti di mare.  Tasty bread and bread chips were served before our dinner arrived.  My frutti di mare was flavorful and plentiful.
