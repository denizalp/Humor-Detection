Very nice night club. Music was great. Few different rooms with different DJs spinning. It's packed in there, but not to the point where you can't enjoy yourself. \n\nTheir margaritas are amazing. Drinks are strong, not watered down at all. I'm not sure about the drink pricing, because as a lady I definitely didn't pay for any of them, lol.\n\nGood club if you want to have a great night and dance. Good crowd.
