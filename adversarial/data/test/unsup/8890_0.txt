I guess the 4 employee's that work there thought my review was funny. I'm not surprised!!! The negative, rude, disrespectful behavior must be continuing and certainly indicates a lack of manners, education and  professionalism. When business owners laugh at their customers, do you know who really gets the last laugh?????????????
