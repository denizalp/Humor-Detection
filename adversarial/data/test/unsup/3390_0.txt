If I could give this company a zero star review, I would. They must be the most incompetent folks I have ever dealt with and I have had several homes in my life, they are awful. Fortunately I keep detailed records and notes, but that doesn't save my time and energy in having to deal with the incompetence. If you have a choice, steer clear of this company at all costs.
