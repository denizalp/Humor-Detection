I had to replace the ceramic soap holder in my shower. The guys at this location really helped me to know what I was doing and they were really friendly, particularly Cliff who went out of his way to make sure I had everything I needed and not more of it than I needed. It was even the end of his shift and he stayed to make sure I was ok.
