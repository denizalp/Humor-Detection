All I can say is, you get what you pay for!!  And believe me it is not much!!  And I am a hungry person....and sad to say, I was not satisfied.\n\nThe food items are basic and bland.  Nothing spectacular.  The usual grilled chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy, ham, fatty meats,...yeah!!!  See what I mean, and that is all I can remember because it's not great!!!\n\nIf you are staying at Sam's Town, do not, I repeat eat here!!  You will not be happy!!!
