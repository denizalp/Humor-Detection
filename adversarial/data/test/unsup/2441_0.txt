genna's is definitely one of the best bars in the immediate square area, in my opinion (especially now that the local tavern has morphed into some lame english pub). anyway, there's a good beer list and the bartenders know their stuff. i like that there are two floors and more seating options than just tables. they play great music (although they could turn it down a smidge) and the decor is perfect.\n\nto everyone who bitches that this place is too hipster- you belong at the dane with all the other boring people anyway.
