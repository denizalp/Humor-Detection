This place was on the radar for a bit as they sell Greg's ice cream so one need not venture out to the other outposts to get if you live in this area. \nMy friend did order it while there and went for an affagato for flavor that's named after this place. Ice Cream was good espresso was not (too bitter)\nI stuck to the Cappuccino so here is the verdict\nEspresso: Bitter\nCrema': Average\nMilk: Frothed OK\nLatte Art: average\n2.5 Stars all said and done.\nAlso of note is that the place is not quite clean.
