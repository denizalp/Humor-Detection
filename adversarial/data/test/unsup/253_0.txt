I don't know, there's something missing here. The sandwich is kind of on par with the rest, but I don't know, maybe their ingredients are too fresh - something's off. Maybe it's the lack of nudy pictures on the wall, or lack of Italians arguing, or doing coke in the back, or honest food photography that makes it all look gross but relatable. It just lacks a certain level of personality.
