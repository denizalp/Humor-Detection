A family appointment put us in the area and since Comedor was is closed on Tuesday's we drove a bit further to La Canasta.  I haven't been here in years, remembered liking there red Chile, so it was a good choice.  The service was eh, food was OK, and the bathroom was dirty, smelled so poorly,  I don't think I will rush back to visit again.   Last time I visited the  downtown location \"Capitolio\" the atmosphere was much cleaner.
