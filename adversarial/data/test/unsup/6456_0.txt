We come here for the weekly deals. They quite often have specials like country ribs at 99 cents a pound. They run buy one get one free deals periodically. I have a Basha's club card which saves on many in-store sale items. The down side is they don't offer fuel points like Fry's or Safeway. This store is in my neighborhood so I will continue to watch for the weekly specials.
