The strip is full of fun, wild, crazy, exciting, extraordinary people from just about every and any background you can think of.\nHomeless to rich, strippers to escorts, Families and solos, drunken millennials and easy going old timers, the Las Vegas strip is the place to be! \nDon't be fooled by movies though - it's not that small! We walked the entire strip quite a bit whenever we visit but it's no easy or quick task!\n\nBe safe, have fun, enjoy!
