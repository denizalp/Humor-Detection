This museum has eclectic collection. We came on a Saturday in June and waited for the place to open at 10am. They have dinosaurs collection in the lobby, buddhism collection, asian, Egypt's archeology, animals for kids, furnishings collection. The ticket was not expensive. So we spent around 2 hours there.
