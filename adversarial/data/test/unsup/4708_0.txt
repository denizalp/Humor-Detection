I visited Rollover yesterday to try the donuts and coffee I hear everyone raving about. I ordered the orange cardamom latte, an orange pistachio and a maple bacon donut. The coffee was excellent as well as the orange pistachio donut. The maple bacon donut I can't quite get behind. There was something off about their maple glaze- it was oddly spicy and didn't go well with the bacon in my opinion- sort of messed with the whole salty and sweet sensation that you would expect.
