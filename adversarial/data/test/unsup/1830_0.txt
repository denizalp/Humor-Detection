The only thing that this store has in common with Honest Ed's across the street is a rhyming first name.\n\nHonest Ed's has hundreds of things you need.   Ted's has nothing you want.\n\nThe first time I walked in here,  I marveled at how a store could stock such ridiculously out-of-touch clothing while maintaining a price premium for their wacky curation of style.\n\nThe second time, I was completely ignored for ten minutes as the staff talked amongst themselves.\n\nThere will be no third time.
