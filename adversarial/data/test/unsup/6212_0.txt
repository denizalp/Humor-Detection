Gorgeous  country club- I don't claim to be \"in the know\" but when they have league tennis tournaments here, it's great. Stadium seating, plenty of palms, good visibility, and tons of tables and chairs.\n\nRefreshments available in the store, along with various workout gear. Gym access is pricey but limited, so I wouldn't go here for just that- but they do now have a separate studio for dance classes. Didn't see a posted schedule though.
