Simple boba place. Very clean. Friendly staff. Love the painting on the wall (needs color though) for a more inviting atmosphere. But overall I love that this place is closer to me and that the boba drinks are amazing! I ordered viet coffee lychee, passion fruit lychee and mango lychee. All were sweetened to perfection and great portion of lychee! Definitely coming back.
