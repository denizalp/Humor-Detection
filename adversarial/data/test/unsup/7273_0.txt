I've been here several times. I was recommended this place by a coworker and have been very happy with the work they do. \n\nThey have excellent prices and friendly staff. They only take cash, which is kind of a pain, but for a cut, highlights and style it's well under $100, which is excellent. I definitely recommend you ask for Denise M. She's a sweetie and you'll feel like you've known her for years after just a visit or two. I highly recommend this place.
