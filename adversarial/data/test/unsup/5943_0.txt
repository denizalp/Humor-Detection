This club is fun! Has many rooms with different music to choose from. As we arrived we were professionally greeted by \"DJ\"- the security guard...he made us feel extremely welcomed! He described each room down to the tee....where they are located..what music they played...the type of atmosphere..etc...because of the way he greeted us...totally pumped us up to have a great night!
