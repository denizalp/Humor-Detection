Great food! The watermelon and kale salad was tangy and refreshing! Great starter choice! I had the butter burger and it was tall and juicy. The Boursin cheese was a perfect pairing to the patty. The NY steak was the star of the show. The steak was perfectly balanced and you taste the subtlety of flavors! Highly recommend this spot. We didn't have to wait for lunch. We will definitely be back when we're back in town!
