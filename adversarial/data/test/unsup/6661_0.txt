This is a really nice French Cafe.. was recommended by a friend of my son...the employees were very nice., the Bacon Quiche had such a nice smokey flavor and nice crispy..served with a small salad...the peppermint coffee yummy.. I took home a lemon meringue tart.. wow it was amazing.. nice little cafe with lots of table but still a warm and cozy feeling..
