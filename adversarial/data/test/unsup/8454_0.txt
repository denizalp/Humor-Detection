This place has great music and is open late. Although we were seated right away, we were not immediately given menus. Don't bother with their veggie \"Urth\" Burger; it was unseasoned, and lacked flavor. The Chicken Club Burger wasn't bad, but the onion rings were even better. The Rising Sun was delicious, but messy to eat. So, should you try now? If it's late and you're in the area, yes.
