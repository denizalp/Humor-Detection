A quite delicious breakfast\/brunch spot with outstanding fresh food.\n\nMimosas are very good, bloody Marys are a little heavy on the horseradish for my liking. Coffee is ok.\n\nOutdoor seating only and out door heating for chilly mornings.\n\nIf you're in the mood for a nice breakfast nook of a spot with \"can't go wrong\" dishes, this is a place to be.
