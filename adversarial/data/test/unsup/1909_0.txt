Definitely one of my fave curry places in Vegas! Nothing on the menu is over $7.00 - It's definitely a lot of food for the price! You can choose to have your curry at mild, medium or hot. My personal favorite is the chicken cutlet curry (you can also opt to have the chicken grilled if you want it!). First timers at the restaurant get a discount as well - be sure to check out the flyer for the different coupons.\n\nFun fact: The owner is going to start offering Curry Dogs on his menu!  Yummmm
