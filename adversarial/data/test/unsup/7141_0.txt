As I'm typing this review out, I'm currently chugging down my Cherry Pepsi while slowly digesting my BLT sub.\n\nSo my friend took me here for lunch today and although the place wasn't exactly the kinda joint [hehehe...] that I'm use to, I became a fan instantly!\n\nI had the 8\" BLT [Kush, I think?] and it was sooo delicious!  Every bite brought me to toasty euphoric bliss.\n\nI definitely recommend this place to everyone!
