Service goes a long way as well as attitude and when you lack both you lack customers. Unfortunately with the attitude and lack of service from the hostess you will now be losing four customers today. Now..... will that send you into bankruptcy, no..... but I vote with my dollar and my dollar will now go somewhere else.
