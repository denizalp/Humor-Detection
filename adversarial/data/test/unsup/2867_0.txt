So the key to this place is to get here around 8:30-9pm...that's when the fresh batch of donuts leaves the fryer.  I got a couple nice warm chocolate bars (just the right doughy texture) a vanilla French cruller, as well as some doughnut holes just for the hell of it.  This cements it...one of the best donut houses in Henderson\/Las Vegas.
