Simple Italian cafe kind of menu!  \n\nPizzas and pastas for people on the go or something quick to eat! \n\nPizza sausage was spot on. Check in on Yelp for complimentary lemon cookies! \n\nPastas are of the norm.  Standard size and quality is good.  \n\nGrab and start munchin'!  I'll like my food Pronto!
