CHILD PLEASE! I'm from Chicago and I know pizza so I say this without pause. This pizza is a glorified little ceasars or pizzahut . Otherwise this is just a normal joint in the hood. Nothing special as far as pizza is concerned. I was critical of the pizza because it was supossed to be this great place for pizza , but its not!
