Very poor customer service. The waitress there was very unprofessional. She kept getting my order wrong and was too busy socializing instead of making sure the guests were being served. My food came to me late and cold and it's more than likely because she was too busy socializing. I could overhear her conversation from across the room because she was so loud and ghetto. The cooks were all behaving in the same manner. This place has the potential to be a nice establishment, but they will have to replace their staff, starting with management.
