I ordered the tender pork ribs noodles. Really tasty ramen. Juicy pork ribs. Waitress explained that the way they prepare their pork ribs makes it so that you can actually eat the bone. It was very tasty and tender. Broth and noodles are tasty too. Huge bowl.\n\nPlace is clean, comfy booths, great service.
