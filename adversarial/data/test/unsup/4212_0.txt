Firstly, I was very impressed with their bathrooms. Very clean despite a lot of people coming through.\n\nWe got a combo with chicken and beef and a beef shawarma. Together with a fountain pop, it came up to around $26.\n\nI really liked the beef and pita. The beef was flavourful and pita was super soft. They packed the ingredients so it was super filling. The chicken was ok. It didn't have as much flavour as the beef. The hot sauce was very hot and the white sauce was not overpowering with garlic.
