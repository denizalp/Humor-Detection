Exceptional food and service. We sat at the bar because we were in a rush to go see the show. Our bartender, the gentleman in his 40-50s was kind and attentive. He made great suggestions and had a warm and welcoming attitude. We ordered Squash ravioli and portobello pizza. We ended up having a great experience.
