Recently moved to Vegas and have been searching for an acceptable Chinese restaurant. Found this via Yelp and it has been exceptional! Make sure you use the Craig location, the Durango one sucks...\n\nWe try different dishes each time and everything has been great. The only downside I've discovered so far is they use the iconic Chinese food folding box for most entrees instead of the styrofoam containers, and it causes food near the bottom to go soggy if you don't remove it from the box quickly.
