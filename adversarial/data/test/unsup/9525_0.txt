Go!  It is really good!\n\nIn from the Northeast and sat ouside (true sign of an out of towner in January).  Great space, great decor, and great servie.\n\nJust really good and fresh tasting New Mexican food.  Had a Jalipo Mule and enjoyed it very much.  We both ordered off the specials board and were thrilled,  I ordered a \"trio\" while my guest ordered Lamb Taco's.\n\n The flavors are amazing and with a great balance.\n\nGuaranteed visit next time I'm back in Phoenix.
