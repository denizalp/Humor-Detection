Recently just moved to Arizona from Cali and I have to say, this boba shop is pretty good. Got the classic black milk tea with lychee bits and it was the perfect balance. The lychee bits were okay... and the classic milk tea was strong (in a good way). Customer service was super nice! Definitely coming back to try their puffle ice cream cones
