Girls don't wear your heels, esp your fancies, b\/c it's:\n*Super dark\n*Many steep ramps throughout \n*Narrow walkways\n*A multitude of stairs\n*Lame BOYS running about, ready to step on your toes\n*Crazy packed dancefloors\n\nThe worst layout in a club EVER.  Seriously, what was the design team thinking?!?! If the gals can't get around, how are they going to strut their stuff, in turn increasing the revenue at the bars, b\/c the boys are going to clamor to get them drinks.\n\nM attracts a clientele I don't want to bump and grind with.\n\nOn the upside, cheap cover by Vegas standards & great drinks.
