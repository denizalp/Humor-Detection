I'm not sure what people are complaining about. These are AWESOME. Seriously. I love their texture, taste, and the fillings. Quite the creative combo of flavors too depending on the day you drop by. They don't taste like they have an overabundant amount of sugar and the frosting is the perfect blend between rich and not. Both the ladies that work there are beyond sweet and feel that it's worth every penny.
