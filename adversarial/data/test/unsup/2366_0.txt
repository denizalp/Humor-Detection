Woohoo! Free drinks at the open! Drinking and People watching...my 2 favorite sports!\nHad a blast being one of the 189,000 in attendance on Saturday.\nWe even caught some golf action in between. \nThe process of parking in a lot far away and riding a bus was painless on the way in, but since we didn't want to wait an hour in line to get back to our car, we walked the mile or so to get out.\nI've been given Corporate Village tix to this event before, but I've never used them. From now on, I'm going!
