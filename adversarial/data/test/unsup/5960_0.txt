Just so-so sushi. Came for happy hour and there's hardly anything on their happy hour menu. Ordered the calamari (which was too salty to even eat), Spicy tuna, Sunny roll (crab meat and avocado topped with a mango in a sweet sauce), Salmon and Yellowtail nigiri. The only stand out was the Sunny roll. Everything else was just mediocre. I doubt I'll go back. \n\nConvenient location though.
