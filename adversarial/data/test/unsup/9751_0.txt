I had been bringing my dog to Born to Run for week long vacations a few times in the past year without ever being told of anything going wrong. Then, they proceed to tell me when I call to schedule boarding that, because my dog (German Short-haired pointer) is too \"High Energy\" they will not take him any longer. For a place called BORN TO RUN, where pointers need to run, they are DISCRIMINATING AND LUDACRIS!! WHAT A JOKE:BORN TO RUN....WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. PLUS THE PLACE IS NOT THAT CLEAN EITHER.
