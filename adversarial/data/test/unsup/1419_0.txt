My husband and I rented an apartment four months ago , and we are more than satisfied. From the very beginning Cameron helped us with everything that we needed to know, also Figette and Claire are very helpful and nice. The few minor problems that we had in our apartment was solved within a day. I sincerely recommend this place if you need nice , friendly neighbors and a very good management and staff.
