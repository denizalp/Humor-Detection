I have been here 3 times for a blowout and every time it has been 5 star service! The location is very easy to get to in Town Square. The salon is beautiful. And everyone is nice, helpful, and professional. \nCierra has done my blowout for 2 out of the 3 times and she's AMAZING. Very quick and does great work. \nI will definitely come back and recommend this salon to my friends\/family.
