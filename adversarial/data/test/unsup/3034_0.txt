Husband stopped here on way home from work and got home with a completely different order than what he ordered. Not only that, we had to drive back and get the correct order. Hubby called and spoke with the manager Victoria and she immediately apologized and when we got there she was very sympathetic and apologetic. She was so sincere to us and even gave us a free cone for our daughter. Victoria, thank you for being a sincere manager and fixing those issues. There needs to be more Victoria's in the food industry. Thanks again Victoria!
