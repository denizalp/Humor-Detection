The best thing about this chain of cafes is the top-notch service from everyone, even if it's a busy day or stressed. In the case of the latter, our waitress was pulled away from us due to another situation and a nearby waiter was assigned to my table, and he was instantly all charm. Food was good as always, though the waffles in my Breakfast Of Champions were a little cold by the time it got to me. Was also a little long before the food got here.
