Seriously not great. The food just wasn't delicious and the restaurant, though beautiful, had a bad feng shui. Prices are exorbitant for such minute portions. Every dish is totally lacking in flavour, temperature, and presentation. I don't think Joanne Kates would be impressed. \n\nBTW I counted all the layers in my 100-layer lasagna. They were all there but still not a fan of this restaurant.
