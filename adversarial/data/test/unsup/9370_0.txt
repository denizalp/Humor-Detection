Kards Unlimited is, by far, the most fun and interesting novelty shop I've ever seen.  They have tons of the most random things, and I really enjoy buying gifts there.  Most recently, I found an ironic magnetic Sarah Palin dress-up doll for the refrigerator and some very nice bath products for a gift to a very Republican family member.\n\nEvery time I'm in Kards Unlimited, I find new and exciting stuff, and I'm always surprised at how reasonable the prices are.  Gotta love this store!
