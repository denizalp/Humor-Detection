Nice, went here yesterday, my wife got the Crazy Alfredo and loved it.  Quiet, comfortable, good service!  Thank you!\n\nI have never had a bad experience at this restaurant. The people are great, fast service, excellent food, OK, this is Las Vegas and its supposed to be this way!  Too bad many other restaurants don't get it.  So, all you restaurant owners that want to see how its done RIGHT, check this place out.
