I came here for lunch after driving by this place a few times and was happy with what I had.\n\nThe decor here is really cute.  Simple, clean and bright.  I went with the Greek Chicken Pita, and it came with a bag of chips, a side of pasta salad and a pop.   Total bill was $9.02.  Not bad!  The chicken was tasty, pasta salad was okay at best.  I took home my extras and had them as a light dinner. \n\nFood here is fresh, healthy and light.  Servings are healthy in size and would gladly return in the future.
