Not super impressed with my first experience at Tokyo. The waitress wasn't helpful in offering suggestions of good rolls to sample. The sushi I did order didn't seem very fresh or have a real distinct flavor. The atmosphere was kind of strange too, it reminded me of a 50s type diner, and the odd music just made the whole experience sub par.
