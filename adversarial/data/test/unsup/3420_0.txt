went for brunch and was totally dumbfounded on how this place functions.  there are waiters but you have to place an order at the counter and get your own coffee THEN when your ill prepared food is ready they yell out your name looking for your table.\nif i wasn't there with someone that had been there before and knew the protocol i would have starved... which may have been the better option.
