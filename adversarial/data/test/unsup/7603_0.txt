No, this place is not cheap..but I paid for the artist's time and quality [on the Las Vegas strip] and could not be happier with my tattoos.  I have two 3x3 (approx) multi-colored devils on my shoulders and it came out to be $600.  However, even after 3 years - the colors are still even and looking good. The place is clean, spacious and comfortable. I would recommend it to anyone interested in getting a tattoo in LV!
