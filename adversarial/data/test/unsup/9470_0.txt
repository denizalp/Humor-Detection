Fabulous!\n\nAll day breakfast at real great value. We ordered eggs benny with hasbrowns, cheese, broccoli and potato soup and a ham and Swiss on a croissant all for about $22 before tip.\n\nWe left stuffed!\n\nI scoped out everyone else's meal in the dinner and it ALL looked great.\n\nI'm new to area and I know that this will become a staple establishment for us!
