My wife and I made dinner reservations for our anniversary. We're seated right away, with personalized menus wishing us a Happy Anniversary (nice touch.) then, we had the five course dinner with wine pairings. I'm generally a \"steak and potatoes\" kind of guy, and suspicious of \"fancy\" foods. I'm absolutely serious when I say this was the most interesting and delicious meal I've ever eaten. My wife laughed at my surprise and excitement with every course. It's pricey, but we'll be back next year!
