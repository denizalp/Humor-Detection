Soups has no flavor! The seafood and meat was not fresh! They've got oyster, but very tiny and not fresh. You can find those in a cheap casino buffet that cost about $15-$18. Now even with 20%, I don't recommend it, especially for non Chinese consumers, don't waste your money, you'll find a lot of things you will never want to try.
