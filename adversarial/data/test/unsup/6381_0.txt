Wonderful vegetarian food, so many choices it was difficult to decide what to order!  I had the BBQ Tofu and it was truly delicious. My wife had the Israeli Bowl and was equally happy. Our server, Tyson, was knowledgeable, courteous and friendly. We sat on the outdoor patio and enjoyed the people watching while having a glass of wine with our meal. Great atmosphere and great food. Highly recommended. We will be back.
