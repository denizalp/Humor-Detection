Had service performed on my motorcycle and purchased products several times. I like this place, everyone so far has been friendly, knowledgeable and very helpful. I had to cut my losses at Carter Power Sports after they damaged my motorcycle and then denied it. The service here takes pictures when they check in the bikes. The installation was completed early as opposed to being dropped off twice for a total 6 days and having nothing but damage done at Carter. Ride Now is an example of how it should be.
