Ooh, Sweet Republic!  I've read so many good things about their ice cream and the bar was set pretty high!  We're walking around First Friday when we saw their groovy tangerine van.  \nMy hubby got the Belgian Chocolate and my little guy couldn't resist the  Butter Caramel.  \"This is so good!\",  he exclaimed.  White Rose intrigued me.  I love the smooth and creamy consistency with a touch of rose syrup.  \nIt's worth the $3 for one scoop!
