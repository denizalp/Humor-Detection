Kay is the sweetest and the best at what she does! She knows what she's doing and she does a fantastic job on all my clothes. I use her, my mother, grandma, and uncle all go to her! She does an excellent job on all my evening dresses and everything else I need done. Her prices are reasonable, and she does an amazing job! I've never been disappointed. Very friendly staff :)
