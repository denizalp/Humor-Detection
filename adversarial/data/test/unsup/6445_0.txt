If I could give it no stars I would. Worst experience ever. We had to wait for over and hour just for someone to take our order and then another 2 hours to get some boring overpriced burgers. So the manager was nice enough to comp us dessert which was great but it was one of their giant Sundays which saying nothing about them because it's all assembly ONLY. The dessert the made on site (chocolate cake) was boring and too sweet. The food life wise. It was such a waste of time and $$$
