I wasn't expecting much out of my visit to the Hall, and I was so pleasantly surprised. Our favorite part of the hall was the video presentations: the induction video on the first floor, and the who's in the hall on the third. I'm glad we visited on a Wednesday, they are open late (9 p.m.) so we hand enough time to devote to the three screen video feed of inductees by year. Budget extra time for this stop!
