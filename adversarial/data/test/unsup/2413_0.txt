How could you NOT like this place?\n\nI've taken the kids here dozens of times and they always have a good time.  If you can, get the MAX membership that gives you unlimited IMAX movies...  the kids have enjoyed every one we've seen, probably over a dozen this year alone.\n\nThe travelling exhibits are always fun, and the standard exhibits never seem to get old.  With the addition of the new NASA stuff, it seems like they are headed in the right direction.\n\nDuring the warmer months, check out the steamship - it's good for at least one trip.
