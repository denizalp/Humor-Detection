A OK for what it is. A small Chinese BBQ take-out restaurant. BBQed ducks hanging with their heads intact. Cleaver cutting through bones. I decided to stick to the familiar and order chicken legs.\n\nFresh Chinese BBQ. Quick service despite the lineup. Reasonable prices. Check it out if you are in the area and craving Chinese BBQ. Or if you never had it before and want to try something new.
