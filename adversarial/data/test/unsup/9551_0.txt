Recommended by a woman I met, we went the same day for lunch. It was pricey but the sandwiches are freshly made and there isn't anything like it. I did #35 roast beef and enjoyed it immensely. The potato salad on the side was different but good as well. This is not your average sandwich place, and definitely worth a try.
