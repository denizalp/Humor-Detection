The food and service has always been great.  BUT!  Tonight our server Lylia came across very rude and seem that she did not want to be working tonight. We asked for Linda but she was busy. That just tells you they have good servers.  We had to ask for refills extra napkins and rolls.  She never check on us and stood behind the counter chatting.\nIf I get put in her section again I will be asked to be moved.
