Came by for lunch the other day and it was mediocre. Managed to be seated upon arrival and service was prompt.\n\nStarted out with the fresh shrimp and pork rolls which were ok. They were premade and sitting in the fridge.\n\nMoved on to the Bun Bo Hue that Yelpers were raving about which was also mediocre at best. Broth was a tad watered down, noodles were a tad overcooked and meat was all cut up...\n\nTheir iced coffee was decent!
