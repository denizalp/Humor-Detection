DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!  They have horrible customer service, especially to the elders.  Everything is done online and is not user friendly.  They refused service to my 70 year old mother and told her to take her business elsewhere.  Sure, my mom may have been a little confused, but if they really are a \"professional family run business\" they would have a little compassion, patience and understanding towards her instead of turing her away.  \n\nVery unprofessional, rude, and a company I would never recommend based on customer service.
