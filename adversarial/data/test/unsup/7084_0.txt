First time going into a restaurant that has no menu, the only options are \"5 or 7 courses\". They also wrote \"put your belly on us\" so I trust them without asking any questions. There's no disappointment from appetizer to dessert, everything was very tasty. Servers were very knowledgeable and attentive. The atmosphere was very cozy. They change their dishes every month and I can't wait to go back when its truffle season!!
