Quick, clean and generous. I've been on a poke kick lately I've been to three places of this sort in the Charlotte area. All very similar, slightly different price points seemingly based on whether or not avocado is included or extra but it all ends up the same. For about $20, we had dinner for two. We each ordered the smaller of the two bowls and wrangled chopsticks around our bowls until our bellies were full. I would definitely come back here again when I'm craving a sushi-type dinner. Give them a try!
