Went here for dinner. I'm not a fan of Italian food, but it was great! I had the AMAZEBALLS radicchio salad (ginormous and fabulous and delicious and full of all kinds of crunchy green goodness) and the seafood risotto (also fantastic).\n\nWe were offered the choice of sitting in the restaurant, or the lounge. We ended up in the lounge, which I HEARTILY recommend, as it affords excellent people-watching opportunites -- our table was right by the casino walkway, and so much fun to mock all the pretentious idiots walking past!\n\nThis place is schwanky, without feeling overly pretentious.
