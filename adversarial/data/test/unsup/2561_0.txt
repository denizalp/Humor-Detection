If it weren't for Trader Joe's, I would probably die of malnutrition. Not that I wouldn't eat, but without TJ's, I wouldn't have nicely priced, already chopped up veggies. My diet without TJ's would consist of cheese sandwiches, don't judge, I'm too busy and important to properly feed myself (aka, young adult trying to get it together).\n\nConveniently located with affordable produce, TJ's has served me well. The only thing about this place is that I always end up with way more in my basket than I intended. #impulsive.
