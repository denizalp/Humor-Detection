The place has a icky vibe about it, which one could ignore if the service was great. However, it's not. They denied that another franchise carried a particular item, even claiming that one of the employees worked there which is how they knew we were wrong. A complaint that went to their head office resulted in an disingenuous \"I'm sorry\" message left on voicemail, which also insinuated that they simply made a mistake. I guarantee I will never even step inside this location because if you don't have the decency to be honest, I'm not giving you my money.
