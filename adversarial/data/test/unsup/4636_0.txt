Olga the furniture lead was and always is amazing. Great under pressure and always very friendly and helpful. This store is lucky to have her! Cherokee is also very friendly and super helpful as well. He let us know that if we bought on Saturday rather than Friday we would get 20% off of our entire purchase! Very pleased overall. And the selection of snacks is better than most biglots-- lots of nuts, dried berries, gourmet popcorn, etc.
