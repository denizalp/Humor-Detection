The worst Cuban sandwich I ever had, I am Cuban so I know what they taste like. Service was like they were doing me a favor for allowing me to have lunch.  They should also provide more lighting in the co-ed restroom. And definitely take the religious figures out of the restroom, I felt insulted by it.
