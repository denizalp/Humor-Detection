INDIAN FOOD!!!!!!  I thought I would never find Indian food outside of cleveland heights, parma, lakewood and north olmstead.  However there is this one Indian Market that has TONS of Indian goodies and fresh samosas and gulab jamun daily......yum!  It is very small and the vegtable selection is limited however you can get every indian frozen meal you can think of and lots of fresh indian desserts.
