I got so excited seeing Amorino at the Outlet when I was shopping, it's the perfect refreshment while doing some serious damage at the mall and refuel and beat the heat!\nPrices and portions are fair, service is fantastic and the gelato is not only perfect in taste, but also beautifully presented.\nMy son and I had a waffle cone with several of their flavors and really enjoyed them.\nMy husband had a granita, while a bit pricey and small in size, it was also excellent!\nHuge selection of flavors, high quality gelato, I am a huge fan of Amorino!
