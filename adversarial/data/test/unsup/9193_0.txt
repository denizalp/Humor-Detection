This was our first visit and to our surprise we were going to cook our own steaks. We enjoyed cooking our steaks the way we wanted, I'm a well done, my hubby is a medium rare and this worked for us. My only issue was that sides were cold by the time we were ready to eat our steaks. Our waitress was awesome, she explained the process and checked on us frequently to make sure things were going well.
