I stopped by here last Sunday afternoon and picked up a dark chocolate and a coconut cupcake.  The dark chocolate wasn't bad but tasted just a little off.  The coconut cupcake however was awesome, I LOVED the frosting on it.  You certainly don't have to worry about these cupcakes being dry - they were so oily they could soak through several sheets of napkins.  If I lived in the area I'd probably visit this place a few more times.
