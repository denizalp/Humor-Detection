i've been craving Yoshinoya beef bowl for the longest time and was depressed that the location by UNLV closed down.  i'm from socal so yoshinoya is easy to come by.  this was the best alternative and my craving was satisfied.  if they had different sizes like a large bowl, i would of ordered it but the portion was decent and i was full after i combined it with a miso soup.  \n\ni will definitely be visiting more often and trying different dishes.
