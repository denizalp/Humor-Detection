Had brunch here the day after Society Cafe.  Since still dreaming of the Oscar Benedict there, I thought I'll give the Crab Oscar Benedict here a try.  Not bad tasting but it was just crab meat included in the benedict, unlike the crab cake at Society Cafe.  Also had the special salad of the day.  Mixed greens with watermelons.  The watermelons were outstandingly refreshing with a hint of vinaigrette.  Other diners ordered steak and eggs; smelled delicious, looked good.\n\nExcellent service, very attentive staff.
