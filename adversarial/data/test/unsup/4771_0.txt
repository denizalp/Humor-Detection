The Coffee Lab is hidden underneath all the construction last time when I dropped by.\n\nWalking into the small space and I was in love. I already sensed the dedication and passion of the Barista\/Owner towards the perfect cup of coffee.\n\nCome here for the coffee and only for their coffee. No this is not a place for you to park yourself for hours studying or on your laptop.\n\nSparkling water in a beaker? The ultimate coffee geek who pay so much in every small details.\n\n\n\nPS I am just so sad to now it is closed!
