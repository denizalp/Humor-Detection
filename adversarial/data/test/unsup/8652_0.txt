If you get a table on the top floor, it's amazing! Great atmosphere up there. \n\nThe food is really good. I've been there once for dinner (ordered a mushroom & truffle oil pasta) and once for brunch (had eggs benedict with a generous side of green salad and really good toast) and was very happy with the food\/service\/experience both times. Will definitely be back again.
