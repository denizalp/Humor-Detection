Great local hangout on the weekends. The biggest problem with bars in Fountain Hills is that they are in Fountain Hills. If you are already hooked up, this is a great place to take your SO and hang. If you are on the hunt, stay out of Fountain Hills. Singles are not overly popular in town.\n\nExactly what you would expect from a local bar. Reasonable prices and if Angie is working, she is very nice to watch!
