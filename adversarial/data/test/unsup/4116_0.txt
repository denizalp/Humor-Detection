Horrible costumer service !! I came to print instant pictures and the machine as always didn't work.. so I was asking a lady who worked there and she said \"wait here im gonna ask.. I'll be right back\" I waited 15 minutes and still nothing !! I looked like an a**hole... I gave up and walked out and saw the lady while walking out just standing somewhere doing nothing.. she totally forgot about me or simply ignored me.. only thing I like about this place is that you can find cheap deals but that's at every walmart...
