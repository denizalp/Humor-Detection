This place is a gem.  We loved everything we ordered for brunch.  Each dish was done to perfection.  The bacon was probably the best we have ever had.  The water was really nice and very friendly and tried his absolute best to translate and explained the menu.  We loved the food and the service. \nWe will need to try dinner when we go to Montreal the next time.\nThe price is very reasonable for the quality of food we got.  There were 4 of us and we each said our dish we ordered was the best.  Loved it.
