Fri nite happy hour.  Buffalo shrimp with fish and chips very good.  Nice to have beer specials on a Fri nite.  Staff very nice.  Only downside was rooftop bar and deck packed, even at 4:45pm.  Upside, we had the inside bar all to ourselves- nice atmosphere.  Wanted to leave review as I have read others that are not so good.
