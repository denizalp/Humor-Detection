This is the real deal folks!\n\nIf you're looking for fresh Fresh FRESH seafood stop by and see what selections they have. Their selections looked to be much fresher than Los Ranchos. \n\nKeep your eyes peeled when you get to their little store. It's easy to miss the entrance to the parking lot and just as easy to not see the entrance to the shop.\n\nThe shopkeepers were very nice and helpful in answering all of our questions.\n\nIt's worth a gander when you're in the area.
