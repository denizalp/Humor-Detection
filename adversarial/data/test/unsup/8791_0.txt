No, Mister Jumbo\nPerhaps we ate a kitty?\nTaste like chicken -not.\n\n\n     Steady decline here.  Two years ago I got a respectable meal here.  Last year I saw a marked decline.  I thought I'd give it another shot last night.  Big mistake.  Cold eggrolls of stone.  Chow Mein noodles were stale and tasted of rancid oil.  3 shrimp in the shrimp chow mein.  Crap fried rice.  Probably with actual left-over craps.  \n\n     And Rachel, they really do need to learn the secret of General Tso's chicken.\n\nCarry on.
