This isn't my first time here but this is the first time we had a great waitress. She was quick, friendly and attentive. The food was great. I had the crab cake sandwich and added a side salad. My partner had a huge plate of mussels which were excellent. Only thing that would make it five stars for me is that when I order a mixed green salad I don't want iceberg lettuce in it. Other than that I'd recommend Roland's.
