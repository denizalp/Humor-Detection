If I were to summarize my experience at Nazareth by recalling some of the conversations here...\n\n1) OMG, it's so busy here!  Let's just eat at the bar.\n\n2) WHAT?! That vegetarian platter is HUGE, it's only $10?! We're sharing.\n\n3) I have no idea what this is - but it's freaking tasty.\n\n4) Use all five fingers.  LOOK!!! All five!  Just grab it!!!!\n\n5) I told you to not eat all the injera. It's just spongy filler.\n\n6) Ethiopian food - just too delicious.  So full now.
