Just okay sushi. The cold sake I selected tasted like it was laced with vodka (too strong, not enough sake flavor) and all of their cold sakes are served in small portion bottles--tres cheesy. Their web site makes it look classier than it is, which is a little hole in the wall off of King ST in downtown Madison. If you want real sushi in Madison, try Takara.
