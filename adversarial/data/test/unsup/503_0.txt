Just when you thought finding a pleasant neighborhood bar and restaurant was hopeless......on stage is the Four Sevens.  The food is good but the real draw is JAKE!  By far the friendliest, funniest and most accommodating bartender West of the Mississippi.  Im impressed with the experience at this place and recommend it to anyone.
