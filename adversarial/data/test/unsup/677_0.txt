If your name is cold beer and cheeseburgers, then you better do a great job with cold beers and cheese burgers. \n\nThe beer was cold but the cheeseburger was so disappointing. Came out burnt with no flavor and the bun was twice the size.\n\nThere are so many awesome burger shops around I doubt I will be back.
