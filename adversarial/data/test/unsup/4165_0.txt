I so want to love this place. The concept and place itself are great. BUT every time we've gone there one of my kids or myself has gotten sick. We wash our hands like crazy and still end up with something funky. I asked an employee how often they cleaned the ball pits and she told me they last cleaned it 4 days ago! WHAT? That's 4 days of kids sweat, spit, tears, etc. Gross. I wish I could give this place a good review but just can't. Illness has happened way too many times after going there.
