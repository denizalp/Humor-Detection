Two years of school doesn't make Marlina Robinson pa-c A doctor. She doesn't know what she's doing she's incompetent.       \nIf you don't feel well she can't tell you what's wrong with you . You have to tell her what to do and what medicine you want to take . Either the doctor is ignorant or lazy or her nurses  because they don't know which drugs are approved by the patient's insurance. They are lazy and incompetent. Don't go to anthem hills medical center
