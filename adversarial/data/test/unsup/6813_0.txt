Found the show somewhat entertaining bringing a rock star like theme to magic. However, the magic was old stuff and I was looking for something more up to date. The \"plants\" in the audience were obvious and unnecessary but it's all part of the show. The music was good but the overall hype a bit lame. Overall, I expected better, in fairness the finale was very good and more of what I expected the whole show to be.
