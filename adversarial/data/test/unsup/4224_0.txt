exactly what the stars say. MEH. i realize that it is just mcdonalds, but i have definitely experienced better. everytime i come through here the employees are very monotonous and the fries are cold. seriously, the fries are the best part of mcdonalds; the least you could do is give me a decent order of hot, salty deliciousness!
