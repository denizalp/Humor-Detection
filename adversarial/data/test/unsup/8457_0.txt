Friendly service. .. decent burger and fries.  \n\nToday we had the smoked pepper bacon burger.  Tasty.. with the reliable fries. Also had a mini tower of onion rings.... very good with the dipping sauces\n\nOur waitress was paying attention to stuff and our sodas stayed full... and we got the extra fries (I will eat them even if I don't want them. .. Because bottomless fries are their  \"thing\".\n\nAlways a safe, if not inspired stop
