I like the food and location of this Chicago based breakfast\/lunch cafe, but we need a little more Phoenix and a little less Chicago in their approach to beverages.  Here in the parched desert we want our beverages served quickly and refills need to keep coming with large \"to go\" cups when requested (Breakfast Club has this figured out to their customers ' delight). This can be a deal breaker here in metro Phx. Step it up, Elly's and you'll have 5 stars.
