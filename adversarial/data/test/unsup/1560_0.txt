Ok love, love this place. First time I have ever gone anywhere and when ready to leave was asked did I want to go cups for drinks. We said yes and the waitress got them for us. Iced tea, coffee and soda. The food is great, service great, biscuits and gravy still not as good as Brass Rail. Even on a Sunday right at lunch did not have to wait. WIll go back as often as I can afford the drive and the meal.
