You get what you pay for here. Its not the nicest but it is a fun place to stay with kids. Very friendly, the games and the ambiance are all fun and mid evil. They do have great restaurants in there. the shows are fun and the downstairs game area is a blast for sure. I recommend this place. Just keep in mind it is not a nice hotel justa fun one
