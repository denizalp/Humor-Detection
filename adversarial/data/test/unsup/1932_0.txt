5 stars for the mocha coconut frappe. It reminds me of KiMOBEAN in Waikiki. Perfect blend of mocha with a hint of coconut, and not artificial tasting. I've tried the famous sweet potato latte here (it's good for a couple sips, but it's too sweet for me, plus, there is no coffee in it) also the pistachio latte is good here, again, it's a little too sweet for me. \n\nWish they had a better pastry selection, although the red bean waffles and the shaved ice does the trick.
