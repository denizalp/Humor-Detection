I came here for lunch. The location is a little difficult to find. My friend and I found two seats, but there was no tablewares on the table. We found a basket which keep tablewares, but I thought the basket was not clean because everybody can take tablewares from there. When I asked the waiter a coke, the waiter gave me a diet coke. However, the food was good. I love the grilled pineapple!
