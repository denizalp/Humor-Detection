The food was delicious.  I took my girlfriend here for her birthday.  The food was delicious and was only outdone by the shining service we recieved.  Our waiter was awesome.  I had a few dietery restrictions and he was very patient and seemed to not mind at all.  I look forward to going back.\nI can't forget to mention, the view of Toronto was beautiful.\nI definitely look forward to doing back... :)
