I've moved myself a ton of times before but I needed to move Once again and finally (hesitantly) decided to allow the professionals to move me. I'm honestly So glad I did. With the \"movers\" doing all the heavy lifting and moving, I had the energy to decorate my new home without being completely exhausted from moving myself. I highly recommend 5 Star Moving to anyone I know! The staff was very friendly and professional. I'd definitely call them again...if I move again.  :-)
