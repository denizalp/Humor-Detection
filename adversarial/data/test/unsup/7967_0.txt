This is a pretty typical Panera Bread location. It's always best to come early to make sure you have first chance at all the pastries. My favorite is the pecan roll and those go fast, so by the afternoon they're always gone. \n\nService is friendly and solid. They get very busy during the breakfast and lunch rush, but if you go before or after, you're good.
