This is my main go to Super Wal-Mart, as I don't have to go past the freeway, and get tangled up with the poorly timed traffic signals more than I already contend with. Like other stores, this one can have too much of one thing, and not enough of the other. And that, is usually the item that I need. \n\nHowever, today went well, and they had everything that I needed. 8)\n\n But, the staff here could take a refresher course and inter-personal relationships with their customers.
