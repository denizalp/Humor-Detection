This was a busy Starbucks at the Charlotte Airport and it was a welcome treat in the interim between arriving from Paris and departing for home.\n\nThe place wasn't too busy and before long I was on my way with my drink.  The wifi was strong and I should have stayed there because of the time limit on wifi in this airport.\n\nThe staff was pleasant.
