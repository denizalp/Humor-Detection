We didn't get sick. It was a busy day, because they were giving away free food (bean & cheese burritos, and green chili burritos), trying to clean their image after the E. Coli outbreak in another of their locations.\nIt wasn't exactly, it was free! The green chili was just a bit too dry, but I understand that they had to prepare in advance for all the people that was going to show up. So, kudos for them. Great way to advertise.
