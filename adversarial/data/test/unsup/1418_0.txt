The food here isn't bad at all. They had a lovely Fennel and Lettuce soup. That's right, a soup of Lettuce and Fennel. I was quite impressed. The problem, for which I docked them a star, was the service. They were slow, they seemed confused by our group and sadly, they got a couple of orders wrong. Not good. \n\nBUT...\n\nI would recommend this place if you're at the Palais for a convention. It's easy, the place is pretty big and the food is good. I'd avoid the Caribou Pot Pie, but other than that, I thought it was lovely.
