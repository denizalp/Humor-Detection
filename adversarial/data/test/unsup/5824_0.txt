Terrible experience! My family was harassed on the course and had the cops called on them because they were driving on the rough to get to their ball (2 of the players were handicap). The office apologized, but that doesn't help that the golfing experience was ruined and $200 down the drain. Thanks for the horrible experience, we'll never be back. \n\nPlease don't waste your money here!
