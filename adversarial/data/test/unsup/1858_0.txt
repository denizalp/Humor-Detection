First time here and I will be back.\nDavid did an excellent job....a true professional. Sure you can go somewhere cheaper but you will not get the same results. Seeing the other barbers in here and the great looking haircuts they were doing around me solidified my opinion that this is a top quality establishment.\nTrue tradesmen of their profession.
