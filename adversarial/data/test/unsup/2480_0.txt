I have been visiting this restaurant for the past 10 years and always enjoyed the food quality and good service. The beef satay is always amazing! \nOver the past 2 years, however, the quality of food as deteriorated and the prices have increased significantly. The restaurant is no longer flexible with payment options. It's either cash or cash. In today's moneyless society the younger generation do not carry cash. This \"cash only\" policy has made going to Restoran Malaysia incredibly frustrating. \n\nI have been able to find newer restaurants that fit my budget and do not compromise on quality.
