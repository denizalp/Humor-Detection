Lush looks an independent store, privately owned, but its a chain. I was excited to check it out and took my time with a very helpful but not pushy sales gal. So, I sniffed around like a pensive poodle in a new park.\nI liked the colors and presentation.  But I guess I'm just a slave to high end department store name brands.\n\nI will be back to pick up some Christmas gifts though as this store has some cute kitschy items for gift giving.  Both male and female.
