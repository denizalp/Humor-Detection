Hipster Hell--don't fall for their ad that claims they'll buy \"any CD\"...I drove over a box of CDs and DVDs of pretty high quality(everything from The Pixies to Brian Eno to David Lynch and the Coen Bros. In pristine condition and they rejected 99% of my offering, the clerk sniffing \"we're really fussy\". So I tried to unload the rest of it in the uber-cool \"the Annex\" and  couldn't give it away. Next time, I donate it to Goodwill or the local hospital...screw these ripp-off artists...
