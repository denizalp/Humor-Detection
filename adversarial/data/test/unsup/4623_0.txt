This location is super busy (right across from U of T) and understaffed, but if you know Pita Pit, all that doesn't matter because of their Pitas. \n\nI had to wait a little while for my food, but the woman behind the counter was doing the best she could to help every one and was very nice. I always go here when I feel like a cheap, healthy, quick, and cheap lunch that reminds me of undergrad.
