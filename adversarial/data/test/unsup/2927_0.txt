May sound a bit harsh, but even if i'm not comparing to other airports, it can't stand alone to be a 3-star.  \n\nNot many food options; no McDonald's for heaven's sake.\n\nNot many shopping, different boutiques---unless you count three Hudson's!  \n\nThank goodness there's wifi and a few more charging stations, that's the 2nd star lol.
