I'll try anything once. Salted cheese (iced) coffee was my order. I tried the salted cheese crown by itself then with the iced coffee then mixed together. My impression? I do not like salted cheese in my drinks; it left a terrible aftertaste. The iced coffee was ok. \n\nHigh marks for being a bright, clean cute store with interesting looking drinks and a statue of their cute mascot that you can take pics with.\n\nWhen I visit Pacific mall again I would be willing to try their other drinks, minus the salted cheese please!
