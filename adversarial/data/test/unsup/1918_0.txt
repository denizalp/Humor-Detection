This is the Starbucks in Terminal B - right across from the Bojangles. Opening a little before 5:30am, it was a welcome sight to be the 1st in line as the SBux in the main concourse had a line out the door. \n\nTall Nonfat Flat White. Creamy, no extra shot required as it was nice & strong & needed no dressing up. Color me impressed!\n\nI usually avoid SBux like the plague but have to say they've won me over w\/ their flat whites......not to mention they're the best coffee option in Charlotte airport
