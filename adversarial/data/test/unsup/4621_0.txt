This is my favorite local Pho restaurant but the server tonight had way too much attitude to be a server. She was rude when she took our order and snatched the menus from our table and threw them down as she walked away. They really need to rethink who  they hire because I had to ask to have a different person to bring our food. Life is too short to deal with bad attitudes especially when I'm paying.
