The owner Jennifer is quite a piece of work for a business owner.  Like another patron (or potential patron that was snubbed, therefore will never become one) that misplaced her gift certificate, Jennifer refused to even give us 'some' credit toward the service.  So, this queen got her $200 and never had to honour it.  But she lost two (or more potential clients...and we told our gift-giver to never think about spending another dime in this place!  So who's the joke on Jennifer!
