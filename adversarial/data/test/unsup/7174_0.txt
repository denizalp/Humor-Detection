Cafe lunch in the forum shops! (Although I wish I tried dinner instead)\n\nWonderfully professional service\n---complimentary basket of a variety of YUMMY breads. I liked the onion bread & raisin bread but the cheese chip was just ok\n---lamb chorizo wood-fired pizza: I thought the crust could have been more crispy but the flavors were not bad\n\nDidnt get to try the shrimp with jasmine rice but someone at our table ordered it & the shrimp were HUGE!
