Disappointing at best. Server was good however you could tell they were short staff. 20 minutes to get a salad. Fish was cold and not much better than the frozen stuff from giant eagle. Attempted to speak to the manager but was to busy to help us. Place looked like it had not been cleaned in months. Stay away.
