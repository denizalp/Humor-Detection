I will never be able to express my gratitude to Dr. Archie Perry & his team. I've had 3 c-spine surgeries and I feel better than ever.  If you are contemplating a fusion surgery I am a walking success story with more mobility in my neck than 10 years ago. I am medically fused from C-3 to T-2 and feel great!  I can successfully swing a golf club and that's amazing!
