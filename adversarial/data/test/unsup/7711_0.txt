Except for some attention deprived girl in the front row and her comments, I really enjoyed my night here.  The host was really funny and sweet and the comics were entertaining.  \n\nMy date got us a booth in back so we could munch on some food while we watched the show.  You have to pay extra for booth seating, but as he said, \"It was worth it.\"   We ordered a burger and fries and the burger was fantastic.  Our server was also funny. There were no female comics. Is that normal?  Hire the server to do a show maybe?
