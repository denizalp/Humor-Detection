I have to give this store the full 5 stars.  Parking is great in this small plaza.  I stopped in to drop off a package with pre-paid shipping.  I waited for a receipt but the gentleman at the counter explained why it wasn't necessary for me to wait if yhey had a number of customers.  He was a very genial fellow.  \n\nThis will be my go to spot when I'm shipping with UPS.
