I recommend Paris Tattoos to everyone! I had a great experience... Both of my tattoos turned out even better than I could have imagined. I am beyond ecstatic that I get to live the rest of my life with this beautiful artwork! The tattoists were incredibly professional and dedicated to creating the perfect pieces for me... Worth every penny! If you are going to get inked in NC, don't go anywhere else! :)
