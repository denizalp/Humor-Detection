I came into Drones plus looking for help with a craft purchased from another vendor. It had some issues and their staff were very friendly and knowledgable and were able to help me find a solution. I should have purchased my drone from them. Customer service and relations are held high in a world that wants to automate everything. Good people. Thanks guys, I'll be back for sure.
