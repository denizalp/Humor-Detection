Even with GPS, this is still a place that even guys have to ask for directions to navigate to. But it is a nice lounge close to downtown to hang out at, away from the usual tourists hot spots and drunk cigerette smoking drink spillin' people . The only thing to really keep in mind is that no food is serve here, so eat before coming here or pick up something from the grocery store a few doors down or order some pizza and have it delivered.\n\nAnd DO NOT rearrange the furniture!\n\nExtra star for no smoking!
