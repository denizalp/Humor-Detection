Need a massive, well-stocked, but high-priced grocery store where finding things can be a real chore?\n\nLike a large selection of prepared meals and baked goods?\n\nDon't mind if customer service is only average?\n\nDon't mind paying more for the same items at No Frills?\n\nAlso like to shop for non-grocery items galore?\n\nThis is your place!!
