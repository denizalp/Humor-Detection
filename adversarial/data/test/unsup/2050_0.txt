You turn the corner and the street is suddenly ALIVE..  beautiful summer day, la Palma has the windows open.. Inside it's packed, loud, cool..\nNice touch with the uniforms, exterior sign font.\nI'm probably too low brow (and hungry, overweight..), for $20.35 I felt the 100 layer lasagna was expensive and small portion.  Double that order size, I'd be back!  Excellent flavour, taste.
