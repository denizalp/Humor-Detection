Food here is unique and different! Which I love! It is a fusion of both Cantonese food and japanese food. The service here is alright. Could be better but it's probably better than most service around this area. But since I am from the states. The service is terrible compared to what we get. Also their is only one restroom for each gender. Parking is also limited here. \n\nService : 3\/5\nFood : 4\/5\nAtmosphere: 3\/5
