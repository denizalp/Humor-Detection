Went there today to have two watchbands adjusted. Work was done on the spot, rather quickly. Reasonable price. Even when I had to take one of them back for another adjustment, there was no additional charge. Had the adjustment for my wife, but she didn't go with me. When I brought it home, she claimed it was still too big. \n\n  If she would have come with me in the first place, it would have saved me some time and gas.....but that's another story.
