Just off Desert Inn Rd\/Arville this is a real shit nest bar with a couple ofpool tables, a dart game, golden tee golf and a 20-25 person bar with video poker machines. The drinks are cheap, they no longer have food but they have a kitchen. They've done a little remodeling lately but this place is frequented by low-lifes.
