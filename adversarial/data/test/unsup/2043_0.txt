Bit of an issue with eggs ordered over hard and were a bit runny.  Nix provided exceptional service and recovered nicely from the cooks mistake.  I asked her to let the cook know what she did immediately.  Due to being an uber driver I didn't want to wait for a remake.  Let server know that I refer lots of tourists here which was met with an enthusiastic smile, thanks!
