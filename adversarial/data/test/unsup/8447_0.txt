I went to Houglass Cleaners this morning to pick up some dresses I had dropped off. One of them had a stain on it that I was worried wouldn't come out, but it looked perfect when I picked it up! I thanked him for taking such good care of my clothes. The owner is so friendly. He commented on my early start to my morning, then took my bill from $74 down to $65 just to be nice and \"contribute to my good morning\"! Great service, friendly people, I'm definitely a customer for life.
