Much better than the nearby Ohio Arrest Area, which will land you in jail.\n\nIt's not really much of a rest area, but it's out in the middle of nowhere, the air smells fresh and lovely, lots of greenery, and it's got plenty of bathrooms if that's what you're looking for. And some crap vending machines. I've seen much better and cleaner rest areas, but it serves its purpose, much like Steve Buscemi.
