Don't ever get a massage from Ben. I got one yesterday and it was hands down the worst I have ever received. I asked for a deeper massage and he was annoyed with me. Not one time Was I relaxed, did he ask ask if I liked it. Very disappointing. Wish I didn't have to pay for that. It was awful. Don't ever get rubbed by Ben (which is really what it was). \n\nOn the other hand, clean place, nice bathroom. The girl at the front desk didn't ever care. But they had dove chocolate :)
