very average place.\n\nCute little basement resto on the best street in tremont so A+ for location.\nBut the rolls were sooooooooooooo average and SUPER small!\n\nI had the Zeppelin: this was very good & fresh, but again, small. Def reccommend this \nand i also had the spicy tuna roll which was meh.\n\nThe menu is very small and not much to choose from. I LOVE supporting local resto's especially in tremont but i won't be coming back to this one.
