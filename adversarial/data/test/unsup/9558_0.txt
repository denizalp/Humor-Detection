Absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in town. Sparrow & Wolf serves up some of the most innovative and delicious dishes as well as some of the most fantastic craft cocktails. \n\nCreativity at its best, this is the place to go when you're looking for a restaurant for date night, late night eats with friends or a family dinner. \n\nI cannot sing the praises of this venture enough. Their menu is ever-changing and ever-delightful. I have not had one dish that hasn't blown my mind.
