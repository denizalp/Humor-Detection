A pseudo-town center that caters to those who might otherwise feel uncomfortable venturing out of their gated communities and would prefer to eat food that's shipped in from corporate headquarters. The selection of shops is fairly dull and the parking lot is a nightmare-it's intentionally designed to prevent cruising\/loitering\/whatever you want to call it, but while this may keep evil-doers at bay it also results in traffic jams and confusion for the innocent.
