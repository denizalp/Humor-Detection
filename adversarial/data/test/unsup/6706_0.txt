Went today to order wings and fries for 8.99 (12 wings and about 10 little fries) \nover cooked dried out nasty food....the fries weren't even a handful. I tried to chat up a confo and be cool.but that lady at the counter has NO Customer Service Skills at all. The cooks suck. and I just took my money back,and never ever will be back. At first I thought okay word of mouth is everything,but after paying,and receiving my food with a no smile attitude woman forget it!!!!\nI hope you go down!!!!
