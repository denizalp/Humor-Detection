We roamed off the strip to try this place out.  We really enjoyed it.  The food was very fresh and generous portion.  We both got bowls,  one salad and one rice.  Honestly,  I didn't taste the green tea in the rice but probably because of the yummy house sauce and Sriracha combo.  Definitely a go to place for future visits.
