Me and my husband went to Grimaldi's for for the first time on my husband's birthday. We chose Grimaldi's because we like New York style thin crust pizza and one of his friends recommended this restaurant. They didn't let us down! Not only did we enjoy the food, but the service and atmosphere were wonderful!  They greatly exceeded our expectations.
