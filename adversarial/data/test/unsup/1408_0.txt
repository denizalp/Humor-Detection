I have only done the take out buffet and I must say that the food is pretty good. I do pack my container until it is bursting at the seems but for $10 I want to make sure I get my money's worth. (Yes I am greedy but hey at last I can admit it) One of these days I will actually sit down and do the buffet but for now, take out buffet it is!
