Cute little candy store! I bought a Groupon and popped in here recently to see what I could spend it on... They have all kinds of candies priced by the pound (a bit high, but its fun to be able to just buy a few pcs and not have to buy and entire bag.) I didn't see much that I haven't seen before, but I did get some candies that I hadn't seen in years!  There are toys and games for kids... This would be a fun place for any kid, young or old!
