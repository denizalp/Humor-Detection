I can't say enough about this moving team! Extremely professional, on time, great communication!  \n\nThey packed my furniture (each piece) in a very sturdy material so that nothing was left to be scratched or dented.  \n\nVery positive experience all around!  I will definitely use them again and refer to friends and family.
