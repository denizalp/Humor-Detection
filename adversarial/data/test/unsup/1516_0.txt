If I could I would give bartender Brian c a five star review however, manager Jerry has strained the restaurants quality by not complying with guest requests as simple as splitting a plate nor has shown respect for his employee by degrading them in front of guests! With such a horrible experience I would only be back for Brian C! This place and the food was not worth the hassle nor embarrassing show!
