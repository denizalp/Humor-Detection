Macarren airport is actually pretty cool in my book as they tend to flow people through this airport with ease and in an expeditious manner. Flights to\/from Southern California are pretty much ever half hour and just about every airline flies into this airport. The food here is average, the delays are rather rare, the service isn't bad and there are freaking slot machines all throughout the airport! Can't beat that! Anywho, not a bad airport here in sin city, not bad at all... \n\nPros-\nOntime \nFlight options \nService\nQuick dining \nSlot machines \n\nCons-\nTSA \nFine dining \nRestrooms
