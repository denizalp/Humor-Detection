Another dog friendly lunch (quick bite) spot in town!!\nIt's never crowded here so if you are in rush and need to get some quick bite, this place is perfect for you.\nThe girl that was working here was super nice. Having a short conversation with her was fun. She made me a freshly brewed pomegranate iced tea. It was so refreshing. \nThey have full bar and gaming machines inside but I didn't smell any cigarette smoke here. (I think smoke free inside??)\nGotta love dog friendly eating places like this ;-)
