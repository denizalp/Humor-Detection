The only reason I've gone to the Fremont is for their drink specials, which I believe are $2 Coronas, Heinekens, margaritas, and shots of Jaeger.  Have out of town guests that don't really fancy Fremont East and their cocktail bars?  The Fremont Hotel is the place to go to get them filled up on cheap alcohol.  I've never stayed here or eaten here, and I doubt that I ever will.  The end.
