I had breakfast and coffee at the 7th Street Public Market on Sunday morning. If you're ever looking for a place to grab a healthy breakfast, try the Local Loaf! It was delicious. My omelet had spinach, tomato, peppers and onion. I love that you can build your own! I also had Not Just Coffee with my breakfast.
