This is a really neat place to have lunch. You place your order inside and then take a seat outside in the patio. It looks like a small Trader Joe's when you're inside with an antique feel to it. \n\nYou really can't go wrong with anything you order. Everything is fresh. The bread is amazing. The sandwiches are huge. The soup is full of flavor. \n\nWe found another new go-to-spot for lunch!
