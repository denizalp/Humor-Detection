This is one of those cheaper resorts that's owned by MGM. For the price that you pay, don't expect it to be like MGM Grand or Mandalay Bay. \n\nCheck-ins and check-outs were flawless, as with the rooms. \n\nThere's no WIFI at all in the rooms, which should have been included with the tedious daily resort fee. But you can walk-up to Krispy Kreme in the food court and use their free WIFI there. \n\nThe arcadium in the resort is horrible.\n\nAlso, the pool area can be a little better in terms of decor (ex: plant more palm trees?).
