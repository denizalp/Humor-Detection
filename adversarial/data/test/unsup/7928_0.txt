By far the best bar in Vegas. I have been coming here since I've been able to drink. The first thing I noticed was how nice the staff was compared to bars that I've been to before. They're fast with drinks. They always look out for you and they all have a good sense of humor.\nTheir prices are the cheapest I've ever seen. No one in Vegas is going to offer alcohol cheaper than here.\nAlso, their food is amazing. If you want a good burger or chicken fingers, this is the place.
