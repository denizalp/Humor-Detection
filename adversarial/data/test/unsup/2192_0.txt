Apparently if your over 30 years old and its past 11:00pm you get looked upon as if your not welcome.  Drinks were quiet good, but 1944 Mai Tai had to much simple syrup (sweetness). If you have a Groupon God help you - stink eye!  Our waitress, although easy on the eyes, was as standoffish as you can imagine.  A real bit**.  Fun music and atmosphere, but unless your young and spend money like your in congress, don't bother.
