I used to love this place, I came for the opening and once a week for yrs. \n\nI have a food allergy to certain kinds of meat and even when I order the vegetarian dishes I would have to go to the ER immediately. Twice this happened. When I tried to say something to the staff, they handled it quite badly.\n\nBecause of my work schedule I only eat once a day, so there's nothing else if could have been.\n\nThis is my second review, because my first one was DELETED.
