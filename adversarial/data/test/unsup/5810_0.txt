This Subway is just a few blocks from my house. It isn't much different than any other franchise. I had a coupon for a buy one get one free deal. When I got there I was the only one in line. Both girls working there assembled my sandwiches. I was in and out in less than 5 minutes. Jimmy John's isn't the only one who's freaky fast.
