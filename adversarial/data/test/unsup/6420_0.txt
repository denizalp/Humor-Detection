Personalized burro building with exceptionally fresh ingredients, grilled without a trace of grease plus the crispest tortilla chips ever And I wasn't shamed when I did not favor their hot sauces.  Think I'll try their tostadas next time.  PS  Burro is so generous, one lasts for 2 meals or could be shared with a friend.
