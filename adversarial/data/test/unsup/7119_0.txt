Came here with a group of 4, made reservations the day before and we we impressed beyond words! The food was fantastic and reasonably priced for fine dining and the service was top notch. My date and I ordered the 22oz bone in ribeye and the pan seared sea scallops with the twice baked potato side. It was all delicious! Highly recommend the scallops and the ribeye was very well done with a green chili and red chili sauce on the side
