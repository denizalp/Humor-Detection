Love flying on AA, but employees at baggage desk need some major PR training. On almost every flight they are trying to sell you on the Aviator card and it's benefits, but seems when it come to delivering AA employees at CLT baggage desk are too busy socializing amounts themselves to take a minute and actually take care of clients that need assistance. I'm sure not all are bad, but was simply my experience this time around
