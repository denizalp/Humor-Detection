Owner is completely rude and an asshole purchased an item that was the wrong item had it for less than 24 hours nowhere in the store does it state that I cannot return I was not even told this at the time of purchase as I never shop here because frankly there's way better comic stores in the valley. This is the worst shop I've ever been to the owner is a compete asshole and money hungry that he makes return\/exchange policies out of thin air. Do not shop here!
