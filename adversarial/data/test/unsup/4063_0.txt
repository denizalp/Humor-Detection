After hearing how many love Trader Joe's, I made a visit there this evening.  Although the parking was a little difficult, the shopping experience was good.  They have a lot of fresh and packaged foods to meet all different shoppers needs.  Having never been before, I was a little overwhelmed so definitely overbought, however, will say the prices were worth it.  I would say they have a lot to offer, but there are a few normal necessities that would not make this my daily shopping place. I look forward to trying the items I did purchase.
