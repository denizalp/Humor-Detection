The place has some very interesting pizzas!  The bartender\/server was very helpful. We were told we could do 2 halves of different pizzas if we couldn't decide what we wanted.    We had the mellowterian and red potatoe pizza.  \n\nPizza was very tasty. The red potatoe was better in my opinion.  But both very good. I'll be back to try some others. \n\nService was good!
