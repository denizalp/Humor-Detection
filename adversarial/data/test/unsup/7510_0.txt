Great shipment center, they have a very helpful and upbeat staff.\nI came in prepared to spend $40 on overnight shipping from NV to LA but the guy that helped me out was very helpful so much so that he suggested several different things to try to get me a good deal. First he checked if getting a bigger box would've lowered the cost (it didn't, but I still appreciated the suggestion) and then he suggested One-Day Ground Shipping which knocked my shipping from $40 to $10. Score!
