Dear Jimmy John's,\n\nI love you.  \n\nDon't take that lightly.  My heart means a lot.  No wait, where are you going?  Wait, hear me out, please?\n\nYou're from Illinois.  I'm from Illinois.  And yet?  Here we are, out for fun with friends in Vegas.  Who's to say what could happen.\n\nYour sandwiches are divine.  You keep your shop clean, and your staff is AMAZING.  You always leave me happy and fulfilled.\n\nThank you.\n\nPS - You should REALLY consider moving to California.  I could make it worth your while.
