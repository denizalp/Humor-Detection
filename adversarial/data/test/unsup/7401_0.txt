Stopped in here for Happy Hour after a shopping trip to Nordstrom , what a fun Happy Hour and the dishes were wonderful! we had the lobster and steak tartare and the chilled shrimp cocktail. Both of these appetizers were so yummy! The ambiance is dark and sexy, the back bar has a large ice display with lobster and King crab legs displayed . The bar was absolutely packed! We will definitely be back to try out this spot for dinner.
