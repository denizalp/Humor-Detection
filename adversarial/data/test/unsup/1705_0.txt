Classic corporate tex-mex.  What do I mean by that?  The chips and salsa are decent and bottomless.  They also have all of the regular mexican sounding menu items like chimichangas, enchiladas that no one really knows what they are except they have some sort of cheese and bean with them.  I had the fajita enchilidas which were decent.\n\nOur waitress struggled quite a bit with the order even though we only had three people in our party...  and two people were sharing one meal.  Not impressed with her but you don't go expecting nobel laureate waitresses I suppose.
