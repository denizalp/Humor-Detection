Totally hits the spot ! Got the sushi burrito with salmon and tuna -- and it was Delicious! The fish is high quality and the house sauce paired really good with all the ingredients. \n\nEveryone knows the most important thing at a poke place is the quality of the fish - and H2opoke hits it out of the park. The house sauce has a sweet mustard taste to it and it goes really nice with salmon . \nLooking for a solid poke-stop -- you found it !
