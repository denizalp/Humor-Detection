Worst place ever. Ordered about 40$ worth of food with my boyfriend. Wait time: 2 hours. Food? Specified NO CHEESE on one wrap as there was an allergy. It came with cheese so I could not eat my wrap at all. The rice was eh, the potatoes were inedible as they tasted like they were crusted in straight up salt, and the fries were cold and soggy. Worst waste of money ever. Ended up having to grab other food cause I couldn't my wrap or the other food. Wouldn't order if someone forced me to.
