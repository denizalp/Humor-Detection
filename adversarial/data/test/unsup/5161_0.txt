I had a small chicken shawarma platter and it was good but nothing comparable to the amount of hype received from the restaurant's grand opening. \n\nSince Halal guys is from NYC, I'm going to have to quote Jay Z to describe their presence: 'Grand Opening, Grand Closing\"...just kidding, it probably won't close but it'll remain one of the most overrated middle eastern restaurants in Toronto.
