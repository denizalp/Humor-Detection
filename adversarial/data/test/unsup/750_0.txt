Delicious food, warm and inviting restaurant with superb service.  Favorites so far: prosciutto barata appetizer and burned butter, butternut squash ravioli, both were so fabulous my average arugula salad with beets didn't matter.  The meal was nicely paced as well, neither rushed nor too slow, left us lingering just enough to enjoy the atmosphere and relax.  Will definitely be back soon!
