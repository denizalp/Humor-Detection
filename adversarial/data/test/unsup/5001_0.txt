I just tried to make a reservation for 15 people in March at 11 am on a Tuesday and was informed by a very rude female.  She said \"we do not take reservations\" and I asked if they would for 15 people and she said \" I told you we don't take reservations\" and hung up on me.  Is that the way you run a business?  Very poor customer service and I have no intentions of ever coming there or recommending it to my friends.
