Tried this place for the first time and got a burger fries and a coke. Thought it was gunna be great from all the hype but after I tried it. The burger was okay. Not great iv had better. And the fries were tossed in ALOT of seasoning!!!!! I mean that's all I tasted. The reason they get 2 stars is because the coke. I mean they couldn't mess that up right? Maybe I just got a bad order? Idk.\n\nAll in all I don't think I will go back and won't recommend this place to anyone.
