The food is amazing. \nI only have done pick up. I always walk to get it which is usually a ten minute walk. I typically leave shortly after getting off of the phone with them, and no matter how long they say it will be (15-20 minutes), it is always waiting for me.\nThe amount of food they give you lasts several meals. I cannot recommend enough the bang for your buck in quantity and quality.
