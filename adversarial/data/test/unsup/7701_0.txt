Sal, the owner, has a history of verbal abuse towards his employees and customers.  Recently, he threatened to throw my brother-in-law out on his face when he went in to pick up a cake that was previously paid for.  After the Chesterland Police were called, we finally settled for a refund of the purchase price.\n\nDo everyone a favor and take your business to any number of superior bakeries in Little Italy.  Heck, if you need to avoid the drive, head over to Giant Eagle.
