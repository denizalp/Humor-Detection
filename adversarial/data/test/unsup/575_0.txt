I've come here twice and they messed up both times. I speak Spanish fluently and the lady barber cutting my hair was talking negatively about me in Spanish to another barber because I thought about how high I wanted her to go on my fade. I answered her in Spanish and she was shocked lol. I can't see myself coming back.
