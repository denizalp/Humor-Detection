This isn't a roller coaster, it's an instant-headache machine, and an expensive one at that.\n\nThis is the jerkiest bumpiest roller coaster I've ever been on. \n\nI conked my head into the barely cushioned steel pads on either side and spent the rest of the ride trying (unsuccessfully) to prevent smacking my head again. \n\nWhile on the ride you can't see over the seat in front of you, and the ride itself isn't so much thrilling as painful.
