Uhhh, In-N-Out who? I loved this place! When it comes to burgers, I like mine to taste home-grilled and sloppy. The more ketchup, mustard, pickles and onions, the better. This place reminded me of my dad's burgers - they were delicious and juicy and oddly comforting. There were plenty of condiments so I could pack on the flavor and not to mention the fry sauce is to die for. I would take that over animal sauce any day. As a true burger lover, I definitely recommend this place.
