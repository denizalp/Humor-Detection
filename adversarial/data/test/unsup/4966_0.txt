My family hosted my mother's 90th birthday at this venue last weekend. Totally elegant facility with spectacular scenic view! Everyone is still talking about the party. Lori was awesome from beginning to end. Mark was absolutely the best on the day of the event. The entire staff made our family feel welcome and special! The food.....delicious! Tried to get the recipe for the best mashed potatoes I have ever tasted! Didn't succeed! Lol . Thank you Red Mountain for making this an extraordinary celebration; one we will never forget!
