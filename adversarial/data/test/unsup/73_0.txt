We eat here all the time. Atmosphere is relaxed and inviting. They have very good specials on the weekends and have an expanded beer menu. Plenty of Saki to choose from too! \nWhen we think of sushi this is the first place that comes to mind. It's always creative and fresh. Especially love the hamachi, izumi dai, and yazzy snazzy rolls.
