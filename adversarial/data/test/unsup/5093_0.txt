Candy  everywhere this place was amazing it had just about any candy you could imagine! I brought my mother & she was especially happy finding different candies from her youth. \nSweet sour sticky crunchy good bad you name it! They even had favored critters & chocolate covered scorpions  crazy  \nThe staff was extremely helpful even though the place was jam packed, can wait to return!
