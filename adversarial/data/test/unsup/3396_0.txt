There seems to be a lot of vietnamese places in the Phoenix area. I've tried more than 30.  This place is by far the tastiest.  It's not just the Pho but also the other items on the menu are equally tasty, I like the diversity on the menu and have taken out of town friends from New York and San Francisco to come here to eat and no one ever complains.
