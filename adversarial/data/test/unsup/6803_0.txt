This is the real deal.  Beyond amazing.  Went the the almond croissants, but left with so much more.  A slice of heaven.  Authentic and very charming little spot.  I will continue to go back over and over.  Breakfast, lunch and dessert.  The chocolate almond croissants are the best I have ever had.  I have been to France 4x and eaten a lot of them but none compares.  Such a treasure.
