This is located in the Excaliber hotel on the strip. The restaurant is large and great for parties. \n\nThe food is consistent with any other Buca. The service here is attentive and friendly, which is nice as I'm assuming there are rarely any regulars and mostly\/only tourist that come by, which I can imagine may be tiring. \n\nWe did order the garlic bread, but it had very little butter and garlic (read: slightly dry) which is the reason for the 3 stars. If i rated just the pasta and service, it'd be a 4!
