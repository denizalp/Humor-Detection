I rarely give anything five stars.  That being said. .. they've done some fabulous renovations here!  The driving range is two levels with credit card self serve for bucket fills or cash at the small pro shop.     The clubhouse is spacious with outdoor seating overlooking the driving range.   There is a bar & seating on the lower level as well.   \n\nThe menu is basic but delicious & well prepared.  The staff is friendly & welcoming.
