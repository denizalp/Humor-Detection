A crazy world of touristyness.  It is SUPER loud in here and really chaotic.  But, it was by the hotel and, if you get there early enough, it's not too hard to get a table.\n\nI had the eggs benedict and my friend had an omelette.  Her omelette was HUGE and filled to the brim.  My hollandaise sauce was cold, but the eggs were poached well and the potatoes were yummy.\n\nIt was hard to track down our waiter, as he seemed to be serving 20 tables at once.  But, when he was around, he was very nice.
