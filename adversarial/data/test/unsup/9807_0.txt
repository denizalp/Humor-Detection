The food is excellent and the prices are reasonable. My main point of contention is that on the about the third or fourth order the service began to slow down considerably. And the sixth order? Forget about it.\n\nThey are clearly exploiting the fact that as you let the dose digest you get fuller and it gets harder to exploit the \"ask you can eat\" nature of the establishment.\n\nVery disappointed. How am I supposed to reach my American Dream of weighing 400lbs under these conditions???
