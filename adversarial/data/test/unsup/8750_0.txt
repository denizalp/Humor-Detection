The venue itself is pretty nice. It's not gritty and slimy like some other places, clean and decent high ceiling. No crawling into a dungeon feel. \n\nBut nothing goes on here on Monday nights. Literally nothing. So we played with the photo machine out front. The cam is pretty crappy. Then we left. The end.
