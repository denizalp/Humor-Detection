My kiddos had a great time, it was a bit of a drive for us but we came to use our Pogo pass. Bouncy world did not disappoint. My kids had a blast and the snack bar had good variety and reasonable prices. The staff was so friendly and accommodating. The facility was clean and well kept. If it wasn't such a drive from our house we would come a lot more often ;)
