Poor customer service. When I told the owner I was checking into yelp and wanted the mani pedi special they had, he bashed Yelp for 15 minutes to another co worker. They both used bad language and cussed as if I was not there. It made me feel beruncomfortable. While giving me my manicure he texted, talked to a girl who worked there about what they were going to eat after, and then answered a phone call and put it on speaker phone while doing my manicure. Rude!  I couldn't believe it! NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN!  Save your $$
