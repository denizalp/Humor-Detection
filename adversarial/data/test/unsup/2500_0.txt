The photos of the food here always looks amazing, but a few things will keep me away.\n\nDinner with my family and friends was not as we had hoped. The server seemed miserable, the food was cold when it finally came, and the table beside us was complaining the entire time and when they asked for the manager.... they never came.  My suggestion is to head a few doors down to Eddie's, different atmosphere and food but way more worth your time.
