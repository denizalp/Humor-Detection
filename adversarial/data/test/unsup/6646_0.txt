I returned to La Veccia and everything was amazing!\n\nThe service, food and atmosphere were perfect! They added a second floor and it was less crowded than it usually is. They also added nice new bathrooms. \n\nI highly recommend the smoked chicken penne. \n\nI had the fish of the day, Chilean sea bass. It was well seasoned and delicious. \n\nI recommend la Veccia !
