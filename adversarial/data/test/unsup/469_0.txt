I called and left a detailed message for Blake about my inquiry for getting an estimate on blinds WITHIN glass for our French doors out to our backyard. He called me back that same day to inform me that he couldn't help me with this service, but gladly talked to me about it to let me know how easy it would be for us to do ourselves. He asked questions about my doors to give advice. Even though he was not able to help me, I appreciated the valuable information to help me out!
