This goodwill doesn't have daily color deals, which sucks. The customer service is awful, plus I constantly see employees arguing with their managers. It's a popular store so all the good stuff is usually taken fast. I recently saw a homeless man play a toy piano for a good 15 minutes while I shopped.
