We all know Arribas is sub-par Mexican food, but if you go in knowing this then you can't really complain, it's still reasonably tasty for a decent price. What I'm really reviewing here is this location, it has one of the best servers you could ask for, if go here ask to be seated in TJ'S section the \"diabetic Seth Rogan\" as he says, you will always have a beverage and anything else you might need, and you'll get a good laugh too.
