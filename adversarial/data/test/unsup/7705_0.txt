Tiny little Polish piece of heaven in Jean Talon market. They have a sign which reads \"Les Meilleures Beignes au Monde\" by which they mean, quite literally \"The Best Donuts in The World.\" Point finale. \n\n6 donuts, 3 cream, 3 apricot please, and thank you. Light, puffy, buttery, icing sugar coated and just the right size. They are not fracking around. Tucked around the corner of their stall inside the market you'll find a small stack of fresh homemade rye bread - sesame seed! pumpkin seed rye! Toasted lightly with some butter and cheese: to. die. for.
