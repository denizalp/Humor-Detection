Just had my daughters wedding there over the weekend. What a beautiful venue! Everything was included so it made things very easy...the food was delicious, the cake was beautiful, the flowers were gorgeous. The wedding day was perfect....Alicia our coordinator was there making sure everything was perfect. Whenever we needed anything she was right on it. The reception was in the big tent and it was decorated beautifully and the DJ was awesome! We looked at quite a few venues and for the money this was by far the best! Would highly recommend it!
