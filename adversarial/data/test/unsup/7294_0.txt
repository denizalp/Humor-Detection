Seriously...\nIs it sad that we ate here 3 times during a Vegas weekend.\nVegas - city full of different & delicious restaurants.\nWe couldn't help it. \nThis is the most convenient and semi-affordable place when you are staying at the Venetian suites.\nIt is always filled with people for good reason.\nAll their food is DELICIOUS. I haven't tried anything that disappointed me yet.\nGood and safe bet to satisfy your hunger.
