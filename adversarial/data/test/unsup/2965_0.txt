Though it's not considered a \"fancy\" buffet, this place has quality food and service. The staff is friendly and tries to ensure you are not in line too long. There is a good variety of food and I have to say the prime rib is delicious there that I actually went back for seconds. Definitely a reasonable priced buffet!
