This place was pretty decent, especially since there's several pho options within several miles of it. Had the standard pho with brisket and rare steak, it was good. Deep beef flavor in the broth, good size bowl full of everything pho should have. Summer (spring) rolls were mediocre, but acceptable. Large, clean dining room. Attentive, courteous staff and free Wi-Fi. Right around the corner from church, so I'm sure I'll go again and won't hesitate to recommend it to others. But overall nothing really that made it standout above the average pho spot.
