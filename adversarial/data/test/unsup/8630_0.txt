Kind of disappointed that we were charged for water.  I thought all customers are supposed to be disclosed of any additional charges.  I have never been charged for water at a Starbucks.  It was dirty, tables with drinks on them left by lazy customers.  Their wi-fi was not working at all.  Just disappointing.  Too many employees behind the back counter.
