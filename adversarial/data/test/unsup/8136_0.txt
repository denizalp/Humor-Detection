The other day was the first time trying out this new restaurant, that replaced the coffee\/pastry shop. \n\nOwner is very welcoming and her sushi is delicious.  Much better than other sushi restaurants around the city.  \n\nI tried the Eel and Vegetable Roll as well as the Crunchy Crap Roll - so good!!  Definitely recommend the Eel or Crunchy Crab... Never been a fan of Vegetable Sushi.  The Shrimp Tempura Bowl is delish as well.  So is their Vanilla Latte - will be trying the Americano next time!!\n\nEnjoy Sushi Cafe - thank you for you yummy food and coffee.
