The portions here are better than in California. I've been. Noticing CB cutting back on their portions in Cali, and it's not like we eat any less! Anyways, got the Anaheim Scrambler and Commuter Croissant with a small coffee. Good coffee as always. The Anaheim scrambler was solid, lots of avocado and bacon bits. Commuter croissant had 2 large bacon strips with cheddar cheese, scrambled eggs, and tomatoes in a croissant. Both were great, and he service was excellent. Friendly staff, and they seem to know most guest by name. Great place!
