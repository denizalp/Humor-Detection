Came here for a wedding and it was breath taking.  Wedding ceremony on held on the one of the driving areas that overlook the golf course and into the city.  The sunset was just beautiful.  The clubhouse has amazing and relaxing environment.  We had drinks on the patio (great for photos).  Had heater lamps so we ate on the other side of the patio.  The food was pretty good.  Steaks, chicken, and fish.  Tons of sides and bread.  Service was top notch (bar, servers, etc.).  \n\n+++Rabbits & family of deer spotted in the background!
