Great shopping experience! The woman at the front was nice, and very knowledgeable. She answered all of my questions. They have good products at great prices. It's nice to have stuff there, instead of paying for shipping and stalking your mailbox! Would definitely recommend. I would call ahead before coming in, just to make sure they're open though.
