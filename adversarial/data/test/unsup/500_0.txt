Somewhere between Harris Teeter (Kroger) and Whole Foods.\n\nWith an emphasis on Fresh, non-GMO and Gluten Free, it's a nice place to shop. Not as big as a conventional Grocery, every item displayed has been chosen with care.\n\nMy wife is in here at least once a week because she loves the Fresh Ground Amaretto Coffee. Bakery, Cheese Dept and Deli are also great. \n\nToday we picked up more coffee and Filet Mignon Shisk Kabob's to put on the grill which is Memorial Day.\n\nAlways friendly staff and while small, still a great selection of premium items.
