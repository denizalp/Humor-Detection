This is probably the worst place you want to go to if you want to have genuine fun. The staff is rude, they charge you extra and the whole trip is a sham job if they 'promise' you a trip back in the limo\/ party bus back to your hotel. Over all super bad experience. Don't ruin your night with this place on your agenda!!!! Seriously!!!\nThis is the name and information of the person who gave us a deal and then never fulfilled it: Tony from Treasures.
