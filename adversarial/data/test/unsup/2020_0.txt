This place is ah ma zing!!!! I've never had a better eyebrow thread. Mercy was so wonderful. I've been here twice but will only be back for her. She spent so much time reshaping my brows and she actually pulled out a pair of tweezers to finalize the shape. \n\nI always wish threaders would do this...because there are some hairs that just need a tweezer. \n\nShe sat me up and looked at my shape that way which no one has ever done before. \n\nCome here and ask for her! You won't be disappointed!
