I used to come here. They got to the point where the kiask people are nearly running after you to talk to me and my family. Called management ? They don't care in the least. I'll never go shopping here again. Shame. I have to look the other way and act like I didnt heat the guys screaming at me across the room to buy a phone. Not awful at all. Yea. It's awful. It's worse in north Olmsted than anywhere. Losing business
