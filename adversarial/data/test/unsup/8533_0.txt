I learned earlier tonight that Las Vegas is the most gross and disgusting city in the whole U.S. Some of the people are gross. They're also super drunk. It's too crowded. I saw at least 1 person that looked suspicious on every block. It smells dirty. They have strippers at just about every corner. If you were considering going to Las Vegas, DON'T GO! I will never be back!
