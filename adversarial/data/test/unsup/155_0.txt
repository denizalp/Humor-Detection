I do not often go out to Coffee, but at times you just need to. In the Summer I only drink it in the morning.  Even then it makes me too hot.\nSo I thought I would give a nice iced coffee a try since it was mid day. I like these things sweet. so I love that Starbucks had raw Sugar. \nI like heavy cream and Raw Sugar, so that is what I like and they have it!\nFriendly staff, nice clean place.
