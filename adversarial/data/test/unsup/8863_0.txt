FUCKING FINALLY!\n\nBeen to plenty of CPs around the valley and this one is distinguishable only by its decidedly downtown vibe. But what really sets this place apart is the truly inspired tap list: Gulden Draak? 1664? Bacchus? Fullers ESB??? YES PLEASE.\n\nFactor in Lou Reed blaring on the stereo upon walking in and this afternoon just went from 6 to midnight
