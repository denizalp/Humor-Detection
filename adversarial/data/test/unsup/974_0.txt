Had a horrible and exhausting experience with this company. Contract said it would take 10 days to complete- took 30 days and many, many phone calls to get workers to return to job site. I finally took $100 off my bill for each day NO ONE was showing up to do job. Too many excuses on why they couldn't. Patio looks great after 30 day job but they didn't mark on patio where the electrical wires are for ceiling fans. Very unprofessional and didn't care about customer service. Never use this lame company!!!
