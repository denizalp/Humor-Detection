I respect what the folks in uniform do for the community and oftentimes it goes without any gratitude from us.  The Highway Patrol have to deal with accidents and people who are pissed off about getting a ticket.....in other words, there's no real upside to this job, unless you really enjoy serving the community.  I appreciate them keeping our highways safe!\n\nKudos to the Men & Women in Blue, this review is for you!\n\nPS - Only 4 Stars because of all of the tickets you gave me.....I know, I deserved it.  :)
