I count a \"mini\" size as 68 calories, no matter how much the teen attendants choose to overfill my Styrofoam cup. They give me enough yogurt to fill a \"small\" size, which ought to be 136 calories, but, in my book, I still record 68. Golden Spoon has always fulfilled my cravings to cheat my own unrealistic diet plans.\n\nI wish Golden Spoon would use paper cups and recycle. They could also shut off the fans and stop using so much AC.
