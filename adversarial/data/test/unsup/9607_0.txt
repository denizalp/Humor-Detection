Decent sized venue. I like that they allow you to go outside to take a breather. It gets crammed in there sometimes. Monarch theatre didn't let me go outside so I was suffocating inside the whole time. However, wherever you are in the venue, the music system is great and the view is great wherever you are.\n\nI like the event last night, but I did not check in for my free drink yet. I have to come back and do that..
