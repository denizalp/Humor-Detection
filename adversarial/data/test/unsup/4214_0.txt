They were killing it with sales but opened up Bismillah Sweets near heartland. Seems like they have opened up the second location to heartland to bank on it. Well more choices the better or the consumer. \n\nThey carry both the veg and non veg samosas. The samosas are nice, crispy, crunchy and have a nice kick to it. They also sell various sweets\/ Methae, Namak para (Namak para is a crunchy savoury snack of Pakistan) and Pakoras. All goodness!!!\n\nFor my Muslim folks - the non veg samosas are halal
