We went to Main Street for lunch and the pizza was only ok.  The dough was not crispy, a little undone in the middle and the pie is only 16 inches round.  As we search for the best NY style pizza it has to be 18 inches round in order to have the big slices that remind us of the back home style.\n\nDoc
