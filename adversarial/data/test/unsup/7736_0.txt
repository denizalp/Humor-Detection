Food is so good, I get their Ahi Protein Salad every time I go in. The atmosphere is clear and open. It is always busy which is a good sign. The staff is friendly and quick to get your food out to you. The meal itself is always filling. The food is a little pricey though which is fine it just means I can't eat there every day, but over all highly recommend.
