I had the worst experience here!  Customer service goes out the door the second they get your money. Don't shop here!  I have regretted buying my mattress from them. If you have a problem good luck getting it resolved. \n\nIt's now a month later and I can return this mattress. But wait, I can't because they are doing inventory and it might be a couple of days before they can help me. What?!!?  Are you kidding me? I can't wait to hear the next excuse!
