3rd time here   The previous 2 were a lot better.  Ordered theportugeuese sausage and pancakes.  The eggs I ordered had a hair in it.  The orange slice in the side seemed like it was a sun dried orange.  Side of rice ordered was barely a spoonful.  Server forgot my request and I had to walk back and ask again.  I've been here before and it was great then but now not so good.
