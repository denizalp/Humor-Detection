I found this place when I was in Vegas. A Realtor took me there and would hav kept going back for two meals a day. It's kinda like a cafeteria style where you go down the line with a tray and pay at the end. Seating is comfy and decent atmosphere for a chain Chinese joint. But the food was different and seemed to take a lot of spins on my fav Chinese dish, General Tso's chicken. Love this place
