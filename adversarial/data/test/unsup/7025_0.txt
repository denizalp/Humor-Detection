This place sucks if you want to look at rifles\/pistols. It seems that they lack in customer service. I was there with my son and the 2 guys who were working there didn't even acknowledge us or the other customers behind us. I stood there for 15 minutes waiting to see a rifle, still no service. I understand that you are helping out with 2 customers buying a rifle, but at least look up and acknowledge other customers. Just tell them \"we'll be right with you\" and not ignore them. Busy or not, customers should come first.
