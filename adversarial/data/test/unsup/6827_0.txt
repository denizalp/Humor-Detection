I doubt I can add anything substantial to a VTR review that hasn't been already mentioned several times previous.  It seems that all the CLE yelpers have to write one and I'm drinking the kool-aid today!\n\nSave up your paycheck and come have a couple of drinks.  And while you're at it, stare in awe at the mixology belles behind the bar....they put the \"Shake Weight\" models to shame  ;o)\n\nSeriously, just go already....and say hi to Paulius, one of the most dapper guys I've ever met!
