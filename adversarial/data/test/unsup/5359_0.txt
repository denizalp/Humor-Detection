I'm a fan of the show, so obviously when im in Vegas I'll drop in. I just ran into Cory ( Ricks dick of a son, at the Vegas bike rally). He forgets us fans made his a$$ famous! What a s.o.b. Lame ex  crackhead turned heffa!! LOOZAH! He needs a mean attitude adjustment! Anywho, the shop is small.. Cool stuff, meh staff.. You'll only see the stars of the show when they film.
