Here's real Japanese world. Rice is very great quality, I mean great balance, there may be some peoples are feeling that is dry, but the hardness of the rice in matching with a pork cutlet.\nInside is very clean, friendly.  If they can make little bit more juicy pork cutlet( and thick pork), I will love it more.
