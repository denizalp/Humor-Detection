First time visiting this store today. Up until now, I've generally gone to the Trader Joe's in Highland Creek. This one is much bigger and has a very pleasant decor.\n\nThe selection is very good considering that Trader Joe's does not carry as many items as the big box grocery stores. The quality of the produce was excellent and a good selection of packaged goods.\n\nWhat struck me most was the staff. Very helpful and friendly. You could tell they enjoy coming to work and it showed.\n\nIt was a pleasure shopping here and we will be back.
