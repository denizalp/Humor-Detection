My wife *loves* the peach cobbler milkshake and so when we were in this part of town and hungry, we hit their drive through. Not much of a wait at 3:00 PM, so we were immediately able to place our order (there are two lines, folks!) and pull around. The shake was deemed excellent with enough peach and cobbler in it to pass inspection.
