I ordered a Caesar salad that was not a Caesar salad. Didn't even have croutons or Caesar dressing. The pizza was awful crust soggy. The service was awful. We witnessed other ppl sending their food back. I order appetizer that never came after 30mins. I just cancelled. I will not eve be back. This place sucks.
