We always try to bring out of town guests here for lunch. The drive to Cave Creek up Scottsdale Road out of Phoenix\/Scottsdale is outstanding. You pass through the Boulders in Carefree and on into Cave Creek, which has a western feel. El Encanto is one of the coolest restaurants in the Metro Phoenix area as far as ambience.  ( See the Yelp photos! )\n\nEl Encantos' food is very good Mexican fare too. They have reeally cold beer on draft and Margaritas. This is a great place to bring folks of all ages.
