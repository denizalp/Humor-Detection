I loathe the thought of even having to head in the general direction of this place.  The parking lot is super tight and every single damn time I have been this place it is busy as Hell!  With that said Smith's seems capable of handling the hordes that assault the premises.\n\nPrices seem expensive to me, regardless of a Smith's card (numbs the price a little),\n\nHuge store with lot's to offer but so does the Costco, Sam's Club, Target, smaller specialty shops which are in the immediate area.\n\nI only visit when I am truly hard up.
