I do not drink a lot of coffee any more.  My friend Arlin B recommended this place and it is next door to the post office where I drop my Netflix rentals.  No matter when you go in the staff is very friendly and the place just smells good.  While I have had Kona coffees I prefer (notably of late at Hulas) I have chosen the Molokai blend here as my favorite.
