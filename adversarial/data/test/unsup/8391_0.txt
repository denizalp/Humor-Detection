I love consignment boutiques with well made clothes and accessories. Fifi's provides fine merchandise of various styles for different ages.\n\nPROS: A lot of various brands to choose from for all ages\n             Nice customer service\n             Unique and stylish dressing rooms with plush chairs nearby\n             Stylish displays\n\nCONS: Items I wanted were around $100- $400. If I was going to plop that much money down for an item, I want it to be brand new.
