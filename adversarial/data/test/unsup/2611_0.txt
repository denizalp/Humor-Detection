Growing up in the west coast, I was deprived of White Castle. And of course after watching Harold & Kumar, I was ecstatic to find a White Castle in Cleveland! Harold & Kumar must've been way too high to have good judgements on burgers because White Castle is quite bland and nasty. If you're like me and have never had White Castle before moving more east, I don't recommend trying it! It's better if you saved your money for some Mickey D's!
