We had a great experience purchasing a new sectional couch, ottoman, accent chairs and tv console. It took us to trips to the store to decide what we wanted. Once we decided what we wanted we picked out the fabric and made the order. 3 weeks later everything arrived and my wife couldn't be happier. Great experience!
