And friendly staffers to help find what you're looking for!\n\nThey've obviously got the new\/used books, but then they've got everything from windchimes to hand-held pig catapults! After hours of reading, who wouldn't want to launch some pigs from a catapult? You've really got to see it for yourself, but this place has some cool stuff! \n\nBut remember to bring in your used books for store credit.
