I don't get it. \n\nThey did well on the campus of KSU because, well, poor college students have no choice. And no taste. \n\nTheir guacamole is perhaps the worst I've ever had. It should really be called something else. Guaca... pukey?\n\nI feel a bit bad being so smug-uppity but there are several more options for tacos y burritos in Lakewood that blow this place away. \n\nService is super friendly and stuff but still, not good unless you're accustomed to T Bell.
