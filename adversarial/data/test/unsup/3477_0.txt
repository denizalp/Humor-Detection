Bummer that Trader Joe's doesn't carry a few of my favorites anymore, like Truffle Oil, Combat Juice, and Escargot in Brioche, but I found new favorites!\n\nThe Kale Chips, Plantain Chips, and Dried Green Mango are soooo ADDICTING!\nThank goodness its my weekend, because I need to swing by and grab a few more bags! Love Love Love Trader Joe's!....ALOHA!!!!\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(35\/100) \"Gotta Get Some Green Mango!\"
