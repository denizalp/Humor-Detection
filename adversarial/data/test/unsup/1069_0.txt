We came to check it out expecting something moderately priced with good options. We got over priced, low quality ribs, and a vegetable dish I could've made at home for $1.99 ...and this was after staring at a menu for ten minutes that certainly needed more food choices on the other side instead of an (ahem) overpriced wine list. The bookstore\/bar next door is great. Skip the restaurant and fill up on brownies and stouts instead. Oh, and it's loud. Super loud. Loud as balls.
