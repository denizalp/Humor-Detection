After 4 hours of cleaning by 3 gals, I was absolutely shocked at how dirty the house still was.  They had absolutely no attention to detail and apparently weren't able to look upwards.  One gal spent 45 minutes cleaning a brand new refrigerator but failed to even wipe down the outside of it, another spent 30 minutes cleaning a new self-clean oven.  I had to hire another cleaner to actually clean up the mess that this crew left behind.   \n\nWould I recommend them?  Hell no.
