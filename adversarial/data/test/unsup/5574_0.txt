I've had several take-outs including pizza, lasagna and wedding soup.  They're all beyond superlative.  My only criticism is the salad; the very, banal, ubiquitous iceberg and carrot premix.  And although they add some veggies like cucumber and tomato, it's not nearly enough compensation.  No restaurant the really prides itself on their menu (like Peppers!) should ever use iceberg.  They might give some thought to upgrading the salad to match the quality of the main meal.  Used mixed greens, greens and spinach, or sweet butter.
