We ate there this afternoon December 8, 2015 I highly recommend the jambalaya with shrimp the fried pickles are very salty they feature a fried chicken with sweet potato waffles are Belgian waffles with shavings of sweet potatoes little disappointing overall I would rate it 3 1\/2 stars was very clean but noisy for an afternoon lunch
