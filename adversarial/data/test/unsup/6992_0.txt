Worst experience .. lines everywhere even during week days. To pick up another pair of keys or get parking enabled on the account, it takes half hour. They simply don't put any people at customer service. All the personnel are at the show tickets counter and new check ins... that's where they make money... for customer service ... none... after standing in line for 10 minutes someone comes and another 20 mins before it's my turn ... all this for a parking pass. I'm missing out on the other stuff i have to do....
