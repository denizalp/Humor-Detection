The Edgewater has done a lovely job of creating a glorified concession stand with very junior staff who aren't sure what beers are on tap, hilarious bar prices and poor ventilation. You'll leave with a lighter wallet, fry oil scented clothes and a dull pain from allowing yourself to get swindled by a boy scout.
