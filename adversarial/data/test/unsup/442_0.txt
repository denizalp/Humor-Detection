Wow - I really love this new place!  We stopped in yesterday during brunch and had a great experience.  We snagged a corner table on the pet friendly patio and had a great \"family\" lunch.  I enjoyed a strawberry bellini - man, I could drink way too many of these amazing concoctions!  For our main meal, my hubby thoroughly enjoyed his carbonara and I thoroughly enjoyed my side sampler of cauliflower grits, spaghetti squash, broccolini, and creamed spinach...absolutely perfect!  Great atmosphere inside and out, great food and great service too!
