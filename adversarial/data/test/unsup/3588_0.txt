I went to this store to buy a shoji lamp.  Upon arrival I looked around the store and didn't see any lamps, so I asked the woman behind the counter where they were.  She said she doesn't carry them anymore and when I said I had checked the web site first and made the trip all the way to her store for a lamp she said \"Yeah.... my web site is really old. Sorry\".   Web sites are supposed to SAVE people time, not waste it.   Not keeping your web site up to date is BAD BUSINESS.
