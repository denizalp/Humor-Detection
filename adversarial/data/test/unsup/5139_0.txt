Rushed over there on our last night in vegas (bumbai her mom rage bcuz we never get her chosen omiyage!) So we got there and was closed! Luckily uncle was still finishing up his inventory in the store and saw our shocked\/grueling faces through the window lol. He was so kind and let us in to get our dried fruits, chocolate chip cookie chips, special leup chong, and a bunch of other goodies.  After adding it up on the handheld calculator, we departed with two big bags and everyone in kindred spirits :D
