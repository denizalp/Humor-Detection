One of the most anticipated food stores in this area did not disappoint. The variety of fresh, cooked and packaged foods is astounding. The presentation of the merchandise is impeccable, and the entire store is spacious, well-lit, and very well organized. It's a great food shopping experience, enchanced by the presence an in-house casual bar\/restaurant (Twenty Highland Tavern) and a coffee and espresso bar.
