Had the 3 eggs breakfast and bacon, and I had to get the zucchini fries that I saw all over Yelp. Well the portion was HUGE!! Both eggs and bacon platter and the zucchini. I went through the drive thru, pretty fast. Total price came out to be $13.17 but there was so much food that I had enough for lunch and dinner.
