The food quality has gone way down at Gordon Biersch.  I ordered steak tacos, and got dry corn tortillas with tasteless cabbage and carrots and one little dry sliver of overcooked meat that was supposed to be steak.  \nMy husband ordered a veggie burger that he renamed a mush burger.  The food was horrible.  And the restrooms were filthy.  We won't be back.  There are too many good restaurants in this valley to put up with such poor food quality.
