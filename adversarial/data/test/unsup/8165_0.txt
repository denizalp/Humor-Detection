Rude! Rude! Rude! When I walked in the older woman that was working there saw me but still walked to the back. I asked if they took debit cards she says \"yeah\" than proceeded to snatch the card out of my hand. When I got my card back she says \"what's wrong with you today, you crabby or something\" told her I would be writing a review on yelp and her tune changed saying \"I didn't even do anything\" I can spend money elsewhere with better food and service. Too many options in CLEVELAND.
