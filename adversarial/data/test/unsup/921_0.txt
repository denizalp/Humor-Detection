Fresh, Fast, Friendly\n\nThe food is great and always fresh. The service is fast. The staff is friendly. What's more is the prices are very reasonable and the place has been recently renovated. And you'll always get complementary crunchy soup, miso soup, fresh salad, and sometimes even a scoop of ice cream at the end.  Bottom line, I highly recommend this place.
