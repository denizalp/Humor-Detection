Second visit to Abe's last night - even better than the first!  One corned beef on rye and one center cut tongue on rye - two cups of delicious cabbage soup.  Lots of sour and half-sour pickles.  Everything was perfect!!  Much better than Chompies ever thought about being.  Took home a quater pound of lox - all hand sliced perfectly.  Abe's is really the best in the Phoenix area.
