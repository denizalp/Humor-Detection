Nice thrift shop that is very well organized, clean and bright. It looks more like a lower end department store rather than a thrift shop. If you are looking for actual vintage, Deseret for some reason has a lot more real vintage than other places that have mostly clothes from a few seasons back.\n\nThe staff is always eager to help, and the best part, there's no sales tax!
