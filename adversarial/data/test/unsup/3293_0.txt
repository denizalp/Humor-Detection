As someone from central ohio where there are no beaches I loved this place! It's dirty (cigarette buttes in the water),but has nice piers and you can sit and enjoy watching seagulls or the bizarre people arguing over how to spell \"Funyun\". Seriously,the funyun arguement actually happened and it was at Huntington Beach. That alone should get this place 4 stars.
