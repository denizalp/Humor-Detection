I've been here a few times for brunch and really enjoyed it.  It's a cosy restaurant, probably best for small groups\/pairs.  The food is fantastic (I recommend the huevos rancheros) and very vegetarian friendly.  The servers have been great, I never had to wait long for a coffee refill.  Highly recommend
