Atmosphere was great. There was a hiccup with our reservation that they kindly credited us for, they sat us 30 mins after our scheduled time. There was games and activities that you need to be on a list for. If you plan on being there a long time, no issue. The food was average. Pub burger was $13, steak tacos $17. You are paying more for the atmosphere than the food. The service was great though and everyone was friendly. They gave us complimentary apps for our delay, which we appreciated.
