Should you ever find yourself in need of a vintage french military jacket, a deviled egg platter, a pair of PF Flyers and a quick spar in the boxing ring, all with a side of delicious meatball sliders and a gimlet, The Duce has you covered.  \nLove it.  Love that it's close to work.  My new fave! :)
