Have been searching for a new PCP for a few years and am pleased with my choice. Dr Fala spent a considerable amount of time taking a H & P, really learning a lot about my medical conditions, etc. I like him and feel comfortable in his care. And Rickey his nurse is amazing as well. Give them a try.
