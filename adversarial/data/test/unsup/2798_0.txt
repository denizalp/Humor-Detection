I've tried a total of five times to enjoy brooks and I just can't. There is far better chili cheese burgers in the city. This place gets a lot of hype and has a loyal following to each there own but I just don't get it. The chili isn't amazing the burger was tough and 3\/5 times I've come they are out of fries or bacon I personally think the diamond right around the corner has a all around better burger
