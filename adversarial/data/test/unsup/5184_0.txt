What keeps me coming back....My mortgage payment!  Actually Im starting to like wells fargo again because they have 3 tellers instead of just the 1 teller at most banks.  Since I've started going back here on a regular basis I havent been pressured into opening up another account.  The have saturday hours from 9 to 4 which definetly is a plus.
