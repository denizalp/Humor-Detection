Ordered delivery from this place about an hour ago. It just arrived and when we opened the pizza box it was someone else's half eaten pizza! So disgusted and can't understand how this kind of mistake happens.... Called back and they said they would remake and send our pizza out but the damage is done. \nWon't be going back to a place that can't even take the time to open a pizza box and make sure it's the correct order.
