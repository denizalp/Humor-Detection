This doctor is one of the worst psych doctors ever. I came in and told him about my past with trauma and I have ptsd and extreme social anxiety, depression and everything else because I've been assaulted. So I told him xanax is the only thing that works. He refused and prescribed me 4 different meds, 3 ssri  and beta blocker for blood pressure. I ended up going to urgent care for my xanax and the meds that okeke prescribed made me suicidal. I hope he rots in hell and loses his license.
