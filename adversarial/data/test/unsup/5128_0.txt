Had to wait quite a bit, but Dr. Reddy was great. So far so good.\n\nDr Reddy made me feel comfortable and spent more than the normal time with me. He really listened to what I was telling him about my past history and explained his recommendations in an easy to understand manor. I left feeling very confident that Dr. Reddy is a great doctor. \n\nI'm to return in two months, so I'll keep you posted. \nOffice staff also seemed nice.
