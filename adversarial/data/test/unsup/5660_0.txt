Okay, I KNOW I'm writing a review for a fast food place but COME ON, it's Sonic. First of all, it's right across from Palms and open 24 hours. Dangerous and amazing. Secondly, their drinks are perfect for mixing in alcohol because they're essentially just club soda and syrup. My personal favorite is diet cherry limeade with vodka. Get the Route 66 size, add some vodka, get some tater tots and do it Vegas style, my friends.
