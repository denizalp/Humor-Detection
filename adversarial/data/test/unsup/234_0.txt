In my previous review I mentioned that I thought the host\/waiter was the owner and he is not. I am giving this place another star because the actual owner took the time to reply to me on yelp, with a response that seems like they're truly interested in their customers feedback and cares about its business' reputation. I will definitely be back to help support this business.
