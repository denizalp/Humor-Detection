Most of the food here is mediocre, not bad but not great either. However, this place is very convenient if you're craving for Thai food while hanging out on Fremont Street. Their lunch special items are very CHEAP, $5.95 and it comes with a cup of soup and fried rice. My favorite dish from this restaurant has always been the beef noddle soup. It's not a great noodle soup, but when it's cold and there's no other places nearby (chinatown is 15 drive away) that has asian noodle soup, this place will definitely do.
