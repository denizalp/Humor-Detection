Taken Ã¼ber plenty of times and always happy and satisfied.  Even impressed about their growth and branding.  However, once you get taken financially advantage of the taste has turned sour.  Took a five minute ride down the street and was charged $70.  I get the surge but $70 for five minutes.  A 30 minute ride would've been a car payment.  Reached out to Uber and spoke with two different representatives and they stood behind this robbery.  Horrible follow-up.  My first bad Yelp review.  I could not let this settle until alerting future riders.  Not good business.
