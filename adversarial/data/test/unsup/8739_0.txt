Been here a couple of times so far. Each time the service has been great and the food great as well. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich both times but their coleslaw is a bit strange as I'm not accustomed to a mustard based slaw. My husband ordered the Brunswick stew both times and its very good. Their sweet tea is pretty awesome too. The banana pudding is pretty darn good too. Oh and they seat you immediately even when the place is packed. Basically you can't go wrong with Bill Spoons....
