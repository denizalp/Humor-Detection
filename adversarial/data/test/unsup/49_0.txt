I wish this place was closer!  It's a lot of fun on Friday, and Saturday nights.  We usually show up around 10pm, and it's pretty packed.  Darby O'Gill (fun Irish band) plays both nights, and the drinks are cheap. If I remember correctly it's around 3, or 3.50 for a pint.  \nThe atmosphere is nice. Dim lighting, plenty of seats.  There's also beer pong, but I'm not a fan of ANY kind of dirty balls in my beer.
