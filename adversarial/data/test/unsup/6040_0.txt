Sometimes you can find a rare gem here, but I noticed that the selection doesn't change often. I have seen the same pair of Nike sneakers here for about 3 years. Lol. When u do find something, its a good deal and they are always offering coupons. Its basically a hit or miss. Its worth coming here once and a while to take a look. That do have really good prices on socks though.
