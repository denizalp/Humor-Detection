Mr. Lube sure does get er done. I had to hit the highway to Fernie for a day of epic pow riding and had my truck screaming for a service. Called Honda and learned there was no chance of a service any time soon plus the service was $400. \n$62 and 30 minutes later my ride was purring like a kitten and all was good in my world!\n\nMr Lube you rule.
