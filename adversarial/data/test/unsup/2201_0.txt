Beautiful space, great for lunch, but would love to return in the evening. The food is pretty good - pricier than its worth but expected for Vegas. I would definitely return for a brunch or a romantic evening dinner some time.\n\nAlso would be great to sit outside! Lots of reasons to return and try it again :)
