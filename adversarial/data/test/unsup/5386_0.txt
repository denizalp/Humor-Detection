First off if you carry...Peter Piper Pizza does not believe in our 2nd Amendment Rights. Therefore we shall never return. \n\nThat said we arrived at 105 to a completely empty bufett that took untill 130 to get caught back up. Pizza is good overall. Not the best or worst bufett.  Middle of the road. Cheap food almost fast.
