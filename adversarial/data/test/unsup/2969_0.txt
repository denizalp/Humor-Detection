What a ripoff! For just connecting bbq grill to a gas stub is worth $300+. We already bought our conversion kit and we have a stub so why $300+?. And it's a brand new house so nothing to fix. Some companies they only charge $65-$80. We just chose this company because of the \"$30 for $75service deal.\" If not for safety, I would just install it myself! Just a waste of time!!!
