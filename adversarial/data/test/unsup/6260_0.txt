Dropped in for happy hour. Nice looking bar and patio area. I sat at the bar and ordered a brazilian passionfruit cocktail which was made with sugar rum. Very tasty!\nI had a bowl of lobster bisque for $3.50 and followed that with chicken stroganoff which was well prepared in a creamy buttery sauce. $8. Really good food, good service, and overall a nice place. Will return here again.
