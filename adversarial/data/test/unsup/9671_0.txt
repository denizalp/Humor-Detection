I purchased a groupon for three eyebrow threading's and when I went to use the groupon I was informed I couldn't because I wasn't a first time customer!  The last time I used my first of three groupons the lady said it was ok and now this time it was a problem. I told them I already paid for the groupon and the owner says verbatim \"I DON'T CARE, I WILL NOT ACCEPT IT AND CALL AND GET A REFUND!\"  I have contacted groupon and informed them of how their merchants are treating their customers.
