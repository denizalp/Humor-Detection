Super cute inside - definitely nicely an updated appearance since my last visit a few years ago. Friendly, almost overzealous service and tasty classic breakfast. \n\nWe had veggie omelette (huge, lots of fresh veggies) with the classic stringy fried hash browns, and the hot cocoa and hot tea were nice, too. We'll definitely be back!
