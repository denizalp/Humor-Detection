Ok I'm glad this calm sexy little place exists, and everything I said before remains true plus the rolls are delicious. But I have to say this: I get that on a quiet night the staff might use the tv above the bar to watch a movie, but glancing up in time to watch an astronaut vomit, then dig through that vomit and pull out a bloody tooth, was pretty unappetizing...
