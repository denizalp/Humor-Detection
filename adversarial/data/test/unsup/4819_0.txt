My friends and I stopped at the buffet for dinner and instantly regretted it. The pork chops tasted like leather, the fish was awful, the pasta sauce was bland, and even the pineapple slices were inedible. How do you screw up pineapples?! Even the desserts were no good. We all made a b line to our hotel down the street for the emergency bathroom trip. I highly recommend this buffet for my enemies.
