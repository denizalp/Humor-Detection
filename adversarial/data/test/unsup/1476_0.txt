Tried first time today, certainly a joke not a restaurant, ordered tagine which was not fresh at least 2 days old starting to go sour with a single piece of meat and lamb which was over cooked:\n\nI didn't like the place at all, poor food quality , small portions and high price. Unhappy and will not come back
