Wife has been waiting 2 months for this appt. and now the laser is broken.  She has been fasting for 24 hours!  \n\nThey are now saying they aren't sure when the machine will be fix or if it will be fixed today.  Lots of pissed of people in the waiting room.  The snippy little receptionist is telling people to continue to not eat any food.  \n\nWife is feed up with this place - cancelled her appointment and is demanding her $3000 up front money back!
