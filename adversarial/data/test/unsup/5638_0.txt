I have been enjoying the massages with hot rocks and great service for over a year now and yes, I'm a fan. My last visit I tried a gel manicure and now I'm a convert. The manicure I received 9 days ago, still looks pristine, shiny. The application process is more involved and takes a little longer that the standard manicure but for only 10 dollars more - it is so worth it.
