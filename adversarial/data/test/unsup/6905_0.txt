Ordered in using Postmates and was excited to get some yummy southern cooking. I was sadly disappointed. Mostly flavorless except for the salt. I had chicken andouille and smoke chicken and dumplings. When I get takeout, I love to order 2 dinners and have leftovers for a couple of days. I spent $44 and threw the left overs away.
