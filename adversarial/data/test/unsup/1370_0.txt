Our server Jamie was the best part of the evening.  Very friendly and very accommodating.  Food was high priced and delivery of food was slow.  Cost - $75 for one glass of wine, one whiskey sour, spinach papperdelle with hangar steak, and sweet potato gnocchi with pulled pork added.  Food taste was good but for the price we won't do again.  Atmosphere was nice.  Restaurant was clean.  Servers looked professional.
