Funky place! We shared the slider sampler--7 different ones--favorites were the brisket and the egg slider which sounded boring, but was surprisingly flavorful and loaded with bacon. The s'mores cheesecake is incredible and could feed at least 4 hungry people which  were not after eating the sliders. We passed on the overpriced drinks. Great music in the background, interesting retro items for sale--a fun change and we will be back. But do go early and avoid the sun.
