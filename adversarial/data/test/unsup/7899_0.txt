A favorite place to have Brunch I ordered a new item filet mignon and lobster eggs Benedict with potatoes.  An excellent dish with one issue. I was not asked how I wanted my filet done (medium rare) unfortunately the filet was over well done and barely chewable. The lobster side was perfect. As usual the wait staff was impeccable. They lost a star on the tough beef but certainly deserved the other stars.
