Duck fat fries and garden pea falafel from supper.  Preferred falafel to the fries (I don't usually like thick cut fries but good -we were sharing otherwise doubt I'd gone for these). \n\ncauliflower first from provision. \nThe cauliflower was amazing. I love buffalo wings and cauliflower so perfect combo for me. Def would order this again. \n\nAlso ordered chopped salad from el Lugar.  Good salad.
