Not a good experience at all.  They refused to give me water because they had no water cups.  They wanted me to buy an overpriced bottle of water.  I asked to speak to a manager and waited for 15 minutes and a manager never came to speak with me.  I eventually got a refund for my movie tickets and left.  This theater has horrible customer service.  I will not be going back.
