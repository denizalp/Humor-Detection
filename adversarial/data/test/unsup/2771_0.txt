Holly Would in the Alley\nBy The Rue\n\nI spent a few hours at Hollywood Alley,\nI didn't go with a girl named Sally,\nLocated in Arizona, not in Cali,\n$21.64 was my bar tab tally,\nLive music here isn't like a pep rally,\nIt's one of the best dives in the valley,\nIt's as big as a ships galley, \nThey don't do a grand finale,\nThe owner's last name isn't O'mally,\nIf in Vegas don't stay at Bally's,\nI like berries just not Halle,\nWhen you order don't dilly dally!\n\nVan Nuys!!
