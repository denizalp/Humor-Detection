This was a very good experience. The service was a very oblivious and got our order wrong. That is the only reason why this amazing place did not get a full 5 stars. \nI ended up getting the nigiri platter and he shrimp fried rice. Very generous portions. Be sure to bring your appetite. \nGreat flavor combinations. Over all a good experience.
