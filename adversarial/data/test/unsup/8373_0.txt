The good:\nClean, easy to enter and exit, great staff, on the light rail. \n\nThe bad:\nGhetto fabulous customers at times and they wont allow children to run or dance or stand on the grocery bagging counter, which I find to be a perfect distraction from the before mentioned ghetto fabulous customers. \n\nAnyways,  if you haven't been to Aldis, check out one near you.  I save about 30 bucks a week shopping there. And try the salsa in the refrigerated section.  Holy crap its good stuff!
