Nothing too special about Cafe Bellagio. Expensive for what this cafe has to offer. \n\nThe gfs dish was excellent. Shrimp, rice, and some sort of cream sauce. $26 plate, well worth it.\n\nMy homemade meatloaf was just a safe pick. Tasted like any other meatloaf dish I have ever ate. Props for presentation though. $17, should have paid the extra 9 for the gfs dish. \n\nCasual dining at a expensive price.
