Glory Bees is a little shop with all sorts of souvenirs and gifts for tourists visiting this part of AZ. I found myself a very pretty magnet, which was easier to find than the store owner when it was check out time. I actually gave up waiting for her to come back, and put the magnet back, but walked back into the store later and purchased it when I saw her. ($8.73) Cute t-shirts, jewelry and gifts inside!
