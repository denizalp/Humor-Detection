MMMMM, Now that's a tasty burger, what was that called again?\n\nA bit pricy for a burger, but it is the Cosmo.\n\nDrinks at the bar, where we were not allowed to order a milkshake for one of our dining companions that does not imbibe alcohol was extremely annoying, but not as annoying as the gal that said it. Attitude much? Uh hello, this is a burger joint..\n\nAnny who, food was good, fries are amazing, super yummy onion rings, and that milkshake was flippin huge (when it finally arrived at the table)..\n\nIgnore the attitudes and enjoy the food..
