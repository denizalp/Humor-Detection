Daileny, Bri & Amelia were amazing, and I highly recommend this company!\n\nThey did a wonderful job for my wedding. They did hair and makeup for me and my 5 bridesmaids. We all looked amazing and beautiful! Everything was easy to set up through Rob, and the ladies did a wonderful job with each person. They were also very friendly and easy to talk to. Thank you for everything!
