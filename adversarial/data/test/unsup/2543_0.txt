I don't drink. Going into a loud bar with a bunch of drunks is just not my style.  So, unfair to them, I wasn't a fan.  Having said that, my friends are a bunch of drunks, so I usually come here with them.  Good Irish bands, if that's your thing, and a lively place.  It's a fire hazard due to the wall to wall overcrowded place.  Perhaps I should drink and loosen up.
