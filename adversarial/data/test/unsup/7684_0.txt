Here are my favorites:\n\nTry the wings! They're huge & extra crispy. Order both flavors! \n\nThe beef rib is amazing too! Remember the portions are huge so share with others. The meat is super tender and delicious.\n\nCoconut Soju is my favorite - it comes in a coconut & is super creamy! \n\nLychee Soju is my next favorite - it's not too sweet and the flavors are perfect together well.
