I don't know what they put in the soups and I don't want to know ... \n\nI know one thing: ALL the soups are ridiculously good. It's a problem now because they are close to my job and the soups are very inexpensive. I hate how much I love it! \n\nThey also have a great selection of vegan salads, wraps, sandwichs AND SOUPS!\n\nYou should try it ... or maybe not ... I want all the soup.
