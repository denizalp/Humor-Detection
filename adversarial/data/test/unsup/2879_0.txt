Don't start service!!! They have revolving contracts won't let you out of. Want you to pay for services never rendered. They wanted over $600 to cancel now sent me to collections and they want over $700. Even after 7 years of collecting my money. Will never ever reconsider this company. Outdated equipment!!!
