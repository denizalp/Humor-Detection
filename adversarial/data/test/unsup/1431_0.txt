Just had my home serviced through Moxie Pest Control. A very nice young lady knocked on my door this morning and soon enough, I signed up for their quarterly pest control service.  Nick B, the technician was very informative and thorough, explaining everything prior to the service. Moxie is suppose to do a 30-day follow up. So far, I'm very pleased with their service but we'll see how this goes.
