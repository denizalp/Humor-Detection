What a wonderful experience. Tiffany is a great gal who provides personal service with warmth and friendliness. This is a one woman operation which provides a quiet, relaxing attentive appointment. Tiffany will make sure you are happy with your manicure\/pedicure before she will let you go. I am so happy I found this cute little blue box. It's so beautifully decorated. So much to look at - all while enjoying personal one -on -one service. My daughter and granddaughter are also hooked.
