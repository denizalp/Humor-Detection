I came here to treat some family and friends who were helping me move to lunch. I got food from here delivered to me one or two times on Postmates prior to actually visiting. It's very similar to Chipotle\/Moe's\/Blaze Pizza etc. where you have your food made for you along an assembly line. I got a regular sized poke bowl with tuna, tofu, and a bunch of other things mixed in. It was really fresh and delicious. The service was good as well. I'll definitely be back now that I live closer.
