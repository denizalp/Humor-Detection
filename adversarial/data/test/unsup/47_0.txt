I have eaten 100's upon 100's of cinnamon rolls in my life and Rise Up Bakery's cinnamon roll could very well be the best I have ever had. This wasn't a case of \"Boy am I hungry and this hits the spot\". This is, I just ate lunch but was looking for something sweet afterwards. The dough is perfect and the filling and frosting are sweet but not overly sweet. I can't wait to get home and dive into the Chocolate Chip Pumpkin Bread and the Overachiever Cookies.
