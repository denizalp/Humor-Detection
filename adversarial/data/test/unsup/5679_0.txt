I'm upping my rating on Fired Pie. The quantity of the ingredients has drastically improved since the first time that I have tried this place. But I have to admit my fired pies have come out much better of late. I hope these guys can keep up the good work.\n\nI usually spend a skosh over $11 for a large soda and a pizza. It is kind of a fresh breath of air that you can put several different types of toppings on your pizza.
