First of all.... we went here to celebrate my nephew's 12th birthday.\n\nSecondly, the bowling alley\/arcade and laser tag were all a major hit.... lots of fun.\n\nWe decided to have lunch here... and I decided to have the Cobb Salad; the kids had pizza (which they all said \"tasted funny\"). Three-hours later... the WORST food poisoning I've ever EXPERIENCED ensued!!!!  And it lasted 48-hours!!! The most painful 20-lbs I've ever lost.\n\nI left several messages for the manager to call me back - but to no avail.\n\nI'm never-ever... EVER returning to this bacteria-infested septic tank.
