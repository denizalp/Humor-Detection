Quite an interesting find, this Hawaii bar. Totally authentic place. Been around for years, but I had never heard about it until a friend stumbled in there expecting a dank and unfriendly Portuguese man bar. Everyone was so friendly! The place was decorated with great stuff, and the prices were OK. Seemed like all the bottles were in the back (not at the bar) so - not sure how fast it would be to drink here on a busy night. Only heard good things about Tuesday night Tiki music.
