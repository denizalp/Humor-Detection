Carb Party!!\n\nThis place is awesome! I love the atmosphere - it's so cozy and warm. \n\nI can say, in the absence of hyperbole, that the warm, crusty bread with butter they served before our entrees was literally the best thing I've ever tasted. \n\nSave room for dessert! We shared a slice of Black Forest Cake, and we both contracted diabetes on the spot, but it was worth it.
