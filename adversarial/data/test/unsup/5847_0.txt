I was very surprised but this restaurant, considering the mall it was in, but was very pleased with the warm and welcoming interior and atmosphere. The food was fairly good value considering this restaurant is a division of Pizza Nova. I had the Pasta A La A Vodka with optional chicken breast. The chicken breast was slightly over grilled although the pasta and sauce were very good. Overall, I would recommend this if you're in the mood for Italian.
