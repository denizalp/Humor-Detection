If you live in the area you should definitely go see these guys for your lawnmower\/lawn maintenance, you are doing yourself a disservice if you don't. Generally busy, but that's because they will take the time with you and be honest (a lost art). Thought I needed a brand new tire for my classic snapper 825 and they pulled the nail out and simply patched it up and saved me $50.
