Been coming here since I moved to Vegas 4 years ago. Always a great place to watch games\/fights, with lots of tv screens. Pretty sure management has changed a few times across the years and staff are always changing. Had a new girl called Alexis the other day, really friendly and more attentive that other servers I've experienced there recently. I'll be back for sure! Try the zinger melt and ask for the funnel fries (if they still do them!)
