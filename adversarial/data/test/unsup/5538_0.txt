I didn't like the food.  I had the pan seared tuna and the grilled salmon...it was forgettable.  I went to Woo because I could use my resort credit from the Venetian, but I know I won't ever return.  I much prefer Zine, which is also in the Palazzo.  The food and prices at Zine are better. Woo was such a disappointment!
