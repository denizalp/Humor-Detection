It's a solid casino theater. Props for being able to enter and exit via the dedicated side entrance and skip the casino floor altogether. Concessions stand pricing and selection on par with other Station casino theaters.\n\nAuditorium was clean, seats are dated but comfortable, haven't had any audio or video issues. Bathrooms are on the small side and lines develop fast in the evening. Pricing is average. I like that this theater isn't one that gets too crowded.
