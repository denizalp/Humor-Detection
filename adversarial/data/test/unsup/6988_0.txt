My roommate had her birthday bash here last night and we had a group of ten and they sat us in the very front! \n\nThe show started on time, and the men were very handsome. The MC was great. Got the audience involved. The show was fun. Very interactive. \n\nThe only downfall is the show starting so late, but I'm an old lady at heart so it was a struggle to stay awake. Haha. \n\nAll in all, not a bad show to have some girl fun.
