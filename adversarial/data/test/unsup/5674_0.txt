I can truly say that this locations pizza is better then the one I had at the original under the Brooklyn Bridge.\nWe always like to dine at the patio.\nAmbiance is good.\nThe Service has been good all the times we have been here.\nWe ordered the Mediterranean salad was really good. The White with garlic Ricotta Pizza was great. The tiramisu was amazing! \nSo we keep on going back.
