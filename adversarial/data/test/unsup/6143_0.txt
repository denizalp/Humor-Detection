Do yourself a favor: If you're having a bad day--hell, even if you're having a great day--end your night by sipping a perfectly refreshing, strong, India Lime Fizz at the Velvet Tango Room. \n\nYour mind, taste buds and perspective will thank you. Oh, and don't miss the live piano and trumpet. \n\nSigh, I could live in this thought forevs.
