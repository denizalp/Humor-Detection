New coffee shops have been opening every other week on every other corner in the neighborhood, and that's not a bad thing. But how does one differentiate themselves?\n\nCaf√© Pista has a winning formula:\n\n- Perfect shots using Kittel's excellent coffee expertly prepared on a beautiful Synesso Slayer machine\n\n- Great food (you've got to try the breakfast croissant, its sublime!), and great pastries by Dave Plante\n\n- Beautiful decor\n\n- Friendly staff\n\n- Convenient location, a few steps from the Beaubien station\n\nI will be back for sure!
