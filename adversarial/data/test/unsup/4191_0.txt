It's a typical Hallmark shop, but it's a little smaller than most of the other ones. There's really not much to report other than that I didn't see a candy counter, AND they sell stamps! I didn't know!\n\nThe lady that rang me up was pleasant. \n\nI'm not sure what else to say. I am grasping for words.
