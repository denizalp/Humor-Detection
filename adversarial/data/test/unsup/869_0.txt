When you think of a Chinese buffet you think the place is going to be pretty gross, Dragon Buffet is the complete opposite.  \n\nThey have a great selection of your favorite American Chinese food along with some other food, such as pizza and mozzarella sticks.  One of my favorite things are the crab legs...so good.  The price is also decent.
