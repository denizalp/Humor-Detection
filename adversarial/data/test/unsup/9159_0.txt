Good family restaurant, I had egg, cheese and ham omelet it was very good, pancakes had a great flavor to it, and omg the coffee was spot on! The hash browns were not that good but with salt and ketchup it was better. I recommend this place, fast friendly service with no waiting. Girlfriend had sweet banana pancakes and she loved them. We shared our plates as the amount of food they serve is awesome.
