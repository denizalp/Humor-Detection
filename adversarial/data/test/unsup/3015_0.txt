Great place. I went here with my cousin for lunch on Monday afternoon.\n\nThe location is OK. Not the best, but not the worst.\n\nThe food was great. Nice and fresh. I had salmon sashimi (5 pieces), Tako Yaki (5 pieces), and Chicken Katsu.\n\nI would come back to this place again if I'm ever in the area.
