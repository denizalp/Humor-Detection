Eating the food at Frank's Kitchen is akin to a sexual experience.  The chef obviously knows how to take control of your taste buds.  There are already many Yelps on some of the highlights of my meal (carpaccio, gnocchi, chicken supreme, the fresh breads, the desserts:  everything was as good as it gets).  I just want people to know that this is a true foodie experience and the meal, the server and the ambiance were all a delight.
