Picked up food for lunch the other day. I ordered a small vegetarian hot and sour soup; the soup was flavourful, delicious, and a great portion size. I then ordered their one of their spicy mixed vegetable dishes. The dish was good but the veggies were a tad mushy and over cooked. I will be back to try, but to dine in next time. \nI am glad they have a great variety of vegetarian options, especially the hot and sour soup.
