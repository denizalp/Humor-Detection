We did a yelp and decided to give it a try after reading the reviews.  It's up past both the Rio and the Palms in a strip mall.\n\nHubby and I both ordered pho.  Good broth and meat and noodle portions.  \n\nIf you check in on yelp, you can redeem the deep fried two spring rolls offer.  \n\nLots of locals so it's gotta be good.
