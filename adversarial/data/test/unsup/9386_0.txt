Major points for the flirty baristo!  I ordered a tea, which kept me warm on my cold walk to the next bar.  This place was a pleasant, friendly stop on a drunken bar crawl, and I know that's not really enough to warrant rating it so highly, but I came out with a brownie, too, and that made me happy.
