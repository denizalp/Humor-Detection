You would think being new on the street they would be nicer to potential customers!!!!\n\nWalked in at 7:05pm, within seconds the cashier yells out at me \"excuse me!!!! We are actually closed!!!! But u can look around if u want\"\n\nMeanwhile there's at least 6-7 people browsing all stopped to look at me.\n\nNo thanks. Annoying.
