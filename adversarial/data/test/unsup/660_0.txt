My first time here, upon reading previous Yelp reviews. I decided to eat here today. I just ordered a small beef donair, and a bottle of water. It came to just over $10 dollars. It was very tasty I have to say. I ordered it with the sweet sauce. You can also order it with hot sauce, or garlic sauce. Oh yeah, you can also get various veggies in it. It's like a sub, but way tastier.
