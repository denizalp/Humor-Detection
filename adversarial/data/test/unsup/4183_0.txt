I would give Carolina Auto Repair no stars if possible. \nI took my car here for a simple oil change. When I picked my car up and started to drive home my hood flew open and broke my windshield also destroyed my hood.\nJohn (the owner) refused to pay for the damages even though it was clearly his fault. He was very disrespectful to my father and I while lying about who actually did the work on my car.\nWe are now going to sue him for damages.
