This brewery was FUN!! We had a great tour and sat at the bar. We enjoyed kombucha and beer with afternoon snacks.\n\nThe outdoor seating is plentiful and many customers enjoyed hanging out outside. The Brewery had several sizes of tables inside the main serving area. The seats are comfortable.\n\nService is exceptional. The bar tenders were busy but still eaher to welcome us as new customers. He cheerfully explained the beer and kombucha offerings then offered samples - whoot whoot!!\n\nI enjoyed the experience and we will be back.
