I just discovered they have Creamed Dried Beef (aka Cream Chipped Beef aka S.O.S) there is NOOOOOO other place I've found that serves that! \nAs if I didnt go out to eat often enough, Ill be going way more often. This is officially MY FAVORITE restaurant. Not to mention they are inexpensive, and FAST
