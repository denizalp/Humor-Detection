Here is a very good restaurant and to find someplace where I can take the my boys and they will eat good.  They were able to find something they all liked, the service was very good, the food quality was good and the prices were OK.\n\nIf you are looking for a place without the crowds of the Las Vegas Strip, then you need to come here for a good meal.  You are in a good part of town, the packing lot is lit up and the wait to be sat down is good.
