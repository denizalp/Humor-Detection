I really enjoy dining here. The soups are hot, rich and tasty, the salads are really fresh and you can customize them to your liking, the staff is very friendly, and the whole cafe has a bright, contemporary, casual ambiance. You can customize your drinks at their drink bar which has syrups and \"recipes\" for various combinations. All that and good prices too. This place is a winner.
