Couldn't resist this cute little bakery. Decided on the bundtlets -White Chocolate Raspberry for my chaps, Pecan Praline for me and Marble for hubs. They were all delicious, and easily enough for two servings. At $3.99 each, not too bad for a personal sized treat. They also offer a complimentary buntinis- single bite sized samples of the day's featured flavor...today's was Red Velvet.
