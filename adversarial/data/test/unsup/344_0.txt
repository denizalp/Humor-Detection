Hmm, what can I say about DJ's. The employees are rude and unhelpful, they are over priced with cheaply made products, and the place is filled with dirt head hookah smoke that is just disgusting. Seems like they don't care about their customers, and in the end that will cause them the same fate as their counterpart Trails....which is now OUT of business and in chapter 11 bankruptcy. This is where DJ's is headed unless they clean up their act literally and figuratively speaking.
