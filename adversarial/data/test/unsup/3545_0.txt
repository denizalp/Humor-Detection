Been here a couple of times now and both times it was awesome.  The first time I had the sesame chicken dinner and today I had the orange chicken dinner.  The sesame chicken is excellent here.  Most places I've had sesame chicken it just taste oily.  Heng's sesame is very sweet, honey-flavored, with a bit of ginger - very pleasant.  As is pretty normal for Chinese restaurants, the orange chicken isn't anywhere near spicy but you can have them spice it up more.  Great crab puffs and fried rice here as well!
