There was a dude trolling for chicks with sequins spelling \"puppy\" on the back of his shirt.  Need I say more?\n\nCheap drinks, awful food, young crowd, tourist spot, place to get hammered before Strip Bar\/Hockey Game.  These are all things that Peel Pub is.  \n\nIf you are expecting quality, you've come to the wrong place son.\n\nOne other thing of note, they had banana flavored condoms in the mens bathroom, but I didn't try them.
