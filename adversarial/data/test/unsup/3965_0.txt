The office staff comes across as cold, terse and judgmental. Their attitude telegraphs, \"I wish you would go away,\" and so I did, to another wonderful practice not too far away. Lina Kay, PA, is helpful, compassionate, and an \"outside the box\" thinker. Did not see Dr. Shapiro. As others have mentioned, they are very sensitive about seeing other docs. I was told one is not allowed to change docs within the group. This would seem to be a violation of patients' rights--an illegal act--would it not? Very concerning.
