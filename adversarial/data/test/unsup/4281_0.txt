First timer of Korean bbq! Service was spot on. Shea is one of the coolest ones there, and our grills were changed immediately when needed. The meat was perfect and the shrimp and calamari were prepared beautifully. Rice cakes were awesome, and the seaweed salad was equally as good. Everything came out promptly, and the atmosphere is perfect.
