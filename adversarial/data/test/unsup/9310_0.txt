I don't even like bread pudding, but this place has THE BEST bread pudding EVER! I think they make it with donuts or something, but the vanilla\/caramel cream sauce is just \"the most.\"\n\nAlso, my animal lover friend loved the veal meatballs. She didn't realize what veal was at the time, but when I told her, she still liked them, but she hated herself just a little for it. What can she say, they were delicious!
