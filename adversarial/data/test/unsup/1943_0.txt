Had apps at bar onThurs and enjoyed myself. We had the portabello mush with sirloin tips which my girlfriend loved,escargot which I loved and the carpaccio which was just ok. We also had shoestring fries and cr√®me brulee, both were good.  Our bartender was Levi and he was friendly and helpful on his suggestions. Want to go back to try the steaks.
