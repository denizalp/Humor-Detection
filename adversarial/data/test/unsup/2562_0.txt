I LOVE this restaurant.  I always visit it when I'm in town.  The Hostess is always fantastic and very accomodating.  I love the elegance of this restaurant, the seating on the patio, the views of the incredible fountains,  very romantic, the menu is divine.  (Love the free range chicken.)  This is definitely one of my absolute favorite restaurants in Vegas.  Ciao Bellas!
