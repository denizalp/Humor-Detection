My wife, kiddo, and I went here tonight for dinner.  It was fairly packed.  No problem, we can wait...  But once we walked in the hostess said, and I quote, \"it's snowing people... go home!\"  We turned around and walked out, and we will not be back.  I wish I could give them zero stars.  That is NOT how you treat a paying customer... ever.
