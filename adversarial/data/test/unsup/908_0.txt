It's been many years since I set foot in an Express. But ya know, sale. Holy moly, this place was a clusterf*ck. It's like they tried to cram as much merchandise in there as possible. It was just so messy looking. And were their clothes always such poor quality? I used to shop here all the time years ago and don't remember the clothes being so scanty and such crappy quality. And to top it all off, such poor customer service. From the fitting rooms to the register, the staff were snobby and rude.
