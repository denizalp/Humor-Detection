I cannot find enough words in the dictionary to explain the outstanding,freshly cooked delicious juicy meals on this entire menu as well as the service provided treating you like a king or queen. I highly recommend the falafel balls, the hummus. the shwarma, the lentil soup, the beef and lamb kebabs, the schnitzel and salads. The two owners, service and cool atmosphere is a must to try out over and over again!!! Oh and let's not forget the best hookah in all of the world!
