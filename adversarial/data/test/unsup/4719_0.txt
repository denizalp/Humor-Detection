Went here for a NYE dinner, got a table for two. Ate on the 2nd floor, which had an amazing view. The atmosphere was good, and we ordered a pizza and a lasagna. The lasagna was amazing, it was honestly the best we've ever tasted, it just melted in your mouth. The service was good too, we would definitely go back there again without a question. The food was a bit pricey, but well worth the taste.
