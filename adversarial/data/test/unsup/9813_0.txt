I haven't had a full dinner from them. My\nBoyfriend introduced me to this restaurant because I had a taste for some good mac & cheese. And I must say it is SPLENDID! We got it as a side and honestly I wish we would have gotten a large. After all mines was gone i was peaking over at his for some more. Reasonable price for a side $3. Customer service is good.
