A real, cool smoke shop that offers cigars, cigarettes, bongs, peace pipes, hookahs, wraps, lighters, snacks, and more, all topped off with good service. They have a little hangout area towards the back of the shop where you can hang out to relax or smoke and watch tv. Shop is very clean. The cafe is no longer but there is something in the works that will replace it.
