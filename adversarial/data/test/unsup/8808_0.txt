THE WORST! Visiting Vegas from Charlotte....\nCame in Here w 3 girl friends and they denied our entry bc we didn't have a guy each. (Sexist if you ask me)... Then later when we finally got a hold of our guy friend that was inside and they STILL denied our entry FOR NO REASON. While our friend argued with management to get us in. They told us we HAD TO WAIT OUTSIDE! And to get out of the hall way!!! SERIOUSLY? Just wanted to stay out longer and have some fun and spend money. THE WORST SERVICE TOWARDS WOMEN!
