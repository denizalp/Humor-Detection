I shop here frequently because they have good prices and good inventory. \n\nI had a positive experience buying a new dryer. I do wish they could give a more specific delivery time window, but their delivery crew is great. They don't carry any extra parts on the delivery truck, so you have to be careful to order the exact parts you need to connect everything together. \n\nThe store is well organized, and I can usually find whatever I need. The staff is generally helpful and knowledgeable.
