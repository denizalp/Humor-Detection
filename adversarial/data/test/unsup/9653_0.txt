Takes a lot longer than Papa Johns, but it is cheaper. To the company: I don't recommend having a countdown if you aren't delivering within that time frame. It's a psychological tip for free, unlike your delivery. Ordered at 2:53pm on a Tuesday. Delivered at 3:51. Had to microwave both mozzarella sticks and pizza since they were apparently sitting around. Delivery driver was polite and friendly.
