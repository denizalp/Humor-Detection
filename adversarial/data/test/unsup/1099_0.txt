HORRIBLE COSTUMER SERVICE. The owners niece did not want to except our groupon because she said the family owned business is losing money. She did not care about losing customers that were using YeLP or Groupons. She is very rude and is a LIAR. After we ordered we were very misled after until we got the bill.The staff here is unbelievable, not in a good way. Spread the word.
