The company pride oozing from this shop is palpable! I was thrilled to snag a last-minute Saturday appointment and, after reading the great reviews, did not leave disappointed. My tech was friendly and professional, and the shop is stunning. I love a good massage chair, and though I couldn't really feel the massage in these particular chairs, that won't stop me from returning. Services run about $5 more than other salons, but it's worth it for the friendly attitude and warm atmosphere.
