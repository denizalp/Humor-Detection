Solid place.  Steaks were great and cooked perfectly -- rib eye was medium rare and filet rare. Oysters and shrimp cocktail were fantastic , love how they give you extra horseradish of the Extra spicy variety.  And of course the bourbon selection was huge. Old fashion made correctly with a ball ice. Would definitely come back
