Excellent food. Enthusiastic staff. They have a great thing going on. We WILL be back! Ask questions if you are not familiar with menu items. They are over the moon to explain the menu if it's not clear. They have BEER too. Simple seating, clean and yummy! Give it a try but DO ask questions.  You won't be disappointed.
