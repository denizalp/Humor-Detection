Thought I would give them another try. Still a lack of training for the kids that take the orders up front. This one was told by manager after my order was placed that he messed up my order. Instead of the manager adjusting the order once the mistake was caught, the over-charge of my meal left me ticked. Will NOT be back. Massive #fail on many levels!
