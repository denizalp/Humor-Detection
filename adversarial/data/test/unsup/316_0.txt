Another shitty over \"hyped\" establishment. My quesadilla had shredded lettuce that was shredded so fine it resembled a green blob. By the way, iceberg lettuce fucking sucks. It tastes like hell, is primarily water, is cheap as shit, and has no nutritional value. The diced tomatoes were from a can. Salsa was bogus & chips were not home made. The bean & chz. burrito was deflated as an old tire & tasted like one. It was all tortilla.... In a nutshell, this is nothing but bar food. Nothing authentic here. F. this place.
