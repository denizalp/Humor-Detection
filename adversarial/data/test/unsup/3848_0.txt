Chinese food from your parents generation and service that would make a tortoise look like a rabbit this place is unbelievably typically rated the best Chinese food in Madison. Madison obviously is ok with what these guys are serving.  One sign of an authentic ethnic restaurant is the number of people of that culture eating there. Well the China Garden must be a damn good Wisconsin supper club based on the clientele.  That said, the fragrant chicken is good as is the orange beef.
