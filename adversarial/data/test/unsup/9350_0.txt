I always heard about  NY NY but that was just for the roller coaster which I hate by the way. I heard that the rooms were just okay and yes that's true they are but they aren't bad either. It wasn't anything fancy like the Venetian or Bellagio but my room was clean. The casino was alright and I loved how the hotel had NY themed restaurants and bars. So overall I would stay here again if I was on a budget.
