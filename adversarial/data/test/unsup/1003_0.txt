This hotel is conveniently located near the action in Old Town.\n\nIt is a great place to crash when you have a long night of drinking and festivities planned.  Just walk out to the street, flag down a golf cart and you are on your way!\n\nThere is a complimentary breakfast seven days a week.  Today they had waffles; steel cut oatmeal; berries; a fruit basket; bagels; bread; assorted cereals; coffee; tea; juices; milk and more!\n\nI'd stay here again... if I ever go out drinking again.  ;) In Arizona there is a Zero Tolerance policy.  Don't drink and drive!
