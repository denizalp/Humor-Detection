So, I'm going to walk through a maze of children and blinking lights to pay $15 to ride a ride that's going to give me mini-whiplash?\n\nUh, yeah, no thanks.\n\nI mean, it's fun and all (after the virtual raping you get with the price of it), but the next day you're going to be paying for it.  You may as well get drunk with that money - your head won't hurt as badly.\n\nPeople need to realize this town was built on gambling, not thrill rides for chrissake,\n\nBut secretly, I wish it was built on Rock and Roll.
