I keep coming back here every three months or so, and each time it's worse. Ordered a snack of 5 wings, and two were just embarrassingly scrawny. Overpriced, long wait, drinks never refilled, marginal service.\n\nIt's me. It is. I'm an idiot for coming back here. [slapping self]. Stupid, stupid, stupid!!
