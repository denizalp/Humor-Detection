The skewers at ZK Grill are so good that you'll keep eating them even when you're full. The rice that comes with the meals is light and fluffy with a very nice flavor. And their french fries are pretty addicting too. The Greek salad is ... eh... just like all the others, not great but not bad.\n\nThe restaurant is always clean and so are the restrooms. \n\nI give ZK's 4 stars because it is a bit pricey for the this type of restaurant, counter order\/pick up.
