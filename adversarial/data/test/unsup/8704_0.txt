Considering this place is a food court fast food restaurant, I ordered a basic order of mama burger combo with normal fries and drink and they managed to take 20 minutes to make the meal. When I got my burger it was cold. \n\nMy family that got us a seat already finished their meals by the time I walked there with my meal. I would not come here again.\n\nI finished my drink and asked for a refill, knowing the hillcrest A&W location gives free refill, they said refill is $1. Wtf. Understaff, cheap, and horrible service. No thank you.
