The service is always friendly and competent.   It's also a clean and well maintained place (though it's not sit-down like the Cincinnati Skylines).  It's good for a fix, but the chili quality seems uneven compared to other Skylines.  Sometimes I'll go there and it will be very flavorful and other times it seems bland.  Sits in the pot too long?  Previous day's batch?  I don't know, but I've also thought that it might be a sourcing issue since they're so far away from other Skylines.
