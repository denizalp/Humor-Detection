Now I understand the meaning of the restaurant name....\n\nDisappointed with the service.... a little slow for a Monday night but still took almost an hour to get our orders.... others who arrived after us got their dinners ahead of us.  \n\n$22 for a slice of salmon.... no sides.  The rest of the party had sides with their dishes.  Street tacos were too spicy to eat.\n\nNot worth the prices they charge...
