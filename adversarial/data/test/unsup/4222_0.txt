HEFTY 8 OZ burger in the cosmopolitan!\n\nyou can get your burger on a white OR wheat bun\n---gold standard burger: pretty good! i liked the strong cheese flavor & char-grilled smokyness to the patty... ALTHOUGH my patty was unevenly cooked, which was a bit of a bummer\n---burgers come w\/ steak OR shoestring fries... shoestring were definitely yummier! \n\nNOTE:you can ask for other sauces besides ketchup & mustard, but the chipotle mayo sauce we had wasn't too impressive\n\nFREE house beer OR house margarita w\/ a foursquare check-in!
