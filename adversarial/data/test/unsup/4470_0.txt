We walked in and we're sat immediately.  Unfortunately we waited over 20 minutes with nobody coming to our table.  Then we were noticed by this server named AJ and he walked up was like have you guys not been helped yet? Then he said this isn't my section but I'm here now so I got this.  Super knowledgeable about the menu.  This kid saved our experience because the food was really so if the service would have remained poor we would have been upset.  AJ is the man.  Nacho daddy is now a must everytime!
