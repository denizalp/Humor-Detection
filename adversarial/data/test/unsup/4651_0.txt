I have too many good things to say about this place:\n- I got the veggie steak shawirma, (expensive for me but portions are huge).\n- I have been to Greece and this is some of the best Greek food I've had.\n- Super clean in lobby and they have an open kitchen. \n- Cook brings food out to guests when he can. The cashier was genuinely friendly, helpful, and asked about my day.  \nSo: authentic, delicious, great customer service. \nThe only thing I wish is that they sold pita bread and hummus in bulk!
