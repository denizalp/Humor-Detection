Can you say \"bait and switch\" the online ad said the car was in \"excellent condition\" so we flew in to Vegas to purchase.. The condition of the car when we arrive is at best \"fair\"  while on the test drive the center consul fell off.. There is tons of body damage - car is dirty as hell.. Sales reps and management team were not interested in adjusting the price accordingly. All in all id say this dealer is a run of the muck sleaze ball!
