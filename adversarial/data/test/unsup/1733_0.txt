My friend and I ate lunch there together.  They had a buffet only lunch menu. I was very disappointed...at first but after investigating the HUGE selection of 8 entrees and 2 kinds of rice as well as rice pudding, yummy carrot thingy I can't recall the name of and small salad bar I must say it enticed me back to see their dinner menu. Worth a return visit for sure.  Please comment and follow me for more reviews! I would love to have you!
