Kinkade still my favorite place to take my car for an oil change. The guys are friendly and honest. If it wasn't for the Groupon deal, I probably wouldn't know about this place. They even have a Keurig coffee station while you wait, but no tv. They highly recommend you make an appointment. This place gets extremely busy. The parking lot is small. They have shuttle service if don't' want to wait.
