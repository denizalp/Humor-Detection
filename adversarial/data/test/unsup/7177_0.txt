Although I was just looking, I ended up buying because of not only the beautiful, luxurious car (I got a CTX 2015) but also the wonderful customer service I received the moment I stepped onto the lot. Saad was extremely accommodating, fast, honest and personable. He listened to my life, (two kids, just moved here, etc) and found the perfect car for me.) The actual purchasing portion was fast and very easy, which included a trade-in. I would highly recommend going here for your next car buying experience! Ask for Saad!
