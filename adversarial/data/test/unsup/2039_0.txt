The atmosphere and lighting was perfect. However, it doesn't match the service...which was absolutely terrible! I waited 20 min for my check, and 10 to get it back. The food was over priced, and came out cold and wasn't even good. The wine glasses were filthy...Two of them had lipstick all over them. Thankfully the bartender knew how to pour a drink, because it had to be strong for the experience I just witnessed.
