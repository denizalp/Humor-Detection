Adding some stars because I was contacted by the arrangement supervisor after writing this review. He has been working to do what he can to try to compensate for what was messed up. Of course, and he said this as well, there is nothing that can be done to actually fix this. It's a one chance thing. But I do appreciate how apologetic he has been and trying to get to the bottom of what happened. Thank you Lawrence!
