Indian khaane ki maa bhen ek kardi. Basically they destroyed such a beautiful cuisine. Murdered it. Destroyed Vegetarian food. My question to the owner if he ever reads this : are u bloody insane man? Have you no idea what indian food tastes like? Did your mom never fed you good food? You have kept in untrained chefs and staff to cook and serve your horrible food. An insult to indian food. Never will I come back. Wish I could give u negative stars here.
