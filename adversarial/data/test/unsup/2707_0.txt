5-star Happy Hour!  We had a bunch of beverages and a bunch of food for 35 bucks!  Can you believe that?  The bartender...I think his name is Geoffrey...took great care of us.  \n\nNext time we need to leave room for a pizookie.  \n\nThat Harvest Hefeweizen is so good it took me back to old Bavaria AND made me blaspheme.  Now that's a great beer!  We always enjoy stopping in at BJ's.
