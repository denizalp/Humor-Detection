A huge complex that offers a lot of sport league and lesson options. The main building looks nice and is relatively clean. The swimming and diving complex is wonderful.\n\nOnly quibble: only food in the building is vending machines (including the sketchy one with stale sandwiches in them). Wish there were better options - especially when all-day sports competitions are being held.
