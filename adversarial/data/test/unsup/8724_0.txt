Came to fill gas before heading back to return the rental car, this Popeyes was connected to the gas station.  I spotted their advertisement for Tuesday special - \"2 pieces of chicken for $1.29\" WHAT!  Thats so awesome!\n\ni of course got 2 of the specials for the plane ride back!  Heck yeah 4 pieces of tasty fried chicken for less than $3 rather than a $8 tiny sandwich from the airport!  If i lived here id get a few of these deals every tuesday and have some for lunch every Wednesday too.\n\n4 Value stars!
