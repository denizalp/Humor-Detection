Great job replacing my AC blower motor..Blows super cold air now. First service that was not at the dealer's shop that I purchased the car from. (not under warranty any longer)  Louie and Kyle were very friendly and helpful..I never even spoke to a mechanic at the the dealership..only the front office staff..Very impressed with this shop !!
