Probably one of the most beautiful hotels in Vegas. Comparable to The Bellagio in decor. It is simply fantabulous!\nI think I may be addicted to red. And the theme here is red, luscious, divine, sultry, sooo amazingly red.\nThe rooms are outstanding!\nThe service is outstanding! \nThe clientele is a bit pretentious, but you get what you pay for right? With stores like Chanel and Louis Vuitton lining the corridors, you have no doubt where you are.\nI love it, and I would stay here anytime!\nThat's a hint~
