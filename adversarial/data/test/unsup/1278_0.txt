$5 per ride\n$12 per day\n$28 3 day pass\n\nBeat that cabbie!!! Although the monorail doesn't go EVERYWHERE, it's a valuable resource when you're getting around the strip. It doesn't always drop you off at a favorable location so there may be some hoofing around to do, but I think the exchange (saving moola) is well worth the effort. From now on I think I'll be choosing my hotels based on this sucker.
