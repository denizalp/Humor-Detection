This is our go to theater in Las Vegas. The seats recline and are super comfy. Lots of elbow space as well. Each seat is assigned so no rushing to the theater to get seats next to each other. They have a variety of snacks and drinks. My favorite is the kettle corn. Love that they offer free refills on large popcorn and drinks. Makes it worth paying for when you have a family of four. Plus right off the freeway!!
