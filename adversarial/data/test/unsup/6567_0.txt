R&R Plumbing did work for us sub-contracted through Lowes Hardware. R&R does great work and stands behind  their service.  Rep that came to house (Walt) was very professional and courteous. Had to call in to company and was very impressed with the employees' strive to ensure that I was a satisfied customer. Spoke with female S. Zenes. I would highly recommend R&R for plumbing needs.
