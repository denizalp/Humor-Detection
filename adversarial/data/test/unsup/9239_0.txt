I think the last time I was here a few months ago I asked for no peanuts in my food and it ended up being in my food and long story short I got pretty destroyed. I didn't really think to come back again after that food allergy incident. But then again I came back this weekend staying hopeful and I was glad I came back. We ordered fries, fried chicken sliders ( without peanut slaw ), and ribeye rice bowl. All were so delicious. It's definitely a banger
