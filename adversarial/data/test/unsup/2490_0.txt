Hired company to refinish tub and tub surround.  The first technician did a poor job.  They came out again to inspect the poor work to authorize fixing the problem.  Then they sent another technician who redid the work of the first technician and that was acceptable.  \n\nDealing with this company isn't worth the hassle.  From the first meeting until the completion of the job was approximately three weeks.  I was trying to get this rental property on the market and was delayed as a result of the problems.
