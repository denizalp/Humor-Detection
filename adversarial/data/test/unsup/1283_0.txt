Is it possible? Have I truly found a Pho restaurant that has fresh ingredients and broth AND a clean environment?!?! I know they're new so crossing fingers they can uphold it! I had the beef pho. Shrimp and pork spring rolls and flan. Could be one of the best flans I've had not too sweet and soft. Yum.
