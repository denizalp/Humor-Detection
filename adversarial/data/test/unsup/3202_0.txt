I will have my third lesson in tap with Nikki today.  She's spearheading the beginning adult tap program for this studio.  She breaks every thing down in a very manageable way and is a lot of fun.  The entire staff is very personable and interesting.  I'll be signing up for more tap lessons today, and will attend other beginner classes to help my learning curve along.
