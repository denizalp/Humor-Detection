1. Front entrance staff way too arrogant given the early time of day and an empty club.\n\n2. For a Friday pool season, there is no excuse for bad DJs, especially peak set times, at a premier day club. One or both guys could not put two records together to save their life, let alone play a whole set. The DJ at Moorea Beach Club should've just played there instead.
