Shaved snow is one of my favorite desserts, so I stopped by to try the most popular spot in Vegas. I ordered two of their combos, the tropical mango and cookie dream. \n\nThe snow itself in both were nice and fluffy, but it was pretty standard. I'd suggest adding more toppings to the combos because it's pretty plain. The tropical mango didn't have mangoes but canned pineapples that was way too sweet and sugary. The cookie dream had chocolate drizzle and Oreos, but again was very plain tasting.
