Came here today to see if I could find some last minute things for Thanksgiving. I don't have a problem with (most of) the products they sell, but man! Talk about grumpy workers!! I bought some canned food for a food drive and the girl that checked me out today was banging the stuff down on the counter. Never cracked a smile. I guess that's what you expect when you shop at the 99 cent store. I'm gonna go drown my sorrows in a Dutch Bros coffee - at least THEY seem to actually LIKE their job.
