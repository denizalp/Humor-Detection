Would give a zero if possible.  Terrible service and grumpy workers. Took fifteen minutes to get a tea drink in which all the ingredients are pre made and just need to be poured. Good news is you have plenty of time to appreciate the pretty inside while waiting eternally for your drink. Would not recommend to anyone unless I dislike them
