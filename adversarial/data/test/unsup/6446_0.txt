Okay, you are on your break, I get it.  But why do you have to be so rude and argue that you were already in line when you were clearly stealing food from the bakery side.  All I wanted was to get my breakfast.  This employee lacks customer service.  She should not be working in customer service.  You should never argue and disagree with the customer.  I will never, ever, step in this store again.
