The best show in Vegas for a girls night out. Not raunchy like the male strip club. A fun show, with hot dudes that are really good dancers, dancing to fun music.... interactive with the crowd but not in a gross way.  My only complaint in the cocktail waitress was rude. But whatever, these dudes make and their dance moves make up for her. Do yourself a favor and just go! Now! Patrick and Lenny we will miss you!
