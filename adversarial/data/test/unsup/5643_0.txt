we were looking to kill time waiting for our bus, and after unsuccessfully trying to find a bar open on a sunday we were pointed in the direction of the nauti mermaid.  success! exactly what we were looking for in a bar.  good beer (they have hopslam!), friendly staff, and decor that doesn't feel cookie cutter.  i would recommend it to anyone visits cleveland.
