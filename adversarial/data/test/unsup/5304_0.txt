Delicious asian fusion.... is an understatement. This place has a lot of qualities I look for in a go to joint. Unique\/delicious food... Check. attentive and friendly staff.. Check. Cool atmosphere.. Check. Also a signature drink menu plus a two page wine menu.\n\nMust tries: Big Mac bao (play on the McDonald's staple), skate (seasonal), pumpkin ravioli (most interesting dish I've had in my life).wasnt a huge fan of the duck wings: they got pretty messy.\n\nVery good spot, I'll be back..
