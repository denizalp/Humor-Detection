I had a wonderful experience with Chef Kimberly and the secrets of healthy cooking. The class was small and the tips were insightful. I particularly enjoyed the shrimp salad... I never considered honey as a way to make salad dressing less salty. This class is great for weather you are a beginner or advanced in the kitchen.
