This Target is super convenient and has a lot of brands and clothing options. However, the store is FILTHY. The floors are so dirty in the cart area and every single aisle you're walking in something sticky, walking over actual dirt and trash in the MIDDLE OF THE AISLES.  It's so disgusting I barely want to shop. The aisles are a mess, some days it feels like I'm shopping at Ross or another store where cleanliness is not a priority. Do better Target.
