What a blast! \nI've never been to this golf thing before.\nGood friend of mine scored some passes and all the food and booze were FREE! \nLove to people watch which didn't disappoint.\nHaven't seen that much silicone all in one place before! \nI had 3 Bloody Mary's, 2 shots of Tequila, an Arnold Palmer, 2 Blue Moons, and I forget what else after that... glad someone else was driving so I could get my drink on! So much fun!
