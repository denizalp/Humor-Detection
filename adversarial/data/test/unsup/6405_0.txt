To me, this is the best casino in Summerlin. The smell of cigarette smoke isn't as strong here as the other casinos. Ultra clean and convenient too, as it is right between home and the office (within 5 minutes). I'm here almost every day. Rubio's, Yardhouse, Starbucks, Regal Theater, Red Rock Lanes, nice sports book - what more do you need? Oh, and another bonus - I occasionally run into family and long-lost friends here.
