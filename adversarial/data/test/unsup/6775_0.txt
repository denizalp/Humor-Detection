Of course I waited until 2 days before leaving to Europe to decide I needed some pants hemmed.  I brought them straight to Rashin where they had everything tailored to fit me in about an hour.  I returned the next day with my husband at 5:00 at night and she had everything done by 6:00.  Her work is fantastic and she is so happy to help.
