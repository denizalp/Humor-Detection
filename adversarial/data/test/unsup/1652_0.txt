The most approachable option in the Crystals complex.\n\nPaul Smith has always been a beloved brand of mine, but the San Francisco store leaves much to be desired both in size and in service. Thankfully the Crystals store satiated my needs for those beloved socks, and is staffed with incredible sales associates that will shoot the shit with you about other brands as much as they will about Paul Smith. Paul Smith's prices and designs are some of the most approachable in the Crystals, and the service backs that up.
