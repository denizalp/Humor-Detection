Cinnamon rolls are awesome, but the donuts are not up to par.  I ordered maple bacon on my 2nd visit expecting a sweet\/salty taste.  The donuts were more savory than sweet.  I do not like things overly sweet, but the donuts I recieved over many visits were just not sweet at all. I love donuts, but this place has been a disappointment,
