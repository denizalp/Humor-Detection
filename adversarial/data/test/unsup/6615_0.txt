More expensive than Petsmart or Walmart. They do have a few things that the two former stores do not carry.\n\nPoor customer service. Employees are weird. Sometimes they talk to each other instead of the customer...while the customer is right in front of them at the cash register. \n\nThey now have an attached grooming service. I don't know. I have just about given up on this place. Would be surprised if they are still around in 6 months.
