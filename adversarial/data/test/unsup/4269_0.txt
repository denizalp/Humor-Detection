I won't go into a lot fo detail.  All the people who gave this 1-star are a bunch of whiners.\n\nFor $6.99, it got the job done.  And I was there late, around 9:45.  Line is a mile long, so go early.\n\nPizza was terrible. Fine.  Everything else was okay.  Like I said, for $6.99 it was good enough.  better than the $25 we spent at Harrah's Cafe.\n\nSo this place gets 4-stars, taking into account the quality and price.
