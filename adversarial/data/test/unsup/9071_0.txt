This isn't a fully stocked Asian Market, especially if you're looking for ingredients for Thai cooking (for example, no galangal root, fresh lemongrass, or kaffir lime leaves for Tom Ka soup). The selection is better for Chinese ingredients. The cashier is unfriendly and is not interested in being helpful.
