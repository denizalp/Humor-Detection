Overrated and too expensive. My first edible arrangements was given to me for my wedding anniversary they were very pretty but only lasted one day they were soggy by the next and with the price it left me disappointed. I'm giving three stars since they are nice and it's not like you don't know what you're buying when you go in there.  I'm know I shouldn't have looked at the price of my gift ..... LOL thanks hubs.
