Gave this place a try on Thursday night! What a great stop. I enjoyed the naked beer they had on tap and grabbed an awesome burger to go with it. The burger was ground fresh in house cooked just the way I asked served on a pretzel bun and topped with some melted cheese. The burger was absolutely delicious and so juicy. It was served with some perfectly seasoned fresh cut fries. You are missing out if you don't give this place a try.
