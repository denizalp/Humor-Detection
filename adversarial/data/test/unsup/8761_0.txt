Our baby Chewy's first birthday was yesterday so I was browsing for some dog cake in the last minute and came acrossed with this dog bakery while I'm here in Yelp. We came few mins before they close and luckily found these yummy treats for our baby! Very affordable prices and of course healthy cookies, cakes, and treats for your fur loved ones.. Will surely gonna come back again!
