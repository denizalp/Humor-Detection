Olives provided us with a very tasty lunch with a wonderful view.\n\nWe had the fig and prosciutto flatbread to start with and that probably could have been enough with a salad.  But we pushed through and each had the butternut squash ravioli.  It was so worth the extra effort, and it's easy to see why that dish was one which helped make Todd English's name.\n\nI look forward to trying it for dinner at some point.
