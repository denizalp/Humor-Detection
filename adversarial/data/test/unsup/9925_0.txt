Sometimes you just have to take one for the team. I came here for a bachelor party. My friends bought one of the guys a dance but he wouldn't go. So I went. Now I'm sure you're all saying \"What? A free lap dance and you're complaining?\". In this case, yes. It wasn't pretty, it was awkward, and thankfully it was over quickly.\n\nAside from that it was a great time. Our waitress was by frequently and kept the rounds coming. The dancers weren't overly pushy and were quick to take off when you said no thanks.\n\nNov. 30-day challenge 40\/30
