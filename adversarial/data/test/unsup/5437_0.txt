Nasty receptionist. Not helpful at all when giving out directions and nasty attitude towards new customers! How about the hair stylist can not dry your hair because she doesn't have time. I guess there is a first time for everything. Don't try it unless you want a dose of nastiness to ruin your afternoon.
