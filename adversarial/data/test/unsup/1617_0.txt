I've gone here 3 times in 3 weeks?  It's pretty good.  My faves are the fish taco and one of the meat ones, but I totally forget the name.  I think it's Al pastor.  I agree with Al L, the Al Pastor was a little dry this week, but in previous weeks its been fine.  2 tacos are a good size for lunch.  I was pretty full afterwards.  My coworker got his taco with no onions.  I'm going to try that next time.\n\nIt's tasty here, and I'm totally coming back.
