I am rating this bar with a one star. They just had us pay for somebody elses bill. Which was $28.11 for what they claim was 1 shot of crown. I do not recommend this bar. We had a going away party and spent $100s of dollars. But because the bartender messed up we got charged $28.00 for one shot to fix their error.
