good service, good food, good atmosphere.... happy hour food and drinks are a great deal. I got the vbs filet mignon tournedo. Great meal, perfect combo with the heart of Palm sauce meat was a little over done but good. Calamari was awesome as well as the bacon wrapped shrimp... Karens a great waitress with awesome customer service. Accommodates each customer professionally. Any problems the owner takes care of it quickly and professionally... Will be coming back here soon. Great restaurant.
