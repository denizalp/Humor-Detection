I've been to this restaurant several times and have always been very satisfied with their options. The Samosa Chaat is a great appetizer that I would highly recommend. Some of their great entrees include the Chicken Biriyani, the Chicken Vindaloo, and the Dhaal Makaani all which can be had with either Naan or White Rice. The restaurant also has an authentic design as seen even in the design of the bathrooms and the service is phenomenal!
