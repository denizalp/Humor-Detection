This is the original Chinese Bun place in Toronto...I've been going here since when in Med School @ U of T we ate lunch here almost every day!\nThe most amazing thing about the place is the old man who runs it (now with his kids) looks identical to how he looked thirty years ago! Must  be some sort of fountain of youth in the buns!\nStill incredibly cheap prices.
