Met some friends for a birthday celebration and The Rousers were playing. I love live music but the volume inside The High Noon Saloon made my teeth rattle. It was SO LOUD that you couldn't talk unless you were 1 inch from the other person's ear. The good news is you can buy ear plugs at the bar. \n\nI heard the acoustics were bad and couldn't  agree more. It's really too bad. Don't think we'll be going back any time soon.
