We ate here when in town for a conference. It was a very nice place. Excellent service, wine, ambiance and food.\n\nI was expecting the place to be a bit more \"Italian,\" but that is probably my own ignorance. No worries though, I ordered the fillet and was absolutely not disappointed. I have had better (eeee face) but do not get me wrong, this was quite tasty.
