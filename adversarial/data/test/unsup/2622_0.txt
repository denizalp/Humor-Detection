For those of you who've lived in Tucson, Pete's Fish and Chips is probably the closest thing to Lucky Wishbone that you can find in Phoenix. \n\nEvery once in a while I stop in and get myself some scallops, shrimp, or crabettes with fries. Yes it's all deep fried and probably not very healthy, but sometimes that hits the spot.\n\nOh and remember, it's cash only but they don't take anything bigger than a $20!
