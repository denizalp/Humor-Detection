McCarran is quite good for an airport.  It's fairly easy to navigate and the luggage usually arrives fairly quickly.  The food is uneven across the various gates with some pretty good choices at the D gates and average choices at the B and C gates.  The noise level at the Terminal 1 baggage claim is quite high as the result of advertising for Las Vegas attractions.  The new terminal 3 is quite excellent, although you can end up with very long walks between various parts of the terminal.
