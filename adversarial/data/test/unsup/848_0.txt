I've heard nothing but great things about Bandera since I moved to Old Town, and I had to try this place for myself. It was fantastic!! The service was great, we were seated right away and our server was very friendly and helpful with recommendations. We started with the artichokes and had the carnitas sandwich and steak and enchilada for our entrees. Everything was amazing, but hands down, the carnitas sandwich was my favorite. The restaurant was packed but the level of service didn't change a bit. Can't wait to go back!
