Finally stopped in after passing this restaurant so many times over the years.  The Wedding Soup passed my wife's litmus evaluation with flying colors! We had the Quattro Stagoni Pizze which was vibrant with fresh ingredients.  Not the best we've ever had but very good pizza.  Coming back to try some Anitipasti which looked amazing!
