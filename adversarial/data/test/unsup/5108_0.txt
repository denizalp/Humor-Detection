I've been here several times for both lunch and dinner; every time the food was very tasty and generously portioned, and the service has been phenomenal. At one time my friends asked me to choose a place for a birthday dinner gathering and this is the restaurant I chose. They all agreed after dinner that it was an excellent choice. I know they'll be returning and that's a good thing; this is one business that deserves to stay, in this building in Melrose that has seen quite a few tenant eateries come and go.
