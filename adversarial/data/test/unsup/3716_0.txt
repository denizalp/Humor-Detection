The customer service at this salon has gone down hill and quick. Have been a client of Michael Sweet for 20+ years. He blew me off three times when I had scheduled appts because he wanted to leave early. Whatever happened to good customer service? I guess it is hard to come by now days. Most of my friends and family also quit going to Sweet Salon. I would not recommend this salon to my worst enemy. Check out other reviews looks like blowing clients off have became the rule not the exception, so sad...
