Family restaurant?\n\nNick's is one of the places I think of (fondly) when I reminisce about the many hours I spent with Cleveland's homeless population.  I also think of it as more of a hot-dog place than a restaurant, although it is kind of a breakfast place.\n\nIf you like gritty old-school places with greasy food, then you'll love this place.  If you don't like places like this, please don't come here and then complain about it.  You've already gentrified too much of the West Side; let the people have Lorain Avenue at least.
