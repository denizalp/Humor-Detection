Been a while since I reviewed this location. Been here a lot of times since my first review. Love this place! Staff is efficient and friendly, atmosphere is great and food is as good as it gets. Black Bear makes the best pancakes, cinnamon roll French Toast, onion rings, lava cake and bread pudding. Location is convenient, too.
