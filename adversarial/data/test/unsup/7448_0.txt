The BEST customer service in that whole auto mall. Went there 1st to check it out and was greeted by Jeremy Hassler. He treated us like we were the MOST important people in their lot that day. We went to a couple of other dealers there in the auto mall but in the end we went back to see Jeremy and made the purchase! Highly impressed with the whole team there at Avondale Nissan. I will recommend this place to anyone that asks me where I bought our car
