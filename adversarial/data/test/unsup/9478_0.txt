I am forced to rewrite my review because someone has complained. they didn't like what I wrote which pisses me off because I did not violate the guidelines on here. I told the truth and they don't like that. I'm sure it's someone from Country Hills Massage as they know I was very frustrated with my experience and told them they were not helpful. \n\nBottom line is this place has inexperienced therapists, the receptionist is rude, and I would never ever go back here. Don't waste your money on this place.
