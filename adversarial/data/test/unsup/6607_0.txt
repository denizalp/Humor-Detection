We kind of stumbled upon this place but we were glad we did. This is like the authentic pho you find in Chinatown, except you're in Henderson.. plus, the service is waaaaay better. Definitely a place to go if you're looking for some yummy Vietnamese dishes and for a good price! They've got certain lunch deals and they're definitely worth it. So is the bowl of pho. It's good sized and tastes super good! We also got the chicken wings and those were boooomb. We were so happy to have eaten here and will for sure come back!
