This is the only place you need to go for sushi. Stop reading other posts, just go. I don't know about all of the baked or fried rolls that they offer, but if you're seeking the freshest and most generous portions of nigiri, look no further. They typically have more uncommon specials that vary each week inclusive of giant clam, ocean trout, delicious uni. The service is the best you can get and there's never a wait so it's special treatment all the way. I come at least twice monthly. Delicious
