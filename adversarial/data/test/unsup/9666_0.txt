This is an awesome place. If you like shooting guns this is the place to come to. You do shoot blanks but you get to do tactical missions. You can choose different levels of missions and guns. You can choose a SWAT or Seal Team Mission. There is even a Zombie Survival package that I will be doing next time! This is the most fun I have had in a long time! I will come back next time I am in Vegas.
