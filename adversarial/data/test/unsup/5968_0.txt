My handsome steed, \nA Canadian Tire breed, \nWas in desperate need,\nOf repairs indeed!\nI took him to Gord, \nA fine bicycle lord,\nWho fixed the wiggly bits, \nAnd the brakes and gears that stick,     \nSurely did the trick,               \nHe was the perfect pick,       \nAnd all for a reasonable price, \nIf you want my advice,\nAnd a fella who's nice, \nDon't think twice,\nTake your bicycle to MetroCycle TO,      \nFor efficient service it's the place to go!
