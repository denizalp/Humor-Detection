Overall, I don't really have any complaints here. I always get fast and friendly service and you seem to get a lot of food for your money here. For example, I have to get the mini Chicken Katsu because the regular size one is way too much food. It's great if you don't mind taking leftovers home. I can't really comment on the authenticity of the Hawaiian-ness of the food but it tastes like any other \"Hawaiian\" joint.
