I decided to go here based on the other reviews.  I ordered the tacos (carne asada, pollo and pastor) and the pineapple drink.  The tacos are really small so I ordered 4 and was surprised that I was struggling to eat the 4th one.  The meat is really well-seasoned and the pineapple drink was the perfect sweetness.  This is authentic Mexican, not americanized Taco Bell type of Mexican food.  I will definitely be back!
