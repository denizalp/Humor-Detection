Stupid name, great place! This arena is the perfect size for concerts and hockey games. I like it much better than America Worst arena in downtown PHX. Plus, I like it here a lot better than arenas in L.A. and OC suck as Staples Center and Honda place in Anaheim. It's a smaller venue than those others in California, and like I said... It's a great size, not a bad seat on the house. The sound is really good for concerts as well, having seen Van Halen, Ozzy, The Who, and many more shows here.
