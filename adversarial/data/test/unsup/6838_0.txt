First, the upside; the meat was excellent.  The shrimp, not so much.\n\nCrowded and noisy it was hard to get to the salad bar without bumping into people, chairs, and tables.\n\nOverpriced.  I should have known that when they hand you a two-for-one coupon at the door.  I can't imagine that anyone would actually pay full price for this meal.  At half price it was too much.
