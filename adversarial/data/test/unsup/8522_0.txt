This place sucks. Waited over and hour and was never even asked one question, just told to sign in. Came in on a Saturday and there was only one wedding consultant. And the other consultants stood around while they had no one to help. Before we left we heard some one say they were there for their 4 pm appointment, when we were told over the phone we could NOT make appointments.\n\nThe staff is lazy, and not helpful at all. Instead of trying another men's warehouse we will be taking our services to another company completely.
