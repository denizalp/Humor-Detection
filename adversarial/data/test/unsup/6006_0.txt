This will be short. \n\nFood was decent. Not qreat but certainly edible. What's unacceptable are their prices. What, this restaurant's really in NYC and I just fantasized it was in River? \n\nGet serious, people. If you're going to charge prices like that you need to perform WAY close to the top of your game, and this wasn't even remotely there. \n\nPlayer's on Madison and Deagans on Detroit are two places that immediately come to mind where you can get better fish dishes for considerably less money. \n\nThis will be our last visit here. Simply not worth it.
