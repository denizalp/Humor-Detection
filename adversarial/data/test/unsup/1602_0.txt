So expensive but so good! I walked up around 2pm by myself and was able to find a seat at the bar right away, avoiding a 40 minute long line. It's on the 2nd floor of the Cosmo.\n\nI ordered the Rising Sun burger and a Grasshopper shake. Service was very fast and friendly.\n\nThe burger was super rich in flavor but you have to make sure you bite where the sauce is! The fries were wonderful and the shake was so good.
