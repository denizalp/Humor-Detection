ZERO STARS!! Ordered meal vua Door Dash, Fresh Millions TOTALLY LET ME DOWN!!! The Beef Hot Bowl was  so thick with noodles I could barely make out any other ingredients! I ordered 1\/2 noodles, 1\/2 spinch! Beef was probably 1 Tablespoon of Ground Beef, 1 slice of mushroom visible, 4 spinach leaves ( I requested 1\/2 noodles, 1\/2 spinach), 3 bean sprouts, no onions and hardly any Teriyaki sauce. NEVER AGAIN Fresh Millions!!!! You lost a BIG fan tonite!!!
