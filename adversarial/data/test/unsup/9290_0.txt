WORST DIM SUM ever!!! I am serious. The quality is worse than food court dim sum? am I making sense? Way too pricy for the type of quality. \n\n1) deep fried stuffs are oily \n2) shrimp har gao tasted sour which means left it out for too long\n3) steam beef smells very meaty - abnormal smell \n\nService is normal so I tipped the waitress fairly even though the food is not good at all. Definitely ruined my weekend lunch couple weeks ago!
