Since this CIBC is in Bayview Village, it has to be excessive. Well, it is. If you consider three ATMs excessive.\n\nThe bankers can be hit or miss. Some are nice and friendly and others are nice and snobby. But it's Bayview Village, so if you're all sad from a mean banker, you can just go to the Loblaws and buy yourself a nice big tub of ice cream. sshhhwwwingg.
