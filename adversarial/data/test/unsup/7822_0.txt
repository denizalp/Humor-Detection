This place was so good! The service was amazing, our server was so nice. I got the steak and mushroom scramble and it was what dreams were made of. The perfect marriage of tastes. I also got a side of pancakes. I am bariatric so I can't eat very much and the portions were huge so I had food for days! My friend got the veggie scramble and that was also amazing. Highly recommend!
