i know its corny, but living in nyc i really wanted to check out this casino\/hotel.\n\nthe replicated ny streets are fun to walk through, and the outside facade very well done (in a super tacky\/awesome vegas way).\n\nthat said, i prefer my neon fanny-packs to be on hipsters - and not fatties from nebraska.
