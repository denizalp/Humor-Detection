My car was damage when they took off the sticker off my windshield. They scrape off my windshield tint and refuse to take responsibility. I was paying for the car wash every month without the sticker.  I've talked to the owner which refused to take responsibility. I do not rememend anybody to this place who takes advantage of hard working people. I give them a one star because the owner is a crook and a lair.
