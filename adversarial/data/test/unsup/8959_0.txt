Awesome experience! Highly recommended for tourists within the area. Not something that I'd do repeatedly, but it was awesome, and a bit of an adventure. We took the one way ride uphill and stopped for photographs of the viewing area just after sundown. There city's skyline twinkled and it was truly beautiful to see. At the top, there are artifacts and other historical information on Pittsburg. Very enjoyable for guests. Prices are unbelievably reasonable and there is also parking nearby.
