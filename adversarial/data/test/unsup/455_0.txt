I don't mind to spend $$$ if the food worth it，however，I was not satisfied with food we got here. Since the disappointing dining experience，I gave this place two stars. To my surprise, the business owner left me a message the next day and his tone was full of sarcasm. I drop the rating to one star because of his attitude.
