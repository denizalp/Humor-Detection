I've been taking the train for 7 Years. Not once have I had a successful interaction at union station except for one agent. He looks like he possibly indian. He is calm and delightful to work with.  He's tall and seems to be tired but he exceeds my expectations each  time I deal with him. The train crew are always welcoming. Very positive crews on usually.  Thier job is very demanding so I understand the stress they are going through.
