I highly recommend this salon. I've been searching for a new salon without much success. Sisters and Co isn't far from where I live. It's very cute and clean inside. Stacey was my stylist and she did an amazing job! I love my hair! I can't wait to return to buy some products and get my next cut. Everyone is so friendly there also.
