I've read the reviews on MEB management. Granted I just moved in a week ago to Jamestown  apartments in phoenix, however the application process was pretty simple. They never asked any unusual questions. Giselle, the office manager is is so sweet! She was a pleasure to deal with. She not only has a wonderful personality, but she is extremely professional and very willing to help. While I can't comment on other properties, I am VERY happy with everything at Jamestown.
