This is my second time to a Brazilian steakhouse. Glad I went already because now I can say that this particular experience was not stellar. Meats were good but really needed a little more flavoring.The items on the cold\/salad bar were OK.  there were a few good things for example the couscous, mushrooms and beets but again the other items were really not that flavorful.\n\nAtmosphere was nice - it is in a little corner of the miracle mile.  \n\nPrice was pretty high.  $48 a piece.  Don't think it was really worth it.
