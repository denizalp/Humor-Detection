Beautiful place where my husband's cousin got married. It has a cathedral feeling to it and the court yard is beautiful to have a wedding ceremony. \n\nThe reception was held indoors and it was rather old and outdated, but it gave the wedding a rustic, whimsical feel to it. The restrooms are atrocious though, they need to fix that.
