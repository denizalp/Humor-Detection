The one thing that truly stood out besides the laid-back vibe of the restaurant is their bourbon lemonade. One is just not enough. And you can get them in pitchers. Need I say more?\n\nI'm a fan of their informal friendly style. The only menu is on a chalkboard at the front of the restaurant but the menu options are mouth watering. \n\nWe had the fish tacos and popcorn shrimp. I've had better tacos in Montreal but the popcorn shrimp was delicious. \n\nTry this place for a laid back bite to eat - just don't pass up the lemonade.
