We have eaten at china garden many times today was horrible service. We waited 30 minutes for are meal then they brought me the wrong dish and insisted that's what I ordered. So I sat and waited for my daughter to eat her dish. The owner was there but avoided our table. So I left there hungry!!! I will never eat there again
