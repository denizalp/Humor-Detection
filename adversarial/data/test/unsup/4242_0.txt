Let me paint a picture for you. I am 54 years old with bad knees and about 40 pounds over weight, not at all athletic. I have never tried Yoga before.  I saw the Groupon and thought \"What the Heck\". I have been amazed at how good the beginner classes have been, especially Nina's. I know I can't do everything but I am getting better and I feel great when I leave. It almost feels like I am leaving a Spa, very relaxed and renewed. I Highly recommend them.
