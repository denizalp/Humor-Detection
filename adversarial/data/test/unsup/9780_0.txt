Pretty good coffee drinks using Illy.  Not that jacked up of a price considering that it's Illy & in the hotel.  But service can be slow.  My friend waited for her breakfast sandwich for at least 20 minutes and clearly they forgot about her.  My turkey pesto sandwich with cheese didn't look like a bagel sandwich in the display case but it was.  It was pretty dry and bland sadly.\n\nJust come here to get coffee.
