Good  barbecue flavor  brisket and pulled pork was juicy, very good flavor in the meat.  I love great condiment bar! Very thoughtful set up for customers to get pickles, peppercinis and onion.  Barbecue sauce served in the table made by their own brand taste tangy and sweet for the mild, the hot flavor the hot wasn't so spicy, but good flavor. I will buy them if they were bottled, let's say it that way. Both has good consistency.  Good customer service, the person in the counter made great suggestions to us. \n\nThank you for the great Food
