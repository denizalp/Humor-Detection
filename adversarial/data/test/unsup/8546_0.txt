It's a lake. The water was purchased and used to fill the lake and interestingly, some 1.7 million gallons evaporate every day. I guess it's an important thing to have here for sightseeing and tourism, but wow, that's a lot of water going into the air.\n\nPaddleboats are available for rent and I did see a guy fishing. No idea if he caught anything.
