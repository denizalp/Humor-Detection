Friendly Donuts is a treasure of Henderson. It's a family-owned mom & pop shop that keeps it friendly, fresh and classic.  \n\nButtermilk, old fashioneds, apple fritters,  Bostons and glazed,  it's everything you'd want from your neighborhood donut shop.  There prices are good but make sure you have got cash.  No credit, debit or checks are accepted.  \n\nWe've been going to Friendly Donuts since moving to Henderson in 1997...20 years... and hope they'll be here at least another 20.
