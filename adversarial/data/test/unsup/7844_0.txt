DONT COME HERE!!!!\n\nI went into the restaurant chain wanting to use my promotion code on my phone, and the employees response was \"We are PRIVATELY OWNED, we don't use the app\". I can't believe this is true in ANY WAY? HOW CAN I NOT USE YOUR PROMOTION CODE AT YOUR OWN RESTAURANT? \n\nBTW Chick-fil-A @ downtown ASU campus......... I'm coming for you.\n\nPretty sure the original mormon founders of this company would not tolerate this type of horrible service.
