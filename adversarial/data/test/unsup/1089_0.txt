I'm heartbroken.  \n\nYou know, there comes a point when you add so much milk to the already cheeseless bleu cheese dressing, a very-necessary side to suicide wings if you ask me, when the entire point is lost.  If, after dipping, my wing is actually dripping with milk (rather than teasingly speckled with thick dressing), then I may as well forget the bleu cheese altogether.\n\nFix this, Loons.  Damn you.
