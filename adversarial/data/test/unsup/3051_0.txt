I lived in NNM for the first 24 years of my 28 year existence and this restaurant does not deserve to associate itself with New Mexican cuisine. Chile wasn't hot at all and didn't taste like much. You're better off heading over to Sonic and getting a green Chile cheeseburger now that they offer hatch green Chile. Really wanted to like this place because carlitos burritos is hit n miss and no place else to go. Looks like I'm sticking to my freezer full of Chile for now.
