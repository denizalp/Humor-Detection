What can you say about a place where you sit at the bar for 20 minutes, watching the bartender walk by several times, without so much as a hello?\n\nPerhaps this is just one of those \"cool\" places where you have to \"become welcome\" by suffering through an initiation period of neglect and disappointment. \n\nOr perhaps this place just sucks.\n\nToo bad, we stopped there because it has a great name. Maybe there is some way we can give this name to a better bar?
