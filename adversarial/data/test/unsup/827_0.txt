Went here because of a 2 hour wait for Wynn buffet that had been included with stay.  Like the rest of Wynn it is beautiful.   The chairs were very comfortable and you are right next to the casino. My wife and I shared a sausage pizza and a Cesar salad.  Salad had been just a salad.  Nothing great and had been expecting nothing more.  The pizza had been just ok.  The sausage on it was very good but the crust and sauce were not worth the price. Maybe I'm not fancy enough.  Service had been ok.
