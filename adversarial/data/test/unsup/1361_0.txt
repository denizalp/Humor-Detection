Awesome saloon! Went to this place for a after work get together! I may have used coupons to get my food and beer although it did not take away my bull riding experience! Watched YouTube videos for a few days on how to ride a bull but nothing can prepare you for this Beastly Bohemeth! I paid $40 and signed my life away and got to ride the Bull! I figured how many opportunities am I going to get riding a bull!?!? Awesome staff and supportive staff and bull fighters!
