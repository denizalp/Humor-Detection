I had such a great experience with Vegas Flooring Outlet. They have a great selection of flooring and let us shop around with no pressure. I found the perfect laminate flooring for my house. The installers did an amazing job and didn't rush through the job. It took about three days and the house looks gorgeous! Great customer service and attention to detail. I couldn't be happier.
