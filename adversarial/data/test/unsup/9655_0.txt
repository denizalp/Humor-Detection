Gaia is my go-to florist in Las Vegas. Whether for big occasion arrangements or little thinking-of-you gestures while away for work, they always come through and totally nail it. Best part: more than once they've put something together in the time it took to go pick up groceries, and if you're doing pickup versus delivery, it isn't impossible to get a day-of order on Valentine's Day. I'm always happy to support a downtown business -- especially when it's this good.
