First time at a Java Joes and the serving staff are really nice!  I got a latte and enjoyed every bit of it.  This location even serves Korean dishes! I didn't get a chance to try but will do so on my next visit.  Not too large a location so i can see it get busy (I went Sunday morning so it was bad at all).  Great place!
