Frist off worst customer service ever I asked if I can add extra meat to my combo the server said \"No we can't do that \" with an attitude. Not once did the server come check on us or offer a refill on our drinks. I over heard the two servers talking about how the other customers did not give a tip  The food was not good at all no flavor real bland I had to drown the meat in water down BBQ sauce. You are better off going to Rollin smokes barbecue
