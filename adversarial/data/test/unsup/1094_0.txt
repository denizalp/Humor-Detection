Super duper quick assessment and check in! OK maybe not that fast but still fast for a hospital. Went to get my lower back checked out and it took roughly an hour and half to get someone to check me out. Super quick! Although parking there can be quite some $$$ but hey its your health so! \n\nDon't mind the short wait times but don't want to come back haha
