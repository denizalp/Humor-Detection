Shocked by the $17 tab for the Manhattan that I ordered at the bar. While it was an upscale bourbon,  Blanton's, ( a $50 bottle at the PA state store),  felt ripped off.  Most expensive Manhattan in Pittsburgh!  For a moment, thought I was in Manhattan not the North Hills.  Overpriced drinks, average food and service. Tremendous drink and food scene 10-15 minutes south on Mcknight Rd. in the city.  It's worth the drive and will not disappointed like Blue North!
