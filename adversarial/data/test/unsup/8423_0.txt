Over priced with a small portions on your plate.  I got the mahi mahi plate one time i went there and i im eating 99% egg and 1% fish!! im like are you serious? worst hawaiian food restaurant in vegas....go somewhere else where you get what you paid for! go to Ross J's on Sunset...Decent price with alot on your plate.
