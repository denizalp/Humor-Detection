Fantastic food and atmosphere but the best part of Pita Island is the amazing staff they care about you and give great suggestions. I had never had a Pita before and was a little nervous trying one but this was some of the best food I have had. I would recommend any of my friends here and enjoy coming whenever I have a chance.
