This place has great sandwiches , period. The Pepperoni Melt is definitely my favorite . The specials are usually pretty bomb, too. Add the fact its steps from the pool....this gem is perfect on a hot summer day.  Seavian will order anything you need if they don't carry it . I wanted Peanut Butter M&Ms and a specific cat food and he immediately ordered it . They still have all the necessities ! If you live at or nearby Capri, this is the exact kind of place you will go to everyday .
