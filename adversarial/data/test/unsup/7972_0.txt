A non-food review. Had to sit at the bar because it was going to be a long wait, according to the hostess. Sat at the bar, ordered margaritas, then nothing. Looked at the food menu while we were waiting, and waiting, for the margaritas. We made our selection and waited for the bartender to come back. She never came back. She made other drinks, took orders from other customers and basically ignored us. We ended up leaving after 15 minutes. We never even got water.
