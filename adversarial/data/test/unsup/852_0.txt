We stopped in to Bar Cento for their yummy mussels and some beer.  They had a beer called 'Kwack', which was really, really tasty.  It was served in a glass that does not stand on its own, which was held up by a wood pedestal.  The beer was awesome and so were the mussels.  They have a happy hour from 12:30 - 5PM on Sundays, so stuff was cheap! \n\nTwas good!
