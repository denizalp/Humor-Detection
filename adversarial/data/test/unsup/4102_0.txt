I'm giving you 5 stars Kitchen because everytime I've gone to you, you've knocked my socks off.\n\nYour Napa Valley sandwich is absurd and should be noted as a controlled substance in Maricopa county.\n\nYour truffled grilled cheese is insane and should be locked up, in my stomach, for eternity. \n\nYou have the most impressive beverage selection I've seen in a long time and your employees actually know the difference between Moscato and Champagne.\n\nMe likey.
