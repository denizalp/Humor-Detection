I travel a lot, and dine in a wide variety of places from fancy to dives. This place was spot on. Food was good, came quickly and the variety for breakfast was amazing. From Crepes, Benedicts,  Omelettes, Srambles, and standard fare, everything was delicious. Our server was phenomenal and absolutely on top of it. We didn't have to ask for anything from extra napkins to water to the check.
