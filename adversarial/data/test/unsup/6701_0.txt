Cool little place to stop in a have a coffee drink, sweet treat, or gelato.  The menu said it right \"offers a cozy dining nook or sidewalk terrace to enjoy its house-made pastries...\".  Very accurate description.  There is a nice view of uptown from the patio and comfortable seating to people watch. \n\nI was hoping for a milkshake that day, but they only offer them certain times of the year.  I had a cup of gelato which was tasty...creamy and flavorful.\n\nThe staff was friendly.  Everything in the case was beautiful and looked so delicious and delightful!!
