This is the best Thai in Champaign\/ Urbana.  Had the staples... Crab Rangoon then Pad Thai....crab rangoon was crisp and thin with filling that wasn't the usual super sweet, it was sweet and savory!  Pad Thai was fresh and not greasy.   Food was amazing ,service was prompt and friendly..table and restaurant were clean.  \n\nI will go back and I recommend My Thai
