Dr. Balloonatic is the greatest balloon artist I have ever encountered.  We found him at Pot Liquor on a weekend evening and of course we couldn't pass up the opportunity to get balloons.  He asks if he can make something special for each kid rather than take orders (but he will do that too).  He created masterpieces.  If you need a balloon artist for an event do not hesitate to hire him.  Everyone will be extremely impressed!
