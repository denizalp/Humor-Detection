The place is dirty due to being busy. The bun bo hue was better and the rare steak pho was average. Their crispy rolls and fried shrimp rolls were also great. \n\nThe bottom line is no Pho has been able to beat the clean taste of the best Pho around in Morgan Hill, Ca called Simmering Pho Cafe. Unfortunately, they sold the resturant 4 months ago and no one will be able to taste this great healthy Pho.
