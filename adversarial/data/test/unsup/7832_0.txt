Give me some of that \"peanut butta sauce\"\n\nYou probably don't want this if you're not drunk, but otherwise, c'mon I don't care if it sounds gross to you, no one I know doesn't think this shit is delicious once they've tried it. Withhold your reservations, don't be a snob. Just ask to have some of that warm PB poured all over those greasy fried noodles then squirt some Sriracha and Soya sauce on it. Sounds good, no? That'll be 2 bucks.
