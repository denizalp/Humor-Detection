Four stars because I've only been here once, when I return a few more times I'm sure they get the final star.\n\nThis place reminds me of a European cafe. No frills, simple decor, and pleasant staff willing to help you make a decision.\n\nI had a breakfast burrito, forgot what it was called, it looked a little small on the plate but by the time I finished I was full and satisfied. Yummy.\n\nI wish this place had a bit more of a patio\/landscaping, just my 2 cents.
