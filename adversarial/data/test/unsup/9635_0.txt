Just picked up my car this morning from Meet Your Mechanic and couldn't be happier.  Louie, our mechanic, did a great job making the AC work like new in my 11 year old car, and charged much less than the dealer.  The best part is knowing who worked on the vehicle... a super nice, honest and ethical guy which is rare in this (or any) field.  We will definitely recommend Louie and his shop to anyone needing service and check with him before bringing our vehicles anywhere else.
