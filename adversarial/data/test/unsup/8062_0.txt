Perfect pancakes! Danielle was an amazing server! She was super friendly, attentive and made great recommendations for our first time! We tried the Adobo Fried Rice Omelet and the Banana Foster Pancakes. The omelet was delicious and full of flavor, but the pancakes were definitely my favorite part of the meal! Light, melt in your mouth pancakes with a sugary salty caramel on top with warm bananas and a perfect dollop of fresh homemade whip cream! Thanks for the great service and meal!
