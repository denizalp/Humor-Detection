I go to Shawn Denard's 2 Yoga classes and 2 Core classes. He is an exceptionally good instructor. His Yoga classes have helped me improve my stretching and breathing. His Core classes are extremely energetic and he pushes you to the maximum effort to improve. I also had him as a personal instructor for 6 months and made some important changes to physique and improved stamina. He is highly regarded by many current and past clients.
