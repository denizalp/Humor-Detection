We were excited to try when we had this spot recommended by a friend, but were let down. The ambience wasn't quite what we were hoping for- jt didn't have a great vibe and the service was so slow.  The only \"on top\" service were the service assistants \/ bus boys.The food wasn't anything special and was so overpriced for what we got. Tiny oysters for $22 for 6. Entrees were okay, not bad but definitely not great. Ended up spending close to $200 for sub par experience was not at all worth it.
