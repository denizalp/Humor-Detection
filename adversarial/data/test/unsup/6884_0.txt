I give them credit for how diligent the crew was and how accommodating towards our big party, but I did not really enjoy the food. Our group ordered a plethora of items and came across a few that even caught our attention. I prefer to stick to nigiri, but had a few pieces of the rolls. \n\nIf based on service alone, it would have been a four star experience even with all of the chaos. The whole group works in a restaurant and know how strenuous a group of twenty can be. They were great on that end.
