So im visiting my Grandpa this week and wanted to buy him a nice bottle of Scotch from this place. I normally dont drink so have no idea what brands are good so I went to the counter to ask for help, some worker named Tony was there. I tried asking him some questions and he was extremely rude and unhelpful. He made me feel like I should have known the questions I was asking. Will never come back here again, literally.
