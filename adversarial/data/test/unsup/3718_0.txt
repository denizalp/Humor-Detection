I own \"Harmony\" and \"Guardian Angel\" by Peter Lik. I bought these pieces from the Caesar's Forum Shops gallery in Las Vegas. Lik's  work is absolutely breathtaking and intoxicating. I'm very proud to showcase his work in my home. I did not buy his art for investment purposes, but am comforted to know that his work will appreciate over time.
