This review is for a poor access to this already remote restaurant. Unless you stay at the hotel, consider other dinning choices near the strip.\n\nAfter a pretty good dinning experience, we took Lyft\/Uber back to our hotel, the Wynn. The restaurants drop-off for ride sharing is a far far walk, in hot and dingy spot. This shows poor understanding of your guests preferences and forcing upon us your personal preference: rude, expensive and dirty taxis.\n\nSo avoid until there is a better way if getting back to the strip.
