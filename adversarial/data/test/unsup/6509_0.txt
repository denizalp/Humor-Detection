A good place to satisfy your cravings for shave snow if you are in Vegas. There is a variety of flavors and you get the option of creating your own bowl. I got black sesame with red bean on top and my friend got the mango flavor with mochi toppings. The interior had around 3 tables with a few seatings. Although the parking lot was large, we had to park across the street since all the spots were filled. Overall, I was pretty happy with the shave snow here.
