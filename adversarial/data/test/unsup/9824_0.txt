I went with the hubby to get prints done for his new job. At first I was taken back by the mom & daughter interaction being so casual so I just put my nose to my iPhone ignoring their conversation. The father came in and struck up conversation and was hilarious. They all are. We were only there for 15 mins, but left with smiles. Very funny crowd and make you feel so comfortable.
