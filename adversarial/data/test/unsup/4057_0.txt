Breakfast burrito.  This is my favorite item here.  Gluten free pancakes if that's your thing, veggie omelette very different.  Packed w whole fresh veggies.  Really good, opposite of a greasy omelette.\n\nWhat a quaint place off town center, sweet music, great lighting.\n\nI had to write a review on this place, it has been getting weird reviews lately.  I would def check it out.
