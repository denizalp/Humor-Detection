Finally tried Jardin at the Encore and we cannot wait to go back next year.  Since I am a pescatarian, breakfasts while on vacation can be lackluster and tend to be either a bagel with lox or eggs and toast.  At Jardin, we ordered the Maine Lobster Benedict and the Kale Scramble.  The Main Lobster Benedict was near perfection and just melted in my mouth. Highly recommended.  My husband enjoyed his Kale Scramble and it was flavorful and satisfying. I fully appreciate the restaurants at Wynn\/Encore offering quite a few options for non-meat eaters.
