I ws not impressed. First of all very loud, poor service and the poor health inmspections do not spell fun to me. Both times I went was on the insistance of others and nothing special, can't hear people at your table and again did I mention that they put their clients health at risk. I guess it's the whole lemming mentallity in Charlotte, if someone tells them it's good it is
