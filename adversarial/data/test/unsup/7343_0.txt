I LOVE YOU MARQUEE for having a hip hop room!! As true Bay Area girls, my friends and I were thrilled to step inside the hip hop room. O how I've missed T-Pain's synthesized voice at clubs!\n\nadd that to nice bouncers (unlike XS's spit hurling ones) and a HUGE dance floor....you're bound to have an unforgettable or rather, a FORGETTABLE night ;)
