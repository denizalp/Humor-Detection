3 floors and outdoor seating to this pasty specialty and tap beer restaurant\/bar. Bartender Sean took such good care of us. He recommended beers and even split a huge Shepherds pasty, one half for now and the other half  to-go for later. Very satisfying and filling. Beautiful Phoenix night. Fun and yummy food. They also have wings, greek spinach snacks and other tasty appetizers. Desserts, too.
