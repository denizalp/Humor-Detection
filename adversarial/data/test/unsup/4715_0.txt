It's a very small place but the food it's great. The portion of the dishes are definitely full filling. My favorite thing on the menu are the shrimp tacos in which the shrimp it's cut into small pieces and serve on hand made tortillas. Hadn't found a place they served shrimp tacos that way, so it was really nice having them that way. The server is super nice so you feel very welcome. :)
