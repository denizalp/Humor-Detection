Nice atmosphere. A little disappointed that the coffee is pre brewed- my coffee was lukewarm\/cold. However, they seem to have a good selection outside of coffee including a smoothie, breakfast and lunch menu, and serve Wild Tonic Kombucha on tap and Red Bull. Perhaps I will come back to try their food selection as well as their Nitro Coffee on tap.
