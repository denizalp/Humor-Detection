Everyone was very satisfied with their appetizers and entrees.... the food was prepared and presented wonderfully. The ambiance is very invited but quite noisy because of the high ceilings and open space. We went to the Yorkville location which is perfect for a stroll afterwards. I would highly recommend it even if they forgot to acknowledge my daughters birthday which I specified upon booking and also to the hostess.
