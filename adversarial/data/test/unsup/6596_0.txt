Canadian dim sum.\n\nI'm Chinese. I have a pretty high standard. My momma makes dim sum. I've even had dim sum from Hong Kong. So, this dim sum didn't really rock my world. BUT, it's pretty dang authentic dim sum. I'm sure this is a spot lots of Chinese in Quebec come to. I came here after running a race and boy, did it hit the spot. Grease, carbs, and chicken feet. That's all you need.\n\nTips: The staff are fluent in Mandarin, Cantonese, English, and French. That's so crazy to me.
