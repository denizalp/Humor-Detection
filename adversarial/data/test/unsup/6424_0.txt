Incredible service, honest, professional and did I say honest?!!!!   My elderly father was scammed by another company who outright lied to him about necessary repair to his air conditioning system.   Pat came out and gave a thorough and honest quote and he replaced a fan motor on the spot which fixed the problem immediately - at a cost several thousand less than the scam company.   Highly recommended - honest and trustworthy service you can count on.
