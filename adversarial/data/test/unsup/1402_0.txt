I've been here several times and have yet to be disappointed. I always order the same thing: kale salad, a couple of bacon wrapped dates and the four cheese pizza. For two people, this is more than enough food. The patio is fun for people watching. The last time, we saw an almost car accident and a few pedestrians ask if they could try our pizza. The only negative is the obnoxious sound of super loud motorcycles, but hopefully with the new noise bylaw, this will disappear. Still one more month of patio weather!
