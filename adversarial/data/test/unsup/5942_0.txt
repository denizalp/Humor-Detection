I came here for the tan tan men.\nSadly, I ordered to go so I did not have the availability of the chilis and oil, available at the restaurant. \nIt was soo heavenly! The flavor of the brother is so rich and complex with a nutty earthy flavor. My boyfriend loved it too! We will definitely be coming back. :)
