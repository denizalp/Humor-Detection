Went to check out this hotel for a potential site for our combined family reunion\/ wedding this summer. Hotel is an older properly but well maintained, no trash floors kept clean, room was a towel Royal queen not a great view but didn't stay there much anyways. Room clean and beds comfy. Pool was large with three separate and another adult pool plenty of chairs. Looked at Chapel for up coming Wedding was beautiful !!! Can't wait, hotel staff friendly. Game room had plenty of games.
