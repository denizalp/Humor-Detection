I join others in feeling ripped off by this organization. First, it was a major pita trying to find a dentist that would accept it, then,  I was promised that they would cover a procedure at a higher rate than Delta Dental, when, in fact, they denied the claim.  Next, they denied a simple cleaning for \"Frequency Limitations\"\n\nI would advise against purchasing this insurance as they only accept payments, and do not pay claims.  Even the dentist that accepts this insurance says they are a pita to work with.\n\nTDA - you suck.
