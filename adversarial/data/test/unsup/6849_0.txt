On tour this happened to be my day to write a column for a magazine on what we're eating on tour, and I stumble across this gem.  Huge space, sports TV everywhere, large bar area, great staff.  Oh and they make their own kettle chips!\nMy bacon burger was great, microbrews on tap, a great meal!\nNear the HOB in Cleveland walk down a block and grab a bite before a show!
