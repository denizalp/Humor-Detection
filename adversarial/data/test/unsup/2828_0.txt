First time here and I enjoyed the atmosphere. The menu has a variety of food including the sustainable salmon which I support and was happy to see on the menu. Served by the server Asya who was very friendly and polite and offered a ballot for a chance to win an all paid for trip. I will definitely come back here especially since it's right by the ACC so we'll be celebrating some raptors wins here!
