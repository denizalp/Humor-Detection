The food was incredibly bland. I was expecting gourmet and fresh ingredients, instead I found myself eating food that could have been served from a concession stand at a little league baseball game.\n\nThe ground beef was unseasoned, the tomatoes dry, the lettuce bagged, and chips old and stale. \n\nUnless you're drunk and need some sustenance, I'd refrain from eating here. This place no doubt makes Lakewood's worst restaurants list.
