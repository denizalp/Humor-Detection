Total Scam. Dont believe the fake reviews or \"filtered\" reviews. This place is everything thats wrong with vegas. Hope everyone involved in this place dies of gonorrhea and rots in hell. \n\nThe cab drivers come back after they drop you off to collect a portion of the money. \n\n\n\"biggest scam in vegas\"\n\nOk had to edit my review because I linked another page with a bunch of reviews about how terrible this place is and how its a scam. Convenient that yelp wants to filter this page...are they in on the take?
