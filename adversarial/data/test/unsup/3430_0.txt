Cafe Myriade is a cute little coffee shop serving 49th Parallel Coffee.\n\nComing here with high expectation and was a little disappointed!\n\nBoth Americano and Cappuccino we ordered were both overly fruity to even sour.\n\nThe search of a great cup of espresso drink continues....maybe I just stuck to drinking beers!
