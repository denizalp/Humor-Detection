This place is always crowded.  It seems as though TownSquare is the new hip spot at the moment as I write this.  Plenty of beers to choose from.  I probably haven't heard of 70% of the beers on the list.  The food's pretty good, and the prices are decent.  It would be a lot better if there weren't so many people, but I guess that's how it goes now.
