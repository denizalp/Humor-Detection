Super kudos to the manager working tonight, Holly.  I had three separate issues\/gripes which she addressed very professionally.  As I was shopping, she came up and gave me a $3 coupon for my inconvenience.   Notice to corporate-- this is the kind of customer service you should strive for in all your stores.\n\nThis store has definitely stepped up its look and its staff.  The trainers here have also been super nice\/helpful
