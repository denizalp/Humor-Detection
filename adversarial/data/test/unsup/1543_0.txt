My first experience with Encore has been absolutely horrible. As we checked in we were helped by Victoria whom throughout the entire transaction did not have a smile on her face. She was very rude while answering our questions. I will tell everyone about this terrible experience so that they don't encounter this. Never come here again especially while paying so much for a fancy hotel! VICTORIA is the worst!! I would put a 0 start if I could.
