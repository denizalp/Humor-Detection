I've been here a few times. Service is always friendly. One time I had to pay $5 for a box for shipping, which seems reasonable.... Except I saw her pull it from their recycle. The box had clearly been used many times. \n\nI am happy they are reusing, as it's better for the environment, but being charged $5 for it seems quite outlandish.
