one Word....EEEEWWWW!!!!\n\nThis place is like a nursing home cafeteria. The Food and the customers!\n\nBeing called a pancake house I thought that the pancakes would be good....instead I got old dry crumbly and cold cakes...... my omelet was more of a scramble and the eggs were browned and slimy... is that even possible?UGH!\n\nI'll NEVER eat there again!! \n\nIf there was a choice for no stars they'd be getting that.\n\nAnd all I can say is anyone who thinks this place is great needs to quit drinking!
