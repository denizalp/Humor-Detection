Tv is the worst. Nothing but basic cable. Can't order movies. No pay-per-view or ondemand menu at all. Can technically sign into personal Netflix account but it keeps showing an error message every 2 minutes because it can't connect to the internet. \n\nIce machine is broken on the floor. Fire alarm checks  for three hours with no advance notice.\n\nBut all in all a nice hotel. Good location, except when there's a major event at the rogers center.
