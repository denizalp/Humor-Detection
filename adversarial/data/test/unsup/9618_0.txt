I'm not going to lie -- I mainly go here for the bread (if you go at an off-time, it will be fresh out of the oven and soooo lovely) and cheesy olive oil (mmmmmm) combined with the nice wine list. Each time I go, I order a dish to justify eating all their bread -- I have had a pizza, the caprese salad, and the goat cheese trio -- but I wouldn't order any of those things again. I'll keep trying, though, because the bread haunts me, and the service is excellent.
