The guys behind the counter are really nice and the sauces were delicious: spicy ranch and sweet chili had just the right amount of heat.\n\nHowever, my chicken tenders (which they did give me extras of! Very nice) were unevenly cooked and pretty dry. I had to douse them in sauce to chew them. As nice as the service was, I would expect a place that specializes in chicken tenders to ensure that their tenders weren't dry....so unfortunately even though the sauces, thin matchstick French fries, and service were excellent, I wouldn't return to this place.m
