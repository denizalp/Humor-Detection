Why review a chain restaurant?  Only to point out any significant variations from the norm.\n\nThe only way this KFC deviates is that it's slower.  Consistently.  I've been here to buy a couple small dinners and been asked to wait - \"we're out of chicken\".  Yesterday we wanted 30 pcs of chicken for a picnic.  I can understand waiting a little while for 30 pcs, but we waited every bit of 30 minutes.  And they weren't insanely busy.  It's summer time; weather is good; people picnic during good weather; have more chicken ready.
