I have been going here for the past 7 years. I take my children here also.\n\nDr. Gordon is great. We love her personality. She was very calming to my children and they trust her now.\n\nThe hygienists have always been very professional too.\n\nAnother person who is the first and last person you will talk to is the office manager Tyrone. His personality and professionalism makes him a real asset to them.\n\nIf you are looking for a dentist in the Green Valley area, I highly recommend them.
