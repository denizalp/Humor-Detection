Definitely love the ambiance and a great place to sit and chat and have a few drinks and pick at food. The food was good, the dishes chosen were quite different, next time I am back in town I'd definitely have to come again and try other dishes that.l be recommended. Wasn't wow for the pizza it was super soggy. I'd have to say I've had better pasta but I love pasta so it really can't go wrong for me. I'll try again on my next trip back out
