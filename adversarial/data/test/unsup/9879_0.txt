This is actually an above average T-Bird location. It's kinda divey. The beer offerings are really meh. But the bartenders are friendly and attentive. And the food seems to be tastier here. It doesn't get too loud or crowded either. So if you've gotta hang out a T-Bird, this location is one of the better options.
