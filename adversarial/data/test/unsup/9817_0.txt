Google and Yelp claim its on Huron, but its actually in the Tower City Mall.  \n\nThis place is scary.  We made an appointment to get a quick mani before we went to a wedding, and from the mall entrance you can smell the toxins running out of that store.  This place is generally for acrylics and it was very grimey with poor nail color selection.  \n\nUtimately, we walked out of there because it was so filthy.
