Saturday morning at 530 we arrived in the drive thru and were the 3rd in line. Didn't have to wait long. As a mother of a teenager who LOVES Dutch Bros, I find it to be a bit expensive, however flavors and variety and friendly staff allow for it. Tried our 1st pup cup with our Lab and she loved it and kept her occupied in the car.
