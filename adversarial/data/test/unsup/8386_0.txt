I have lived in such style capitals as Paris, London, LA and NYC. Never have I been asked to give my credit card over the phone to reserve an appointment or come in ahead of time to put a cash deposit down. Ridiculous! I understand that no-shows are a problem for many salons but this is the quickest way to alienate potential clients.
