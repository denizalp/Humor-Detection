Tried this place for after-dinner drinks and dessert this weekend. Loved that they had live music, loved the ambiance and yeah for the great service. \n\nYes it's not cheap, but it's fair. We got a bottle of malbec and the brownie a la mode - yummy! The place is cozy and I would definitely go again. We don't have that many choices for wine bars here in CLT - so far, it's on top for me!
