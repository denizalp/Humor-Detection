I have travelled a lot in my life so far and have been to a gazillion airports from places with 2 gates to your Frankfurts, JFKs, and LAXs of the world.  McCarran is and will always be my favorite.  It is easy to get around between the gates, your luggage comes out quick, and there is actually things to do when you are waiting for your flight and not just slots either.
