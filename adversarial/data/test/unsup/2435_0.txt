This is definitely my new favorite place to grab a drink and get some work done! There are MANY plugs for your computer\/phone\/ipad charging needs! I also love how this coffee shop has 2 stories! The back area on the second floor is definitely very productivity-inducing :) I ordered the chai latte, which was not the best latte I've had but it was pretty decent! I definitely agree with previous reviews about how this place can get loud. It's nothing that a pair of headphones\/ear plugs can't solve :)
