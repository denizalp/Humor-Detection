This place is healthy, quick, reasonably priced, and the staff is really friendly.\n\nI stopped for to try an açaí bowl at lunch.  I got the Frutta sub chia seeds for coconut flakes.  It was incredible.   I was almost licking the bowl.\n\nThey have a rewards program that you can easily sign up for when you order.  You can also place your order online for pick up.  I liked the music they were playing the the background!  There is a cute patio that you can sit out on and enjoy your bowl.  I will be back!
