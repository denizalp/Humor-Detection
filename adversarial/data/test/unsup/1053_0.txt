We wanted to eat where the locals eat and this place  was amazing and had reasonable prices.  My husband ordered the carrot cake pancakes...super delicious. The red velvet was also very yummy. Large portions. Friendly staff and fast food service. Next time I visit Las Vegas I will definitely eat there again.
