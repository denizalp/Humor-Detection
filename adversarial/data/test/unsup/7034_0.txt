My roommate and I went here for our monthly roomie dinner, because I drive past it everyday for work.  \n\nThis is probably our favorite place we have gone to thus far, this year!  The food was fantastic! Our server was PHENOMENAL! I do not even like tequila, and he recommended something to try and I  even liked it! \n\nBeing able to order tacos a la carte is such a great way to try all the different ones! Pork belly is my favorite! \n\nThe atmosphere is really cool vibe as well!\n\nGet a bunch of friends together and check it out!
