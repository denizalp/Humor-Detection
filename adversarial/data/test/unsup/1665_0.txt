I got take away and was really disappointed. The flavor was missing from my food, which was really odd since I thought General Tso's Chicken is usually a spicy dish. It wasn't spicy. It wasn't sweet. It really didn't taste like much. Some of the chicken was not edible. Thrown in with all the chicken were a few pieces of broccoli drowned and therefore saturated in the chicken's no doubt sugar laden sauce. I won't be returning here.
