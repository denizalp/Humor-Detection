Good food.\nOutrageous prices.\n13$ for the cheapest glass of wine.\nThe ingredients used are low quality but with a fancy twist .\nThe environment and service is great but we left feeling very ripped off.\nMy wife had a flat iron steak which was low quality meat but they charged us 27$!! Which is basically the price of a filet mignon I'm some places.\nI had shrimp with the head on.\n6 shrimps,(medium size) 20$!!!
