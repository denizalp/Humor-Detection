Super large plush reclining chairs. The wall railing cut off like the bottom four inches of the screen unless i sat straight up. I also sat on the very back, so the wall may be taller back there?\n\nService was quick and friendly.\n\nParmesean fries were potent with the parmesean smell and pretty tasty.\n\nThis place is comparable to the studio movie grill.... But a bit more intimate.
