If you come to eat, ask to be seated in John John's section.  He's the most amazing waiter I've ever had in my 56 years on this planet.  Your drinks are replaced before they're empty.  Food is brought out immediately.  Drop a napkin, John John will have a new napkin on your table before the old one hits the ground.  He definitely made our experience there one we will never forget.  Amazing waiter. Thanks John John!
