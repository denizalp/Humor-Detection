I work in a popular breakfast joint and when people tell me the wait is too long, I point them in the direction of the OG breakfast house. It is small, local, and they seem to have sustainability in mind. The service is great, friendly but never too much. Their biscuits are made in house and they have fresh squeezed OJ. The wait is never too long, especially if you come before 9am. If you love breakfast and supporting your local businesses, than this is a great place for you.
