Absolutely horrible. They don't take you seriously and they treat you like you are lying. They are also lazy. They are just assholes, all of them! They are a bunch of sociopaths! I was treated with complete disrespect and disregard when I reported something. They were asking some pretty ridiculous questions like, \"What medications are you taking?\"
