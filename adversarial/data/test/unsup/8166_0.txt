Ballin' location! The richness of the area lends to some pretty high end items lurking around the white trash garments: Ferragamo, Chanel, Coach, all at the patented Winners price. On the classic Winners plastic hangers. Strewn around all over the place, sometimes even on the floor! I did find a pretty sweet pair of Nudie jeans here, and of course Westhills in general is a good place to spend a day shopping. If you are a guy, and you love UFC and brovine styles, Winners is the place to go.
