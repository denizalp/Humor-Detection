Very very very slow. Drivethru has gotten my drink wrong multiple times. Also though the baristas are friendly when you go inside to the cafe the drinks seem to take longer to make than other locations. I do like the actual seating in the cafe better than other Starbucks in the area but all the issues you encounter getting your drink doesn't make it worth it
