Just had the California Omelette. Would get it again but without the Goat Cheese. My wife had the Home Skillet and liked it. Waiter Keith was great, very attentive. Biggest complaint: $7.77 Surf and Turf no longer comes with a salad. You can add a salad for $3.99 if you would like. I chose not to out of my own stupid little protest. I really loved that little salad with Bleu Cheese Dressing. Even with adding a salad it is still less expensive than many other items. I hope management will reconsider and bring the salad back.
