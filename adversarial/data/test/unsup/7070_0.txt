Been here multiple times because of my Hybrid and they've been helpful and quick. Definitely accurate. Here now to check what another shop may have screwed up and now I'm spending more money than fucking intended! I feel as if I should get some sort of compensation for the trouble. Because if this is going to cost me more money that other shop is getting roasted majorly! Should've listened to my instincts and gone here in the first place!\n\nJust wish prices weren't so high...but it's the dealership...
