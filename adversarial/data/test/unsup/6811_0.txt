Really good Gluten free pizza. \n\nIt's almost unlimited toppings! \nThey said there is a limit however I asked for extra pepperoni and other items and there was no problem. \n\nOverall good pizza, you pick which crust you want then start with the sauce, what veggies and then meat and other items you want. \n\nFast service friendly and good price, for a Gluten free pizza it was $13.40 so not bad and I think it's a 10\" pizza. \n\nIt's right beside a Chipotle grill walking distance from Ballys Casino.
