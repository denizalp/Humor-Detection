Was up the street having lunch with the GF when we started having a conversation about an Idaho brewery I was craving and she was yet to try.  Having faintly remembered seeing this location in the past, I pulled out the yelp app which confirmed my original suspicions.\n\nThis location is large and roomy.  We perused  the beer section and Idaho brewery in question could not be located.  We settled on another brand.  The large and roomy space made it simple to locate another spirited purchase and we were out the door.\n\nCustomer service was friendly enough as was the prices.
