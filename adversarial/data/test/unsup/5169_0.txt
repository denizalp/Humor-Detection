When sleepless in Vegas... and hungry..........\nThis is the perfect spot to unwind after a long day. We arrived at the cafe at 3am and ordered a couple of drinks appetizers and salads. The service staff was very attentive and polite. The atmosphere was one of the most memorable settings of our dining experiences. Iron patio railings, antique lamp posts and beautifully painted sky ceilings all created the perfect little Italy at 3am.
