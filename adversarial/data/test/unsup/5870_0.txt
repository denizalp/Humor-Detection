As of Feb 2014, all prices at this airport location have gone up by at least 30% across the board. $11 for a dinky 7.5 inch Quiznos sub? No thanks. Very disappointing!\n\nI used to always grab a chili and a sandwich from here for non meal service flights, but I refuse to support the new price gouging going on here. There's even a new handwritten sign above the soda fountain that reads \"Refills are 85 cents\". Come on, man!
