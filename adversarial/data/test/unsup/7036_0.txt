If you're looking for a good burger, at a decent price, Holsteins is the place to go.\n\nWith that said...if you're looking for an amazing burger at an OK price, go across the street to Gordon Ramsay Burger. \n\nAfter going with a group of friends and trying them both in the same night, everyone agreed Ramsay beat Holsteins (even their Kobe beef)...\n\nGranted, we spent much less at Holsteins, and they had some crazy looking diabetes shakes, so if value is your thing, Holsteins does provide slightly better value.
