What a great place for a salad! Plenty to choose from, & you can pile a ton on your plate for a one time go through. It's $5.99 a plate, $2 more for all you can eat! They also have a place to sit, be waited on & get drinks. \nNext to their salad bar is an olive & Buffalo wings bat that also includes boneless wings. Quick, easy, with a lot of variety. Way to go Hy-Vee!
