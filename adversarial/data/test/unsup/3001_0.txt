Nice place to go shooting, but a little on the cramped side when you are on the range. The staff is friendly and helpful. We paid for a lesson, but our instructor, who was in high school, chatted with us more about everything in her life than how we can learn to shoot better. We really didn't improve on our skills at all, but we enjoyed the range.
