Yes Yes Yes Yes YES!  Finally ! Sittin' outside eating fantasitc BBQ ribs and potato salad and mac n cheese and OMG the sauce!  mmmmmhmmm.... no lie - you can't pass it up... I wanted to stay and listen to the blues for hours but it was too late, they close at 10.  Honestly, I would've ordered a beer or two and sat around if I had the chance.  And they totally make you feel like you can stay - no rush for sure.  Great chattin' w the owner and workers... what more do you want at a BBQ?!!!
