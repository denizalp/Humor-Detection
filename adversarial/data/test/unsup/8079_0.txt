Taste: 4.7 The rice was very tasty! The fish was fresh (do they have a pond behind the restaurant?)! One person in our party: \"It was very good. I just felt like the shrimp tasted a little like a plastic bag. Spicy tuna was phenomenal. Best spicy tuna.\"\n\nService: 4.1 There was a mix-up with the mix-ins, and multitasking didn't work out well. \n\nPresentation: 4.9 very organized. Colorful. Appetizing. Straightforward. Ingenious. \n\nAtmosphere: 2.2 Not very pretty. Small. Not a lot of space. Loud music. Chairs, weird.
