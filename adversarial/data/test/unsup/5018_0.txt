About every six weeks, my eyebrows are on the verge of appearing more like hairy werewolf beasts and head on over to Traditions of India. Yes, it's located not far from the Costco entrance in Christown Mall but for the charge of $10 for eyebrows and a simply clean up, why not?  I highly recommend this place. Cheers***
