This place is great and it's easy for locals to get to.  If you are looking for a spa that's on the strip and that is away from the hustle and bustle of Vegas, this is the one to go to.  They give a discount for military and for locals and the staff is very professional and experienced.  I wouldn't go anywhere else!
