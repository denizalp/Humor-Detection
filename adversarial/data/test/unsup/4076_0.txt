Good club. Cushy, comfortable seating. The seating has a dark, tucked away feel for the customers. Great main stage and talented strippers. Cute, classy girls. Next to Olympic Gardens, Treasures is my other gentleman's club of choice unless I really want to get down and dirty in which case it's Palamino Club.
