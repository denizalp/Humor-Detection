I just checked in and got charge a resort fee of $180 for 2 nights which is 30% of the total bill. The fee was absolutely not advertised during the booking process. The desk representative couldn't tell me what was the purpose of this fee. These practices are unfair to the consumer and should be stopped or at least advertised appropriately.
