A low review because I found the service to be awful and the food was just okay. My wife and I were out with a friend and ordered 3 simple pasta dishes. When our food came we asked for some parmesan cheese for the pasta and for more water. Wait staff never return with parmesan or water until I had to get up to ask for our check. We spoke with the assistant manager about the poor service. We will be giving our hard earned money to better service and food.
