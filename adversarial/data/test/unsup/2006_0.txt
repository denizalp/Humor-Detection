Going to the Brillo Box after you've lived in Brooklyn for a year is being asked five hundred times \"Isn't this like Brooklyn?!?!\"\n\nNo. \nIt's not like Brooklyn,\nIt's like the some tryhard joint in the fuckin LES with trees and projection cartoons and god damn.\n\nTheir drinks were okay. And cheapish.
