Honey, it's high up here!! \nSo, for the faint of heart, you should DEFINITELY come here. HAHA. :)\n\nFor $5.00, your fear of heights will be instantly cured. NOT. \nIt's scarier going up than down -- just don't think about how long it's been around. \n\nHOWEVER, you'll never get these amazing views without going on this. \nSO... you really should come and do it once. Then you run away squeaking.
