Thank god for this tram!! honestly helped my feets and legs after walking the strip for a few days..what a relief! i forgot about this lil part of transportation which wouldve helped me with all the shopping i did but remembered later (so forgetful of me)! please dont forget about this lil sweet spot in vegas...very very very very useful!!
