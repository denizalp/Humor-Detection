The ambiance in this place is very cool. The location is great, and they have a pretty solid wine list. The reason I'm not writing a 5 star review is because the food I have tried is just ok. We came in for brunch, and I had the French toast. It was a huge portion of deep fried French toast shoved on a little tiny rectangle plate. Don't get me wrong... I'm all for creative plating, but it was a little impractical.
