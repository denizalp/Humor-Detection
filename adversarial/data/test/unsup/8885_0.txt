We wanted to explore the local mall in the area so we made our way here. It has all of the typical department stores - Macy's, JC Penny, Dillard's, Sears.\n\nAt first, we didn't realize how big this mall was - the layout made it look small. But as we kept walking, we learned that around the corner, it had many more stores. \n\nThis mall was nice and clean. They had a nice selection of stores. Although the food court wasn't special, it's a great place to come and freeload on some A.C on a hot day and chill out.
