I had a gift certificate for a regular car wash, normally priced around 14 dollars. So, everything seemed to go okay at first glance. They vacuumed the interior, ran it through the machine wash, and then did some touch up inside interior. However, they seemed to gloss over the interior to an extent. The reason I didn't give 3 stars is because the next few days after, the interior smelled of mildew, as if they spilled some of their cleaning solution inside the cab of my sedan. It's tough to get rid of that smell...
