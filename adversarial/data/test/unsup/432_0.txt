Came here today for the first time after reading the reviews here on yelp. My wife and son and I each had 2 carne asada tacos and 2 al pastor tacos taking advantage of taco Tuesday. We were all very pleased with the tacos, very tasty. We will return for sure. Service was on point during the lunch rush, restaurant was clean, food was tasty and an excellent value. I highly recommend.
