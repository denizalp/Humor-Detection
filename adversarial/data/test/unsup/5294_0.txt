This place is Indian vegetarian heaven and what's more, one of the very very few Indian restaurants not likely to give you mad diarrhea. Seriously I eat here twice in one week and had extremely normal poo the whole week.\n\nThe selection of dishes at the buffet is impressive and as a meat eater I found my appetite more than satisfied.\n\nThe golgapee station and the dessert section where the best part of the dining experience. They make fresh dosa on site if you are super into dosa. \n\npaan after dinner also available.
