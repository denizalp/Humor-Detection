I'd like to preface this by saying I'm not a fan of any sort of \"food truck\" food. Bad experiences with Mexican food trucks in the past have left me jaded.\n\nThat being said, upon seeing the well-taken-care-of truck & a delicious sounding menu, I decided to indulge. This was one of the best choices I've made in my entire life (I've been married, graduated college, bought a home etc) and this ranks right up there. I plan on following these fantastic people to wherever they drive their truck at least once a week.
