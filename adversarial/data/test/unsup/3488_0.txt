Great brunch spot! I had the gravlax benny and my boyfriend had the skwish benny, both were awesome! Delicious and not overly heavy... and they both came with salad and potatoes. Service and atmosphere were also great and fast! Not sure why this place isn't busier... You don't have to wait in line like the many other brunch spots in Leslieville, and I found this food to be better than the ones with the long wait! Try this place!
