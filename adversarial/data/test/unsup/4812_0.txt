Definitely a fan! Great beer selection and outdoor seating. We only had appetizers and I wish they had more options that were healthy. Their appetizers list is mostly fried and\/or breaded. It's a hard to make \"healthy\" choices here but their food is good. Use this as your \"cheat day\" and you will enjoy every minute of their delicious food and beers.
