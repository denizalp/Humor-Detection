Awesome food! I eat here often and have tried many different dishes. My favourites are the spring rolls, rice dish with grilled beef, the Vermicelli and of course...The big bowls of Pho!! Amazing! The price is reasonable,  service is friendly and fast, even their take out and the place itself is very clean. Definitely my go to spot for Vietnamese.
