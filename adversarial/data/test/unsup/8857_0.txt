This place is filled with Trump support posters, so if you get offended by that don't come here.\nPrices for the pho is about double what you pay elsewhere. The lady owner keeps on claiming her broth is the greatest. But after eating I just felt really thirsty and drank a whole bottle of water (sign of hea y msg use). Also another thimg, the noodle they serve is very different than the traditional pho (more flat and chewy)\n\nI will not eat here again, I suggest you guys do the same
