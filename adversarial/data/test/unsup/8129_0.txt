So happy we stopped by last night. Novel ice cream is in the cutest location with surrounding restaurants. The owner was so personable and really made it point to introduce himself, talk about his journey opening his ice cream shop and showing his appreciation for his customers. We were all super impressed with him and the ice cream donut! We will definitely be back
