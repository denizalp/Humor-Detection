Do you like Cowboy style popcorn-crusted popcorn chicken superbanged with jalapeno gravy slaw, and served with Velveeta drumsticks!?  ME TOO!  So go Velvet Tango Room.  Be sure to axe for a trough of southeastern Serengeti mulch glaze.  (They don't serve that entree, but I just wanted to say \"superbanged.\"  And Velvet Tango Room is awesome.)
