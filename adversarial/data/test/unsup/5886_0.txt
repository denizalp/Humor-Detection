First visit to Good Bite. Very clean with traditional Diner interior. Excellent service with fast refills on coffee. My Egg White Vegetable Omelette was hot and fresh. Good ingredients. We also had an order of pancakes. They were fluffy and hot. Very tasty. Menu a bit simple. It would be nice to have some creative dishes such as fresh fruit in the pancakes.
