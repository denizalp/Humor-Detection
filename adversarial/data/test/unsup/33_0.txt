Looking to mix things up and try something different? Look no further! The good folks at Lake Wilcox Brewing have an excellent tour for those anxious to learn the art of beer. \n\nAlthough it's a short tour, the staff are knowledgeable and the samplers following the tour are excellent. If you happen to be there between 2pm 4pm on Saturday, don't pass up a chance to pair your favorite beer with a plate of fresh oysters from 'The Fresh Cannon Oyster Company'.
