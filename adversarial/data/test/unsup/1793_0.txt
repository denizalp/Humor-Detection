From start to finish, a delightful watch buying experience. As a first time \"nice watch\" buyer, I was very unaware of brands and options. The sales staff were very patient and let me take as much time as I needed to make a good decision. Very pleased with the Tag I bought for my wife. More importantly, she was pleased as well. I highly recommend this store.
