Pretty much an average Deli sit down restaurant. I went here for lunch and it was a huge portion for the price. I had a tuna melt sandwich. It was honestly pretty bland. But I must say their sweet potato fries were amazing though. The service is good. It's not too busy when I visited though. I'm giving it four stars because I just think the food wasn't amazing but it was good. I would go again.
