Loved this place! Glendale\/Peoria, Phx have hits\/miss Chinese sit-ins but this place was super accommodating and really delicious Chinese food! Their food was NOT OILY compared to other place and their servings can feed more than 1 person and to top it off, we went there during lunch hour thinking portion was going to be small but much to our surprise they were huge portions! Really friendly staff and really tasty Chinese! I suggest the sweet and sour pork!!!
