Still cash only and still some of the best donuts in town. I don't venture to Henderson too often, but when I'm in the area for one reason or another, I always make it a point to stop by Friendly's.\n\nLove the crullers. Pretty much everything is solid here, but I never can seem to pass up a good cruller. The cake donuts and apple fritters are some of my favorites as well.
