Arguably, the best Starbucks on the strip. Also, its a real Starbucks that takes your rewards, reloads your cards, honors free items, etc.\n\nStadium seating and outdoor seating.\n\nReasonable (avg.) prices, compared to other fake Starbucks on the strip (hotel\/licensed).\n\nWarning! You had better come here with full battery, or a backup, because there is not a plug in site for all of your gadgets. Pretty sure that was done on purpose, as they assumed it would be busy, and don't want people hanging out all day, taking up seats.
