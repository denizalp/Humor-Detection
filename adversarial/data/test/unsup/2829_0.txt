This place got me hooked to Pho Thai.  At one point I was there 3 times a week.  The owner is so personal and friendly.  \n\nThe Pho Thai, spring rolls, and fried rice are to die for.  But everything else...no so much.  But the Pho has me hooked.  It gets crowded around lunchtime, so you might have to share a table or call ahead and get your fix to go.
