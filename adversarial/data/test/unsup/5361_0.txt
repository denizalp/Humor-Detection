First time ordering from here. Was craving some good Chinese food that delivers. Ordered the dinner for 2 combo. Fried rice, 2 spring rolls and 2 other dishes. Was plenty of food for 2 adults. The man at restaurant told me it might take longer since they were super busy but it came in about 30-35min. Everyrhu n g was very tasty and filling. Will definitely order again and recommend it to friends and family.
