I took a diamond ring with 18 diamonds to Perrys and talked with Holly.  The ring was purchased for $2,500 and she said diamonds weren't worth anything any longer and offered to purchased the ring for $89.00 - yes . . . $89.00.  This place is a rip off and if diamonds aren't worth anything any longer, why are their diamonds VERY expensive.  Holly really had an attitude and wasn't very pleasant to talk to either.  I am at a loss at all the good reviews.  This place is terrible!!!
