I have to preface with the fact that I hate all-you-can-eat sushi. I came here with a friend because we wanted quick food and this place is SUPER quick.\n\nThe sushi is okay - it didn't make me violently ill so I figure that's a solid point there. \n\nI've had better sushi, but overall it was okay. I'm not sure I'd come here again -- I think I'd rather try somewhere else.
