I am waiting in this horrendous line while writing this review. It's probably been 15 minutes and I've taken maybe 3 steps towards the front of the line. Typical post office with a mile long line and 2 workers that look like they hate their life. It goes to show that no matter where you are, even in the fancy, nicer part of town, it's still a $hit show. The building is clean so there goes the one star.
