Fantastic bar! Dive-ish bar, patio type area, Wednesday is Poetry night .... Weekends live music.... poetry isn't really my scene and the live music is kind of loud..... but that's what the patio is for! \n\nGreat beer selection! \n\nWhat I love about this place is the extensive beer selection!! Dogfish head that I've never heard of! \n\nAND you can drink your delicious beers (or cocktails) while watching live hockey games\/hockey practice. \n\nI'm not big into ice skating but this is super fun. AND it feels like a secret bar... which I guess my review isn't going to help.
