Came in with coworkers after work. Great spot recommended by the roomie. Great tempura green beans, crispy chicken skin, and beef wellington empanada. I gotta try the sliders next. The Irish bartender made a great beer recommendation too. Bomb.\n\nEdit:\nSliders, tempura green beans, veal meatballs. All bomb.
