Their staff is too aggressive and it's hard to browse without them getting in my face. I would have had a much better experience if they would have just asked if I needed help once. I actually dislike the overly helpful service so much that the next time I go back there, I will probably pretend I don't speak English. Aside from the aggressive staff, I love the store, and all of the products are interesting as well as effective and smell great.
