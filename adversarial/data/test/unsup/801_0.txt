I had not visited since the ownership change from Blue to Blue North and I am sorry I did. There was no comparison. The menu is limited. All my husband wanted was a plain seasoned steak or a filet he could not get one.  We ordered a bottle of red wine $42.  A twist off.!  On a positive note our waitress was great. She was attentive. I should have know better when we walked in at 7pm on a Friday night and the place was empty. We will not be headed back any time soon.
