I wish I could give zero stars for this company. Called the number on the card dropped into my courtyard and he came out once for yard work. The job he did was adequate, if a bit over-priced.  However he failed to return at the next scheduled time, and he failed to respond to any of my calls asking when he would reschedule. Now I am still suffering from the barrage of refuse (his business cards) he repeatedly drops in my yard, despite several calls asking him to stop.
