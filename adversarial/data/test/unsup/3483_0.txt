I have been going to this place for about 7 years. Over the past two the customer service from the teens are terrible! There is a very rude girl in the credit room. She never greets anyone,  she is always frowning,  and looks at people like they are beneath her. I got tired of jer service so I called a manager who acted exactly the same. I understand why the staff there are so unprofessional now, the managers are too! Just because its a thrift store doesn't mean poor customer service is okay.
