This mall is how all malls should be; One long strip with stores on each side. If malls like Sherway Gardens drive you crazy because of their spider web like layout, then Dufferin Mall is for you.\n\nIt has all of the major \"mall\" stores and some eateries here and there.\n\nIt is pretty clean and hardly busy on weeknights.  Definitely my go to mall for socks, underwear and chewing gum on a Wednesday night.
