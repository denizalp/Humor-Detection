Horrible customer service! Called to post a bail, and was asked a couple questions, and when i answered the questions he replies well why did you wait so long and why did you wait til 12am to call? SO RUDE! THANK GOD THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY BAIL BONDS OFFICE IN ARIZONA. I'm SURE HE DIDN'T THINK OF THAT BEFORE BEING A RUDE JERK.
