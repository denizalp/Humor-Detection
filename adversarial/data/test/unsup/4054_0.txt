Dessert only: So the first time we ordered takeout from here, we just got the infamous butterscotch bread pudding for $6.50. We were a little disappointed to find it was very dry and dense. I prefer an airy, moist bread pudding. I should have gone with the pineapple coconut cake. But, glancing at the menu, everything sounded delicious. Will have to try out the entrees!
