Zero complaints! Cold beer, live music, awesome outdoor patio and outdoor service. It was a very enjoyable bike night spot and stop. People and motorcycle watch galore, ran into a couple of my boyfriend's patients one table over too, small world. Dog friendly and good service. We found a new bike night spot :)
