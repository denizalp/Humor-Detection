It was across from my hotel so easy to get there, ate at the bar and the food was pretty good although the draft beer selection was a bit limited. Had 2 guys sitting next to me who had way too much to drink and who ended up picking a fight on the way out and were escorted out. Strange to see a \"Texas\" place in Toronto but it was OK.
