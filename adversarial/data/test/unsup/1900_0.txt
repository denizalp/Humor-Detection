Second time trying this cafe and it didn't disappoint. The atmosphere was very relaxing and \"funky\". I got a medium matcha milk tea with tapioca which was customized by an amazing barista named Marcella. She was so polite, considerate and exhibited excellent customer service. I will definitely come back again. \n\nThe matcha milk tea with tapioca was not too sweet and not too creamy which was perfect for me. What was really great was that they make the tapioca everyday. Price was not too bad compared to the other bubble tea places around Markham.
