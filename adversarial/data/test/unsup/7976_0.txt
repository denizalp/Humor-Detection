Wish I could give 4.5 stars.  Stopped in for breakfast.  Service was very attentive and the Belgian waffle w\/ huckleberry compote was so good you don't need syrup.  Staff suggested visiting that afternoon for their 2-for-1 mojito happy hour, but I didn't have a chance to make it back in time for that.  Good quality, good times.
