Do not go there for any work on your car. They tried to put a tire on a brand new rim and scratched the rim in 4 locations. I was watching them work and had to literally pull the wrench from the mechanic's hand before he destroyed the tire as well. This is the most incompetent garage I have ever seen. Stay away!
