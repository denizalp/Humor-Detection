So I went to NAILS 3 for an eyebrow wax I left leaving with two different expressions on my face , one eyebrow round and the other straight up n down, wen I asked for a refund they said it will grow back n that I shouldn't get my money back because she spent her time doing the wax, I do not recommend this place, sry.
