I wish I could give this place 5 stars because the coffee is delicious but I cannot. The customer service is horrible after waiting 15 minutes for an iced latte I did not receive an a apology not to mention the people in front of me got free coffee for waiting just as long as I did. Yeah peace out Starbucks your customer service blows which made my coffee sour.
