Oktoberfest all year long...why would I not love this place? \n\nI don't know much about German food...but German beer...well yes. The pitchers are big, the Hefeweizen is cold...the polka band is providing entertainment...and you can get paddled. \n\nPricing is what you'd expect for a Vegas restaurant but the happy hour offers decent deals if you want to get your drinking started during the day. \n\nYes...I'll be back and prob buy something overpriced at the souvenir shop cause it is beer inspired.
