Good location in Port Credit.  Small well designed space with bar style seating, ideal for people watching as you are enjoying some delicious tacos.  The barbacoa tacos are real barbacoa, not gringo-style \"barbacoa\".  The baja fish tacos are excellent.  3 tacos for $10 is not a bad deal when you think about the quality.  A must try for anyone going through Port Credit.
