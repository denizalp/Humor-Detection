I live right by here so I thought I would give this place a try. I'm pregnant so my feet were in sure need of a good pedi. I waited about 15 min, but in a comfy pedi chair. The pedi was amazing and my feet are so soft and polished!! Prices are comparable with anyone else but way better quality. Leslie was so nice and even hugged me when I left. I definitely will be back!
