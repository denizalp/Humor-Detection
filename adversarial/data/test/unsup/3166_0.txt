LV Yelpers... stay away!\n\nCame here the other night for dinner since I was craving fish.\n\nI waited over 30 minutes to be seated.\nCrab soup was horrible... no taste.\nFish wasn't cooked throughly. (I had the trio and rainbow trout)\nlomi salmon wasn't done right.\n\nManagement and customer service was horrible with compensation for bad service.\n\nI won't be back.\n\nNEXT!
