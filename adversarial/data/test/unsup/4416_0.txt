Really like the vibe of the place- Retro chic.  I stayed in a deluxe king room. Very comfortable.  They charge a resort fee added on to the room rate.  It covers, breakfast, unlimited snacks, bike and pool use.  Would prefer it was just added to the room rate to reflect the real nightly cost. Very close to Dignity Health Care\/St Joseph's Medical Center if you are visiting family.
