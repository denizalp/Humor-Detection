I love this place! Have been going here for more than 5 years and after I moved I always make sure to visit! My favorite is the classic of a teriyaki bowl. The Mac salad here is one of my favorites where it's just the right amount of sweet and flavorful! The con about this place is that it is pretty small and only have a few employees working so it takes awhile for food and to order. However I'm glad the business is booming because they deserve it!
