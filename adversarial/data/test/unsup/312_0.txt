wait, did i seriously just get charged $10.50 for a french onion soup the size of my fist?  yes i did, and it was so worth it.  the amount of gooey molten cheese covering my soup can justify the spending any day.\n\ni got the ny steak & eggs, though i think the steak could just do with 2 eggs.  the steak quality was great, tender and soft at medium.  tip is to sub french fries for the hash  :)  their fries are skinny fries, perfectly crispy.\n\nit's in the bellagio, so naturally the cafe comes with the hefty $$$.
