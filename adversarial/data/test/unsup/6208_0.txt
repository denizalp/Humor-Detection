Mediocrity at it's finest. Overpriced hotpot. Would taste better if it weren't so expensive. Lots of sushi ayce which are about 4-5x better at half the price. Many other places to pick from. On the other hand, compared to other hot pot places here it's probably just a smidge better.  Not a lot of options out here and they're all not the greatest. Not a lot of ways to mess up hot pot. But also, Cant wait for my next trip to Taiwan.
