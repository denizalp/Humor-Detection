Great value!\n\nPeaks and Valleys has a nice variety of tasty food, reasonably priced, with a very friendly wait staff.  My family has been there on a number of occasions and we've always been very pleased.  They now have a full-service bar up front for those so inclined.  \n\nTry the various specials, especially the ribs - other great dishes include the Mediterranean Chicken, the burgers, the Greek salad, and the desserts are great, too.
