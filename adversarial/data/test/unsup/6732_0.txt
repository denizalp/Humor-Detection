Grilled mushroom burger and cheese fries. Ask for the lobby sauce. I've tried almost everything on the menu and have not been disappointed once. The guy grilling definitely knows what he's doing. If you call in your order they'll wait to start cooking so that when you get it home its hot and fresh.
