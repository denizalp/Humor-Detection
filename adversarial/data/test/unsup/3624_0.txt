I like this spot.  Nice laid back vibe, good coffee too.  The pastries are pretty standard commercial stuff, the food menu limited but hearty.  Great vegetarian chili.  Downtown Willoughby has a \"Mayberry\" like feel to it, but if you go down Vine Street, your in a scene from the movie \"Deliverence\".
