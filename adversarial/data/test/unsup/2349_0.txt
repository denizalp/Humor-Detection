Great guys! Joey and his brother are great with customer service.  They took us out for the night with a bunch of or friends- we all got babysitters and went out to a really nice dinner without worrying about getting home- it was fun to have drinks on ice and hang out all the way there and back! We will be booking again with them again soon.  We have also rented their party buses for realtor property tours during the daytime and they were very professional and accommodating!
