Came here with the Husband and Grumpy Father-in-Law for breakfast this rainy morning, and thought the food was delicious. I had the maple pecan french toast which was just the perfect sugar rush to kickstart my day. I also have to give kudos to the service; our server was quite nice and accommodating, even when faced with having to deal with Grumpy Pop before his morning coffee. \n\nI'd definitely come back again.
