Visited this salon based on Yelp reviews. It is small inside so I'm not sure how comfortable it would be if you have a large  group I.e. Wedding party\/bachelorette party. I drove myself but understand they will pick up clients from area hotels. I was offered a beverage with was much appreciated considering the heat. I was happy with my gel mani. It lasted for 2 weeks.
