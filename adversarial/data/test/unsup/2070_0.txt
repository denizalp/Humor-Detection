Tried Via Rail for the first time on a route from Niagara Falls to Toronto (a 1hr 20min drive by car).   Via delayed departure by 1:15 mins.  I could have driven to Toronto and be there almost before this train left the station!   I have $2,500 tickets to the Raptors\/Cavilers game tonight and I'm going to miss the whole first quarter because of Via's delay.   \n\nThis is the first and last time I'll be using this train!!!!
