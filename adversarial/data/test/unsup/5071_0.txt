Located in the convenient Queen west district, Gusto is an agreeable week day night bar. It's good for a drink, but not too late since they close at midnight and they don't let you in after 11:30pm. The food was alright and the 1$\/1oz. wine concept is pretty cool. The rooftop is cool even though it's covered, so it gets a bit like a green hot house during the scorcher! Go out with a group of friends for the best experience of Gusto.
