Yuck yuck yuck! I was excited to try this place- especially since it's pretty close to where I live... but was so disappointed! Paid $17.99 for lunch, and the only thing that was somewhat enjoyable was the gelato. I tried to find something good to eat and couldn't find anything. The service was terrible ( go figure, we tipped over 20% before even getting service) and never got our drinks refilled and our plates were never taken off our table. I will not be going back to this place.
