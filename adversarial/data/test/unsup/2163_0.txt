I went to their website to take a look and see what the place is all about. There is no menu and not alot of information on their website. I called the restaurant and some guy answers the phone and I say.  \"I am on your website and I can't find a menu anywhere on there do you have one online?.\" His answer was \"We don't have a website\" and I said \"Yes you do im on it right now\" and his response was \"oh well\". \n\nWe will not be checking this place out ever.
