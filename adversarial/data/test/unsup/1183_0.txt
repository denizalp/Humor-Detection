The US Post Office has so overly complicated mail and shipping that they are driving themselves out of business with virtually no competitor in the market that can do what they do by hitting every single doorstep 6 days a week.\n\nThis particular location is as ingrained in the \"Post Office Mentality\" that they actually seem to contrive new ways to inconvenience you.\n\nIf I could boycott the post office - The Whole Damn United States Post Office - I would.  Ben Franklin must be ROLLING in his grave to see what his beautifully simple creation has morphed into.
