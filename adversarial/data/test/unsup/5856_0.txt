This place reminds me of what an oversized love child of Walmart, a dollar store and a ghetto Fry's (think Cave Creek & Hatcher) would look like.  Yes prices are cheap, but its chaotic inside and the people are worthy of having a website dedicated to them (People of...).  Last time we were here, we witnessed several people eating the fresh fruit right from the bags in the produce section. Who does that?  I would rather pay $1 more for my box of cereal at Safeway then shop here.
