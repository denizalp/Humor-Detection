Not impressed. I was there one evening on a weekday with some friends. Service was slow despite the fact that the place was empty. I went to the ladies room to find a gentleman plunging the toilet; he suggested that if I needed to use the bathroom I was allowed to go out back and pee. Hmmm, no thanks. I'd prefer a bar that doesn't allow patrons to urinate behind the building.
