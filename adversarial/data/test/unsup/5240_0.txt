Saw this bar from our hotel and figured it would be nice to walk across the street for a drink. However, we waited for over 15 minutes and had several waiters walk by while making eye contact and did not once ask us if we wanted anything. I could understand that if it was busy but it was a Wednesday night with less than half the tables full.  Only reason it got 2 stars is because it was a beautiful night out and the place would have been cool if it wasn't for the lack of service...
