Tuna tartar and burrata was good. TERRIBLE service!!! And it wasn't even busy for hh on a Monday yet nobody wanted to help. The girls next to us were complaining too that they weren't getting service. Tried to charge me $16 for a kettle dirty martini.... Um excuse me??? It's a wanna be Yacht club with terrible club music. The owner did take off the up charge for the martini which was nice. Won't be returning though! Better places to visit
