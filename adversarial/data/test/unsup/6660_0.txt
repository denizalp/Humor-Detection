This cafe is on Dupont and Spadina, and I don't think it's open in the evenings or even on weekends (not sure) so it attracts lunchtime regulars mostly.\n\nI think the owners are Korean but their specialty is indian curry roti. I recall there was some Korean food available as well, but haven't tried it. The portions are very generous and tasty.\n\nI used to go there every day for their Timothy's coffee when I worked nearby. I got to be a regular and every time I'd go in, the lady behind the counter would yell \"Coffeeee Time!\"
