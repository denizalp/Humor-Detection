Went in to pick up a friend who is a retired Captain in the Army.  Reading everything in press last two years about Veteran Hospitals candidly i didn't know what to expect.  But from the moment I pulled in to the minute we left I experienced nothing but efficient,  friendly and knowledgeable staff and volunteers.   In terms of equipment that I noticed I couldn't think of anywhere having more up to date.  Also, want to note how clean everything was.\n\nCompared to the experiences I've had at regular hospitals this blew them away.
