Not a bad place.  Really sparce and random clientelle.  BUT, drinks were somewhat stong, bartenders were cool, Greg Hovaround was Djing me 90s hip hop songs and the have a Flavor Flav mural dammit!!  If any of those stars were not to align again..it might drop a star..  To quote the immortal Heavy D \"now that we found love, what are we gonna do with it?\"..
