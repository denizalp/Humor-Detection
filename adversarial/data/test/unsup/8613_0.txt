Great place for HK diner food. Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner are all great. Went for lunch yesterday. Had chicken steak in black pepper sauce with rice. Very tasty. My sister got the assorted balls and other things on rice noodles. Nice and big portion size. You only need to order one thing each to be really full. Fast, efficient service and great prices!
