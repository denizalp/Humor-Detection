Well another Hibachi in the Valley (I love them all) .Arlin B. and Rand H.joined me here for lunch and with well over 100 trays of food there was lots to eat. Most of the food was real good so I say to myself why are you only giving this one 4 stars? Well it was missing a few of my favorite dishes ,fresh strawberries, and the tacky fountain. So yes YAY!! I Am a fan.The more Hibachi's the better.
