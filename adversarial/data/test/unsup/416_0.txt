My husband and I love coming here! We've been coming here for I think 8 years? Maybe 7? I can't remember but we love coming here for lunch for a little date and I love getting the salad and BBQ chicken! Sooo good! The girls are always so sweet and ask us how we've been. We really enjoy coming to this Barros!
