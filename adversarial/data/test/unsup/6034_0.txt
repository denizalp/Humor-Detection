Pricey but so. freaking. good.\n\nI missed visiting this place last time I was in Vegas so on our most recent visit it was a must. I did  fasted 8 mile Treadmill Run then walked the 2 miles here and back to deliver Hubs Breakfast in bed. Needless to say he was pretty darn happy and so was I. Soft, fluffy, creative flavors and so darn cute. I kinda wish I had bought a dozen home.
