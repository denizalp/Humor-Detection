This place makes extremely fun cocktail drinks!\nI ordered the gummi worm dry ice drink and it was so cool and delicious!  Each bowl is an equivalent to 3 drinks so I suggest sharing unless you want to get hammered. The atmosphere is so cute and fun and the candy store connected to the bar smells like cotton candy. Yummm. Can't wait to come back to try another drink!
