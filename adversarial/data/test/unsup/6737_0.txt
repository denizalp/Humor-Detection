After arriving to the first lesson. I wasn't aware I needed to wear a swimming suit to get in with my baby. Brittany was nice enough to not only put on a swim suit and get in with him. He enjoyed a private lesson. \n\nThe staff is very courteous and professional and I appreciate their patience. I couldn't have asked for a better facility for his swimming lessons. Thanks a bunch \n\nSincerely Kendall's Mom
