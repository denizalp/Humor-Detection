This has got to be my favourite hangout spot ever (in the summer).\n\nBurger and fries combo. OR burger and gelato combo.\n\nThey have great gelato here, I love the roasted almond. The burgers are just okay. Extremely messy though! \n\nThe poutine was pretty bad.\n\nThe service is amazing!!! I think they recognize me now, which is fun. I bring friends on dates here because it's really quiet -we're usually the last group to leave. The staff does not mind that sat here forever.
