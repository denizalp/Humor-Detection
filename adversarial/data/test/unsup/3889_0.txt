Almost nobody goes here.  Its like a ghost town especially at night.  The employees are  nowhere to be found even.  Tried to get a drink during a 10pm movie but nobody was up front.  Called out and nothing.  Stood there for a while listening to crickets and nothing.  Called out anyone here?  I coulda robbed them of so much popcorn its not even funny.  I dont think they really care too much though.
