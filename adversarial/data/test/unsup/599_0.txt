Very informative clerk saw my violet hair and after complimenting me on it advised me what she used to make a lavender streak in her own hair.  I ended up buying it also, along with some of their great little dollar size nail polish and some of the kind you stripe your nails with.  Great place to shop for hair supplies and if you are looking for products to add a little glitz to your life!\n(4\/29\/09)
