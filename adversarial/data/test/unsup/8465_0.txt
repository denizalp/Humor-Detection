Went to the Barbara Seville Show and it was AMAZING. My boyfriend got felt up by a drag queen and he said it was the most amazing birthday yet.  \n\nTips:\n- Reserve tables over the phone\n- Get there 20-30 mins early to get drinks and chill.\n- Bring $20-30 in single bills to give to the ladies when they perform. It's fabulous and necessary.\n\nGood luck! :)
