I have had several items framed at this location.  They say it will talk about two weeks but they have always been done before that.  The frames came looking great!  Keep and eye out for specials.  If it weren't for them (specials), I doubt I would pay full price and thus my prints would be naked.  The store itself has was ever craft making material one could want.
