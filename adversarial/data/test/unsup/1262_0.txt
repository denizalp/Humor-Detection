I'm done with this place.  We went here last year and 2 days later I got a call from my CC company that my number was compromised and I was able to narrow it down to this place.  We tried to go here last Friday but gave up after having to listen to the manager and bartender argue with a customer about his takout order.  I can't stand restaurants that argue with customers.  There are far too many burger spots popping up around town to deal with these guys.
