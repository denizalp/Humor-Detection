Phenomenal, cheap, fast hangover food.  This place totally reminds of a diner that you would see in a tiny little town where everyone knows each other.  The servers are friendly, there are lots of options for different egg substitutes, and the service is quick.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who woke up in a random apartment in Old Town, and needs some food quick!  One quick reminder though - be sure to bring your check book or cash!!  They do not take credit.
