This busy salon offers impersonal service.  Tech who did my pedicure could have cared less, passed me off to a second tech halfway through with no explanation.  Manicure is of horrible quality, I'll have to redo polish myself.  Tech was working on another client and myself at the same time.  Worst of all, this salon is not clean.  Floors, tables, tools.......dirty.  I will not return.
