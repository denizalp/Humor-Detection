They won't make americanos\/espressos etc on the weekend as 'it takes too long' and as the server condescendingly explained 'if you wanted to have a second one we'd have to charge you for that'. Uh ya, that's how it works. I know how to order and pay for an americano (and even a second one if I so choose). \n\nMy brunch date opted to try their drip coffee and it was not good and he was disappointed.\n\nI just can't enjoy my brunch without good coffee. Can't!!
