Definitely my go to place for an easy night out with dinner and drinks. 4 quality food vendors with unique menus that will keep bringing you back to try them all. A bar with spectacular service and a diverse beer selection that caters to beer lovers. You may have to share a table with others, but seating is comfortably close without being cramped.
