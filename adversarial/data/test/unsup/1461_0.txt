This burger place in the cosmo is okay. The popcorn is a nice plus but I mean it's just popcorn. The burgers are ok but somewhat dry and they cook a little bit over when I got the medium. The ambiance is nice and it is right next to the marquee club. I didn't get the shakes here but heard they were on point
