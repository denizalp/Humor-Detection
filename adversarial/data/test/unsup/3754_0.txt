Service is stale and unwelcoming (tried this place twice). \n\nThey didn't have half & half or creamer available, only milk. That was a surprise! The small, or tiny sized, cup was full of ice and barely any coffee. \n\nThe only sweetener sitting out was Splenda, no stevia. After stepping away, I did overhear they have simple syrup (which was not sitting out).\n\nA\/C must be rationed by the owners because it was extremely warm inside. Not a pleasurable experience.
