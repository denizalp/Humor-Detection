This is a great spot. I love the decor inside and was very impressed with how awesome my server Mimi was. The drinks are delicious as well. I ordered pork belly buns and while they were a bit on the fatty side, even for pork belly standards, it was fresh, crisp ingredients throughout and I considered getting one to go! I then had the spicy tuna roll, it was good, nothing too groundbreaking. The poke is a great dish as well!
