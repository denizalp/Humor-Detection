Well I just happened upon this place during happy hour.  I wasn't expecting much, but the food was excellent for the price and Scarlett (I think that was her name) was very attentive and knew I needed another drink almost immediately.  I will definitely be back if I'm ever in Vegas again.\n\nEdit: I think here name was Scarlett.
