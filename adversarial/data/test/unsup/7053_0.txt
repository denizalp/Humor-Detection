Spencer's is horrible. I went in to buy a home theater system, bought one model but I'd have to go to their Tempe warehouse to pick it up. Supposedly out of stock at their Mesa location. Upon arriving I was told the model I bought was out and they only had the next model up, but it was an additional $400, on top of the $900 I already paid.  \nThey're nothing but a total scam and I hope they go the way of Circuit City and the dinosaur. \nI'll never shop there again.
