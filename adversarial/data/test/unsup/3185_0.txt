Never been....Just called to make an appointment and spoke to Elaine herself. I requested an appointment with her specifically and she turned me down. Seriously?! I was booking 5 days out.... It's not like I wanted an appointment in the next hour. She asked if someone else could do my nails and I said no thanks, bye. If the manager\/owner doesn't take pride in getting new clients, that's a business I'm not interested in using.   There's a hundred more nail salons I can give my money to.
