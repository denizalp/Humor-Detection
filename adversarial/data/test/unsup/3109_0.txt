The food here is phenomenal. If you really like nachos this is the place to go. I like how they have a guaranteed \"every chip is wet\". I sat at the bar in the bartenders were very friendly. They help me very quickly. And my food came out quickly but it was still fresh. The place is kind of hard to find because it's around the corner connected to Planet Hollywood. However, it's right past the Buffalo wild wings on Harmon and Las Vegas Blvd.
