Omg this was the most awesome service I've had all month! And it's funny how it's a fast food place and I got better service in the drive thru on a graveyard shift than any other restaurant I've been too lately!! Props to the funny drive thru guy with positive energy! I wish I got his name so I could name him on this review! Excellent job!
