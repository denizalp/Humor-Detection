PS,\nJust to reiterate my point on the price increases, two years ago I paid $13 for a child's  haircut, this week I paid $25. I guess it wasn't really a 200% increase, it was only 192%. I'll do my math better next time. This is NOT a downtown hair salon, stop pretending it is. Also, your snarky responses to customer reviews when they aren't in your favour, are pretty tacky. Allocate some of that revenue to hiring a proper customer service\/ social media specialist as clearly you are terrible at it. Remember word gets around.
