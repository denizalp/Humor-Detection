One star because no star, as far as I can tell, was not an option. Ordered food on line at 4:44 on line for delivery at 7:30. Food did not cone until 8:30. Manager\/owner said orders on line are delayed 45 minutes. Would have been nice to know. Horrible management\/organization. Food is a solid \"OK\".
