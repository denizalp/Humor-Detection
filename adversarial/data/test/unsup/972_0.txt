So finally a few days ago I got to try their shrimp tamales and I was very disappointed. I expected something different than just a green chile tamale w\/ shrimp in it. I also tried their rajas and both of these were too spicy. My spicy tolerance is high but for a tamale it was too much. I could not enjoy it properly and was a little bummed about it. Please tone down your spice level I would gladly give you guys a better review. Also prices are going up so I also expect better flavored tamales.
