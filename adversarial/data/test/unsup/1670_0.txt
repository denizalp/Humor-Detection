This place does great steak and eggs. Or, if you're feeling as adventurous as my wife, you can have a poached egg with pancakes and sausages - which she assured me was delicious as a combination. Service was very friendly and efficient, and I would definitely recommend it for people looking for a filling breakfast\/brunch as we were.
