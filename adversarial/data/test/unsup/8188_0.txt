We've been twice since this fun place opened, and will definitely go back soon. It is a great vibe (lighting is cool, servers are helpful\/happy). We have seen two bands play here, and both were great! The food is delicious, especially if you like burgers (they have many options, plus build-your-own). Beer options are decent, cocktail options are top notch. In the summer, when the outdoor patio opens, it will be a blast to sit outside and listen to the band playing.
