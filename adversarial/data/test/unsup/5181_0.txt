HORRIBLE store - I bought a Halloween corset and when I got home it was damaged they asked if I checked the package at store? Uh no I didn't expect to buy damaged stuff then I was charged double - they wouldn't give a refund but I could get same item to replace it but they didn't have one so when I went back up to counter she was socializing I left corset without refund or exchange and will not be returning!!!!!!
