This is like going to Disneyland. \n\nI had a lovely latte that had a super creamy taste. Since the pumpkin loaf wasn't in house yet (coming in later in the day), I decided on the cranberry orange muffin. The muffin was so moist, and it broke apart to a beautiful color! \n\nLots of parking in back.\nLots of moms with kids.\nLots of food items and lots of reasons to come here!
