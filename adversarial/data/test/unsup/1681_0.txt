Went for ice cream with the family last weekend.\nService was a bit slow and the ice cream did not have much flavour for the items we selected.\nThese were the ice creams we ordered.\n\n- tiramisu \/ torrone\n- straccatella \/ torrone\n\nWe have had other flavours other times we have been there and it was flavourful, so maybe just an off day for the person making the ice cream that day.\n\nPricing was reasonable\nNice texture.\n\nWould go back and pre try other flavours next time before ordering.
