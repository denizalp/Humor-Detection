Bad service, the waitress actually banged glasses on the table. When a cocktail that was not on the list was requested the answer was a categorical no, not let me check.\n\nPlace was dirty- don't look up at the dust hanging from the ceiling.\n\nFood was actually good. But not worth dealing with grumpy people.
