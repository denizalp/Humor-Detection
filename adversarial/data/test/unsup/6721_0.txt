I really, really wanted to like this place. Unfortunately, there just wasn't much in the way of flavor. I had to add salt to EVERYTHING just to taste SOMETHING! The red sauce was bitter and lackluster. The green sauce is better, but still not great. I will say that I did enjoy my cup of chicken soup, but there isn't much else to give props to. Our food was supposed to come with sopapillas, but they never came out.  I doubt we'll give it a second chance.
