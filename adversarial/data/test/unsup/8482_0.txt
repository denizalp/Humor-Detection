Unfortunately we weren't able to get a seat at Tommy either time we went because it was so packed, but it was right up the street from our Airbnb so we hit it up twice while we were in town. The lattes were creamy and delicious, and the cronuts and canneles were to die for. If I lived near here I can imagine spending lots of time relaxed at one of their tables overlooking the street, provided I could get a seat!
