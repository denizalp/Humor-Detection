Lincoln Park Pub is far from a dive, especially when you gems like the Clark Bar right down the street, but the atmosphere is a little beat up. A true Tremont tradition, I would be disapointed if it wasn't. Everyone loves Tremont for its working man heritage, and thank God there are still places like Lincoln Park Pub about. The crowd veries from long time residents, to hambones on a pub crawl, to just regular yelpers looking for a $1 taco on a Tuesday night.
