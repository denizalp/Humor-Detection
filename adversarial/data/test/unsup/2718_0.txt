I've been waiting for 40 minutes to see the doctor and was just told that it could be another hour - I told them I'd leave and come back and they said they couldn't guarantee he'd see me.  \n\nIs this your first day running a doctor's office?\n\nThey said that even though I had an appointment for the first spot in the day, other patients showed up early, so they went ahead of me...  Ok, that makes a ton of sense. \n\nI got a refund and peaced out of there.
