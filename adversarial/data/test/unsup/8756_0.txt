Yinnz gotta go n' git one a' dem hootinanny sanchiz. This place is great for one of those drunken excursions. The locals are some of the friendliest folks you'll ever meet, and if you wind up tagging along with them for a night, chances are pretty good you'll wind up here at the end of the night.\n\nThese guys don't skimp on the layers of ingredients and they serve beer, which is great if you wanna prime the sandwich with an introduction to what it's gonna be soaking up in your stomach.
