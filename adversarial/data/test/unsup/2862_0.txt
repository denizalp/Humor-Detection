I came seeking Vonegut and found a new world artisan \"not so peasant\" market with lots of chimes to fill the air, retro-games for gifting, students huddled in trendy cliques talking about how they could alter the axis of the current culinary movement, and a fond attachment to Wildflower Bread Company.  Is there then any reason to return from whence I once oogled?  Not really.  I have indeed changed hands.
