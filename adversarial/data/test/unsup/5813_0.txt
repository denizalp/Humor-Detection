This is about as good as it gets for Asian food in this price range.  The chicken isn't chewy like many other inexpensive Asian restaurants.  I've had several of their dishes and without a doubt the Yakisoba with chicken is my favorite.  I love the white-meat chicken and broccoli (with Teriyaki sauce).  The broccoli is quality, and never overcooked.  And I love their Teriyaki sauce.
