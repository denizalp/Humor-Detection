Late night hunger too often results in desperate and embarrassing decisions: \nPerkins, questionable street vendors...  \nEating the entire tub of ice cream in my freezer...\n\nBut no more! The Tornado Room took a meal I barely want to admit I eat and turned into something I can't stop talking about.  Their late night menu is classy and delicious.  So have a house cocktail with a shrimp cocktail and say goodbye to midnight trips to Taco Bell.
