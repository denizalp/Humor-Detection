Clean, friendly bilingual service and amazing options:\n\nI bought some:\n\nCanadian Cheddar Cheeses-which you can puchase by the time that it has aged. \n\nQuebec Brie Cheese-that is unavailable in the United States\n\nFYI-as long as you declare the cheese you can bring it home in your suitcase.\n\nCanadian Maple Syrup and Maple Butter Spread\n\nA Baguette\n\nGrapes and Clementines to snack on during my stay\n\nKetchup Potato Chips\n\nSuch great selections!
