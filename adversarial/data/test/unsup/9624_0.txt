We had a delicious lunch here the other day! \n\nThe luncheon cut with all three sides : mashed potatoes, half creamed corn and half creamed spinach is perfect! More than enough food! To accompany my lunch I ordered a belvedere and cranberry redbull. It was yummmmyyyy. \n\nService is friendly and more than enough parking. Great, close lunch place after landing at Signature private airport terminal.
