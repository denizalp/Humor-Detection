I'm from California and was gonna spend my last day here and get a tattoo with one of my good friends, so we called to get a price and confirmed we'd be on the way. We arrived and the guy who spoke with us said he no longer could do it until late at night (around 9:30) because it took us a half hour to get there? \n\nSo unprofessional and rude. Waste of time and gas.
