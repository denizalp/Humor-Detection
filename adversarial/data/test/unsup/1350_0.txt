Hey Macy's,\nHow about a smile or any actual gesture acknowledging your customers as you unlock the doors at 10am and open the store. Gal who opened the front doors today could not have looked more disgusted with her life.  Then walking through the store to the second floor,  not a single employee looked up or smiled or anything. \nMaybe you should close and start again
