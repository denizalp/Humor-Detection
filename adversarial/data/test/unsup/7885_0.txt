I am local and I still frequent here.  The only thing better than the burgers is the outstanding staff and the excellent beer selection. (I prefer Brother Thelonious) \n\nIt is not too pricey either, especially since it is in the cosmopoliton.  I only have one suggestion to everyone:  TIP YOUR SERVER !
