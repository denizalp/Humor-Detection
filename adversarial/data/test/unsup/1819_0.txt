Came here with a friend who is a friend of one of the family members that own this place. Dinner was delicious, I ordered the chicken dinner which was perfectly seasoned and a large enough portion that I had some to put on top of a salad for lunch the next day. Moncho's is a cozy, neighborhood spot with a small, affordable menu of classic Colombian cuisine - check it out if you're in the mood for something like that.
