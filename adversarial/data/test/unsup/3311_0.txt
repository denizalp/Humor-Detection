Great decor, ambiance, and service!\n\nThe food was excellent, but the portions were way too small for the price. $13 gets you a 5 piece sushi roll instead of the standard 8-9, and these weren't 5 large pieces either.\n\nWe ordered 3 rolls whose names escape me, but all 3 were scrumptious. There was a strawberry and lychee roll that was particularly savory.\n\nIf I wanted a VERY light meal and some drinks with girlfriends, I would return. But for dinner? Probably not.
