Not too many times have I been impressed with cupcakes from bakeries that have been featured on food network- tried sprinkles yesterday. The store was clean, staff was great. The cupcakes were amazing! Had a salted caramel, red velvet and a cinnamon spice. So moist and the icing was perfection. I would definitely buy them again.
