This Game Stop location is the best as they always seem to have what we need in stock, which is surprising considering it is located inside of a mall. We just placed a pre-order for the new Xbox one that will be released November 5th along with Ghost. \n\nOur favorite employee at this location is Chris because he is super friendly, and knows his gamer stuff!\n\nWe are an Xbox family and always find that Game Stop is our main store for our gamer needs!
