Thank goodness they deliver! I've only had pizza delivered from here, but it's been the best pizza I've had in a long time. They have just the right balance of toppings, cheese and sauce and the crust is soft and chewy. The Chicken Florentine pizza is my fave.\nI'm looking forward to eating in the restaurant sometime too.
