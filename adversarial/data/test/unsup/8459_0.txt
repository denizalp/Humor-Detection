We strolled around his gallery admiring his photogrpahy.\n\nThere is no doubt that Peter Lik is an amazing photogrpaher. At his gallery most of his works were landscapes and nature. The captures were artistically composed and looked stunning.\n\nHis work is definitely expensive, this particular store had his work available for $5000 and up!
