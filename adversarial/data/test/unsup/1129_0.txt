Me and my brother first came here today, 4\/15 and he had the loco moco, side of corn beef hash, and I had Kalua pig, rice, with Mac salad. \n\nThe Kalua Pig was delicious, and didn't lack any flavor, rice was cooke well also. But for the Mac salad I think they could have done better with flavor. \n\nCorn beed hash was good also, and same with the loco moco. \n\nI'll be coming back here when I'm in Vegas again, \nGood customer service!!
