I am a student of music, be it 60's Bossa Nova, Surf, Jazz, Swing, AOR, PUNK, New Wave, Grunge, Psychobilly. I can go on but the point is I go to immerse myself in something that is very near and dear to my heart...Music...What is the soundtrack  of your life?\nGo discover it at the Rock Hall!!!!!!!
