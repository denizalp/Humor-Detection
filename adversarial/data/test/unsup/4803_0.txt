The wild boar nachos are the best nachos I've ever had anywhere. Tamales are excellent... Any of the choices are good... I had the chorizo with an egg.  The sides are delicious too... We shared the corn, the refried beans and Brussels sprouts. The sprouts were salty so we sent them back but overall the meal was delicious and a good value for the  portions. Go during happy hour.
