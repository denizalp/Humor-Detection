While juice bars are popping up all over the Valley, The Juice Kitchen stands out with their exceptional customer service. First time in and I left a loyal customer due to Atif. Their açaí bowls are also a little better than the rest. Instead of frozen açaí berries blended down so they're icy or watery, they freeze the banana and blend them into the açaí to make it creamy. My current fave is the Açaí protein bowl but I hear the açaí cheesecake is not to be missed. I'll be back for sure!
