Culinary knives only. I'm sure it's a great place for snobby chefs. I tried calling three times to ask if they would sharpen a hunting knife. So I gave up and went in. The lady was not helpful and quick to judge. She wouldn't recommend me anywhere else \"because of competition reasons\". Well I found their competitor and they were happy to help me. When it comes to sharpening, a knife is a knife?
