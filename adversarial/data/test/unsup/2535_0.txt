Great place for botox and other treatments. The front office staff is very polite and the waiting area is clean and calming.  They even have a Keurig for coffee while you wait! The doctor is very sweet and even apologizes for the little pinch during injections.  I would highly recommend Modena Med spa and will be going back very soon!
