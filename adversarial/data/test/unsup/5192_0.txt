I recommend but correct the category - it's not really French, more like Mediterranean.  Lamb is the specialty.  This was my second visit.  Great lamb chops, rack of lamb and pasta, and nicely priced wine list (enough under $60).  The interior is exposed brick of a historic building, so that is charming.  The downstairs may look full but the upstairs is expansive.  It's in a tourist district, so I can understand if some others had an off experience when the place is full.  Our server was a sweet and professional woman, who did her job very well.
