I was in Vegas craving some Texas BBQ Brisket - Found this hidden gem off the strip.  The Brisket is amazing- The Smoked Turkey is amazing - the Ribs Rock- as a former Houston Astro Baseball player, this place is TEXAS in VEGAS !!!  Cream Corn is amazing - grab a Shiner Bock and enjoy Texas Grub in VEGAS !!!  The Staff is amazing as well. Great customer service!!  BIG B and Family did it right !!
