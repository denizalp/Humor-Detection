Eh, it's OK.\n\nIt's a decently modern airport, nothing like the hell-holes of the East Coast.\n\nUnlike almost any other airport, there are slot machines everywhere...cuz...\"Vegas\".\n\nI was in and out of this airport quickly in both directions so I'm not sure what the food & drink scene is like.\n\nTSA here was grossly under-staffed and an absolute cluster foxtrot
