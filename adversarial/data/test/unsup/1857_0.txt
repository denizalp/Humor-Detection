It takes big balls to have a bathroom through your kitchen!  Check it out!\n\nPros:\n\nThe place is super clean\nkitchen well maintained! \nPrices are great! \nFood is not greasy and good tasting. \nGood parking, great convenient location. \nVery pleasant inside.\n\nCons:\n\nlisten if you are a bitchy negative person, like some folks who gave it a 1 star, you can always find something wrong with everything around you.  Bring a positive minded spirit back to the restaurant and you'll give it 5 stars. or maybe you just had a bad day...
