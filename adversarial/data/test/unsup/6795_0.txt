Met Chum A++++++\n\nWife took pictures with CHUM A++++++\n\nFriendly place, ya to be honest a pawn shop was chill.  Price on a ring i bought, 20$ for black hills gold, who cares if i under paid or over paid the place was fun...  Now on TV this place is huge, in person very tight to move around in.  \n\nSaw the super bowl rings, the death clock and other items that i saw on tv.  Cool place to visit when I go back to Vegas. \n\nD
