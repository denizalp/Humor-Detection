We got the noodles to-go and a side and the side salad and side soup was not even half full. Was very disappointed with the quality and portion on this noodle & company. The tomato cucumber salad made me feel nauseous and had a weird displeasing aroma. I usually am a fan of Noodles & Company, but will not be going back.
