Got our food fourty and fifty minutes after ordering. (Different times). Staff forgot our order and scrambled to get our food for two on a moderately non busy Sunday.(my order was wrong tho). When the server brought our food we did not receive an apology she then rudely said \"we good?\". Really? I'm sorry but that's garbage. Never coming here again
