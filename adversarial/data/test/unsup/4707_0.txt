Love this place! Took our grandsons there while visiting from California.  Love the King Tut themed glow-in-the-dark mini golf. And, we had a blast playing laser tag - my first time.  They also have a snack bar, games, birthday party areas and super easy parking. Very entertaining.  Look for a Groupon before you go.
