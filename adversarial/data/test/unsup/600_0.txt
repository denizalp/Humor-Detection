I wish I could give no stars. I am completely shocked - I was five minutes late because of unexpected traffic due to a marathon (takes me 30 minutes to get there), and arrived at the studio for 8:35 and they would not let me in the class. \n\nI told them I had a friend waiting in the class and she refused to let me in, trying to persuade me to try a different class so that my friend could wait for me after. Ridiculous. Don't come here. Unempathetic people without any consideration.
