Was looking for a fast meal the other day and stopped by this location for lunch.  I didn't want a large meal and didn't have time to sit down and eat a Salad, so I ordered a Chocolate Oreo Frosty & Large Fries, ha!\n\nWhat a great combo.....the Fries were OK and the Chocolate Oreo Frosty was awesome!  I really wanted the regular Oreo Frosty, but they were out of Vanilla.....minus 1 Star for that.  I was full after this meal, that's all that mattered.\n\nReturn Factor - 40%
