Who ever designed the inside must be color blind. The walls are red and pink and aqua and green and blue and.....God knows what else. \n\nSome elderly woman who seemed to be suffering from dementia waited on us. \n\nWhen she brought our food she yelled :PEPPERCHECK  at us several times. Apparently this was her way of asking if we ordered pepper jack cheese. \n\nThe food was a little better than Denny's and a little worse than 5 & Diner. \n\nA lot of old people.\n\nWeird experience all around.
