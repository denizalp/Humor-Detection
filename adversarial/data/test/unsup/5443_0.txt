This is the only family friendly escape-room-type place in the Charlotte area. My family had never done one before, and had a blast at Escape Kings. \n\nThe seasonal Santa's Workshop room was challenging, fun, and age appropriate for my 9, 10, and 12 year old boys.  The owners were the nicest folks who took time to explain everything and ensure we had a great experience. We'll definitely be back to try the Aztec room soon. \n\n They also seem to be a great place for birthday parties with the Halo\/Minecraft room, etc.
