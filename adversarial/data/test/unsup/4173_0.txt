We had Gyudon and Pork Katsu Curry for lunch.  Beef in Gyudon is moist and flavourful, but could use a little more to cover the rice.  The Pork Katsu is better tenderized than my previous visit, and curry is good but no potato\/carrot in it. :o\n\nOverall good quality and price is reasonable.  Definitely worth a visit.  Japanese food is not limited to ramen and sushi!
