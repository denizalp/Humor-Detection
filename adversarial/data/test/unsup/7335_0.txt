$4 Tuesdays - what's not to love?\n\nLast week I saw a matinee of Adventureland and tomorrow afternoon it's The Hannah Montana Movie. Hey - I'll go see anything for 4 bucks. Yes: anything. \n\nThe only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is because the seats leave no breathing room and because I'm not allowed to bring in my tall Starbucks americano. It's a crappy shot of espresso with some hot water in it - what's the big deal? Suck it, vendor girl. Suck. It.
