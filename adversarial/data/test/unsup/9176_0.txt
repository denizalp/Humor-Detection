My favourite pho restaurant has opened a second location near Weston & Hwy 7! \n\nSo clean and the menu is just like the first location.\n\nI always get the\n\n*Pho đac biet - classic famous vietnamese soup with errthang\n\n*Pho Sate - same classic soup but SPICY\n\n*BÁNH  CUON - rice noodle rolls with ground pork meat, dipped in fish sauce  : my absolute  fav appetizer!\n\nMy friends love the rice dishes and pad thai.\n\nThis restaurant is so clean and it doesnt have the tacky vietnamese decor you see that other restaurants. I can eat in peace.
