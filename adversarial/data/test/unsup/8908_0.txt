I'm so excited I found Vicky again! She's amazing & sooooo sweet & friendly. They've created such a comfortable, friendly, professional environment with a cozy feel to it. Very welcoming as well. They r open til 11 and even though I was there til 1130, never once did I feel like I was a burden or inconvenience. I can't wait to build their business and spread their name. I'm very excited to see how successful this family owned nail salon can be :)
