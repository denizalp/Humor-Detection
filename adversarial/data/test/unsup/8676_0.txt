Memphis Championship Barbecue has perfected the fried okra. Their sauce is nicely balanced and complements the meat well. \nThe baby back ribs and pork shoulder were great with extra sauce, but alone were slightly dry. Loved the sweet apple tea. Service was great as well.\n\nOverall, a very enjoyable experience. I'll surely return for more Championship Barbecue!
