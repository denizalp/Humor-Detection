Rudy's does sell some quality meat. \n\nI buy sausage here on a regular basis. It's delicious. Their Andouille is unbeatable. \n\nThe staff at Rudy's are very friendly and helpful and can answer any question you have. \n\nBefore you make a stop to Rudy's, be aware that they do not accept credit \/ debit \/ checks. Cash only.
