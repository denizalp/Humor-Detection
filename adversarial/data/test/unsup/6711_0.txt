Hard to believe you can call it a resort. \nNo poolside dining? \nNo ability to order room service from the pool? \n\nNot like any other \"resort\" I've ever been to. \n\nI understand the concept of off season service, but most other hotel resorts make accommodations for their guests. \nI guess I have to go wander the casino in my swimsuit if I want to eat....Ewww.
