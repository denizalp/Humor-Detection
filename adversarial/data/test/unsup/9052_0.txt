I really like having a pita jungle close to my house!  I ate here last night for dinner, and it was tasty as always.  I ordered my 'usual' pita, the gyro.  yummy!\n\nService was wonderful.  My server was kind, and recommended a few things to try that were made with gyro meat, after I told him that I don't think I mix it up enough sometimes.\n\nThey have a seperate bar area here, and its off to the side.  Seating is open, spacious, clean and looks like all the other pita jungles that I have been too.\n\nTasty as always!
