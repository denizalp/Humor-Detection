Brampton is absolutely fortunate to have this restaurant. Everything from the decor to the service was outstanding. Chantal was charming and happy to answer every question we had and the food was incredible. \n\nI would recommend this place to anyone and everyone. There is something for you here. Oh and the beer choices are off the charts as well.
