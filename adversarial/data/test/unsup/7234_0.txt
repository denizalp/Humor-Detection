$100 for 9 pieces of sushi and a mouthful of other food, no thanks.\n\nThe atmosphere made it feel like we were in a library, needing to take off our shoes was less than charming (particularly since the interior design wasn't inspired and didn't feel like I was entering a special space to need to make special accommodations), and the taste of the food lingered until the next day.\n\nTo each his\/her own but this one is not for me.
