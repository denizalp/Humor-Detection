For me these are the cupcakes to end all cupcakes...they are the gold standard I compare all other cupcakeries to when I go out for cupcake tastings.  If you're in Phoenix then you MUST try their cupcakes.   Plus, the ladies are so nice; the customer service is very personalized.  They just really take care of you!
