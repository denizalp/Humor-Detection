Just ate a Bulgogi Bento (beef Bento).  I can honestly say it was delicious, and at a reasonable price of $12.50+ tax.  They give you complimentary green tea and Miso.  I really liked the beef and dumplings.  The salad and veggies were also good.  I don't know much about Korean food, but this little place is recommended.  I'll give it 4-stars since I haven't really compared to other places, but it was a great dish.\n\nC.L.
