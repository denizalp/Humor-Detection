Bartenders are not personable, and I've been here multiple times. Save your money for a fun bar and leave these douchebags alone. Maybe then they will be more appreciative of new business\n\nAlso, i have heard nothing but rotten things about their st pattys day festival of overpriced admission and drinks.
