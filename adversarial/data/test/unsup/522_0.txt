Odours on the Danforth are normal - part of the neighbourhood. The smell of fresh roast coffee, souvlaki, and other ethnic flavours...\n\nBut there's a new smell on the Danforth, (at Broadview).  Dough Bakeshop. Fresh baked breads, muffins and other oven tasty treats, including ice-cream.\n\nThe bread is often oven hot and incredibly fresh. They've only been open for a month or two and already I've met people that drive across town to pick up their evening bread.\n\nI don't know if they do gluten-free products or not.
