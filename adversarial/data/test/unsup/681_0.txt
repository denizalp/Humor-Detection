fry crisp, my chickpea, \nyour crunchy goodness delights\ncarnivores as well.\n\nMaha's Felafel in the northeast corner of the Westside Market serves up the best felafel I have ever had.  Made to order, crispy and spicy goodness.  I also prefer the gyro to \"Steve's Gyro\" in the market.  Maha's gives you freshly made and seasoned meat that, again, is cooked to order, and much tastier than the one featured on Man vs Food, or whatever show that featured it.  \nQuality vs. quantity...\nCarry on.
