We stopped here for dinner before watching Zumanity. I had my first martini and it was POTENT. Was already buzzed before the appetizers arrived. This is a good thing. We had the Irish nachos and the fried sausage. My husband said he could stop at that without the entrees. Regardless, if you come here, make sure you sit outside to get a nice view and fresh air. Definitely recommend this place!
