This is a great cozy park. Has a nice walking trail and plenty of room to play with your dogs. The jungle gym is just like any other park and is very nice. The baseball diamonds are great for team ball sports. They have a basketball court that sometimes gets crowded but over all it's a great place to play. They also have a frisbee course for those that like that. \n\nThis park is a great family park.
