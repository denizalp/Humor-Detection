Went in today and noticed they had risen their prices. The lady working the register confirmed that for us and that some locations had gone up even higher. Jersey Mikes was always expensive for subs but to top it off, they got rid of their daily specials! Their subs are good but paying $11-$13 for a regular combo is just ridiculous. Plenty of better values in this area.
