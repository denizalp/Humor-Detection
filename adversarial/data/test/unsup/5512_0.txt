Decided to go here during restaurant week. It was fantastic. I had the filet mignon. Perfectly cooked to a medium. My buddy had the paella which was quite good. Not traditionally made with lots of rice but still very tasty. They did not skimp on the seafood. This place can get pricey but would be excellent for special occasions.
