OK so I am a fan of the gay bars. Shocked? Didn't think so. I also like karaoke. Shocked now? I leave nothing to surprise. I love this bar.\n\nThe patrons tend to choose awful songs for karaoke but somehow it works out as charming here. Everyone is super gracious and friendly; very welcoming to new singers. \n\nThe patio is terrific. Roomy, friendly and plenty of seating for the smokers and always someone to light up your smoke. \n\nThe drinks are reasonable and well poured and the bartenders are good people. \n\nJust your friendly neighborhood dive bar...with a rainbow flag.
