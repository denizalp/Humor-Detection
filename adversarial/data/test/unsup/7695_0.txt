Went in with very low expectations after reading previous reviews. But I was pleasantly surprised. We had a good experience. The service was decent , dint take very long. Food was good. Really liked the chicken biryani and malai kofta. Agreed they are still in the learning stages of a new place but the staff was courteous. I would definitely go back.
