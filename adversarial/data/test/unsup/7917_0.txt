New M4 burritos opened up near McGill!!!! Great environment, clean and crisp.\n\nStaff was friendly and service was fast.\n\nFood is everything you'd expect! I'm used to chipotle back in toronto so this is exactly what I needed. They're very similar, expect M4 prices are more varied in terms of the meats (carnitas, chicken, steak, barbacoas, etc) unfortunately, guacamole is still extra.\n\nAlso, if you're a student you get 10% off! I didn't even know but the cashier asked.
