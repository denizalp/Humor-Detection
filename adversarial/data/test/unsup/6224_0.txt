The garlic bread is delicious.  Order a side of marinara to dip it in and you'll look like a real Italian.  \n\nThe Crazy Alfredo was packed with shrimp, sausage, chicken, and half a dozen other items.  And it had just the right level of spiciness to complement the many other flavors packed into it!  \n\nMy dining companion was looking for something simple and ordered the gnocchi with  marinara.  He enjoyed the dish immensely.\n\nThis is one of those hidden gems that will put smiles on visitors' faces forever!
