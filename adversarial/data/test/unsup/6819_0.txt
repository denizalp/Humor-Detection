A good all you can eat restaurant for people who like to enjoy Korean BBQ. 2 hours to have meals there, so you can try as many meats and dishes as you want. The price for lunch is fair, merely $14.95 per person. There are 29 choices of meats and dishes for you to enjoy, as well as some side dishes. The flavor of dishes ordered by us is good. Meats are fresh and juicy. It's a good place for group gathering.
