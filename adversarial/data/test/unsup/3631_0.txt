The popcorn can be hit or miss here, I think it depends on your preferences.  Personally I think their regular popcorn and cheese and ones with different nuts are just okay, like 3 stars.  However, I'm rating them based on my favorite which is the classic caramel corn, no nuts, just sweet and crunchy and flavorful caramel covered popcorn.
