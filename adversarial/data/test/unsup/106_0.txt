I got a hot stone massage, which started out great with the therapist asking about what I would like to focus on. He even followed through with my request! However, I was cold in the room, and asked for the table heater to be turned up, only to learn that it's not allowed to be on. Hot stones on icicle skin is not really the most relaxing experience. \n\nAlso, the therapist was breathing his cigarette breath all over me. For the love of god, use a mint.
