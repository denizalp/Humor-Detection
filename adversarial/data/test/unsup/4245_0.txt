Have been here probably a dozen times now and have yet to be disappointed. The 6 inch subs are a LOT of food for me and I am always stuffed. I've tried the Philly cheesesteak, the chicken teriyaki, and the Reuben- all of which are delicious! \n\nA word to the wise though. . . Don't ever look up the calorie, sodium, or fat content...
