I saw Serena for my very first waxing experience and she was theeeee MOST professional, fun and experienced wax tech! I was so nervous beforehand and she addressed my concerns, put me at ease and made the entire experience practically enjoyable! Lol will definitely go back to Serena and recommend her! Have ALREADY told many to give her a call!
