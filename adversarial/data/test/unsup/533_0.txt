Friends wanted to try the fried chicken ,I was not keen on ordering. And of course overcooked dried out fried chicken.they should really close this place. Swiss Chalet at this location doesn't care about quality . If this is your delivery store , don't place an order. It's been like this for a number of years and it's not going to change cause the same manager is still there and he really doesn't care.
