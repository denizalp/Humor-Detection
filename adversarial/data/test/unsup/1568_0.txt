I would give this office zero stars if I didn't like my Dr. so much.  This place has absolutely no idea what competent, quality customer service is. Every time I call I'm on hold for at least 20 minutes. Then they tell me they can't even help me or they transfer me to a phone number where no one answers. Thankfully I moved out of state so I only have to deal with this incompetence occasionally.
