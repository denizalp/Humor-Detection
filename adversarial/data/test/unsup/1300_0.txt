New restaurant alert.  If you filipino food then this is the spot to go.  \n\nUbe waffles with fried chicken is a must order with their homemade maple butter.  Who a pairing like that could be so delicious. \n\nPlus the staff is super nice. I accidentally dropped my knife on the ground and it got replaced right away.\n\nI'm coming back to try the rest!
