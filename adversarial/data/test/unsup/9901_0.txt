Real neato. So you don't get lost trying to get there like us, it's right outside the Venetian closest to the strip. \n\nLike everything else, it's expensive but a fun way to spend ~1 hour. Plenty of selfie opportunities. \n\nA lot of celebrities\/athletes with really well done props and settings. If you notice your buzz is dying off, have no fear as there is a bar about halfway through the museum. \n\nThe 4D movie at the end was a cheesy Avengers cartoon, good for kids though.
