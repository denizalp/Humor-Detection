First time Korean bbq and I came to Gen because I got plenty of suggestions from friends and family. I was quite impressed, very cozy environment. The booths provide privacy since I took my girlfriend her as an anniversary dinner. She absolutely loved it. Also, Luis the food runner provided extraordinary service, friendly and constantly checked up on us making sure our drinks were filled, orders were made, and cleaning up the table. Highly recommended Luis his open attitude makes me want to visit Gen more often.
