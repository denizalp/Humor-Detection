The beer selection is great, the atmosphere is awesome and the food is to die for. Get the lobster roll or the steak tip roll. The only thing that baffles me is every time I come here, they always have signs out front giving you specials of the day and every time you come in and ask them about it no one knows what's going on. So please change the signs every once in awhile if you are in fact not giving out those specials anymore.
