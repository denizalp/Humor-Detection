Food was good but service was terrible. They weren't even busy. Waitress came over ONCE the entire meal and that was to take our order 20 minutes after we sat down. We had to ask the bus boy for the check. Free check in offer gets you a small edamame or cucumber salad.\n\nI would come back and get my food to go.
