I have no shame in saying how much I love Panera!  I have always preferred Panera's coffee over Starbucks & I only wish they would open smaller stores so I could have it more often.  I love their rewards card too - I usually get a free item of sorts every couple of months.  Not only is the food high quality but they also have delicious baked goods, smoothies, etc - something for everyone.  The employees are always super friendly too!
