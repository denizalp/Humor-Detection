Last night the bartender looked me over twice to fill out some paper on a clipboard. No big deal. I decided to leave after a black gentleman sat next to me after I had waited for nearly 10 minutes and the same bartender asked for his drink order in less than 2 minutes of his arrival, before asking for mine. Blatant racism.
