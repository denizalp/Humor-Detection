I love this place! I recently moved back to Charlotte and was looking for a good Caribbean food restaurant and I stumbled upon this one. They are very accommodating of all requests. I loveeeee the jerk sauce they use on the wings and the plantains are amazing. My only complaint is about the cornbread. It's very dry. But other than that, I definitely recommend this place! And the prices are very reasonable.
