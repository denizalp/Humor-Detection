Local designers, accessories. There are a lot of stores in the area with the same kind of focus. After going to three of them they all kind of blurred in my mind. There are some nice things in this store as well, but nothing that I was looking for. Things in this store seemed more on the quirky, casual side, probably for spring\/summer. I didn't see any basics in here, I'm probably in the wrong store for that. But I was hoping at least to see one piece I could pick up. Better luck next time maybe.
