My friends and I had 2 rooms here for our group of 8 on our most recent Vegas trip. Check-in took forever, but we managed to get rooms across from each other even though we had booked separately. We also slid by the additional persons charge by only putting down 2 people per room. Shhhh. \n\nThe rooms were spacious- the one I stayed in even had a huge closet with sliding mirror doors. Unfortunately, the other room just had a small armoire. The beds were comfy and large enough to share. A pretty standard and affordable Vegas hotel.
