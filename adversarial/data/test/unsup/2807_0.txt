One of the only normal bars around Tremont. Tuesday Taco night is always one of the busiest nights. Rumor is that the building was an old funeral home. That is all that I think of when I enter the bar now. The patio is really enjoyable in the summer. The servers and bartenders are nice people. It is usually a friendly crowd that comes here. The food is decent. The taco meat is covered in hot sauce. Tastes pretty good though. They have Simpsons pinball which is always a blast to play. A good low key place to go.
