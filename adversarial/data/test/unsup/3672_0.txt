This is a really small branch, and I would have only given it 2 stars *BUT* since it's so small and seems to only really serve the folks that live right around it I was able to find some books there that were out at the main Mesa Library and the Tempe Library.\n\nSo for that I am willing to grant you a whole extra star, wear it proudly!
