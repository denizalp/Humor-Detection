I placed an online order, which they sent to this location. It was labelled with the wrong name and the management was totally apathetic and not at all interested in offering any help or suggestions. Eventually, corporate Lowe's helped us figure out the situation, but I would never work with this store again. They weren't interested in helping us with our order, we're not interested in giving them our money.
