I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked Porco. They gave us the tiki room for a bachelorette outing, with mood lighting and really excellent service. The drinks menu is wide-ranging and affordable enough to be able to have a couple fancy drinks without completely blowing the budget. The dry-ice is mysterious and exotic, and the drinks are strooooong. \n It seemed like everyone in the bar was having a great time without getting out of control. I hope to get back for summer patio time!
