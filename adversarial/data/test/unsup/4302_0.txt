This company is absolutely amazing! I was first introduced to them when I was a bridesmaid in my best friend's wedding. They were so great that I knew I wanted them to do my hair and make up for my wedding day. They were always extremely understanding and always worked with what I wanted and needed. They really made my morning stress free and fun! I would definitely recommend this company to any Bride looking!
