This is the only place my fiance will ever go for pizza, especially a late night one. \n\nFor $4, you can 2 slices. I've actually never been inside and only waited in the car as most times it's super late and we're illegally parked. \n\nThe pizza is divine - thin crust, every bite crispy and crunchy, toppings are not over powering (last night was pepperoni and mushroom). \n\n*finger smack*
