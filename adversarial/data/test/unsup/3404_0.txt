This place is great because it is open 24 hours. I've tried the calamari. I would say Ichiza has better fried calamari. The zen noodles is pretty good. It is somewhat like pho, but not pho. Santa Barbra sandwhich is pretty good in my opinion. I would ordered that again. The waitress was nice and overall, this place leaves a good impression on me.
