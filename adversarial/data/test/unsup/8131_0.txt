This Dairy Queen, isn't like most. First off they don't have hamburgers at this location. That to me is like KFC not having chicken. \nOh well if you just like hotdogs, and ice cream then this place will be good for you. \nOh yeah they also sell Julius' here.\nMy son had a grilled cheese sandwich. The cheese wasn't fully melted. That could be a one off thing. Oh, and my hotdog bun was dry. \nI will come back. Just not if I'm in the mood for a burger.
