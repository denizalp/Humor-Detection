Waited 15 minutes for service after we sat down, I had to hunt a waiter down and the manager came out to take our order, so after that fabulous first time welcome I decided I wouldn't be back especially since service continued to be slooooooowwwww.  \n\nWe got there at 6 pm and ended up leaving right before 8 p.m. WTF?  Mushroom goat pizza was ok, kids had a pizza too. Lobster bisque was good, not enough wow to bring me back.
