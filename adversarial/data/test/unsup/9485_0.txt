Excellent high-quality local ingredients (better than El Campesino). My favorites are the tofu tacos and mahi mahi tacos. The kids love their children's menu because it's actual tex mex but in smaller portions (not like most children's menu fare of chicken nuggets) and it comes with celery\/carrots to start and a delicious warm brownie with ice cream to end.
