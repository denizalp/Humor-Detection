Keegan's? More like Barf-gins. \n\nThe food: Low quality. Our wings came out completely charred, Brussels sprouts were slimy and gross, shrimp tacos were overly salted. Chicken came out in a side dish with blue liquid on the bottom (chicken and detergent?)\n\nThe service: Our waitress, Teresa, slammed our food down on the table and never came back to check in and see how things were. Our order was wrong. Teresa also didn't bother to acknowledge the fact that we literally barely touched half of what we ordered when she dropped the check and ran off.
