Dr Clifford and the staff are the best, most patient and professional dentist I have ever been too.  When I was younger I did not have the greatest experiments and when I got older I delayed going until it was absolutely necessary.\n\nNow I actually enjoy going.  When I had scaleing I did not even feel anything! The entire staff is excellent I will never go to another dentist.
