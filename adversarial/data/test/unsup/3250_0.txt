So it's cold out and you have a hankering for fresh farmer's market esque food.  Where to go?  Right here.  With new additions like Heist Bakery (ie, Heist Brewery) you will love what you find here.  They have a rather ecclectic collection of vendors, from pickle specialist to honey to meat shops.  All good and all local.\n\nOne of my favorite vendors is in here, Beverly's Gourmet Foods.  Unreal food from them and here's a hint, if you catch some right before they begin closing down you might can snag some really good pricing for those items they can't keep!!
