Nice place and friendly service.   We had the pork medallion special.  The veggies and mashed potatoes were perfect but the pork was a little dry; either over cooked or under marinated. We rarely get dessert but the skillet cookie sounded good to my hubby so we shared and it was really good.  We will go again.   Three stars as no good craft beer, fat tire was best they had.
