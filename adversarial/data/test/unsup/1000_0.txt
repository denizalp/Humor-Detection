There's this MD Skin Lounge with Jamie Comstock, daughter of one of the most respected dermatologist in the United States, (& trained at Mom's Skin Spectrum offices) at this skin lounge!!!  That alone is priceless information.  And Ms. Comstock just happens to be brilliant too!  Love this place!  Book in advance.  They're of course super busy but with the wait!!!\nBut be careful of \"upsetting\" the mean girls that run the office...they only want to hear how great they are, even when they aren't.  And they aren't...the mean girls that is.
