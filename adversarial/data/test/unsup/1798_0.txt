Had a horrendous experience just now where Mikey the window server refused to give a second order through the drive through; since he couldn't seem to answer me back on his headset after my first order. He immediately called his superior, who then proceeded to tell me merry fucking Christmas after I explained the situation. I will never go to this location again, what a Christmas spirit, what a sense of pride and dignity they offered to their loyal customers. This is not customer service, this is a complete lack of training.
