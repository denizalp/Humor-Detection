If my \"uncle\" served me food like this, we would no longer be family...\nHonestly I had high hopes that were shattered by the salt and mundane, lacking flavours of the dishes. Corn\/Polenta muffin were good, fried chicken was decent. Pasta was horrible, but the worst was the Sheppards pie... it was absolutely disgusting. Eggs were oddly crusty and bacon overcooked.\nThe only dessert I had was the bread pudding,  it was the only saving grace for this abominable display. \nTheir selection is far too limited, but there is promise if they improve the quality of the dishes offered.
