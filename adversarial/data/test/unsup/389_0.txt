Andrew at German Motor Works saved my weekend. \n\nWhen my daughter's BMW 325csi started leaking coolant and running hot on Thursday evening, I figured I'd be without MY car all weekend since my daughter had to work and would have to use my car since her's was broken. \n\nAt 1pm on Friday when I took her car in, Andrew immediately took the time to diagnose AND repair her car within an hour of my bringing it in. \n\nTHAT's what I call 5 star service!\n\nThanks German Auto Works!!! \n\nMy daughter and I both have our cars for the weekend!
