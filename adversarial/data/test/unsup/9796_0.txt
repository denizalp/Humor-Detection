Great place to visit as the have a wonderful selection of delectable Asian Desserts.  Almost too pretty to eat!  Tried the Coconut \nRoll, it was marvelous!  Never had such a great roll in my life!  Fresh, soft, fluffy and sweet, filled with coconut cream!  Should have bought a dozen!  I will be back!!!!!
