Me and my wife came back again after 2 years during our visit to Pittsburgh. I would say nothing has changed with respect to quality of food service and ambience. All perfect. We ordered the crab Rangoon which we had before and on the spot- same perfect preparation. This time we tried the grilled salmon with vegetables in yellow curry and was very well prepared. We shall come back every time I suppose now that we see the quality is well maintained. The only minus point would be the green tea we had which was not hot.
