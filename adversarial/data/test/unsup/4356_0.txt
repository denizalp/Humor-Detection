Service was average..food was kinda bland..actually really bland..sister ordered the pozole to start which tasted like hot water with pork and hominy..absolutely no flavor..i ordered the chicken tacos and it was basically boiled shredded chicken in my tacos..very disappointing..i really wanted to like this place..the only thing that had flavor was the carne asada..I like the chips and salsa but I probably won't come back again..nothing to come back for
