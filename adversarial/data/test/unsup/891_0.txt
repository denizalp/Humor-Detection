Great little place in Stouffville! My husband and I had dinner there Saturday night and loved our experience. I had BBQ chicken sandwich and it was amazing. My husband had the ultimate cheese burger and he also loved it. We will defiantly go back! Staff was also very friendly and helpful! Looking forward to our next visit!
