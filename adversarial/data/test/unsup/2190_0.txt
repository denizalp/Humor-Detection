Had lunch at my mothers, no not talking bout my moms place, ha had a sandwich with mac salad. It was okay, have had better sandwiches elsewhere, my homie had some chicken wings, they looked and smelled yummy. Saw the ladies across the way order spaghetti, definitely on my to order list when I make it back to mothers.
