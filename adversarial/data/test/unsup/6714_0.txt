This is my old digs from my college days and it is still kicking after all these years. They have a great selection of British and Irish beers on tap. The food here is great! I recommend the Basket of English Wallys (must try!!), Fish n Chips, Bangers and Mash, Beef and Guinness Pie or the English Sausage Rolls. It's all good. Also a great place to watch a game or play some darts.
