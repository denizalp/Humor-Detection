As I've often said, if you want good Dim Sum, you have to leave the city.  This place is the perfect example of that.  \n\nThe Dim Sum here is probably the freshest, tastiest I've experienced in all of Torontonia.  You order your food, instead of having it delivered by cart. While I'm used to ordering via cart, this method is so MO BETTAH!  You're getting exactly what you want, and it's always fresh and piping hot.\n\nNo more yelling: \"WHERE IS MY SUI MAI BA PO!\"
