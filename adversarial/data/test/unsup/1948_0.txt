I booked an SUV rentalcars.com. Even though I did not like having to pay an additional $30 for unlimited miles, they did still offer the cheapest rate. My copilot & I were helped by Clint. He was friendly, informative, & helpful. It took a while to finish checking out but it was because Clint was accommodatingly social. If my experience returning the car is as good as the pick up, I won't be updating this review.
