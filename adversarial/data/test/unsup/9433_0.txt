This was an alright movie theater. It had the requisite accoutrements of a theater. Just in Mesa and at Riverview which sucks. They seen to have recently remodeled to have 'luxury recliners' that not only require that you pick your seats when you buy tickets (without any guarantees that someone isn't already in the seats) but also the seats are horribly uncomfortable whether reclined or upright. I now hate this theater...
