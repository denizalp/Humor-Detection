Bad environment, worse food. Geriatric smokers coughing everywhere! How does this place continue to operate in Scottsdale?  Simply awful. Canned, mushy vegetables. Not a fresh ingredient to be found anywhere. The even have signage touting themselves for their ice cream. Don't get too excited, it's just Dreyer's. Avoid Randy's at all costs, considering the other options nearby. Disgusting.
