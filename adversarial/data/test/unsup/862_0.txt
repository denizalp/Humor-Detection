My favorite of any locals casinos in the valley!  A poshness here that doesn't come across as such!  This is a fantastic location for people traveling with kids, couples looking to get away, and plenty of amenities to keep you inside all day!  There's a Kids Quest here the kids will love spending time in while you gamble, a pool that's just gorgeous, a beautiful movie complex, and a 60 lane bowling alley!
