This review is not for the dentist, but rather for the nasty receptionist.\n\nDr. Vander Schaaf was rather a sweet mid-aged lady and her hygienist was really sweet too.\n\nBut,... Heather or Betty? its been like 8-9 months since I've been here I still remember how displeased I was by the experience with the receptionist I stopped going back after two visits.\n\nShe was so rude and disrespectful of my time, I was outraged and eventually found another dentist. She was not helpful with scheduling my appointments around my work schedule to say the very least.
