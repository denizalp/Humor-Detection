They really have a cool selection of seafood and salads. maybe this is the main reason I am visiting Winko few times a week. The prices are decent and even low. \nWinko is claimed to be one of the cheapest places to shop in Vegas. If it is about the seafood, they have one of the best prices in town. The veggies and fruits are almost always fresh.
