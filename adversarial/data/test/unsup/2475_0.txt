I needed something quick to eat before I boarded my flight back to NY and there was slim picking at this terminal.  I haven't had Quiznos in years and probably for good reason.  I had the chicken carbonara.  It was pretty much exactly what I expected from a Quiznos located in the airport.  The bread was mediocre and everything was overly salty. Good thing I had lots of water for the flight home.
