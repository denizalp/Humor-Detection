Americas is a place that I had to visit more then once before I reviewed. \n\nIt is good. The carne asada was tender and had a nice charred flavor. \n\nThe bean and cheese burrito was good. \n\nThe chips and salsa were bland, the salsa was \"tomato sauce\" as one of the 10 year kids said. \n\nThe price was a little high esp $1.50 for each can of pop. That is $9 a six pack....
