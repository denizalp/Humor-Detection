Have been waiting for several months and Finally They Are Back In Business with new management ! Ordered to go & was soooo good that my Bf & I didn't get to our phones fast enough.  We had the Tokyo Roll, California Roll, Shrimp Roll, Wasa Tako (octopus with fresh wasabi & daikon) and the Shima Aji Jalapeño (Jalapeño yellowtail  cilantro, yuzu dressing) everything was delicious & fresh.
