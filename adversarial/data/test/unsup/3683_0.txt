What a misnomer. This is just another typical bar on W. 6th. The only thing that makes it somewhat of a dive bar is because it is in the basement level of the street. So I guess you could say that it is a dive bar because you are going down in depth and if the ground was water it would be a dive type motion. You are diving in some shallow water. I prefer swimming with peaceful creatures like manatees. W. 6th is a place to go if you like dancing, house music and epileptic seizure inducing lighting.
