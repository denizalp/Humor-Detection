The new management here is terrible do not move here or believe their advertisement. Everything has changed the maintenance except for the on person from previous owners is non existent. They don't clean the pools, we have homeless people and random,kids climbing our pool gates and dirtying the property. Recently people stay up and get drunk after hours that don't even live here. I write this post because it is impossible to reach anyone by phone at convenience.\n\nThe only reason I give one star is because my lease started with old management. We will be leaving ASAP!
