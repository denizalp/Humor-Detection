Tried this place for the first time. Heard good reviews from friends and family. The wait was long but the food and service was great. Ozzy was our server and he did a great job at making sure our waters were filled, served our food promptly and provided great suggestions since he knew it was our first time. Would recommend asking for Ozzy when checking this place out.
