After the gym nothing like a protein backed mushroom burger at fresh. This is probably my favourite dish on the menu, and it is not that pricey. I have heard from many people that to eat at this place it is pricey, for myself I don't mind paying alittle more money for good quality food. The service is quick and the food is always good.
