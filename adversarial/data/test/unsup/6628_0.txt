I love this store because it's so easy to buy gifts for women here. Basically just pick anything and the recipient will be happy. It's like going to the Disney Store to buy gifts for small children. Hard to go wrong.\nThe staff here was very helpful. They ask a few simple questions and give you good suggestions based on your response. \nRight now, they have some variety gift sets being sold at package deals. They make excellent gifts. I had to drop some money here today.Thank you ladies for all of your help!
