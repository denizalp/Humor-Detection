Who doesn't love Arbys? I have always loved the beef and cheddar....roast beef with some melty yummy cheesy goodness. I do say I also LOOOOOVE the loaded potato bites, but I am a sucker for anything loaded with carbs. I feel less guilty eating here than at other fast food places, but who am I kidding? I'm sure calorie wise its all about the same.
