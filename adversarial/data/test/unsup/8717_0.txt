I used to watch WPXI news bc I can't stand Wendy \"Now get this...\" Bell on WTAE I got tired of all the human interest stories on KDKA.  Now, I can barely stand to watch WPXI bc I cant stand watching Darieth Chisholm stumble her way through each news cast.\n\nShe used to be an amazing anchor.  I don't know what's wrong.  Can't the print on the teleprompter be enlarged or something?  She stumbles over her words so often that I actually feel bad for her. \n\nIt's so annoying, I never watch this channel anymore.
