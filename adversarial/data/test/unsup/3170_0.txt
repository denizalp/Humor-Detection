Went in for brunch on Monday morning. Tiger shrimp tamale was fantastic as was my salmon. We also tried the burger but thought it was just okay... Seemed like any other burger.  Love their bread basket\n\nKind of weird where we sat because outside the restaurant wall you can hear and kind of see the games that were playing on the big screen in the casino area.
