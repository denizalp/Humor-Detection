Been here a few times. Inside is always clean and large with plenty of tables to study at. Every time I've gone inside, it's pretty quiet and not too crowded. Staff is always helpful!\n\nI used the drive-thru during lunch time and it was quick with a non-existent line. However, I pass this location in the morning and the line does look much busier around 7:30-8am.
