This cute little bakery has the best bread in town. I love keeping their white dinner rolls (made with unbleached white wheat) in the freezer for when I run out of my fresh stash. The ingredients are quality and simple, which you can taste. Cinnamon rolls, cookies, brownies and loaves of heaven are what you will find here. To top it off, the staff is positive, helpful and very friendly. We love this place!!
