Crap--Crap--and more--Crap\n\nMy wife and I finally checked out this local Italian joint because it looks so quaint from the outside.   If you just want to look in the window, it's fine....It you want a good meal, you better keep walking.\n\nSalads were overdressed, food was overcooked..... To make matters worse, they tried to overcharge us by $20 ......   You can do way better in Leslieville....   Trust me..... We're foodies and eat out A LOT.....
