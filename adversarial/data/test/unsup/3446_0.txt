Nice local Italian bakery in Woodbridge. Staff are genuinely nice and friendly. Purchased Sicilian style cannoli and pistachio eclairs for a family we were visiting and they called back to compliment our choice of pastries and bakery as each piece was devoured in seconds!! Will definitely be coming back as both service and quality was wonderful! Thank you La Strada bakery!!
