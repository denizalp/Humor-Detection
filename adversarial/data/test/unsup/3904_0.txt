The only real reason I come here is for the Blue Crabs. I use to drive across town to the other location to get them, I like the other location better but I also don't want to drive farther than I have to!\nI usually get them to go, so the people I have dealt with on the phone and at the front door have all been nice and my food has always been done when promised.\nI will continue to go here as long as they keep getting my yummy blue crabs for me to buy!
