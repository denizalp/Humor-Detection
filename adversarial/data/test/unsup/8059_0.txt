I don't know what happened to this place!  They once had great bartenders that knew how to make some amazing cocktails, not to mention they could handle a full bar in stride....I went there last week and this place is just awful now in comparison.  I am sorry Merc, your service was poor and slow, with a kind of haughty, supercilious demeanor.  Not sure I will be back.
