It's just ok. Nothing spectacular. The taste is ok, the serving is small, for the size it's really pricey... The naan bread kind of keeps the hot dog and toppings neat but since the dog is so small it makes it super bready. \n\nTIP: order the chicken sausage. Skip everything else. I don't recommend anything from this place. It lacks flavor, especially their tasteless homemade chips. Skip that too. Yes, just skip this place period. Best tip ever =)
