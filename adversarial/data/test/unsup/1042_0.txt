Large dishes to share. Had the Homestyle Tofu and Pineapple Rice and another dish, can't remember the name, but it was spicy hot. All fantastic and vegan. It was so good that  we ate every bit and had no leftovers to take home. At the end of the meal we were served complimentary orange slices. Very nice and healthy end to the meal!!
