After having been on the road for hours, I was just looking for something decent and fast.  What a delightful surprise to stumble across this place!  Stylish decor,  friendly greeting,  upscale yet casusl atmosphere,  and a menu that has something for everyone without moving outside the realm where they could get it wrong.  Know what you do and do it well!  Excellent service and excellent meal. I had the half pound Angus beef burger and fries.  Delish!
