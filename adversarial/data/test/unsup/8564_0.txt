i have been looking for a truly outstanding apple fritter ever since moving to henderson. still looking. perhaps was better at 5am but at 9am was pretty dried out. also had a jalapeno cheese kolache, was better than the fritter. fellow behind the counter seemed friendly enough. my total came to to $4.04 and he gave me pocket full of change and a five back from my $10. really? yeah, still looking.
