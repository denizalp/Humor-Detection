This place is amazing! The new layout is perfect for a high quality salon, and the prices are absolutely affordable. \n\nATTENTION: please disregard past reviews. Kim never worked there, the tools are 100% disinfected and sterilized before every use, and in case you didn't know CHEESE GRATERS ARE USED TO REMOVE CALLUSES. If you're not comfortable with cheese graters, you can ask them not to use it (but I recommend you do if you have bad heels, mine have gotten better because of the dead skin removal.) \n\nI would recommend this place to anyone!
