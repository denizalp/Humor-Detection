I ordered their Lamb Shawarma and crab cake bites appetizers last night. I woke up promptly at 5:30 this morning and proceeded to puke my guts out. I'm not sure which did the job, but they were the only things I had eaten that day. That being said the meal itself was pretty mediocre. \n\nThere are many other places like this in the Pittsburgh area, I'm sure you can find a better one.
