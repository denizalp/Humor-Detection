Yet another night was spent at Rehab this past weekend. When my friends and I want to go out and don't feel like driving all the way downtown this is the place where we usually go to.\n\nI think we arrived before 11 pm because we still got to use the guest list line instead of the regular line. The bouncers are nice and getting into Rehab is never an issue. Last Saturday night the main room, patio, and second floor were open. The music was blasting and drinks were flowing, we had an epic time.
