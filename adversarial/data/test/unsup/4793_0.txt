Well, I guess the night was a success, but no one really remembers. At the last club, my drunkard husband tripped and broke his foot, but we didn't know it until we got back home.\n\nYou know what they say: \"It's not a party until something gets broken!\"\n\nThe third club, at Paris, was by far the best. The last club, Tryst, is a blur.\n\nAll-in-all, it was a great way to spend my 40th birthday
