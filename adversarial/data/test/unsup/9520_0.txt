Took my wife and son to experience this Charlotte institution and to be honest it was the worst burger I've had in quite a while. Meat was dry and burnt and eating it all the way just tried to mask the non flavor. Fries were also too thick, bland and not very good. As much as everyone raves about this place, I just don't see it.
