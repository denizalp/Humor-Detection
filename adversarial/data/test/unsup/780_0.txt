anything and everything about Meraki is exceptional. with being greek myself, this is truly the most authentic greek restaurant i've been to and had in las vegas. i'm very picky when it comes to food but Meraki never disappoints for sure. i eat here as often as i can but i wish it was every day. Love:)
