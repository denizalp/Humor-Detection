This place is a lot smaller than it looks on the outside, basically a square building and straight row for the bar area. With that said, they offer karaoke nights and really generous birthday specials (free drinks all night in their complimentary glass! See my photo for the full detail). The bartenders were nice enough, the ambiance is a bit divey, and they tended to go heavy on country while we were there.
