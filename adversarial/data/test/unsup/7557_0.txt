High prices for items available elsewhere at lower prices.  Customer service comes and goes.  The worst part about spending my money there is that they ask for ID on credit card purchases as low as $5.00.  If I was buying a $1,000 plus tool, that might be understandable.  Why establish an uncomfortable situation over small change?  Next time, if there ever is, I'll also be asking the employees for their IDs.\n\nIf you want great wood at great prices along with great customer service check out Wine Glass Bar Saw Mill.  They actually respect their customers.
