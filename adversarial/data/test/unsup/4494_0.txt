This is officially my favourite St. Lawrence Market cheese stall. That is saying a lot because there are a million of them. Let me \"Brie\"k it down for you:\n\n1. Helpful, knowledgeable, not-pushy staff\n2. Great prices and specials\n3. Plentiful, multifarious samples\n\nI stopped by on a weekend market stroll and tried everything from 15-year-old cheddar to Brie de Meaux (raw milk) to the triple creamed cheese they had on sale, and if you're reading this, Scheffler's -- I bought them all!\n\nA-Oka. Very gouda. Cheddar than all the rest. I'll see myself out.
