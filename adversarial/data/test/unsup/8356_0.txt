This is nice place to hold a private event. The decor is not old, but very understated. The best part of the Arizona Club is the breathtaking view of the valley. \n\nThe Arizona Club is on the 37th floor of the Chase building, the tallest building in Phoenix. \n\nCareful... the bartenders pour strong drinks.
