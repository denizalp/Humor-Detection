Unfortunately, I would not recommend this cleaning company.  I had them clean an empty rental house for a flat $150 fee and only 1 person showed up (young college age girl) and she probably worked for around 3 hours total.  I would grade her cleaning at a 5 out of 10 - found several areas not clean after she left.\n\nThen, my credit card was charged 5 separate times for $150 within an 8-day period!!!
