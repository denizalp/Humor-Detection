Apparently Montreal has some sort of a misty-eyed exoticism about Texas. Being from Texas, I decided to see what America's beret did with beer house cuisine. Tacos, burritos, and sides are available and people kept raving about how \"Texas sized\" the portions were. (They were more of a Texas snack.) I recommend the popcorn shrimp. It was so good that I wanted to cry, which I did when I saw the $100 bill.
