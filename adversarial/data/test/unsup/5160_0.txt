Today was my first time coming to Massage Envy for a full body massage, I loved EVERY min of it ! My massage therapist was Franky and he was very professional. I enjoy firm massages to get tension and stress relief. He was gentle and firm at the same time and would check on me here and there to make sure I was still comfortable. I definitely recommend Massage Envy if your looking for a relaxing time. Ask for Franky !
