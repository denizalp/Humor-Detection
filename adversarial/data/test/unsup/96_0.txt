WARNING! THE MENU IS EXTREMELY LONG.\n...but I decided.\nThe Rueban was amazing. Wish the pastrami was warmed up a bit more. They really should take gourmet out of the slogan. But overall experience was good. Cashier dude did \"hookmeup\" with a large drink- WINK WINK- BUT hooking people up is not good for business. Speaking of business, I don't think this place is doing so well. Sad to hear when my sandwich was so good. I will be back to support a local business and of course for an amazing sandwich.\n\nTill then HOOK-US-UP with lower prices!
