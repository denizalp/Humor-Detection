Each time I walk out of the Forever XXI at Dundas and Yonge with a new bag of clothes, I always brace myself for... Bbbelieeeeeeeve in the Lord!! Nope, didn't mentally prepare enough - still startled. The Jesus Guy is definitely a Toronto staple. He's there rain or shine watching you and waiting for that perfect moment to pounce and make you go \"OH MY GOD!!!\" Yes, mission accomplished. Now you bbbelieeeeeeeve in the Lord, right?
