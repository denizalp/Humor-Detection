Olives is always a mainstay when I go to Vegas! The dishes are consistently fabulous, the staff is so friendly, fun and accommodating! The salmon salad cant be missed, love their flat bread and desserts are bomb! Check out my pictures.  We sit at the bar most of the time for quick service but the outdoor veranda overlooking the Bellagio Fountains cannot be missed!  Take that special someone and make some memories!!
