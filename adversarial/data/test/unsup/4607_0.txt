This farmer's market actually has farmers selling their goods! Unlike some other of the bigger markets in town - the ones I refer to as \"outdoor grocery stores\" - Atherton hosts a nice variety of local growers and merchants. Today I saw everything from red okra (!! way cool), goat and cow milk cheeses, to our local honey company Cloister Honey. The environment is great - there was live music today (provided by little old moi.)
