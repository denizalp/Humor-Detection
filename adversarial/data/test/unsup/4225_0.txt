I liked the store, but it got a little strange at times.  There was a mannequin laying on a couch with a phone to his ear and a stroller full of bald 70's baby dolls.  They did have some pretty cool jackets, especially the work outfits from back in the day.  The jewelry selection was a little tacky and limited, but I felt a warm vibe in the place overall.  It felt like I was having tea in a strange, eclectic person's home.  More women clothing than men.
