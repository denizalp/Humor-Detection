I love tory burch!! My first paycheck post grad I bought myself a pair of Revas at the tory burch in sf. I went in yesterday and bought my first tory bag and got it with my $50 off birthday coupon and was offered water and diet coke. I love the whole shopping will be back her post first nursing paycheck and do some damage maybe buy a simon cardigan i've been eyeing!
