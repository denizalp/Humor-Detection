Went to Johnny's Diner last week with daughter & wife for breakfast.\nThe place is very deceiving from the outside as it looks like it would fit about 10 people.\nIt is actually pretty big on the inside.\nThe waitress gave great service and was very fast and friendly.\nThe prices where very good.\nI had the Johnnys special which was 2 pancakes 2 eggs, bacon & home fries and toast all for $8.\nFood was good and I would go back again.\nIf you have not been to Johnny's Diner it is worth a trip.
