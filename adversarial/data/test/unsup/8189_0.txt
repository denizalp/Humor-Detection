If you are near this place, You're too far east for any better food or service. Most of the crowd here, especially during the winter, is snowbird seniors. Sturdy coffee and solid home-cooked meals all day long. Service is really slow (example one server for the entire place at breakfast), so bring a good friend to talk with, at length.
