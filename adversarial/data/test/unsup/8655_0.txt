Having recently furnished a new home, I love and hate this place at the same time...I hate it because I didn't discover it sooner!  \n\nI saw a couch there that was exactly like the one we just purchased but it was $400.  I wanted to cry.  Everything was so nice too...they don't accept anything that isn't.\n\nWe now need a number of rugs so I can tell you where I am heading.  I'm not making the same mistake twice!
