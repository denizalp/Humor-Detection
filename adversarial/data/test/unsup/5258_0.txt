Have to say out of all the circle k's I've stopped at, this is the one I've received the best service at. I've been here several times at night and all three attendants I've come across have been very helpful and accommodating!! They've been very helpful with directions an with tips on place to go in Phoenix. Prices inside are comparable to other gas stations but the service has been very consistent! This is my main gas station. The only bad thing about this spot is that I haven't won the lottery here yet... Lol!
