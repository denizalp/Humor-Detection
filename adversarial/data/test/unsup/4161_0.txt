Been here a few times over the last couple of months and always good food. The salsa is one of my favorites with hot fresh chips. \n\nWe normally eat at the bar and this one is never crowded.  Came in to watch the last quarter of Vikings Saints game knowing we could watch the game.  \n\nWe will be back next time I'll take Pics and detailed review. \n\nRecommend Matta's because we live in Scottsdale and really not much in the way of decent Mexican food.
