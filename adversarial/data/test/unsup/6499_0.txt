Big Bs was good all the way around. From the sweet tea (not too sweet) to the tri tip, we enjoyed it all. They serve big portions too. We had to get a to go container. My favorite things were the chicken, tri tip, fried okra and BBQ beans. They also sell Shiner Bock. My Texas heart was thrilled with this BBQ place!
