Fantastic place with great food, strong drinks and superb staff. The mimosas on Sundays are unbeatable. The food is plentiful and delicious. On weekends, there is easy parking. It should be your go-to place for now on. \nI did warn them that I was allergic to gluten and they made accommodations. Burgers were LEGIT (none of that dainty pathetic patty) and the Brussels sprouts are a must-have. I heard the Panthers waffles are good but next up, I'm getting the buffalo chicken egg Benedict.
