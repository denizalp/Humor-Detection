You know, I'm super glad that Jimmy John's are franchises. It's the only way my conscience can handle coming here. That's all I will say about that.\n\nThis JJ's crew is top notch. As usual, the restaurant is clean, organized, and well staffed.\n\nThe food is fresh and amazing as always. It is really hard to not pig out when I am here.
