An absolute waste of time, energy, gas, money and please do not be attempting to leave with money from selling your \"item\". Low ball you, you will not be seeing the pawn \"stars\", but you will meet their snobby, rude and clearly do not know much about the products ppl bring in. So in closing I'd rather pick my nose while sitting on a toilet in the middle of container park \/downtown Las Vegas. Before I come here.
