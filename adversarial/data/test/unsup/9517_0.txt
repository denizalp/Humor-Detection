Oh my goodness. Bacon. Lots and lots of bacon. I can't even think enough to type this review because of my bacon coma. \n\nThe best shrimp and grits I've had. The shrimp were HUGE and wrapped in shrimp. Hubby had a smoked brisket sandwich which was indescribable. It was smoked very subtly in an aged whiskey barrel. The brisket melted in your mouth. \n\nWe will definitely be adding this place to our list of regular joints!
