We came here after a motorcycle ride to mountain Charleston and the service was amazing. We got the garlic fries for an appetizer and they were so good! The pizza itself, not so good. It's called streets of New York but the pizza was nothing like New York pizza. Growing up in Manhattan you learn what pizza is. It was good but not what I expected. If you're going to say you're like New York pizza, make it like New York's pizza.
