I went here with a coworker about a week ago when we wanted a nice lunch. I got the wildflower two with the roast beef sandwich and the potato cream cheese soup. I also got their iced tea which was very tasty, and a loaf of lavain bread to go with my dinner that night.\n\nBoth were AMAZING. Nice pleasant service, clean, busy restaurant. Plenty of seating (even though we took it back to the office). Overall a pleasant experience. I'm sure I'll go back when I don't mind dropping $10-15 on lunch.
