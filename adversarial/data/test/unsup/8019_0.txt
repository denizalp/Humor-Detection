Wow! My fianc√© and I ordered Flo's Filet while my daughter had the kids sirloin--both were fantastic! Excellent wines as well. The Key Lime Pie was the best I've ever had! But the real reason for the five stars was because of our superb waitress named Antionette. She was the finest server I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. She was extremely charming and sweet. Longhorn Steakhouse should be extremely proud to have her!
