We made a reservation for my wife's Birthday dinner.  When we arrived they didn't have our table and said it was a 20 min wait.   We understand that mistakes happen but they didn't apologize nor didn't seem to care.  Because they were so rude we left and went to another sushi place down the street.  Glad we left.
