This is one if those places where you either love it or hate it; we loved it. We visited on a Sunday morning & were seated and served pretty quickly. There were five of us and we all had sandwiches. Recommend you get corned beef & not pastrami, as wife thought it was too bland. \nNo real kids menu, So my son, who's give had soup and some pickles. \nThere is small parking lot behind the restaurant & it's free.
