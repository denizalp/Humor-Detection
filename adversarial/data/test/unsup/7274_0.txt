Pretty decent airport and much bigger than it was when I was growing up. We flew into the newer terminal and had to take a tram to get our bags and we flew out of the older terminal but it could use a little (or a lot) of updating. \n\nAs far as airports go, this is probably one of the easiest to get in and out of. Must be due to the 43 Million passengers that come through every year!
