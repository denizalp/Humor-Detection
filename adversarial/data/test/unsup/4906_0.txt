Good location, bad service. \n\nIt was not a busy Thursday night, but our waitress was literally 20+ minutes in between stops. \n\nThe nachos were not really nachos. More of a salad mixed with some tortilla chips, that happen to be burnt. \n\nChristina ordered a lavosh thingy and it came out cold. \n\nThe food was way overpriced. I only had one drink. It was stiff, so that is good. \n\nThis place was just really meh.
