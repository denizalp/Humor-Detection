\"I love driving 6 hours to bring my two kids to the Golden Nugget JUST so that they can swim by the fish tank and try out the water slide with the shark tank ONLY to find out when checking in to the hotel that it is CLOSED FOR CONSTRUCTION,\" said NO mom EVER!!!! I'm beyond disappointed to have to break this news to my kids. Thanks Golden Nugget for making kids cry on their Spring Break.
