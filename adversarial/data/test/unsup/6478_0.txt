I've been a patient of Dr. McCracken's since 1996\/97. Great guy. Thorough. Patient. Sincere.  And he has a heart of gold.  His practice has grown considerably however his methods, bedside manner and personality are qualities you'll see in all of his employees.  I cannot toss Dr. McCracken's practice enough accolades.  If you have a dermatological issue, stop scratchin' and  head thee to Dr. McCracken.
