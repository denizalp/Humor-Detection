Took my 4 yr old for brunch yesterday, food was good, price was decent service was very good, but the man in the back screaming and yelling profanities actually scared my son to the point where he struggled to eat. If you take your kids ask to not sit by the kitchen. Food and service 4 stars, but had to give a 1 for obvious reasons.
