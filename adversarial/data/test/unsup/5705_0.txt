This used to be one of the best practices around... many years ago they re-organized and moved adding and removing doctors.  That was the beginning of the end of Excellent service.\n\nMy daughter developed sepsis and instead of the doctor seeing her, he kept calling in more and more antibiotics which put her immune system through the wringer and most likely caused the heart issue and stomach issues that she now has for life!\n\nI used to refer someone there every month :(
