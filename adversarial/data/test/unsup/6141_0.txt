These guys ROCK...I shopped for  Honda Rancher Quad...Checking each dealer in the East Valley. I have purchased several Honda dirt bikes, had service performed and even ordered parts from Western and they are always pleasant to deal with, competitive in their pricing and incredibly helpful. Randy is a great guy, he made the experience easy and was very thorough in explaining all options from financing to warranty options.\nDon't bother shopping around, you can...but you will get the best buying experience at Western Honda...
