We used Platinum Rides for our wedding and was thrilled with the experience! We used their party bus for our transportation to our reception site and then a private car service for our ride after the reception. Both drivers were great! Our party bus driver was so helpful and accommodating! Our late night driver was so nice too!! We couldn't be happier with our choice and we highly recommend this company!
