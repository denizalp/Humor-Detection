I have never seen an apartment staff handle issues with tenants more poorly. Do not live here. The place looks nice but a lot of things like towel racks are rickety and many of the pluses end up being a pain in the ass ie. the dish washer and washing machine are pieces of crap. They also charge you like $18 to pay rent online. I'm currently living with 7 people and an infant in a 4 bedroom apartment. I have complained twice and nothing has changed!
