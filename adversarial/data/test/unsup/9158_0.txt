This is the worst bar i have ever patronized. Girls... unless you want to place yourself in a sketchy situation don't come here.\nThey only take cash. ATM was broken this wasnt told to us until after we ordered and my friend had to leave and to to the Wells Fargo. It's dirty. They should offer seat protectors for the bar stools. This is one of those bars you see on movies and tv right before someone commits suicide.
