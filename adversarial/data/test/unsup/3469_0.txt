On the next episode of \"Vegetarian things with no nutritional value\" I give you the Vegetarian Poutine at Smoke's Poutinerie.  Though it was visually clear that not even a week's allotment of calories would cover the fat content in this concoction, the sound of \"guacamole, sriracha and cheddar cheese\" in the same sentence just screams \"Canada\" and for a moment, I was proud to be a part of it. \n\nAnd no lie - the ingredients listed above, over a bed of french fries, is truly an unforgettable experience.
