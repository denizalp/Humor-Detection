I'm not a fan of the German beer or festival but the ambiance and the music was pretty cool.  I could not remember the name let alone say what I ordered but it was basically a thin piece of pork lightly battered with a side of cranberry sauce.  It was pretty damn good and the portion size was huge. I didn't order a beer and was called a girly man by the pretty german waitress. HAHAHA funnay.   This place looks fun once your drunk and in the moment.  the ziggy ziggy oi oi oi was fun.
