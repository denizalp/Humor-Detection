I LOVE z gallerie. \n\n1. they're inexpensive\n2. great customer service\n3. unique pieces\n4. amazing sales\n5. great online shopping\n6. sweet quality\n\nI can't get enough of z gallerie. I only enter when I have spending money, otherwise I would go broke or eat peanut butter and beans until the next pay check.
