Saturday morning 7:10a.  Just dropped my car off across the street for an oil change and used Yelp to locate Nosh.  \n\nWalked right in, went up to the counter to order a build your own Frittata and coffee.\n\nThe gal at the counter was very nice and full of energy.\n\nThe wait time for my food was acceptable.\n\nMy Frittata was good\/delish too.  It was delivered hot, tasty and fluffy.  Served with hash browns that were good but average.\n\nI would return.
