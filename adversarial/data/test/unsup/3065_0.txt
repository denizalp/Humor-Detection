I ate here once and was hooked. While they don't make the food as spicy as I'd prefer, even after you ask them to make it spicy and a \"10\", the Thom-Kha-Gai is great.\n\nThe best part about this place is that they deliver, and even being up in Summerlin I could count on to bring me my yummy goodies and make my tummy warm and content.
