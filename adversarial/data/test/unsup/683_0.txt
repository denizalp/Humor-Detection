I used to love this place!\n\nThen they starting SUCKING:\n1) Went there on a Friday night with a bunch of out-of-towners and it turned out they had no ice for drinks.  We were not told this, just given drinks with no ice at 6pm outside in 110 degree temps.  No apologies.  Have you ever had a HOT (not even warm at that point) Malibu Pineapple?  Don't.\n2) Got food poisoning here.  Granted, I ended up losing a few pounds from the whole ordeal, but overall, I probably would have passed on the experience, given the chance.\n\nBad. No. Don't.
