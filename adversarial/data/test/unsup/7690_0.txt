I love Central Coffee. Great spot to get some work done with a delicious cup of coffee. If the study munchies get to you, they have a nice spread of pastries and other snacks to get you going. Bagels, biscotti, zucchini bread, muffins, quiches, other pastries... Their drink menu has a ton of different coffee and tea selections. Hot or cold. And they recently came out with a cold brew, which I'm totally digging. The baristas are friendly, and pretty cool, which I can tell because of their music..\n\nYay Central Coffee! See you soon..
