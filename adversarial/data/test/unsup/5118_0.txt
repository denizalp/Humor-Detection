Its Pho - so you know its yummy!!  Which is the only thing this place has going for it.\n\nStaff.  I actually think they are fem-bots.  They dont speak.  They just kinda grunt.  ZERO customer engagement!!\n\nCaution:  watch your veggies!!  Often they are slimy & wilted.   The meat portions are minuscule.  \n\nBottom line:  if the sun & moon all align & the veggies are healthy and a few extra slivers of meat fall into your bowl your meal will be tasty!
