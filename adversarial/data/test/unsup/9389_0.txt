Impulse tattoo at 7pm, all the other tattoo shops were booked . did a yelp inquiry and the owner of the shop said come through. Clay was available to help and end story, was very pleased with his work. got a rose tatt from golden rule last year and the line work was not the best..which is now really obvious compared to Clay's work. His lines were thin and achieved the dainty tattoo look. Will return so he can blend in the old tattoo with this new one. Thanks Clay !
