Had an early dinner, was intrigued by the window signage that it was just salad, well it was very good salad you have two choices you can either design your own salad with any number of options, or you can choose from the menu options. The portion of the salad was very large it is for sure a \"big salad\" ( Seinfeld anyone?) The price for a salad as a main was very reasonable. An enjoyable meal for sure :)
