Whenever I find a good Asian restaurant in Arizona, I get really excited and must share!\n\nThis place is a fun, hip, hole in the wall that is an excellent addition to the entire plaza with the Korean market and a few other asian restaurants. \n\nI got the peach iced tea with boba and loved it. The boba was great!! \n\nNext time, I'll be sure to save room for the grand shaved ice.
