We have all four, the brisket, pulled pork, pork rid and beef rib. Pulled pork and brisket are the best, but unfortunately they come at the smallest serving size. The beef rib is huge but not as good as them(maybe because it's not fatty so the taste is a bit dry) although it's still delicious. The bill is 44$ plus tax and tip. I think the food worth it.
