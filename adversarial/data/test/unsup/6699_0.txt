Great food and a nice tap beer selection. Everything we had to eat was delicious! The yucca fries were so good, as was the chicken peanut stew with injera. It all paired well with a Karben4 Lady Luck. They were out of a few menu items and seemed a little under staffed, but we still received very good service and were not disappointed with the food that was available. Excited to see this place grow!
