Returned again a week ago for dinner, and finally tried that milkshake. It was delicious but TINY.  Like in the glass you get orange juice at a brunch place. Somewhat disappointing.\n\nI wasn't in a burger mood this time so went for one of the salads which was actually really filling, and good. \n\nOn the more unfortunate side, my boyfriend's burger was mediocre, then actually made him sick by the time we got home. \n\nI'm not sure I'll be back for burgers here, honestly. Milkshakes, salads, drinks- all great though.
