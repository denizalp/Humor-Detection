I used to come here for happy hr . They had a lot to choose from and a GREAT bartender . Went recently and was disappointed . Food menu is tiny and no vegetarian options. Drink selection also small if you're not a bourbon\/whiskey\/rye drinker your out of luck . I know they want to be known for their bourbon selection but it's not right for everyone.  I hope they revisit their new menu and maybe add well drinks to the cocktail portion .   I would love to come back but it's sadly not likely .
