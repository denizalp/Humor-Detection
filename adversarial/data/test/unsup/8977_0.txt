Believe in the lord guy isn't what he used to be. Less outbursts, slightly lower volume, less startling. Although his message has been consistent over the years, it feels a bit 'softer'. Maybe he's getting old... Maybe he needs to add a shot of espresso to his morning coffee. Still a staple in the city. Still don't believe in the lord though.
