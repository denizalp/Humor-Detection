Located at Wynn, this is one of the best spots on the strip!  \n\nOur server, Adam was wickedly funny, helpful and super professional!  He made our dinner more fun and enjoyable!\n\nWe ordered...\nCalamari - comes with veggies that are fried in the shape of French fries.  Comes with a yummy marinara sauce that has a good kick (spicy) to it!  We loved it!\nBosco Pizza - ricotta cheese with wild mushrooms and truffles.  Deliciousness!!!!\n\nEverything was perfect!  The decor is earth tones and calm lighting.  Service and food were incredible!\n\nLooking forward to next time!
