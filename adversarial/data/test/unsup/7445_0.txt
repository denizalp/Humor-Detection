I had a horrible experience with Michelle Lee. I live approximately 50 minutes away from her location and she booked an appointment with me at 10 am and when I arrived at her home she was not there. When i called her she didn't answer but then texted me to tell me that she had a photo shoot \"come up\" and wouldn't be able to do my tan until 3:00 pm. I drove 50 minutes each way for nothing, and when I told her this was unacceptable she got extremely rude with me. Stay away from this woman!!!
