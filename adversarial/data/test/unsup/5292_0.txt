What exactly defines a sketchy gas station? Well, just stop in at this Circle K and you will get a chance to experience one. \n\nDimly lit on a dark night, check. \n\nOnly having the most expensive gas available, check. \n\nNot asking for any information at all for credit card approval, check. \n\nBums asking you for money in the parking lot, check. \n\nNo receipt unless you see the cashier, check. \n\nWouldn't go here if I wasn't in a hurry to get back to the airport.
