I went to lunch here on Sunday with a pretty large party. It's hard to eat with a large group because you can't please everyone... but this place was a hit with us all! Some of us ordered breakfast, and others ordered lunch. Portions were perfect, the food was spectacular! Personally, I ordered a turkey sandwich on gluten free bread with sweet potato fries. The bread was amazing and so were the fries. It tasted very fresh and healthy. I can't wait to try the other locations.
