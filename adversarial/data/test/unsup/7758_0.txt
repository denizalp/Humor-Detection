Crack.\n\nI think that is the secret ingredient in their strawberry milkshakes.\n\nTo tell the truth, I don't eat fast food much.  But for some reason, these milkshakes make me feel like a junkie.  I'm like \"Milkshake, milkshake, must have, now!\" and so I rush to get one (large, always).  As soon as I start drinking it, I know that the taste is really unnatural but I KEEP DRINKING ANYWAYS. \n\nAnd then the cycle repeats. Seriously, what are in these things!?
