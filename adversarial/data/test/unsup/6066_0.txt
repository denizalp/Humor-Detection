This place had such a cute atmosphere and the owners were so friendly. I had the spinach\/goat cheese quiche which was delicious, although it wasn't as hot as I would've liked it to be. I also had the creme brûlée latte which was amazing. Their almond croissant was very flaky and moist, and their walnut tarte was to die for. They both had the perfect amount of sweetness. They are a bit understaffed so the service was a bit slow, but nonetheless, I'll be back!
