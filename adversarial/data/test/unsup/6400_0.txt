I really love the food here. The chicken and hummus appetizer is my favorite. \n\nThe service really sucks. I've limited myself to take out, just so i dont have to deal with it. I hate saying this because I have a friend who waitresses here, but its the truth!\n\nBut like I said, great food, so if your hungry for some food to take out, then this is your place :)
