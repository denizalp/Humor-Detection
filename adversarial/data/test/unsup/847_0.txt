This was my second visit to Black Mountain Dental and the entire team there is very professional and accommodating. They make you feel like family when you walk in. I love open and inviting the waiting room is. The patient rooms are open but very private and I love it! I will definitely be recommending this office to those that I meet and very thankful that I found them on Yelp!
