John came by to clean our carpets and travertine. For the price it was competitive against other quotes we pulled. \n\nOur carpets and floors were cleaned by the previous home owners before we moved in. I mainly wanted to have John clean extra w\/ pet odor removal because there was a cat previously. \n\nIt's been several days, and the cat allergens are still heavy in the house as well as the odor. \n\nOverall, it was a 'better' price than most, but i don't think I can say so the same for the service.
