Had bacon and egg breakfast before a crack of dawn 6:00 AM flight as this was the only breakfast place (other than fast food) that seemed to be open.  Breakfast was so- so.  Bacon didn't taste as fresh and came with your usual potatoes.  We sat at the bar and service was quick and attentive.  Would I come back here?  I would try other options as it wasn't anything memorable!
