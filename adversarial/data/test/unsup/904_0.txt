I give 5 stars sparingly and Deluca's is completely deserving. We waited outside in the sweltering heat, during prime brunch time, for almost 30 minutes but knew it was worth the wait. There is nothing fancy or classy about this place which is actually quite endearing. The menu? Basically anything you can imagine for brunch. Really happy we got to visit this Pittsburgh staple after almost a year of living here. Portions are insanely big but we love leftovers so it wasn't an issue.
