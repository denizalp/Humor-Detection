If you are looking for good coffee, tea, or treat, Orbis has it.  Coffee is excellent and the staff is great.  Have met some friends that tend to hang here and have never been disappointed.  Have had a few treats, bagel my last visit was good.  Have not tried but others have had some egg wraps that they said were good.
