This place got some serious crepes. Banana split crepes, Japanese special crepes, and mango tango crepes?  Oh my goodness, take my money please!  I want it alllllllllllll!!!!!  \n\nThey make it fresh on the spot.  The place is quite small, only got a few tables. The best is to take it and go. Whoever lives around this place, you are so lucky!\n\nWith every review, I always ask will I come back?  The answer is yes for sure!\n\nFood:  5\/5\nAmbience: 4\/5\nService:  5\/5\nCleanliness:  5\/5
