This was absolutely fantastic! Not only were the dancers extremely talented, they were nice, respectful, and funny. They were having just as much as the audience. I was blown away with the level of dance skills, break dancing and tumbling. I have only been to one other male strip show (thunder down under) and Aussie Hunks blows them out of the water. It was an intimate atmosphere and the dancers were \nvery interactive. I will definitely be going back every time I am on Vegas! ;)
