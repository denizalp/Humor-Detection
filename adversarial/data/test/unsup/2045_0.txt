I really am only giving this place 3 stars because it's super small, the pool fits about 10 people comfortably & the parking sucks, BUT the vibe and atmosphere is super hip and very vintage looking. Makes you wanna stay there & grabs your interest. Rooftop is cool...they have yoga classes up there on Sundays. Just took a class, this past Sunday and was an amazing view.
