Should be called \"boo,\" and not, \"blue.\"  Came here Friday night and there were about twenty open tables. Told there'd be a fifteen minute wait. We asked why and we're told that if we were ordering food we could have a table. We said we were going to have appetizers and drinks. The hostess then informed us that since we weren't ordering dinner we were not entitled to a table!!  What!?! Drinks and appetizers don't get you a table when there are twenty free and available!?!?  Why this place would turn away paying customers is beyond me. Never returning.
