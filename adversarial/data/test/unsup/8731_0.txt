I walked in for a pedicure last week and had a wonderful experience. Everything was really clean and the staff were very polite and gentle. They also give you wireless headphones so you can watch a movie (they were playing Bride Wars). They serve coffee, and tea and water for a cost as well. The price was $40 for the pedicure.
