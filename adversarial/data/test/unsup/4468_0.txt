There were kids running around screaming the whole time.  We were so upset by it we left.  If the parents can't be bothered to watch them the restaurant should say something. If the policy here is kids running around the buffet screaming is the norm, then I'll pass. I basically spent $20 for one plate of beans and Lo mein. I don't even know if they have desert as I never made it that far. First and last time I'll visit.
