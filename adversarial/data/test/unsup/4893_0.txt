I may have to give it another chance, but $12 For a Caesar Salad is ridiculous!\nAnd $23 for so-so eggplant parmesan and bland side of pasta is crazy. \nIt was not worth the $100 check. \nThe meatballs are frozen,  reheated and not good. \nNice atmosphere and the place was packed so I somehow missed what it's all about. \nOur service was great, so no complaints there. \nStay tuned for an update and hopefully more stars.
