For $31, this was a fabulous little morning excursion for my family of four...\n\nMy kids loved the dinosaurs and puzzles but at 2 and 4, they were a little too young for some of the exhibits and for panning for gold...\n\nMy husband and I were impressed with the diversity of what this museum offers, from native arts and crafts, an old mine, jail, dinosaurs, and so much more.  We had a short window to visit and spent less than two hours, so we'll definitely return when the kids are a bit older and have a longer attention span!
