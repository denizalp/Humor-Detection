It's a nice upscale burger joint \/ bar.  second floor inside the Cosmopolitan. We ordered fried pickles, French fries, calamari, chicken dip, teriyaki n vegan burger. But they charged $11 for our bday cake and didn't even sing with us. \n\nDefinitely paying the price for ambiance not for satisfying taste buds. Our bill came out to $80 per person...bit pricey for burgers, no?
