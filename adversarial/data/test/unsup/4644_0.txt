We ordered delivery, and just everything was so overrated. I advise everyone who orders through GrubHub to look at the yelp reviews before ordering. The mongolian beef tasted like old rubber, and the general's chicken tasted so old! I can't believe I even gave this place a shot. And their driver?! Came in freaking short shorts, a white tee, and flip flops? Seriously? Take your money somewhere else!!
