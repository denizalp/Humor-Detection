This my jam.\n\nThis is one of my favorite spots in my area. \n\nThe juices are awesome and creative. They taste great. They aren't cheap (7 bucks or so), but at least you get fresh ingredients. That's what counts right?\n\nFood is quite good too. The Bison cheesesteak is delicious. So are all of the flatbreads.\n\nMost Vegas locals know about this spot, but if you are unfamiliar, give it a shot!
