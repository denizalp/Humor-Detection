You know you're in a ghetto grocery store when they have trap doors that keep you from taking the grocery cart out of the store or leaving out of the store or...honestly I was very confused by the extra set of trap doors they had as you walk in. \n\nNeedless to say, I came here for the U.S. Post office.  I had a heavy 50lb package that I was sending and thankfully I found a cart in the parking lot that helped me take it in.  Employees were helpful.
