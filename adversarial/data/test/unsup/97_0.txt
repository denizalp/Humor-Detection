i work out here but wouldn't recommend the trainers. i have had 5 in less than 3 months and have gone a month without being contacted after asking to be put back on my training schedule.  i payed for a year membership and a few months of training so far. not worth the 1000 i have forked out. i am almost to the point of cancelling
