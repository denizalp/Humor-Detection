I think this is a very friendly and welcoming neighborhood bar.  There are pool tables, tv's everywhere, nfl ticket, and great food.  It has a comfortable feel inside whether it's busy or quiet.  Definitely my kind of hangout.  The only reason I gave it only four stars is because it's too far from where I live.  Otherwise it would be a FIVE!
