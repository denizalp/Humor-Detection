By far Barbie has been one of the best groomers for my Scotties!  When we moved back to the NEO area from Rhode Island, I was nervous about finding a great groomer. We found Barbie and followed her wherever she went. We are so thankful she has her own business now!  She treats my boys just like they were her own!  She even keeps cheese treats for them!  They look regal and handsome.
