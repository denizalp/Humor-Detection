Cool tram that has great views going up or down of the Pittsburgh skyline. Not a far walk or drive from Station Square. The cost is $5 round trip and there a few restaurants located near the top. \nGreat view of Pittsburgh's skyline at night if the weather is clear. Definitely worth the trip and ride.
