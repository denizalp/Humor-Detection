I'll go back after a couple months when they have their stuff together. I was upset at the beginning because of service but then they told me they've only been open for a week so...you get a bye. Food was pretty good but they really can't go wrong in this neighborhood. These poor people are sandwiched between the Gardiner and the railroad tracks with nothing other than this and Fox & Fiddle. They'll do fine...but I wouldn't cross the tracks for it...yet.  \n\nOh...the wine by the glass list is amazingly horrible.
