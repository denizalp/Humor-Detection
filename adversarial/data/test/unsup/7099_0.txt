6\/18\/15 \nAfter having several no shows with other companies I was assured that this \"company has 4,000 customers and they would never do such a thing\"...\n\nThis company was suppose to be at my house between 6am and noon today.\nI have called and left three voicemails, emailed them...zero response.\n\nThe worse part about it? They have already charged me $85 so now I have to call fraud on their charge! They actually charged on 6\/16\/15 two days BEFORE the service was even suppose to be done! \n\nCalling fraud department on my card.
