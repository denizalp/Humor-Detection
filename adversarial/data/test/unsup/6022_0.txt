An upscale dining spot with lots of options.\n\nA large menu of make-your-own pizzas sits right next to a wonderful selection of seafood and steaks.  Dishes are meticulously prepared and presented, each with unique flavors.\n\nA favorite way for my wife and I to dine here is by sitting at the bar for happy hour.  Their drink specials and small plates \/ bites at the bar are hard to pass up, and can easily satisfy and entire meal's worth of food options.
