Came for lunch. \n\nThe place looks like your typical hipster bar that also serves food. \n\nTypically, the menu includes a lot of comfort food and pretty much anything that goes well with alcoholic beverages. The food was good but not amazing. But for the cheap price, I'd definitely come back. Also, the staff are super friendly!
