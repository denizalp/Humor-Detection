I have been here a few times for issues related to my phone and account. They have always taken good care of me. Sometimes it is crowded in the store and I have to wait a bit. The products are reasonably priced and the staff is friendly and helpful. This store is in my neighborhood so I will be back when I have a phone related issue.
