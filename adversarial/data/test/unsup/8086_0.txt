I've been coming to this specific location for the past 3 years. I was really disappointed this last time. They got rid of so many figures including the presidents room, famous history figures such as MLK etc. \n\nThey have kept the same ones that they've had for years though and the new ones are all here within the yelp pictures or on their website. \n\nTickets are $30 each and we were out within 40 minutes. I'd rather pay for a massage or something for that price!!
