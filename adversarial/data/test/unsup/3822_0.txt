Located inside the food court of the Red Rocks Casino.\n\nCapriotti's is a restaurant chain.\n\nWe had the italian sausage topped with marinara, cheese, grilled sweet peppers and mushrooms. The medium size comes on a very long piece of bread and thus makes a very long sandwich. Perfect for splitting.
