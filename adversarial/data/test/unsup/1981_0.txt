Love their chicken bacon avocado sandwich- full of flavor and not overly greasy. You can order it grilled, and it's not rubbery or artificial tasting. Sweet potato fries are on point too- would like to try the smashed fries next time around with rosemary seasoning $2.29. They do charge like $1.50 extra to add avocado and bacon and other extras to sandwiches. Very quick service- was there less than 10 minutes.
