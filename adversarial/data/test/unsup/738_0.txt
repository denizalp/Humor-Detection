Sadly disappointing. We were seated on time, and have been waiting 15 minutes for our server to take our drink order. Still waiting right now. \n\nWe've watched the server deliver at least two tables before taking our fm drink order.\n\n\n\n5 minutes later. The server just came by, took our drink order and I said we're ready to order food..... So she walks away and says she'll be back without taking our order. I'll never take clients here again.\n\n28 minutes after seating the server finally comes to take our order. See if she gets it right.
