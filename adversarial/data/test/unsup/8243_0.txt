Words cannot simply express how we feel about their food.\nEverything we have had there so far has been incredible. \nWe are moving soon to Raleigh and lucky for us they are opening a location there. \nI think we would still have traveled to Charlotte for a taste of their delicious food.\nI highly suggest their chipotle bison.
