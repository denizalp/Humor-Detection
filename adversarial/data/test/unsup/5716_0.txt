You know I've been eating Chris's pizza for about ten years now and the pizza I had today was just as great as the first one I had years ago.  However, if the little princess working the counter doesn't give a shit if I am there or not and the best she can do is hand me my pizza and the wrong salad with a \"here you go,\" I can just as easily drive through federal pizza a few blocks north where the people who work there couldn't be any nicer.
