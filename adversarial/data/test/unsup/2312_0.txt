Came in after work around 5pm with no appointment. Got me seated in about 10 minutes and my gel manicure was finished in about 40ish minutes. Johnny was awesome! Super friendly, knowledgable, quick and simple. I liked the environment and the location is nice. Definitely will see myself coming back. They have a VIP program so if you visit 10 times you'll get 10% off I believe. Either way, they're open late and have great service so that's what matters most! \n\nQuick, friendly, and good quality service!
