Waitress was given credit card to open tab.  Upon asking to close tab, bartender said they didn't have the credit card.  The waitress denied ever getting the card yet when I opened the app for my bank, there was a pending transaction from the Firehouse.  The bar \/ manager offered no apology for the issue.  Contacted the police department to report the issue.  They indicated this has happened before. If you are going to go to this place, use cash.  I will not be returning.
