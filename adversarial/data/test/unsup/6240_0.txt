Don't leave Vegas without the great Brazilian BBQ! a great service and atmosphere. The waiters and servers were very helpful and friendly, and the whole ambiance is great for a fine night out.  The food is great and worth the price, especially the special cuts and pork. A surprise favorite were the Brazilian  Bananas.... you just can't find them anywhere else, and me and my family were always going back for more!
