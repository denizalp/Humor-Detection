I have eaten here several times and have always enjoyed the food and the clientele.\n\nBeing married rto a Filipina and having lived in the Philippines for a year; I can say the food is original and tasty.\n\nFor Alex D. - maybe he should just go back to California to eat? You seem more than just a little paranoid thinking everyone is laughing at you.
