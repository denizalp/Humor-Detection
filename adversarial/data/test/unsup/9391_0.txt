700TH REVIEW!!!!!!! I'M ON A ROLL NOW YELPERS\n\n1st time at this location and everything was pretty much the same as other locations. Service decent, food great. I subtracted a star because it seemed to take our food FOREVER to arrive at our table, opposed to other diners. We didn't order anything extraordinary either. This location isn't near the area I'm usually in, but if I'm ever around here again I'll definitely drop in.
