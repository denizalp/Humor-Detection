Interesting I think I got a reply from one of the servers telling me about their delivery not making it that is the reason why they run out of Kare Kare and what not.  Even if you don't have your delivery, you should know what is popular and have enough to last you when your delivery comes.  \n\nAny ways, it still doesn't explain the serving of COLD food.  Really?  Isn't there a health hazard of the temperature of foods.  The health department may need to be called on soon.
