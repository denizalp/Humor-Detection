Sauce has the kind of thin-sliced pizzas you can't stop grubbing (lol). I usually order the chicken sausage pizza with sweet grilled onions. I believe it's eight slices per pie. They also make those amazingly huge chocolate cookies which you will be tempted to grab and run away with since you can see them there staring at you on the counter next to the cashier. The location is great and the employees are friendly. Their service is quick, in less than 15 minutes they have my pizza ready when I do takeout. Their prices are reasonable. Never a disappointment.
