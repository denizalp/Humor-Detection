I started using MK House contractors roughly 10 years ago, and they have done great throughout the years. I can't say that the company is perfect but in the event someone makes a mistake on their side, they do own it and take care of it. However, they are very hard working and reliable. I can definitely count on them to get the job done right. I would recommend them any day. :)
