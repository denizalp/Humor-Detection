Enjoyed dinner starting with the gumbo which was delicious. Next I had the pork loin which is a very large piece and very tender. You could have cut it with a fork. The pork sat on a bed of sweet potatoes with a few greens.  \nThe area is unique with a few stores to shop next to the restaurant.  Service was friendly and attentive. We will definitely come back again
