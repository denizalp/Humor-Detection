I enjoyed my visit. The waitress was very nice and attentive. The food was good, not amazing but solid. My mother enjoyed her short ribs more than I enjoyed my scallop casserole. No complaints, just not phenomenal for the price point. The wine was delicious. The homemade caramel salt ice cream is really good too!\n\nAll in all, a good experience. I enjoyed the ambiance, waitress and food but I think it could be a bit better prepared.
