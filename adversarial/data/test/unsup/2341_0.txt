Tried to see if there is good used fairway wood, went to this \"super\" store first.  Got one sentence of help from the sales who is chatting to another employee.  I left the store immediately and went to AZ golf and that store employee inside helped me for 15 minuets.  I got the exact 3-wood I am looking for.  If I am looking for a new club(s), I will not come to this \"super\" store again.
