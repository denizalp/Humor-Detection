After a long morning of driving around not knowing when my car battery would completely die on me, and going to like 4 different places (including a different Pep Boys) this location and their workers were so so helpful! I was helped as soon as I walked in and they took me serious like an adult whereas everywhere else treated me like a child. Thank you to Jose for getting me in and out in a reasonable time.
