Of course I had to try Mesa Grill, as it is owned by Bobby Flay! I unfortunately did not see him, haha, but the food was delicious!! Do keep in mind the flavors are a mix of savory and sweet, which my fiance did not like. I, on the other hand, love that kind of combination of flavors. \n\nOur server was super sweet and gave great recommendations. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu!
