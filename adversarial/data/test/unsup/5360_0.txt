Did carry out. Girl taking the order kept telling us they did not have what we were ordering and had to give her instructions as to where on menu it was located. My Tavern Chef salad was extremely small and barely any lettuce. Will never order from here again. Extremely disappointed as I was excited to try a new restaurant ever since they moved in.
