When we are at the indoor Las Vegas Premium South Outlet Mall, this Carter's Babies & Kids branch is one of two stores that we will first check out.  Well, if we are in need of a gift for babies, Carter's is our go to store.  Most of the time all items are at least 25%.  Quality clothing.  Well organized and stocked store with professional service.  Bottom line is that it is a good place to buy clothes for babies and young kids.
