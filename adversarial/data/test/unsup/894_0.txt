The food was delicious! The sushi tacos are bite size (I wish I had know because they're too small for the price) but we're amazingly delicious. My boyfriend doesn't like salmon but he tried my salmon tacos and actually liked them! His spicy shrimp and mango burrito was great and the teriyaki salmon sushi roll was also great! My boyfriend also ordered a small bowl of ramen and he really enjoyed that. We loved our visit and hope one day our city opens up something like this place!
