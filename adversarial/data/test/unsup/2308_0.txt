Tried Gen for the first time yesterday and it was amazing . I never had a kbbq experience like this one . The food was great and Luis was grabbing my food. He was very attentive and made sure I always had water cus I hate waiting for a drink while I'm choking . Definitely one of my favorite kbbq places . I'll definitely come back !
