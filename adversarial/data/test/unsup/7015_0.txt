We had such a good time here! We purchased the ticket online which if I'm not mistaken makes it $6 cheaper per person. Posing with the props and acting silly made for a great time and many laughs. They had people from Cameron Diaz, Elvis, Snoop Dogg to blue man group. Stay for the 4D experience. It's 10 mins tops and a cute ending to a fun hour and a half at the museum. Would love to try some of the other locations in the future.
