Pretty cool space for sure.. the pastries were nice as well.. the 3 girls behind the counter seemed like they could have cared less if we were there or not.. whatever. \n\nHad a pecan toffee tart.. eh, have had much better.. this one would be have really good if it didn't taste like the caramel was burnt. I will say though they they do have some of the prettiest pastries Ive seen in the valley.. very clean and creative.
