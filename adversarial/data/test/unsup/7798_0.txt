This buffet is one of my favorites in town and I love that it's not in the business of the strip which means free parking and no traffic! It's a high end buffet with tons of options and a delicious dessert bar. Also they have unlimited wine and champagne, don't forget to tip! Mostly this review is about Pat our server who was incredible and provided us with some of the best customer service even though it was super busy! Girl was on fire making sure everyone was taken care of. Thank you Pat, you are awesome!
