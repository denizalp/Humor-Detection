This attorneys office is very nice looking however that's about as far as the satisfaction will go you will meet with an attorney the same day however from that point forward your case will only be handled by an assistant. The best way to desribe how the team of Heness and Haight is that there office drops the ball and always passes the blame to everyone else. I would go else where to have someone handle your case
