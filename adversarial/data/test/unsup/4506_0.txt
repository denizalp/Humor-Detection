I am not a sushi person, was simply looking for a close spot for some good hibachi style Japanese food.  The food was good but the value was far less than expected.  For $15 a plate I'm accustomed to having food left over.... Not the case here, and I can't say they made up for it in the quality of the food as it seemed comparable to other places I've dined.  I also wasn't happy with the $1.50 for a can soda.....
