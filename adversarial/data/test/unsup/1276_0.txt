So I just moved to Vegas and always got a pretty good haircut from the Sport Clips in Northridge, CA. The haircut I got at this Sport Clips was awful. I went home and fixed it with my own clippers. I also smelled cigarette smoke the whole time I was getting my hair cut as someone was smoking just outside the back door, with the door open. I will not be returning. I could have gotten a better haircut at a beauty school.
