The service here is horrible and always a long wait. The workers are always talking and being obnoxious. They're perception to a customer  is always received as an unfriendly one and they seem put out if they have to re do something. They talk more than they help, and I swear they're always getting orders wrong. I love Popeyes but this location is such a dread to order from but I go to because it's close to me. I wouldn't recommend this location, as the customer service is poor.
