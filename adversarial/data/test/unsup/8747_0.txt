Clark Bar is not for tourists. This is a gritty, neighborhood bar that is is definitely in the dive category. It's ripe for being taken over by hipsters who want to once again ironically sip their PBRs. This regulars would promptly kick their asses, of course. I would describe the regulars a little like Kurt Russell's character from Big Trouble in Little China.
