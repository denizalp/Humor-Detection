Not my favorite ramen place,  but still really good, especially considering there aren't many ramen options on this side of town. Really small dining area, but I've never had to wait for a seat yet.\n\nI like the tonkotsu ramen. They do have my second favorite karaage in town, though (first is Izakaya Go). If you order it to go, make sure you ask for the salt on the side, because they tend to leave it out. Gyoza is good too. They have a stamp card, so make sure you grab one to stamp for each ramen.
