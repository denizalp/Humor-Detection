Salad eaters--listen up. I just devoured this salad for lunch and I have a feeling it's going to be in my regular salad rotation. A large portion of lettuce with shredded rotisserie chicken, generous amount of avocado, and the world's best salad dressing. A simple yet incredibly delicious salad. It comes with fries on the menu, but I recommend ordering plantains instead and tossing a few in! Super yum.
