Not worth the $20 cab ride from the strip. It's located in a seedy section of town and has a line stretching to the neighboring strip joint. The store itself is small and has a very unwelcoming feel to it. I've seen the show before so I was hoping to see some cool memorabilia at the very least. Nope. Just junky jewelry and  their own line of merchandise. Tacky and so not worth it. Save yourself the time and money, don't go.
