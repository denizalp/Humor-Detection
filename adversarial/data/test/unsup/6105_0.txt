We went here with high expectations. A friend of my son claimed it was one of his favorite restaurants. \n\nArrived right before closing and they were kind enough to fry up some chicken for takeout. It was a bit expensive, maybe twice as much as KFC equivalent, but figured it would be worth it. \n\nUnfortunately it was not. The chicken was kind of dry, the batter was interesting but was missing something. A bit over sweet; not enough pepper or other spice. \n\nMaybe their ribs are better, but based on the chicken we will not bother going back.
