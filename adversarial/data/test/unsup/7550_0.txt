We came here for the breakfast buffet and it was OK. Came here for dinner once years ago and it was bad. Figured they can't mess up too much on breakfast, right?\n\nWe had eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, pancakes, and fruit. No stomach ache afterwards and I didn't have to run to the restroom which was a good thing.
