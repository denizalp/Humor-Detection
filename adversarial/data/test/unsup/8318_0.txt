This review is based on my experience between Toronto and Montreal.\n\n$35 each way if you are flexible and willing to book a few weeks in advance! \n\nThe ride itself was quite uneventful but the WIFI was working well as I was able to Yelp a little, uploaded some photos and just listen to the Live streaming of some of my favourite radio stations.\n\nI would suggest just skip the food! Just have a light meal before boarding will be a lot more ideal!\n\n$35 each way?! I want to go and visit Montreal again and again.. :)
