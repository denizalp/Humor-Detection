My favorite Thai place to eat in the Glendale\/Phoenix area so far.  This restaurant may not be located in the better part of town nor does it look like much from the outside, but do not judge a book by its cover.  Inside decorations are nice and service is consistent.  You will be served with cloth napkins, real silverware and white dishes.  I think their food is very tasty with a full assortment of flavors.  Siam Angel Wings, Pad Thai, duck curry, papaya salad and pineapple fried rice are must tries! 4.5-5 stars for their food!
