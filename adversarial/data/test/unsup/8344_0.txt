I was lured here by the good yelp reviews.\n\nHusband and I got the sashimi plate to test its fish quality. Salmon and tuna were good, but not great because the pieces were not thawed properly when served. The other types of fish - yellow tail, mackerel, white fish - were too fishy and chewy. Husband didn't quite like the octopus and squid because of the texture. We didn't finish all the sashimi.\n\nI got an eel roll. It fell apart. It didn't pass my rice test.\n\nGood as a neighborhood sushi place. But not worth the drive from Tempe.
