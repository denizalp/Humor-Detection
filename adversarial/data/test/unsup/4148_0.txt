Great sales going on during our visit.  Sales associate was a bit aggressive sending me into the dressing room with a very unflattering top that I didn't even want.  When I told her it didn't quite fit right she seemed offended and walked away.  The other associates however were helpful, enthusiastic and by far the friendliest I had encountered from any other venue on the strip.  Refreshing expereience that really left my last day on a high note.
