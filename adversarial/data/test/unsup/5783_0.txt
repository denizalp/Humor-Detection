Quaint little pizza place! Hope they increase the ventilation before summer really kicks in.\nWe had the bruschetta appetizer which was very tasty with the roasted garlic EVOO! My son ordered the chicken Parmesan and was very pleased. Wood fired pizza was good, crust was chewy( good), tasty sauce(not very spicy though), toppings were good, but not overly plentiful:(. Service was friendly and prompt.\nWill probably come back if in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip.
