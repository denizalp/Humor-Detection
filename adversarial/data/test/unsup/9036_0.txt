One word bruh, one freaking word. GAAADAAAAMN.\nThis place so good I gave up veganism. Solid 3 day vegan streak down the toilet for the most delicious portion of ribeye steak, baby octopus, and King Ocean roll. My wife is staring at me with disappointment right now but with enough beer ill be able to blur out her face while eating some more sushi. Hidden gem here. Shoutout to everybody in this place.
