This law firm is trying to establish themselves in Las Vegas, but they have a long way to go!!  Eric Finch was the paralegal handling my case, but every time I talked to him he was a complete asshole to me. He has no people skills whatsoever!! And don't get me started on their office!  Let's just say you can't go there at night. Ghetto.
