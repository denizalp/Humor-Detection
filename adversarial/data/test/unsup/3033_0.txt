Soooo, I'm visiting from Cali, and am used to having five scoops of fish\/protein on a large bowl anywhere I go. Here, the large includes only three scoops. The avocado is fresh, but each scoop is one dollar extra! Also, the sauces are limited in choices. Long story short, I ordered a \"large\" bowl, avocado (one scoop), one extra scoop of fish\/protein, and a drink. The total was $17! The quality, cleanliness, and decor, is great, but the prices here are way off. Not coming back
