I really enjoy coming to this buffet. Great stop before heading into Vegas or on your way out since it is about a 20-30 min. drive away from the strip. If you are a California resident they offer $5 off with a valid ID. They have a great selection of food and offer complimentary wine and beer, the food quality is comparable to the buffets in the major hotels on the strip but half the price, I especially enjoy the crab legs and their dessert selection.
