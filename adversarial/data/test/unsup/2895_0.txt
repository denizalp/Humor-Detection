One of the best places to eat!\n\nThe food here is fantastic! The Grilled Chicken and Cheddar Sub is incredibly tasty, and the service is downright positive and fun!\n\nOne of the employees, Dylan, is one of the main powerhouses at this Potbelly's locations. A great attitude all the time, Dylan shows what it truly means to be an excellent employee, and is always on the game!\n\nThe food here is very tasty, the environment is up-beat, and they play live music sometimes!
