Yes. The food is fucking phenomenal. But, let me tell you about Bobby. If waiting for a table is Jabba the Hutt, Bobby is Princess Leia. If prices are the the Reavers, Bobby is Mal. If fancy shmancy is a Dalek, Bobby is the Doctor. \nIn other words... \"It is not our abilities that show what we truly are.  It is our choices.\" -Dumbledore\n(And Bobby exemplifies this like a mother fucker.)\nDisclaimer: I am drunk as I write this, but sober me will stand behind my claims of Bobby, the Server Extraordinaire. If Yubaba is shitty service, Bobby Jahiro. \n#Bobbyisthesecondcoming
