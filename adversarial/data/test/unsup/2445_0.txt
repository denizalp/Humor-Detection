We had a Groupon deal and decided to eat here for lunch.  We split a Margherita pizza and added prosciutto to it per the waitress suggestion.  We also split the meatball appetizer.  The pizza was amazing - the crispy crust was our favorite part!  The meatball appetizer came with three large meatballs and sauce.  They were flavorful & The sauce was made with San Marzano tomatoes & was very good.  I ordered a margarita and it was so good I had another!  Great pizzeria, nice cozy atmosphere and good service.  We would definitely visit again, even without the Groupon!!
