If Legacy Village had but one legacy, it would be a legacy of inadequate parking. Cars circle the parking lot like shark packs on weekends, and it gets competitive out there! Whoa. I'm still upset at the loss of the bookstore, but the center park, Crate&Barrel, Apple Store, Starbucks are saving graces.
