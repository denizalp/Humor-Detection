The all you can eat sushi is pretty amazing considering the quality of the roles and nigiri. The price is reasonable and the taste is among the best. \n\nOnly knock is that it's so good it's attracted and enormous crowd and the servers struggle to keep up during the lunch time rush. Can't blame them, though, the place is always packed to capacity of hungry sushi lovers.
