This is not a scam. I enrolled in the program my sophomore year in high school and I used everything the rep told me about. I had them help me with college essay writing, fafsa, scholarships, and what helped me the most was tutoring. I had a C in chemistry and brought it to a A- when using the tutors everyday. Two of my friends joined the program and we all were accepted to TU with a schloarship !!
