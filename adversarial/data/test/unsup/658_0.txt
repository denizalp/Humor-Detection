We used Amelia C & Co for my cousin's wedding in Vegas, for the whole bridal party. The hair and make up were flawless on everyone (different skin types\/ various requests\/hair types etc) and prices reasonable. They came to the bridal suite and did everything there very efficiently and were very accommodating. I highly recommend them!
