I have passed by this place many times, as I live just around the corner.  Finally we decided to try it out and were really glad we did.  The food is delicious and the service top notch.  I highly recommend it.\nMy perception prior to visiting this place was that it would be a simple sandwich\/taco kind of place (don't ask my why I thought this way). Instead it is a restaurant with a extensive menu and many interesting choices.
