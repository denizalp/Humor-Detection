The bartender acted like she had better places to be. I tried to keep my sunny disposition but it was a challenge. The cocktail waitress was a lot friendlier until we had a mixup about my order. That put me on her bad side quickly, but she eventually warmed  back up--a little.\n\nThe food was salty for some items & dry for others. I will happily spend money for good food. However $100+ for mediocre chicken wings? I can think of much better ways to blow my money.
