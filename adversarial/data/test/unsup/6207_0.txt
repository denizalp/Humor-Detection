I was in here on our last trip to Vegas but it wasn't a great time for sales. This time was different. Hit the right time for the end of season sales. Found some amazing dresses. Tried them all on and found two. They fit like a glove. I have never found anything that fits quite like these dresses. I felt amazing in them as soon as I zipped them up. Both were on sale. I got two for the price of one. And the staff, super friendly and willing to help but not too in your face. Awesome!
