Friday at the Waste(d) Management Phoenix Open...\n\n16th Hole Terrace Skybox\n\n74 degrees and sunny\n\nTasty food provided by M Catering by Michael - especially liked the roast beef sandwiches\n\nBar stations practically every 20 feet*\n\nGreat people watching - you really never know just what you will see at these things!  That could have a lot to do with the bar stations...\n\n* For maximum enjoyment of the event, bring a friend skilled at chatting up the female bartenders - he consistently returned with generously poured beverages... \n\nSee you next year!
