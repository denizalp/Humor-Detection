Slow service every time we go, no ones ever at the front to take payment or to seat people. Placed an order online for takeout, waited 15 min before leaving my house and then ended up having to wait 25 minutes in the store. I asked one of the girls how much longer the wait would be and she told me \"i don't know, i'm not cooking.\" Not worth it.
