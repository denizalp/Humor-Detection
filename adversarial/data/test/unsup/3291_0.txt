If I could give 3.5 stars I would.  I think I thought more of this place before but my recent visit here was just ok.  Service wise they were friendly even with a toddler in tow, but food wise...meh...the calamari appetizer was ok, dipping sauce was tasty.  Pizza and lasagna was ok, it was good but nothing so amazing that I would make a trip to the hotel just to eat it.
