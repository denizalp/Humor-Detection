This location is huge! We stopped in before a concert for some pre-drinks and appetizers. There was a bit of a wait as to be expected but we were seated in a reasonable amount of time. \nService was friendly and beer was cold. Food was delivered to our table hot and we never felt rushed considering the crowds waiting to be seated. \nA solid 3 star A-Ok! \nGood for HH and large groups.
