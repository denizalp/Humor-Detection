New York New York, the city that never sleeps is mimicked in this large casino and hotel. \n\nI only walked the grounds and saw an act here. Maybe the hotels are fine. \n\nAs for the casino it differed from others on the Strip by trapping major landmarks from NYC.  Even the dirt and rude people. \n\nThere are several nice restaurants and coffee shops in the area too.
