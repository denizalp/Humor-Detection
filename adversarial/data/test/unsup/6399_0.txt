Took my two youngest daughters to dinner there tonight. Everyone was super friendly and we were seated immediately. JP our server was especially phenomenal. He was even willing to take a picture with them for Red Nose Day. \nBaby back ribs with Dr. Pepper sauce is awesome!\nHighly recommend this location!
