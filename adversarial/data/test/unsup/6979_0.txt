I stopped in on a Thursday around 2pm and it was so nice and quiet. Great job on my nails. They did not push extra services. ..first time ever at a nail salon in Vegas! That was so nice. The music was great and it was a relaxing experience.  If I didn't live near Aliante, I would be back every 2 weeks!!
