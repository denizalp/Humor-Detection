Otani is a nice Japanese style restaurant. The Sushi is fresh although not terribly too Creative. The Hibachi part of the restaurant is very tiny, and doesn't seem to have as much energy as other Hibachi restaurants do. I had the udon noodles, and I found them to be very Enjoyable. We were sitting by the front door, and every time somebody came into or left the restaurant a cold breeze would blow across us. Overall, this is a solidly average restaurant , worthy of a try but probably not worthy of a second visit.
