Ok, I am of two minds on this place. The Hotel rooms are quite frightening; mine had a leaky ceiling and was quite dark. However the room only cost 27 dollars a night so, you get what you pay for. In the casino the felts on many of the tables are worn and faded. All that being said it is still a fun place to walk around, just make sure you have all your shots.
