This is our normal go to place because of their $5 daily specials or what's email to me. And most of our office has some kind of preference to how their meal is cooked so when you order online you can select what to adjust. Sometimes it does get really packed during lunch but if you order online you can pick up or you can eat there really quick. Sometimes it does get a little bit slow to get your meal if you order and eat there.
