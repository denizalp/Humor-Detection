Lets keep this simple and to the point...\n\nBacon Jam, Chicken skins, and Scallops... I was hella satisfied after those three items! This place is great! The menu is short and sweet, the service was interactive and fun, and the atmosphere is small but great for meeting new people. \n\nGet out and goto Carson Kitchen today!
