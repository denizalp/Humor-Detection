I will always go out of my way to find a Garrett shop!  I had my first taste of Garrett about three years ago when visiting Chicago, and it had been awhile since my last trip so I was excited to find this location in the Miracle Mile Shops.  \n\nI ordered a small bag of the Chicago mix.  It was perfectly warm and fresh.  I wasn't able to eat my whole small bag, so I brought the leftovers to my office a couple days later and my co-workers quickly devoured it.  The popcorn was still crisp and fresh.
