Review based solely on \"service\"\n\nWalked in for a table of 4.  The employee indicated there was a wait and to leave our phone number and he would call when ready (we seemed to be next).  Waited outside for 15 minutes and decided to walk around as we wait.  \n\nIt's been 24 hours now and we are still waiting for that call...should be anytime now.
