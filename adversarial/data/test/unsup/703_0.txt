Good food and service but wanted a nice dinner. in a restaurant where I feel like I'm eating with the people next to me we are so close, I didn't enjoy the atmosphere as we couldn't even hear our own conversation. Pretty to see the fountains but if I'm gonna pay that kind of money, I want the matching ambiance not the feeling of being packed in for monetary ends
