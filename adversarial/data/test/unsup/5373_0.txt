This place is beautifully decorated and the prices are good: $30 for a Man\/Ped combo....the nail tech was friendly.\n\nGetting a massage is my favorite part of the whole experience. The nail place I normally go to turns a timer on for 10 minutes with the basic Man\/Ped--NOT HERE! This massage was less than 1 minute!!! What's with that? I think I've been hugged for longer that that!\n\nI gave this place a try and won't be back...I'll go back to my regular nail place.
