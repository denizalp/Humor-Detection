What a great place to catch up with good friends.  Loved the atmosphere, and the food was good too.  Better if you have friends who will show up earlier than you do to get a table.  Best if you have friends who will pick up the whole tab.\n\nI recommend the Chilaquiles and the 3 Eggs Steak\/Chilli.  My wife doesn't recommend the Corned Beef Hash Plate.  Yeowch!\n\nMerry Christmas everyone!
