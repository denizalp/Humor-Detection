We had a very good experience with our recent buying experience.  Started as an Internet inquiry and then we went in to seal the deal...  Geoff Mackey was the name of the salesman...  Deal with him if you can.  He was attentive, courteous, and energetic.  Only downer, and reason for only 3 stars, was the rude treatment we received from Phil in the finance department.   But don't let that stop you from checking them out.\n\nBtw, we bought a Fit....  Lov'in it!
