Stopped in for breakfast on a Thursday morning. We were greeted right away and seated. Our waitress took our drink orders and gave us a few minutes to look over the menus. I decided on the oatmeal. It comes with milk, brown sugar and raisins on the side. It was very good and filling. The decor is casual, and the service was good. We will be back to sample different menu items.
