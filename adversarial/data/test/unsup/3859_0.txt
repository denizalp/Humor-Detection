I had sampled the Vermonter when I was at a yelp event a few years ago.  I really enjoyed the sandwich then, but not as much this time around.  The bread was good, but they used too much of the sweet mayo and the granny apple slices were sliced too thin.  It almost like they weren't even there.  I liked the crunch and sourness that I got the first time I tried this sandwich.  \n\nCustomer service was good.
