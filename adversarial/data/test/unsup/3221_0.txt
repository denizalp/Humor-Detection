Ugggghh, I travel quite a bit and this airport is annoying as hell to get out of.  There is no issue arriving there but people and workers are annoying.  I couldn't wait to get on the plane and get the hell out of there.   The layout is annoying and the food selection was the worst I've experienced at an airport.
