Very good place.  It is cozy, not loud, and mellow.  The sashimi was very fresh.  For $20 we ordered a sashimi plate that had about 6 types of fish.  The miso soup and seaweed salad were well above average.  We tried a sake, which I never remember the names of.  It was also good.  Red wine I remember, sake always forget.  We also ordered an albacore roll with garlic and pickled onion.  Sounds a little different but so good.  The prices are  reasonable and the waitress was very attentive and sweet.  Will be back.
