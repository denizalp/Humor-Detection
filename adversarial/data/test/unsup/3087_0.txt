I tried to call in a to-go order here. I tried calling five times it never was answered so I drove to Denny's to place my to-go order in person and now that I'm here waiting for it outside I see the general manager outside smoking a cigarette just about the whole time I've been waiting for my to-go order. Good luck with a manager like that.
