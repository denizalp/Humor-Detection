Been here twice now and I will definitely go back and highly recommend this to anyone. The food is fantastic and I like the fact that they bring the food to you. Other Korean BBQ places I have gone to have you go up and get the food to cook like a buffet. This place is much better. This will be my go to spot when in Vegas and wanting Korean BBQ!!!!
