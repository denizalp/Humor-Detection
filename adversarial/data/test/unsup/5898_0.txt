This restaurant does it right. Service is attentive but unobtrusive. Ordered yellow tail with jalape√±o. This dish was sublime! Mixed cerviche,miso cod, and waygu potstickers were also great. We ordered various sushi rolls to round out the evening. \nModern design, good spacing of tables and carpet to mute sound allow you to have conversation with your dinner companion without shouting.\nI was there for a conference and my other friends had the same excellent dining experience.
