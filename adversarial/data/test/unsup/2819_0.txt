not great, not bad.\n\nthe browns stadium is right on the water which is cool, but it's also in a dead-zone of downtown (everywhere downtown could be considered dead, but thats for another review).\n\ncleveland fans are insane, and the parking lots stretch for miles to accommodate the beers, bongs and _______.\n\nthe stadium itself is a pretty generic 1980s\/1990s building.\n\nbeing a born and raised steelers fan, i could have taken the easy way out and trashed this place, but we keep it classy in pittsburgh.
