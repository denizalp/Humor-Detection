Atmosphere is pretty great here. Went with my bf, his parents,  sister, and nephew.  It was a lot of fun. I love my boot glass! Reminds me of the one I had when I travled to Texas with my family growing up. The food was decent. Location awesome.  I'm so glad we went here for dinner!!! We will be back again.
