This has to be a top 3 Mexican restaurant in the valley. The setting makes it my favorite. Great outdoor patio and duck pond. They usually have a talented mariachi band on the busy nights. The pollo fundido is the best that I have had. Everything else that I have tried is very good as well except for the fish tacos. I would stick to something more traditional here. The pitcher of margaritas I always get helps washes everything down.
