Dayclub Review.\n\nWhere was this place when I was single and had somewhat of a decent body?  \n\nThere are lots of people there that make you wish you did some push ups and sit ups before going there but there are also plenty of people that make you glad at least you don't look like them.\n\nNo one really cares what you look like there unless you're really hot so just be comfortable in your swimsuits.\n\nBring:\nSwimsuit, Sunglasses, Sunblock, Sandals, ID, and Cash\/Credit Card\n\nDon't Bring:\nBackpack, Jersey, Pants, Shoes, or a Book. (Yes, my dumbass brought my Kindle)
