I'm not here at this airport for food or the slots... I'm happy with the quick transition of Southwest and Virgin airlines terminals especially baggage claim. I'm here to get out to Las Vegas strip NOT to stay and linger unless waiting for a friend. In short, it's the perfect little spot to depart from and to arrive to.
