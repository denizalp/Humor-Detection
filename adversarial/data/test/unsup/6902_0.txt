Very disappointing ....  every stay in the hotel has had a dirty bathroom floor.  (Biological kind of dirty!) \nThe hallways had children running down the halls - ringing doorbells and screaming. \n\nThe Cafe food was bland and the meat was tough. \n\nThe casino floor is littered with children of all ages, who run up and down the isles while your on a slot machine. \n\nI have made numerous inquires to management - yet the service has not changed.
