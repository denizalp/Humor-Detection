It's been a while since I've gone back to this place. \n\nAfter some douchebag patrol at the Red Rock location, I am glad to be back to a more pleasant location. \n\nThis place resurrected our night after some bad Leguntas IPA upstairs at the Ranch so another plus to my return visit. \n\nI don't know, but even though Red Rock is closer to my house, I still want to go to this one if I can help it. That's saying a lot for someone who wants to cut-a-bitch down every time I'm in Town Square....
