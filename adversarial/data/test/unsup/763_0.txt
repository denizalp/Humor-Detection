Eating in this old school Italian restaurant you will feel a thousand miles from the Las Vegas strip.  I had to try this local hangout before it moves a few blocks away.  The house salad with Italian dressing, and the linguini with white clam sauce is one of the best combos you will find this side of Italia.  If you are looking to get away from the lights of the Las Vegas Strip this Italian restaurant will make you feel at home.
