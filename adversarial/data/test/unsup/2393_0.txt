Our new ritual after Sunday mass is stop here for lunch.  It's conveniently located just a block from the church in the Commissary parking lot on Nellis AFB.\n\nDaily specials are offered everyday and on Sunday for $2.99 you get two pieces of crispy fried juicy chicken, creamy yummy mashed potatoes and gravy, a soft buttery biscuit with some honey and for $1 you get some sweet tea!  \n\nHow do you like that?  \n\nI'm comin' back for more!
