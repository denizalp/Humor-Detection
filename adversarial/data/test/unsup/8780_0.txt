I was so sad to see the owner had changed :( the menu changed and it is no where near as good. The fried macaroni and cheese, which used to be to die for!! Sucked :(. I was so disappointed and sad cause this uses to be a must stop when we come to Vegas 3 times a year. Now it's okay we don't have to go stop.
