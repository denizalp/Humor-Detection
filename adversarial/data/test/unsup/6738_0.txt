ABSOLUTE RIPOFF. DO NOT GO HERE.  Wanted $150 for a 30 minute massage, which I mistakenly assumed would include \"everything\", excluding tip, but talked them down to 120.  WAY wrong. Didn't even get the 30 mins before she was pressuring for an extra $200 for \"two girls\".  I didn't go there for sex, just a standard \"asian\" massage. The \"manager\" came in and we negotiated some extra $$ to \"finish\". That got me about 3 minutes more of a half assed massage, not the result I wanted. Didn't even get a full 30 minutes.  RIPOFF CITY
