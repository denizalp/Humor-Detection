We had 2 different temps this week, and they did not disappoint! In all the years we have used Dependable, they have never sent anyone that was not an excellent hygienist, excellent with our patients and excellent with the computer, including changing the day's treatment and posting non-scheduled things and well as scheduling re-care appointments. Yes, we have three words for Dependable~ Excellent, excellent, excellent. Thank you Dependable, for being dependable!
