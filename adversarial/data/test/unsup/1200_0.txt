This is a great spot for brunch or whenever you're in the mood for some casual food! The service here is extremely polite and to the point, the food itself arrives to you in a timely manner. The menu is average sized for what you'd expect for a cafe; on it, they offer delicious sandwiches for lunch. I come back here often when I need something to eat during the day. I would definitely recommend this to friends and family!\nIf you're in the mood for something light and sweet, try the chocolate baby bundt cake!
