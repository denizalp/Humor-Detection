The price is definitely one of the highest in comparison to other Viet restaurants...but it deserves to be because the quality is much higher too. I haven't actually tried their pho yet though. I ordered the diced beef on rice and it was delicious and filling. The fried spring rolls look didn't impress me, but their taste did. Also, the presentation of the meals and the decor is definitely something other Viet places need to take note of.
