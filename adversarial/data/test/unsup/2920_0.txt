Know what tastes better than a meatball sandwich at Cafe Mauro? More meatball sandwich. In fact I'll wager that this place has the best meatball sandwich in the city. Not overly sauced, just enough. The bread is fantastic and fresh. The meatballs, big peppery and delicious. I don't eat here very often, but when I do it's a really nice treat. I totally recommend it!
