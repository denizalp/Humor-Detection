No Prince....\nNo Madonna...\nNo Stevie Nicks....\n?????\nI'm not too sure about how legit this place is....it seems A LOT was missing....or I wished I would've seen.... Maybe it's because certain artists do not contribute items to be shown off here.\nWho knows... I thought it was sparse for the price to walk through it.\nDon't get me wrong, we saw some cool stuff...I was just expecting WAY MORE!
