Momentum Tickets is a RIP OFF!  I ordered Garth Brooks tickets for the Atlanta Show.\nI paid them 564.00 for two tickets, when they came in the mail today, I see that the actual cost of the tickets was 60.00!  I am a business owner but their mark up is REDAMDICULOUS!\nI was redirected to their site as well.  Can you imagine the tickets I could have bought if I only knew!  \nSpread the word never use their service!
