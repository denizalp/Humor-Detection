This is my third time to the barbershop. I now see Alex he's knows my hair knows my style and does what I want.  He takes his time and make sure everything is right he also has become a personal friend of the family!\n\nEveryone asked me where do you get your haircut and I've been telling them and sending them all to Alex!\n Great job Alex and nice addition to our community...
