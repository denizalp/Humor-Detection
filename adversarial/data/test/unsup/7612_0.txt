Well was very disappointed to see out favorite ice cream parlor closed but delightfully surprised at how much we like this spot!!\nService was FANTASTIC TOP notch!! \nTaco was great lots of cheese. Freshly deep fried shell not like SO MANY Phoenix mex restaurants use!  Enchilada was very good. My wife really enjoyed her chimichanga.  My moms chilli reanno was great too.  Everything we had so far was great.  We will return. Highly recommended.
