Utter waste of time and money. It's as if your walking through a crappy version of a VH1 show. Not only that the food here has to be the most vile repugnant reheated slop served. Also let's not forget this waste of space doesn't have it's own parking. So the parking near by is either street parking or parking lots that don't take credit cards .\n\nI will never recommend this place to anyone ever.
