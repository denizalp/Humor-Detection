Jeremy Scott is the real deal. Most of the group workouts I've done in the past aren't challenging enough and\/or don't incorporate enough strength training... \n\nJeremy's classes are totally different. He's super efficient in the way he structures each workout and he includes a good amount of strength training, which I like. \n\nEvery time I take one of Jeremy's classes, I get a great workout. I'm really glad I found JSF!
