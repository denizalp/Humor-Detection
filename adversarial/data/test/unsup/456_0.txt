I agree with Jessica F. I keep trying to love this place but there are other breakfast spots that I prefer -- save the ambiance. You really cannot beat The Farm setting. \n\nThe breakfast tacos are good but (and the menu description says this) they come in HARD taco shells.\n\nDefinitely consider this spot to kick off a romantic, relaxing day and for out of town guests.
