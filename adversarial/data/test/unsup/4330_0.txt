I am a Costco addict. The place is always clean. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Loved my conversation with Silver in guest relations and Joe her manager. They exude pride in what they do and the company they work for. Costco has high ethics as a company which is another reason I prefer Costco over other similar retailers. Thank you Costco! \n\nUpdate 29 Nov 2016. \nRan into a pinch at another Costco. Easily fixed by a quick call to this Costco location. Again. Costco is the best.
