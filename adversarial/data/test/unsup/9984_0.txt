I have never had my lashes done before- and had no idea what I was missing out on! The entire experience was amazing, and I felt so relaxed and pampered. Haley did my lashes, and she was very friendly and professional! I was very relaxed throughout the entire experience, and I was even able to sneak in a quick nap. I can't wait for my next appointment, and would absolutely recommend the Lash and Sugar Company to everyone.
