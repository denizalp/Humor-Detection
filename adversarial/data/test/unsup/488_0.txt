We came here after edc day 1 since we were super dead and needed some pho to help heal us. \n\nThe menu ranges from pho, com tam, noodles and a few other dishes. I got the pho small size. It came out pretty quickly, considering they werent very busy since it was a warm day.  Pho was light and tasty.  I would come again since the restaurant was very clean, and service was kind.
