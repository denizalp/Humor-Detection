It's okay, but not worth the price. The tofu drumsticks are really the only delicious thing on the menu (and they're great). \n\nThey do an impressive job of making the food look pretty, but every entree I've had there has been just okay.\n\nIf you're looking for Asian vegetarian food, King's Cafe is nearby and much better.
