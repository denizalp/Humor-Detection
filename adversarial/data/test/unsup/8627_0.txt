This place is what it is. It carries a lot of herbal items and your off beat supplements. The reason I came here was they were the closest shop that sells Homeopathic stuff that I wanted. Prices seemed OK for what I got but again I didn't have a  chance to do a price comparison. Location is excellent.\nGood clean space and friendly staff.
