I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!\nThe food is terrible, no flavor, dried, no sauce. The only sauce available is ketchup and hot sauce. I should have gone to subway. \nThe service is terrible. She doesn't remember our order and just start throwing our sandwiches on the table and leave. We have to figure it out in our own. She had to open each sandwich and break them in half to see what inside and calling the name out. Who does that?! They are busy but they all have a big attitude here.
