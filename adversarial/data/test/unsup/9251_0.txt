This is my second visit to this walk in clinic in Richmond hill! Each time I sow the doctor very fast! Plus everyone is very friendly. Also the pharmacy is amazing! The pharmacist Mr Samier took the time to properly explain the Medicine I was receiving. And within 10 min I had received the Medications and was out!
