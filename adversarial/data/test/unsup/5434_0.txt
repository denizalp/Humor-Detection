My wife and daughter had been to another location of Fractured Prune, and I'd read about them in the paper when they first came to the valley - finally got a chance to try it.\n\nThe donuts are made plain.  You order from a wild list of flavor combinations (I got the Bacon Bomb and the Banana Cream Pie) - they float your donut in the appropriate flavored glaze, then dip it in the topping(s) to make the custom flavor you ordered.\n\nFun.  Tasty.  Donuts.  Trifecta!!!
