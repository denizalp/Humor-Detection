One doesn't expect too much from an airport eatery, but Sir Veza's Taco Garage is pretty darn good.  If you don't mind your tamales a little greasy, then you should give the corn and green chiles tamales a try.  Need something even simpler than that?  I enjoyed the beans and rice.  They're seasoned just right.\n\nIn short: if you're hungry in Terminal 4, pick this place.
