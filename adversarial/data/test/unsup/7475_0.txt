Einsteins and other chain bagel haunts have done a good job of schmearing our expectations when it comes to bagels and sandwiches.  The absolute mediocrity of their offerings have all but ensured that I only drop by in desperate breakfast circumstances.  But those low expectations were changed with DJ's.  No dry and endless chewable bagels here.  Everything is moist and vibrant and I have reason again to consider the bagel as adequate end tables to my sandwich selections.  Great place in a great little town.
