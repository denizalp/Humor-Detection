Service was exceptional. The staff were polite and very quick to serve. I walked in and was greeted immediately, so that really made my evening. Work was hectic today, so that actually meant a lot!\n\nI ordered the ultimate cheese gourmet burger w\/ poutine and gf got 1lb of wings. The portion was good, perfect size for average eaters. I haven't been feeling well lately, so I almost passed out after having my meal. The wings were huge! Each piece was big, drum stick or wing. Flavour was good, but not spectacular.\n\n3.75 stars, round up to 4! :)
