-WOW!! I didn't expect over the top, friendly service in here...I REALLY like this Baskin-Robbins!\n\n-FRIENDLY, helpful, attentive, enthusiastic (I am speculating was the owner)...a guy that enjoyed what he was doing and really likes his customers! The kind of service that keeps you coming back...\n\n-SUPER CLEAN! Bright & cheery B-R decor...makes you happy about having ice cream.\n\n-LOVe their ice cream...just give me all 31 flavors as I head over to Weight Watchers...\n\n-Convenient parking (next to Leo's Island BBQ).
