Beautiful restaurant with amazing food.  The Boston Bibb salad is so simple but absolutely delicious.  Their flatbreads are great too.  I don't like TOO much cheese on my pizzas and these were great options for the picky pizza eater such as myself.  I definitely recommend this place for any romantic date that you still want a laid back vibe to.
