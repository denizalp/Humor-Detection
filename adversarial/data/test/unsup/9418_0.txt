This place is totally average, and I mean that in a good way. There is absolutley nothing special about the food here. Infact, its toned down \"white person mexican food\"\n\nGood place to eat if you are not into having an adventure or if you are taking people out that you do not want to offend. Its a nice place, high ceilings, clean, nice atmosphere. Not a \"Cantina\" by any means. Very tame place
