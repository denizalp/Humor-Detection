Our wedding anniversary weekend is off to an AMAZING start, thanks to Albert. He made us feel like extremely special guests and not only upgraded our room but offered us a complimentary breakfast buffet at their restaurant for our anniversary. He couldn't have been more courteous and is a true example of first class customer service! Thank you Westin for having such memorable employees! We will be coming back and recommending our family and friends to stay here on their next Vegas visit. I am a happy customer!
