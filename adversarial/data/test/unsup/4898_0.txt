I have really high anxiety about dentists and Dr. Badalamenti did a fantastic job of making me feel comfortable.  He's very funny and was cracking jokes which made me forget about how anxious I was. He did great work and the whole procedure (implant) was over and done with super quick!  I highly recommend him as a dentist.
