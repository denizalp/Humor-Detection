Brady is a pest control expert and has treated our property for over 9 years. Before using his service, our home was full of scorpions, inside and outside. After a very brief time, Brady had all but eliminated not only the scorpion problem, he rid the property of ants and spiders too. We trust that each visit, he will take care of whatever the pest issue is quickly and effectively, He has extensive knowledge, he is affordable and very professional. I highly recommend his  Pest Control service.
