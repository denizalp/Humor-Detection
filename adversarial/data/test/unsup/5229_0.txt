The bottom line\n\n- Service is terrible\n\n- Food is beyond terrible (and expensive). It's like bad dinner theatre cuisine. You'll pay $20 for an entree that should cost $10 and is bad to boot. They get you because the only way to get a reserved (and good) seat is to book for dinner. \n\n- It's a solid venue for music.\n\n\nSo...you are, frankly, better off eating before...booking for dinner...and \"eating\" the absolute minimum...if I went again (doubtful), I'd order one of the harder to screw up appetizer and maybe split a main and then just let it sit there uneaten.
