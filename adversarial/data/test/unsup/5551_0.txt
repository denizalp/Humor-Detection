Why 5 stars?\n\nFreakin' awesome Mexican food, and CRAZY cheap prices!\n\nSo, I went a bit overboard (as always) in ordering.\nI just wanted to try so many different thingsssss\n\nI got:\nCheese crisp with green chile strips and guacamole\nMini green chile chimichanga\n1 cheese enchilada\nSide order of refried beans\nChips and salsa\n\nAll that food... .$15\nAnd it ended up being way too much food.  WAY too much.\n\nI loved everything...\nEVERYTHING I SAY!\n\nAnd that's truly a rarity.
