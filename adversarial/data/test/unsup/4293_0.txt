Brisket fries were the hit of dinner. We got the 2 meet platter with sausage and pulled pork with 3 sides of his puppies, mac n cheese and Cole slaw. The Cole slaw tasted old. The mac n cheese was dry and tasted like velvita.  The hush puppies were good, nothing spectacular. The corn bread did not resemble corn bread at all. The sweet tea was delish. Service was mediocre. Food came out super fast but was not fresh. Sad because we love staying at sams town. The prices are typical las vegas prices.
