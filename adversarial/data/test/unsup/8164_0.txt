This store seems to have more variety than the Urbana store.  As with all Meijer stores, the layout makes no sense, but this one is a little better than the Urbana store.  I can always find all my groceries here so it makes for great one-stop shopping.\n\nThe produce is usually pretty decent and their meat is better than Wal-Mart.
