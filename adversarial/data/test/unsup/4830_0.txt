This is it.\n\nThere is no other place for sushi in the GTA but here. Shame we've lost Mikado as Masuda-san is enjoying retirement now.\n\nGo for the omakase - spring and get the real thing. We had blue fin tekka maki rolls that are lodged in permanent memory and beyond.\n\nOne last hint: their tonkatsu is by far the best I've tasted outside Japan. Don't worry about the location - worry about the fact you have not been there yet.
