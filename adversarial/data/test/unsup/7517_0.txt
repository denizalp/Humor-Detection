5 star price, 5 star taste, 4 star decor and atmosphere. Overall they earn a solid 4. I prefer the Ross J's special because you get a little bit of everything. The spicy korean chicken is really good, no I mean REALLY REALLY good. They are much more reasonably priced then L and L, and yes ill say it...THEY TASTE BETTER.
