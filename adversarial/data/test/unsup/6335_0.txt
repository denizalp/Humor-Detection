The first thing you notice when you arrive is the stink. I'm not sure what it is... cigarette smoke? Hot ass? A cross between the two. There are slot machines to greet you, as well as expected liquor stores and the like. It's Vegas, afterall. \n\nIt's a fairly large airport and if you're traveling via Lyft\/Uber, it can be a bit complicated to find that designated area WITHOUT your app. Don't rely on airport signage unless you know that rideshare means Lyft\/Uber.\n\nNot awful. Probably more of a 3.5 star rating.
