I first came here with my mom and we got a table in the corner looking over the boardwalk. The view was the perfect start to brunch. Their multiple service method ensures fast and genuine service. Finally the food. To die for would be an understatement. I usually get the blueberry pancakes and they are so amazingly fluffy and perfect. Great place to get a bite!
