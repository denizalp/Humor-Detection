Terrible.  Terrible.  Terrible.  I ordered Chicken Chow Mein.  After waiting 40 minutes, it was delivered...with no noodles.  So I called and told them that they brought me the wrong thing.  They said they would run another one over.  \n\nThey brought the same thing again.  Apparently, according to them, chow mein does not have any noodles besides a crispy noodle.  I lived in San Francisco for 10 years, went to numerous Chinese food restaurants, and every time I ordered chow mein, it had noodles.\n\nIt was gross.  I will never order from there again.
