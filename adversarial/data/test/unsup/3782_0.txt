A small business owned by a lovely family. The variety of desserts is amazing. If you get a waffle or a sundae, they ring a variety of syrups to your table. \n\nThey also have great savory options at a really good price! If you like samosas, you have to come here. $5 for 5! They also have burger\/fry kind of options too. \n\nI'm all about supporting the little guy, especially if they're good! This is a must visit spot.
