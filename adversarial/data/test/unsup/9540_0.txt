Ok, but pricey. \n\nAs sports bars go, Buffalo Wild Wings is ok. Lots of screens, beers and wings.  \n\nI dropped by for lunch as a change of pace. An order of medium (15) boneless wings, the size of chicken nuggets, was $17.  They were ok, but nothing exceptional.  Many local pubs would win a taste contest.  \n\nI wouldn't rule out going back, but it would not be a first choice.
