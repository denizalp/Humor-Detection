First time trying this place. Uninspiring food, I decided to have calamari and gnocchi with pesto. Calamari was tender But I wish the batter was lighter and the marinara that it came with was no so heavy with tomatoes. Gnocchi was a disaster, it was soo mushy... I could only eat 1\/3 of it. I'm not a person who sends back stuff. I decided not to finish it, just won't be back for another helping.
