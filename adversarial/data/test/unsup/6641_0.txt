I never felt like I was eating anything here that was obviously old or artificial. Get any chicken dish, they're all high quality. \n\nGet the sushi as well. Nine out of ten times I'll have sushi at buffets, but Mandarin really churns out the California rolls fast and with relatively high quality stuff. Yes, I just said \"quality\" and \"California rolls\" in the same sentence. \n\nThere are like at least a dozen different items I'll eat from here, and when I'm done I'll say dessert is also totally worth it. And it's not even that expensive!
