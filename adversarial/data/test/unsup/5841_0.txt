I don't eat tacos often but WOW this definitely surpassed my expectations! They're also open till 2am so my cravings are satisfied after wanting more and more since the first time I tried it! They have a couple places to sit and eat there too if you don't wanna bring it in your car! The workers are super nice as well. There was music and chill vibes! Great place to grab a quick taco run with friends late night :)
