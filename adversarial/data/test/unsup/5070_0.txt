I really like the pedicure at Furama, and they're the only salon I let put glitter polish on my piggies.\n\nSometimes their state of the art massage chairs alternate between goosing and squeezing my bum.\n\nSometimes, when you order the callous removal, they grate a hole in your foot with that cheese grating tool, and sometimes they don't... but the pedicure is so good you'll be back.\n\nTheir tagline should be: Furama Nails - So good, you wont care when we cheese-grate a hole into your foot.
