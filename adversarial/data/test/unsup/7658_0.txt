We came here to pick up some condoms around 10PM on a Saturday night cause we forgot to bring some with us.  No love without the glove, right?  Found the condoms and the cabinet was locked.  That's fine, go find a checker.  Come to find out, the pharmacy holds the key and they closed at 8PM.  WTF?!  How can you sell condoms, mind you in VEGAS, and the pharmacy that holds the key closes much earlier than the store?  We took our condom money elsewhere.
