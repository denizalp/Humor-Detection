I made a appointment for 9am with Jenny and was there promptly. There were two employees busy doing nails. It was 9:30 and Jenny still wasn't there. I asked if they could call her because i had to go to work and they said she's the boss so if you want to wait.  Then another employee walks in and says Jenny won't be coming in. This is so rude! She's the boss? Wow! Horrible customer service! She couldn't even call the shop to say that!
