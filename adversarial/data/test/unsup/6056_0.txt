Why oh why does it take 15 mins to make a bagel straight from the menu? They have 4people on the line for prep and the wait is just ridiculous.\nIf that's the typical turn time then they should let a customer know. Then I'll be more understanding. But I'm gonna stop giving business because I just don't have the time to wait.
