Cute coffee shop and dessert place. Very nicely set up. The owner, Robin is a very friendly lady and it shows that she loves doing what she does. My wife and I are addicted to the Kona bowl and try to visit the shop at least once a week. Who knew that Azuki beans and ice-cream and shaved ice would go so well together. I also appreciate that they have choice of syrups without dyes in them. They also have special shaved ice bowls for pups.
