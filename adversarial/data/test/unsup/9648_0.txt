I stayed 3 nights at the Excalibur Hotel in Las Vegas, NV on 11\/21\/2014, 11\/22\/2014 and 1123\/2014.  It was the first time that I stayed here.  I stayed in tower 2 which is newly renovated.  My bill for the room was just over $300 total for the three nights.  I love the medieval theme of the Excalibur.  Plus, I took photos.
