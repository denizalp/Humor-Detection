As the drunks, and the bankrupt try to stand on their two feet and wipe their tears away, I was just trying to get on my flight, weaving between all the crazy people.  The people watching here is unbelievable.  Not to mention the last minute gambling before hopping on the plane back home (love the slots in the Airport).\n\nSecurity was a breeze and my flight left on time with no hiccups.  Overall this airport is acceptable.  I might have had a stronger opinion if I wasn't recovering from a hangover myself leaving Vegas - full disclosure here.
