I have passed Sammy's a couple times in the airport and walked on by like Isaac Hayes. There is a picture of Sammy Hagar in white linen looking very at peace like an older hillbilly White Iverson. Sammy's is nothing more than a place to drink while waiting for a plane. People need to either wait to their destination to eat or stop expecting dumpy airports to serve them their foodie-Yelp-Instagram wet dream on a dirty plate.
