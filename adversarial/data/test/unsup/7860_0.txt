OMG. This club enticed us to join for squash with a new squash pro there Scott Denne. Within three months the \"pro\" decided my son could not take lessons from anyone else besides him and his jealousy when my son did was extreme. So much so that he would not communicate with me and had us blacklisted out of the club. Something is not right there. BE CAREFUL.
