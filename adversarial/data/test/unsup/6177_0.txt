I had an Andrew Roby Project Manager come to my home to discuss a kitchen renovation \"fix\". It would involve handyman work mostly. I was told I would receive a quote within a few days. I never heard back from the rep. The work has been done by another company but I think this is unprofessional not to follow through with the customer.
