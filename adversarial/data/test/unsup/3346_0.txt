Solid coffee but not a place I'd ever want to hang out. Basically a grab and go. Interior could use some love. Bathroom is hella gross. I wanted to purell my body. Enough said. Also, please cut off the WiFi on weekends. You have 6 tables and people are using them as a damn library workstation. You're too busy for that. Just make it easier for me to love you. Cause I just wanna love you. OK? Bye!
