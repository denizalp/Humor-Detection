I really enjoyed my visited to Viet Noodle bar. We came in on a Monday night around 11pm. They are open late and it was relatively quiet.\n\nWe ordered the Charbroiled Beef Spring Rolls, the beef combination pho and the Egg Noodle Stir-Fried with Seafood (Hu Tieu\/Mi Xao Vi).\n\nThe food was fresh and we enjoyed the whole meal! The service was great too.\n\nWith tax, the total came to $26. We will definitely be back.
