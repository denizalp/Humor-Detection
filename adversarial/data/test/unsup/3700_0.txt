Recently visited Hanny's for the first time and received crap service from a waitress with an attitude. She was not willing to happily accommodate any requests and acted put-off at anything we asked about or asked for. Plus, the place wasn't even busy while we were there, it was pretty empty. That's how you drive customers away.
