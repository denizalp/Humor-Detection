This is the 2nd time we've made the mistake of buying fish from GE Market District.  Both times, we asked the counter if it was fresh, they replied yes & both times the fish stunk of ammonia. What's hilarious is that you call GE to complain, they want you to bring the fish back for a refund on their satisfaction guarantee. We're looking forward to bringing even stinker fish back to them tomorrow ;)
