Excellent coffee in Scottsdale.  Roast their own and quite well.  Enjoyed a fully washed Eithiopian Yirg which was great as a chemex.  Also serve a variety of beer and wine.  Cool decor.  Hipster but mix of folks in there the times I have been.  Espresso and lattes on a beautiful La Marzocco Strada.  Knowledgable staff.  Polite and helpful.
