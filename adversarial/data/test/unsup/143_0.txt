Nobu in Vegas is the gold standard of sushi for me. The only place I've had that was better was O Ya in Boston. The service here is super friendly, I've sat at the bar, their sushi bar, and their tables. Don't be surprised to see a celebrity eating here. I sat next to a bunch of Yankees once.\n\nAs far as the food goes, you can't go wrong with any of the sushi. My favorite dishes are the Rock Shrimp and Black Cod with Miso. Must go here f you're n Vegas.
