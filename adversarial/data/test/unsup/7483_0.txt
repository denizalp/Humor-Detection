I didn't really like this place. It's located on the bottom floor of the Green P parking garage, meaning you not only have to pay for your car wash but you also have to pay for parking!! The staff didn't look very professional and they didn't do the greatest job on the exterior of my car. I definitely won't be back, especially not for $120! What a ripoff.
