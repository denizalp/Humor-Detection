Super hectic establishment, with a frantic pace as soon as you walk through the door.  Jam packed with people I assumed this would be an exciting, delicious experience.\n\nTook forever to get us seated, even though I had a reservation.  Felt like I was in a fast food court in p-mall.\n\nDisappointing menu.  The food came out slow, felt stale and old as if it were sitting out all day.  Fish quality was very poor.\n\nI could go into more detail, but why bother?  Do yourself a favour, save yourself the hassle and go elsewhere.\n\nCan I give zero stars?
