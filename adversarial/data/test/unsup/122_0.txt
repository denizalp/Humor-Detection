Sangria tasted like my neighbour's nephew's fruit punch, I could even taste the cheapness of the wine that was used. Do NOT order any cocktails here!\n\nGood place for karaoke, the song selections are wide and they update their song lists monthly. Every room is equipped with an air conditioner, however their furnitures are really old and the waiter had a really bad attitude.
