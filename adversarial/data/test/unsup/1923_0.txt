We stumbled across this place on a Saturday afternoon. The atmosphere is very welcoming and the branding is excellent.\nWe had the Guacamole, Tortilla soup, the mini burrito and a few tacos. The tortilla chips are made in house and you can purchase it in bags as well (which we did).\nTake-out is available.\nWill definitely return.
