There's really nothing spectacular with the food at the Grille Inside the Golden Nugget.  The Golden Nugget actually has a lot of other food options.  I always find the Grille convenient, quick, and the dirt cheap.  The menu is basic and consist of all-day breakfast, burgers, hot dogs, grilled cheese sandwiches, and salads.  The service from the cooks have always been great. Overall, I can't knock The Grille because it is what it is and it's basically a fast food restaurant inside the Golden Nugget.
