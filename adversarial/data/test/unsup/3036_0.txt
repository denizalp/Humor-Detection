Big Starbucks with lots of seating.\nThe staff are incredibly friendly and helpful.\nBeing from New York you can not even think about how much nicer people are out of New York.\nThe baristas here bring a new meaning for me to friendly and nice.\nTotally amazing service and drinks made perfectly.\nI will definitely be back for more.
