The chicken is dry.   Every single time.   Been there 5 or 6 times and the chicken has been sitting out under the heater for ages.    Not enough sauce in the world to fix that.\nThe place is usually empty.  \nI'd go to Amir (just a few blocks away on Sherbrooke) for a way better shish taouk pita any day.
