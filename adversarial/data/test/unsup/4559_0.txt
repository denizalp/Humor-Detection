This place is delicious and the food served here is quite unique in taste\/presentation. Nestled inside the Caesars Palace, Mesa Grill is one on Bobby Flay's establishments that has been around for quite sometime and the menu has changed quite a bit for its original. The steak and the chicken are delicious and the mini tamales are ridiculously good. Overall, a great restaurant in Vegas that I'd recommend trying at least once. \n\nPros-\nAmbiance \nService \nEclectic menu \nLots of flavors \nDrink menu \n\nCons-\nCan get crowded \nChanging menu
