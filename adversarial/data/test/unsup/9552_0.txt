Um, this place sucks.\n\nIt gets two stars only because it's close to the Strip (though beware the effing taxi bandits that will try to take a circuitous route and screw you out of double what the ride to your hotel should cost).\n\nThe decor is hideous and outdated and the food options are disgusting. Subway was the best out of many crappy options and it was SEVEN DOLLARS for a 6\" tuna sandwich!!! WTF?\n\nI want to kick this airport in the shins.
