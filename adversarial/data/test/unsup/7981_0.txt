Came here for breakfast today, and it was a great experience. Ordered a number 33 with a cake. Really good food. Came out fast, and the decor is really cute and modern. Excited to come back and try other sandwiches ! \n\nOnly thing I would say is maybe have Tabasco as a condiment to accompany Siracha. I like adding a lot hot sauce lol
