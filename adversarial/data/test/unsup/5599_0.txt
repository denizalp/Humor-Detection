The autumn rolls and pho were fantastic!  The time before we tried the summer rolls which were okay, but needed something more like fresh pineapple.  It was just cabbage in a rice paper roll.  I love that there are so many healthy, tasty options, but I must say the atmosphere is really lacking and reminded me of a kid's playroom with the fluorescent green walls and the giant purple mint leave on the wall.  Despite this with limited vegan and vegetarian options in Scottsdale, I will definitely be back!
