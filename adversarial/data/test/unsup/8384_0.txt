While we entered the restaurant, we immediately received a warm welcome from the waitress.  The restaurant is romantic for couples, also provide a warm family setting.  We ordered escargot and salad to start, and pasta for main courses.  The pasta is good, but would be better if it has a little bit more seasoning!  Just a little bit lack of flavour for the seafood pasta tomato sauce.  Overall it is good and recommend to give a visit.
