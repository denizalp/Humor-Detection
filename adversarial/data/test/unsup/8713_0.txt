Never eaten there because the place always smells like a bathroom and don't bother playing stuff that you want on the jukebox because the bartender will turn it off until you leave and then once you leave he'll delete all the songs that you put on,sorry for putting in Merle Haggard and Willie Nelson I thought it was a lot better than the rap crap playing. There are so many better bars around to go visit like the Martini down the street or Frank's Tiki Room or the Bar on Durango or......
