Very slow service. There was only one person in front of me at the drive thru and they literally took 15 mins to get the food out. I ordered off the menu so nothing custom that should have taken that long. Also it has a Cinnabon attached so I assumed they would have iced coffee like the Cinnabon does however they do not. I was disappointed to hear that they will only serve hot coffee.
