I recently was rushed to the Chandler Regional Medical Center from our home in Maricopa. I was having an asthma attack and could not breathe. I wound up staying at the hospital for 4 days due to my asthma, pneumonia and breathing issues. I would not be here without their promptness, their care, their ability to bring my breathing around. Then the days I spent in the hospital, the nurses, the doctors, the respiratory therapists where all amazing!! Thank you  Chandler Regional Medical Center!!!
