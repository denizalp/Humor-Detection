This sonic has horrible customer service and the can even get a route 44 ounce cup of ice right. Ordered a bag of ice , girl screams \"I need a bag of ice \" in the back like she is at home in her pajamas. Gives me a large instead of extra large water, then when I say thank you she doesnt say anything and just shuts her window . I love sonic, this manager needs to get this employee a mop and keep her away from customers
