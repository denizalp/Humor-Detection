I've never been a huge fan of ramen in Toronto, so I would give this place a pass for flavour.  I had the yelpers recommended garlic broth with pork shoulder and egg.  While the broth was rich, I found the garlic a bit too burnt for my liking.  The thin noodles were fine, and we also tried the fried chicken with mayo dipping sauce which was also a bit bland.  Service was friendly
