$14 for a movie ticket? Because the seats recline and are assigned. What a joke! This will be the first and the last time. No veteran discount either. I guess Harkins doesn't care if you served your country or not. I'd AVOID this location at all costs. There's only a million other movie theaters in town to choose from. Keep sniffing that glue Harkins and rest assured I will never PAY DOUBLE for anything especially a lousy movie.\n\nGo to Roadhouse Cinemas, $6 Tuesdays!
