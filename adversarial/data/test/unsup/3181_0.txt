Food was great but a bit disappointed in the service. Three out of four drinks came out before the meal, but the fourth hadn't come by the time our meal came--and neither had the chips and salsa we ordered. We inquired, and the chips came out, but the last drink didn't. It took another reminder, after we were almost finished with our meal, to finally get the last drink.\n\nTheir nachos are very good, and so are the margaritas. I preferred the Daddy's margarita, which was more balanced, over the house margarita, which was too sweet.
