I had discovered a mold problem in a house I was selling and wanted to get it remediated asap. Josh came within 4 hrs of my call to give me an estimate. He advised me of the process involved and had a wealth of knowledge about mold. He got the work completed within a few days. He kept me apprised of everything going on and always answered his phone whenever I called. Great customer service !!I would highly recommend ASAP
