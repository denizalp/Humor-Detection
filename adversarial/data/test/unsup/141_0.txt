The food here is good. We ate breakfast, tried the lunch menu, and another night had a late dinner here throughout our trip since we stayed at The Venetian. The drinks were amazing. The Clementine Crush...love, love, love. Service was great. The quality of the food seems good, portions are huge enough to share.
