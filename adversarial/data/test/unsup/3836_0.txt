This park is the big craze in Brampton.  Oh my doggie god. It's not that great we went there in a Sunday at 1pm  they have a farm with no  animals .\nLooks like they all put away for winter. \nThey have a nice pond with some ducks and that's about it. No big deal. \nI hope I am not taken there again.
