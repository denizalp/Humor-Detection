Come on people, it's Mr. Roberts. It's a dive bar, it's stinky, dingy, sometimes scary and that's the way it's supposed to be, to keep the squeamish out. Quit being haters, there are plenty of white-washed established to frequent for the faint of heart. As for the crap tap beer-order a bottle. I for one am thankful that shit-holes like this exist.
