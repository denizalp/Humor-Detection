$100 cancellation charge for cancelling within 48 hours, but they confirm the move 24 hours in advance. Would be nice for them to call and confirm the move 48 hours in advance to give the customer one last chance to cancel\/reschedule. Oh well, there goes $100 for nothing. I understand that they need to recover costs for cancelled moves, but there are ways to minimize costs and make your customers happy.
