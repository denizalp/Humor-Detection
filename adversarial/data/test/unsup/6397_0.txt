Some guy came in and wanted to buy crack while I was in the Market Basket.  I guess this isn't the Market Basket's fault exactly.  Still, I'd prefer not to shop at the kind of establishment that caters to crackheads begging for change from other customers to buy a 40 of Colt 45 because they \"need something to tide them over\" at 8:56 PM.
