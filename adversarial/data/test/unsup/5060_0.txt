I have Breast cancer stage 3 with positive lymph nodes. Called Cancer Treatment Centers of America regarding possible treatment. They have continuous commercials on TV in the Phoenix area. Nice guy on the phone--John--told me that they do not take Medicare or Cigna ( PPO). I am an RN with advanced degrees and had hoped for a better response. So, I guess if you have millions in cash they will see you. Only out for the money.
