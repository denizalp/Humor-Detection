The arrogant bartender with the Irish brogue needs an infusion of professionalism! While my Fazzoletti with shredded veal and fontina with truffle emulsion was excellent (by the way, I'd never heard of this type of pasta; it's thin and flat, approx three inches square), the bartender could be overheard making snarky comments and telling patrons his Director was stupid.  He brought the place down and lessened the experience.\n\nHe could learn a lot from Curtis at Circo!
