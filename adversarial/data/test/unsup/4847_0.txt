It just keeps getting better. The sushi prepared here by the guru himself is absolutely flawless. This is the only place that can make a roll using brown rice and keep it together. The fish is always fresh, and I am amazed every single time at the level of service I receive. I signed up for a yelp account just to tell Charlotte about this place. It is my sanctuary. A+
