Great place to kill time; lots of retro merchandise and antiques. Great for buying movies DVD's and Blu-Rays for a great cheap price. Awesome vendors with good games for X-Box 360 and Playstation games; retro SNES games Nintendo games even Genesis! Brought back memories. Great on a nice day with the sun out!!
