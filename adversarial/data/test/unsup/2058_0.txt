Second time here.  Today my two Havanese babies received the worst cuts ever.  The first trims were marginal.  My bad for not paying closer attention.  The groomer cut so close I can see skin.  I asked for 1\/2 of their 2 1\/2\" coats.  They look like shaved rats.  She trimmed around their toes!  OMG-.  The owner offered me $5 off for not being open at 7:45am.  I had made previous arrangements to drop them early.  No\none there at 8:10.  All in all this was a horrid experience.  We won't be back no matter how inexpensive they are.
