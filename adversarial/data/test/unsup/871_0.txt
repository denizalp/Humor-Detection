I have went here two times. The first time my gel nails lasted almost a month and the second time barely 2 weeks and I had two different nail techs each time. I will say my feet are rough and both techs did a great job on them. I like Lannie's but my friend that I get my nails done with didn't care for Lannie's and her gel didn't last a week both times we went. I may go back if I go on my own.
