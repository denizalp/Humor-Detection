probably the ONLY place i'm a regular.\n\nhave really only had their tofu bowls. i only have lunch here and i never feel like trying anything new. \n\ntheir bowls are great. choose your \"meat\". the way you want it cooked - i prefer garlic and broccoli. white or brown rice. add veggies for a $1 more. \n\ni dont know if i would recommend any sushi from here. had a spicy tuna once. dont remember it. so it must have not been that good. \n\nthey have this dessert thats pretty good.
