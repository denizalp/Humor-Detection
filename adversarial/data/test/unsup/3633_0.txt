Had lunch here.  The food was good I had the special for Friday, which was salmon, asparagus and mashed potatoes.  What was not so pleasant were the flies that kept circling around our food.  This made the experience very unpleasant having to keep fanning flies away.  We reported to the manager who didn't seemed concerned and said that she would close the door.  Not impressed.
