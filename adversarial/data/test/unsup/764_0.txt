Great for what it is.... well priced, hearty southern cooking in a casual environment. The chicken and dumplings are my favorite! The apple butter is also really good.. but you'll have to ask for it, because they don't automatically bring out with biscuits. There's a cute gift shop at the entrance, which makes the wait time easier to deal with.
