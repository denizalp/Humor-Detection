This place is so unprofessional. The injectionist wouldn't straight up answer my questions about her location of the injections while she's sticking the needle in my face. I clearly had a few questions and instead she proceeded to argue with me and talk over me. Terrible bed side manner, rude and unprofessional. She even told me off as I put my coat on and walked out of the room. Get a Groupon elsewhere.
