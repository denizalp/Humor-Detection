When I discovered this place, I went two days in a row! Fantastic quality! Over the course of two days, I had the Mushroom Burger, Ghost Pepper Burger, Pastrami Sandwich and at breakfast I had a spectacular Denver Omelette with Hash Browns and Toast. Fresh mushrooms on that burger. Ghost Pepper sauce is spicy but the flavor is incredible! Staff is friendly and very professional. Highly recommend Burger Rush!
