Solid Fry Up and good menu at a decent\/average price point. Only problem is what everyone else is mentioning: service is SLOW. I think it's just one lady serving the whole restaurant so unfortunately we waited a good 10-15 minutes before we even got menus and then an additional 30-40 minutes before we saw any food hit the table.\n\nThe black and white sausage was really good and authentic. I'd go back just based on the lack of decent breakfast\/brunch alternatives in the immediate area.
