We went there as a group and we had variety of dumplings. They are pretty unique. We tried the desert dumplings (sesame and peanut)  and they were surprisingly good! In general potstickers are out too choice. The service was welcoming and we enjoyed the vibes. The only downside is it is a bit slow but I guess there were 10 of us and there were so many choices.
