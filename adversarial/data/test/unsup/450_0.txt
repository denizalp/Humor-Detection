This is the best Indian restaurant we have found in Phoenix since moving here. The service was great, everyone was very friendly. The food was amazing. We had the tikki saag and Malai kofta (sp?) And I would recommend it to anyone that wants dishes full of flavor. I just finished my meal and already can't wait to come back again to try more new dishes.
