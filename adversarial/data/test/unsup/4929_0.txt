Efficient staff and service, friendlier than most Chipotle's I visit.\nEntering the lot and parking takes some maneuvering. \nGreat music, but it is set on rock concert volume. \nStandard Chipotle options and portions.\nFunky dining area.  Looks like an unfinished remodeling project.  Whoever decided that this should be the new look in restaurants, saved the company lots of dollars.
