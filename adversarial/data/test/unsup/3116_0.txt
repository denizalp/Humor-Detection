Everything about this place was yummy... Owner, waitress, the cooks in kitchen all smiled and really went out of their way to make us feel welcome. We wanted to eat all 3 meals there today, however we stated with breakfast. There is nothing that isn't made from scratch. The green salsa Verde amazing.  \nWe drove 40 miles one way to enjoy our meal. Can't wait to go back.
