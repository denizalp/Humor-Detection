Eggspecting something eggstraordinary for brunch? It's typically crowded here on weekends, but take the little eggstra time to wait, and you'll be seated in no time. \n\nEggstensive menu that includes a vast selection for those egg haters as well. There's something for everyone at Eggspectation.\n\nMy french toast was nothing to be eggscited about, but my over easy eggs were perfectly over easy and my brunch partner eggspecially enjoyed his eggs benny with smoked salmon and asparagus. We both agreed this resto is an eggspert. \n\nContent and satisfied, we eggsitted knowing we'll be back for more.
