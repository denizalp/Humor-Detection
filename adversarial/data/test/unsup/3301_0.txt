Loved it! Great getaway for cold cleveland nights.  Unique very well made drinks (dry ice so they bubble and smoke, come on that's just awesome). A great friendly staff. Great place to go for a fun atmosphere and something different, you don't feel like your in Cleveland. Our group order their chorizo tacos to much on and loved them, I will be going back to try more drinks and their black bean tacos.\nDon't hesitate to go in!
