Very unprofessional.I called before coming to see the gym and I was told I could come see the gym with a few friends.The following day,We show up as well as other fans and guest  all to find out the gym will be closed down for a few weeks.Mayweather is undefeated in the ring but has many L's when it comes to professionalism.Get your shit together.
