My family and I have tried many of the appetizers, main dishes and desserts.  We have not found anything that we do not love.  Everything is fresh and so flavorful.  You can watch them pull the pita bread out of the oven before they serve it steaming hot to your table. YUM! \nYou can tell that they really take pride in the food and in the service.
