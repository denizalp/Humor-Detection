Went to lunch at this place. It looked clean but the food was atrocious. I ordered a 3 piece chicken dinner for about $11.00. Not only was the chicken over cooked, but they gave me all dark meat. And get this, they sold me a fried chicken back as one of my three pieces. A chicken back, I could not believe it\n..a back of a chicken. What kind of place sells the back of a chicken. Whats  next, a chicken NECK? Definately will never go to this joint again.
