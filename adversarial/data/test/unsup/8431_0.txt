Wow, what a fantastic restaurant. Top notch professional service. Excellent tables. Food was absolutely incredible (we chose the Tasting Menu). It was a true dining experience with attentive, professional waiters, a relaxed atmosphere so that I could enjoy a wonderful meal with my wife. I can't say enough. Honestly. If you are in town and can afford the menu, the time, and the trip, you will not be dissatisfied. Please look at my other reviews. I don't give 5 stars to every restaurant. Kai deserves every accolade I can give it.
