Food and service are great! The mixed grill is my go to. So much food for two people! All the meat and veggies were seasoned and cooked well. I've had this on several occasions paired with some Mythos greek beer. Highly recommend, it isn't that busy of a place making it a great last minute dinner spot if you give them a call ahead. The patio is great for the summer too for people watching.
