Normally I Yelp things like this before I go in just because it's what I do. Plus I don't like wasting money. The store itself is cute & Kristen was very vivacious which is awesome too. That's were the accolades stop. My Mom & I ordered a slew of things from cupcakes to cheesecake. All of which were bad! The cupcakes were dry as a bone & the frosting was missing something. I've never tasted a cupcake so bad that I had to throw it away. Take heed & stay clear of this place.
