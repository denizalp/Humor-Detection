Inattentive waiters. Upon walking in, I was asked to sit at the Ramen bar! Spicy Red Miso Ramen was Garrrbage! \"Wok fried pork\" just means fried ground pork. Barely any mushroom (total of 1\/8 of a mushroom). Mostly Ramen and bean sprouts! I've had better instant noodles at home! NO soba on the menu! What kind of resto advertising itself as a Japanese resto doesn't have soba noodles? \"Pressed\" sushi was just some western interpretation of sushi; screams unauthentic. Sashimi choice is pathetic. Meh. Avoid.
