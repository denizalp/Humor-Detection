Ok, what woman doesn't love a good deal on undies? There's something for every kind of budget here, from $3 panties to $50 ones; from every-day bras to something a show-girl would wear. Oh, and they have pasties with tassels too! There's a discount card that costs $ 10 a year and gives you 10% off each purchase. I immediately bought one because I spent over $100 today so it already paid for itself...I now have a reason to indulge one of my guilty pleasures - buying pretty underthings!
