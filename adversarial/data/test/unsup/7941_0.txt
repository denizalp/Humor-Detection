I took my golden retriever mix here on a Tuesday for the first time and he came out so adorable and soft with a perfect trim! I fell in love with how they did and two days later on Thursday I took my dads dog. He came out just as perfect! I am definitely coming back. Great job and amazing service! Duke and Hershey look great, thank you All Dogs!!!
