Definitely a cool, sheek, lounge in the heart of the Biltmore. The atmosphere is very laid back and relaxed. The heart warming vibe makes you feel instantly at home.\nThis is by far the hippest and most chic lounge I've seen in this area. Drink prices are reasonable, and the service is second to none. MercBar is great for a girls night or simply a night out in town with a small group of friends. It does get pretty crowded after about 8pm so plan on getting there a little bit earlier. Overall, this place is definitely worth visitng.
