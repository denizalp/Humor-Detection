This place has a large menu and great ambiance. I didn't really care for what I had, but I would go there again when I'm in Vegas. The menu is large. There is even a shot you can order with a scorpion in it! Not for me, but we did see a group try it. They play 80's and 90's videos, which was my favorite thing about the place. Our server was pretty cool. We also got a free house margarita for checking in on yelp. It was pretty good.
