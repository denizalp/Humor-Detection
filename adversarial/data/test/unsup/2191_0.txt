DRINKS ARE PRETTY CHEAP!\n\nBought a bottled water, LA water, vodka cran, and chilled goose shot; and it was around $50. That's pretty cheap! \nNormally, I think drinks in any club on the strip is $20 each. \n\nAgain, I had sooo much fun on their industry night -- MONDAYS ARE THE NEW FRIDAYS! ***quote me on that***
