I will start by saying that the place doesn't look bad good customer service and waiting area however 10 minutes for a fade?? Most places usually take 30-40 minutes if not more. The stylist spent more time on the hand treatment then cutting  my actual hair. Even left a $20 tip once I got home I noticed the horrible job she had done.
