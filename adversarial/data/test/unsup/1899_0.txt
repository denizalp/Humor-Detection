This place has great hours to work out. I can work out early in the morning before work or do a late work out. Its seems like they take good care of there equipment and has a great staff.\n I've been to plenty of gyms that are so packed you have to wait to work out But not here. I'm thinking of signing up with a trainer to see if I can work on more definition. I'll keep you posted
