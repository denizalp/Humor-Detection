You won't believe this but I left my purse on the Monorail!  Luckily I realized quickly and found one of the security staff (sadly I have forgotten her name).  She radio'd to have the train checked and there was an officer who had already found it and was looking for us!  I was very impressed with the professionalism and thoroughness.  I was so relieved--mostly because we were on our way to a show and the tickets were inside my purse!  Anyway, I really liked the monorail...it's clean and safe.  Also, it was very inexpensive.
