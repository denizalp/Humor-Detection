Alrighty, now you're silly for looking at a Yelp review of Steak N' Shake. You know what you're getting yourself into. \n\nThat being said, this location is pretty great. Never have I had a negative experience. The food is warm, tasty, and comes out in a reasonable time. Beyond that, there is a server there named Desmond. He is a joy. Wonderful, welcoming, and inclusive. He alone makes the average diner experience excellent. Hip hip! Hooray!
