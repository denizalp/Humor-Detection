First time ordering.  Called in our order and it was ready as promised.  One of the BEST take out pizzas ever!!  Ordered Barros Specialty and it was loaded, I mean loaded with toppings and soooo cheesy!!  I saved the best for last, the crust.  Crisp and not soggy.  That is usually a make or break for us.  Perfection!  We'll be back.....
