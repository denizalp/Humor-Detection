Tried this place today for breakfast, the food was good, reminds me of BLD as far as pricing, just not as many options As BLD. We ordered the \"American\" and \"Chicken fried Chicken\" skillets and both were very good. The atmosphere was nice, not too crowded. The mimosa was great, didn't skimp on champagne in the mimosa, and the belini was good as well. I will definitely come back!
