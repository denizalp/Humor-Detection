YUM!! Go to taco spot for the whole lake\nNorman area. So yummy and fresh and the prices are crazy reasonable. In addition their salsa menu is extensive with many options and the verde salsa in particular is to die for!! Their chips are homemade and fresh as can be. Definitely check out if you haven't already.
