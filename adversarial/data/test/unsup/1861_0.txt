Second time coming and it couldn't have been better! Ordered the Xa Xiu this time - which contained a greasier pork I guess you could say - but still just as delicious as the pork n roll. We came at a pretty busy time where the line was out the door. But they're service is fast and efficient! And the workers are amazingly welcoming and friendly
