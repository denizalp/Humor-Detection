Friendly service, samples available, clean, & great product!  Both ice cream & gelato is made on-site.\n\nRegular size, 2 flavours only, was $4 in a cup.  I *believe* cone was more expensive, but don't quote me on that.  The only thing that would've made it better was if you were able to get more flavours in the cup as in Europe.\n\nThe flavours that I chose (gelato - cherry & Tahitian Dark Chocolate) were both very good, so choose wisely!  ;)
