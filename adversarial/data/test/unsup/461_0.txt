If you love cocky pieces of crap that will try and rip you off and have no clue what there talking about .. I would highly recommend this place , If you want to go to a real Harley dealership with heart and soul and its family owned,  Buddy Stubbs is awesome I will never go anywhere else . Everyone there is really chill and incredibly knowledgeable and they actually treat you with respect ..
