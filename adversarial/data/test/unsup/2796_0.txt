On the way home from work yesterday, a friend wanted to meet up at America's Taco Shop for a snack & catch up conversation and chisme -- You know me, I'm all about good tacos & chisme! \n\nI ordered the Carne Asada Burrito -- delicious & full of flavors. Somethin' about the recipe they use for the carne asada alone makes it special. I look forward to returning -- now that it's cooler, outdoor seating will be ideal. Cheers***
