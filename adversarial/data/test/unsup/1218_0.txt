Stayed here for a girls trip for 3 nights and was not impressed. Basically you get what you pay for. The rooms cleanness should be better. I feel that you have to come in after the cleaning people and clean yourself. The hotel seems old and dated. They have a decent food court and a few restaurants but nothing crazy. It is also at one end of the strip.
