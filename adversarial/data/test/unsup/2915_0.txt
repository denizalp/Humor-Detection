Probably one of the best places to watch a movie on a Tuesday  afternoon after the opening weekend of a blockbuster release. \n\nNo line ups and you will get a good seat \n\nPrice is great and the popcorn is good.\n\nOnly downside is there is no service once you are in the cinema.\n\nUpside is there is no service once you are in the cinema  (no cellular phone going off).
