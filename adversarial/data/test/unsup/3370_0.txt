Getting a tattoo from an InkMaster.....in Vegas......what could be better? My wife and I decided to get some work done by Joey Hamilton. So far we have five new tattoos over the last two years between us and we can't wait until the next one.\nGreat shop, great staff, great time.  Working with Dexter is awesome! And watching football on the big screen,while getting tattooed is THE BEST!
