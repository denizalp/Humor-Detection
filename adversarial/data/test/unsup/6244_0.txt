This is the best place to bring your dog. They take the time to have your dog come for a couple hours prior to them being boarded overnight to ensure they're not aggressive. They are only crated during nap and at night, and the entire rest of the time they play outside in the enormous backyard. In the summer, they have shade, kitty pools, and sprinklers. Basically it's dog heaven and our dog freaks out with excitement when we pull into the parking lot.
