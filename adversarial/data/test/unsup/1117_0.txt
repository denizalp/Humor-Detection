I have no idea about accomodations \nso I cannot comment on the hotel rooms.  I can tell you that it is a nice venue for a party.\n\nWe went to a birthday party at the Holiday Inn Hotel located close to the airport in Montreal.  Had a great time!  Place looked good.  Staff was competent and professional.  Food was delicious (although I do not know if the hotel cooked the food or if it was catered by someplace ).\n\nBased on this experience, this hotel is a fine 3 star place.
