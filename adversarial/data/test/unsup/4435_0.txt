Outstanding service, quality staff!  Shantel did my hair on my wedding day. I couldn't have asked for a more perfect hairdo. My hair texture is fine and thin and Shantel was able to work it to make my hair look amazingly full. The outcome was exactly as I envisioned it.  Shantel knows hair and she did everything in her power to make my hair look perfect on my big day. \n\nIf you live in the Vegas area, go to the Kelly Cardenas salon and ask for Shantel. She will never let you leave the salon unsatisfied.
