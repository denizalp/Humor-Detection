I went to this circus today in Brea, CA and let me tell you please DO NOT waste your money!! They charge $25.00 to get in and then hassle you the entire show to purchase some of their crap light up toys. The show announcer must have said ladies and gentlemen boys and girls a thousand times and only fifty people were at the performance. The only performer that was impressive was the young acrobat. If your looking to get ripped off and annoyed then be my guest but I recommend spending your hard earned money elsewhere!!
