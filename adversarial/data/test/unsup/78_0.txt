I'm prohibiting myself from going back.  I mean, it's small, can become overcrowded and nothing spectacular.  I need more.....period.  If I'm going to spend my money on spirits and a good time I know me well enough to know this place isn't going to cut it.  \n\nBest thing about the place is the photo booth in the corner of the bar.  Congrats to the marketing team for putting it there.  Other than that....not impressed.
