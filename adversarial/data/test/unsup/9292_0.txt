My girlfriend brought this home while I was working on renovations. Pita is ok but nothing to write home about. The beef samosa was cold, not like it had cooled off on the drive home it wasn't even room temperature it had been in a fridge all night and it was not very good even after I cooked it up myself. For the price I've gotten better somosas that were freshly made that day.
