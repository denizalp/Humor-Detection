My husband and I visited the Wine Bar at Solaire and had a great time.  Wonderful place for drinks and the absolutely perfect place for a date night! Cozy, yet upscale atmosphere. The staff and owners are very welcoming and make you feel comfortable. We ordered an appetizer, Browned Queso Blanco, and it was amazing. This would be a perfect spot to rest after a day of shopping in Hudson at First and Main, or a great place to come with the girls. We will be back!!
