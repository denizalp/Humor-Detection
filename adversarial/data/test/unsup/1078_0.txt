Really good experience! After reading reviews, I was nervous to come, but we decided to come anyways because we had plans to meet a friend for dollar margaritas! Went on a week night, they had a decent bit of people inside so it was nice. Service was quick, dollar Rita's tasted really good and you can customize flavor for 25 cents! Can't beat the deal. We decided to eat and all ordered different burgers and fries. They were very filling, pink inside, meaty, and perfect! Very surprisingly happy with our visit. Will be back soon!
