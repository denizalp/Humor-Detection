Was here a while back with my uncle, aunt, and cousin. The place is located in the Cosmopolitan second floor and there is usually a line. I ordered their classic burger and it is definitely worth its price point. The burgers range from ~$14-45 but their milkshakes are a must have especially if you have a sweet tooth. We ordered an Oreo milkshake and it was the best milkshake I had ever had, it was packed with Oreos yet still didn't overwhelm the flavor of the milkshake itself. Don't underestimate the milkshakes as they are pretty big!
