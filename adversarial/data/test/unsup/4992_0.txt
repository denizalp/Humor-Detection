I went into this studio for the first time today to get a haircut and color.    It did not take long to get a seat and away we went.   I have very long and thick hair.   Most people hate dealing with it.   I found the studio to be clean, and very comfy.   The price was more than reasonable and it was a very friendly place to be.    I'll be back for sure.   If your in the neighborhood, stop in for a smile and a haircut.
