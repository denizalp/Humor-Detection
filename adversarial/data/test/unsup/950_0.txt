It was my first time, but definitely won't be my last.  Sparrow and Wolf is an amazing addition to our neighborhood!  The restaurant is beautiful with a great vibe, open kitchen, amazing menu, creative craft cocktails and a great wine selection.  I met Chef Brian, his wife Wendy and John whose also part owner! They've created something truly special and i can't wait to go back tomorrow night to have dinner!
