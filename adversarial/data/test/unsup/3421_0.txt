LP's new location is IMO central Phoenix's best mexican restaurant. It is what Tee Pee used to be. Just solid, somewhat pricey but solid sloppy mexican food at its finest. Everything is great, simple, basic, by the book, mexican food. I did not like how they would not allow me to take home a meal off the children's menu for my daughter, even though the rest of our order was well above $60 but I guess that is their policy. Other than that, and the lack of attractive female bartenders, is the only qualm I have with this place.
