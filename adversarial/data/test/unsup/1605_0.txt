All these great reviews, we were anxious to try it.  Got there about 5:45pm on a Friday night.  We get in the door and are greeted promptly (more like blocked from walking in more than 2 feet) with \"I'm sorry there's a private party tonight.\"  After silent staring at each other a bit, we turned to leave.  REALLY?  On a Friday night?  We won't be back.
