I had breakfast 2 days in a row here at Citizens during my work trade show at Mandalay Bay. My food was good, and I was able to order a special omelette with spinach. Our waitress was super nice and we even saw her the next day. They also have a nice outdoor dining as well as pastries and coffee to go. \n\nUntil then, be kind to one another and Cheers! ~ :p
