I finally got to try the Classic Burger at Wildfire, and, boy, was I impressed!\n\nThe burger contained fresh lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, and American Cheese, but no bacon, as I had requested.  Even without the bacon, it was an exceptional half-pound burger made medium-rare to order.  Juicy and delicious, along with very tasty shoestring-type Fries.  \n\nThe place was spartan but clean.  Requested extra napkins were never delivered.  Otherwise service was good.\n\nA 5-star burger!  4 stars overall!
