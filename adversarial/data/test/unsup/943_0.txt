Made reservation on Thursday for 6:00 pm Friday .. Told person taking reservation was for 62 birthday and wanted to be seated by window... For the view ... Was offered patio ... Declined... Told window seating would be fine. Arrived Friday @ 6:00 ... Hostess ... Confirmed reservation .. Even window seating... Then said wasn't available... As window seating was popular... But we could sit on patio ... Under heaters...or wait 20 to 30 minutes.. When said we were leaving .. Told we could pick from open seating... Bait and switch???... Incompetent hostess??... Result Happy Birthday!!! Never again!!!!
