Idk if this is common in most bike shops, but I was ignored as I walked in. Soon as a white dude came it, he was asked how he was doing and how he could be helped. \n\nI get this often. I'm a trans person of color and try to support places that not only include folks like me in the staff but at the very least notice we exist.  \n\nAll I wanted were some tubes.
