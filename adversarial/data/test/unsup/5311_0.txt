We got there late, and they couldnt find my reservation, due to a special character in my name, no biggie, Checkin was a breeze, the front desk was super so attentive, asked for a crib for my niece and when we got to the room it was already there, I absolutely love this hotel, there is a Starbucks inside of this hotel, double points for that.. I will be definitely be staying at this hotel again
