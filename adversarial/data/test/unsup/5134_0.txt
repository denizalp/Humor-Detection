Cafeteria \/  food court type of setup. You order from the counter and grab a table to eat. It did take about 10 minute for the food to be prepared but everything was made fresh. \n\n$11.95 for the chicken souvlaki meal which comes with rice, potatoes, salad and garlic bread. Everything tasted great. A decent amount of chicken and the meal overall was filling.
