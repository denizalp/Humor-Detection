Use the free yelp margarita!! Sooo good! I loved the vibe in here. Huge projector with music videos and really spacious industrial decor. I was so impressed with all of the vegetarian options. I ordered way too much but I'm not in Vegas often so I had to try as much as I could. Highly recommend! The hostess and servers were really nice.
