Aldo Coffee used to be at this location, and that was one of my favorite coffee houses, so I was disappointed when it closed. I need not have worried, as Orbis Caffe serves up some delicious coffee and treats, and the vibe is the same laid back, chillin' and comfy atmosphere as it ever was. Try the chocolate hazelnut biscotti...delicious.
