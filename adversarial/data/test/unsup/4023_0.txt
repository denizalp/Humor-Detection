Located in Cesar's Palace on the famous Las Vegas Strip. Ok so it's a little expensive, but the menu is quite inventive and everything is fresh (the fish and seafood is flown in daily). I recommend making reservations as it can get packed, but if you do have to wait, make sure to try a margarita or three at the bar. I should mention that the service is always great here. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!
