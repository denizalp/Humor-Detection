This was one of the nicest meals I've had the prime rib is great they carve it in front of you (kinda cool) you also get the famous spinning bowl salad also cool to watch,everything was great and the food was superb they do have a dress code so no shorts or shirts. The bartender was extremely knowledgable on the local beers which is a plus!
