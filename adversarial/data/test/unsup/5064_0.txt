The service was haphazard and the food only slightly better. Our server was friendly but just not very competent.  Our salads arrived after the main course.  We had the surf and turf.  The lobsters were good, but the filet was a disaster.  Round 1 looked like it was run over by something and burnt.  McDonald's hamburgers were thicker.  Round 2 the steak was red and cold.  I would make reservations at one of the other establishments in the Strip.
