After a long night in Vegas and not eating dinner yet...I was STARVING! And this Sonic is open 24 hours and is located right across from the Palms. So we had the taxi drop us off at Sonic. \n\nI'm giving it 5 stars because:\n\n* It's open 24 hours\n* The guy who brought out our food was super nice and friendly\n* The cheese tots make for great drunk food\n* The frito pies make for great drunk food\n* The popcorn chicken make for great drunk food\n\nPlus it's cheap...after spending all my money at the bars, this place just hits the spot!
