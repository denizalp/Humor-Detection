I've read a lot and heard a lot of good things about polished. I went as a walk in but it wasn't a good idea. They're really busy but they were really nice trying to accommodate me. I made an appointment and love stormi! She's awesome with designs I have another appointment set up in 2 weeks before I leave to California (:
