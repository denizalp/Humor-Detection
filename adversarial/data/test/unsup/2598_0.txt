I don't understand why this place gets so many bad reviews. Maybe people had one bad experience but hey, nobody's perfect. We ordered the pterodactyl, a pepperoni pizza, and breadsticks. The food was delicious. And that's saying a lot because I was accidentally 1 hour late to pick up my order. And it was still pretty damn good! Much better than other local pizza places. I'll definitely order again.
