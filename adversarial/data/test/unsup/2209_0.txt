I tried to edit my review from last time. Not sure it worked. But the management made it right. She sent us a $50 gift card so we would come try it again. We did today and had a wonderful experience. \n\nWe ordered: crab Rangoon (tasty), Massuman, and chicken and broccoli with peanut sauce. My kids got chicken and broccoli over flat noodles. We loved everything! I'm really wishing I would have gotten the green curry. I will for sure go back and am glad Tara took the time to make it up to us!
