This is my favorite bakery which is run by an outstanding family. Honestly everything I have tried is excellent. Their sugar cookies and cinnamon rolls are second to none!  I always buy several loaves of bread and freeze what I'm not using, they always taste just as well once thawed. The decor is warm and inviting and their staff is cheerful and helpful. I would go here everyday if I could!
