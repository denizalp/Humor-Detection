At first you wonder what the hell these little things are... you then bite into them and realize who cares... because they're delicious! I order them from DoorDash and it's here under 30 min, you can't go wrong. Soooooo yummy. The #11 is prolly my favorite. So easy and basic yet amazing. I've only had the breakfast ones tho, I need to go for lunch soon!
