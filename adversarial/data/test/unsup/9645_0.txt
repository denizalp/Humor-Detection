One dive bar to rule them all.....\n\nSeriously, this place is the definition of a dive but on the flipside it's some of the best grub I have had in a bar, the staff is really nice and they have pretty decent shows. I am a fan. \nTip: There is a hidden bathroom behind the pool hall that doesn't smell of death.\n\nI saw nothing.
