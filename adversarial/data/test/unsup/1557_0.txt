Terrible customer service! There were at least 4 employees working while their store had perhaps 3 customers and none of them greeted us or even acknowledged our presence. Some of the employees walked right past me and acted like I was in there way when I was looking at an item. I've never been to a Kirkland's with bad customer service until today. Makes me want to never step foot in a Kirkland's again.\n\nOh and the potpourri smell in there is so strong. I kept sneezing because of the overwhelming smell.
