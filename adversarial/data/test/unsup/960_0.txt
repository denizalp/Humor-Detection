Let me start out by saying that Sephora is every girl's dreamland...well those that care to look good anyways.\n\nThe sephora on bloor street is really the BEST in Toronto. It is an independent store, not in a crowded mall, and you always feel zen in there. It's never too crowded and the staff are super helpful. They always give you samples when you ask and won't bother you. \n\nYes, sephora has good brands and it is not cheap, but would you cheap out on your face?
