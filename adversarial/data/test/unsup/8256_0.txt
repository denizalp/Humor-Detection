Terrible KFC. They have gotten my order wrong 5\/6 times and once charged my husband THREE TIMES for the same meal. That was a mess to figure out. It's been a while so we thought we'd try it again this evening. They didn't put one of my sides in the bag AGAIN. I will not ever be patronizing this KFC. Stay away if you want your food given to you correctly!
