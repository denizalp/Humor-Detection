Decent airport with an easy to get through security. The line for the rental car shuttle can be very long so give yourself some extra time. There actually is a liquor sore in the airport out of security. Wow only in Vegas. If you get there early you can always gamble. Not the greatest food options but a few. I expected better from Vegas.
