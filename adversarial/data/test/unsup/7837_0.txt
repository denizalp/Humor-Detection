I actually, finally created an account with Yelp just to warn people about Crackers? Firstly, the food wasn't bad. Not great and definitely took forever but quality wise it was okay. The service was ridiculously horrible. The waiter was rude, the Manager lady was terrible, they sure didn't screen employees very well. Could use a complete makeover! Won't return and hope others will take warning..
