Patti knows how to talk to a real guy.  She listens, asks questions to ensure she has the right idea, and those eyes pick up on nuances when I answer.  \nThen, in less than two weeks, I have to plan 3-4 dates.   Busy is good!  \nAfter a year of online no-shows, being \"quippy\" and \"humorous\" and all that other crap, Patti and VVI are telling me the rules of dates, and making me dates that are compatible with me and my wants.   \n \nAn IN PERSON matchmaker is the only way to get on the road to relationship success.
