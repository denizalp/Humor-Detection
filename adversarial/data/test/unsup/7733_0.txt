With all the technology the bakery cannot take payment over the phone for a cake order. I am far away and will be coming to town for a party and can not pick up the cake until the day of the party. This is very inconvenient and I will not be using them I will be going to Albertson's or Safeway. TOO BAD WALAMRT!!!
