Wasted my time while my cat sat in his crate for 3 hours. \nI called to drop off my cat before work, so I confirmed he would be done by a certain time. When I came to get him, they hadn't even started, & when I asked why he wasn't ready...the girl replied \"nobody told me\"...like not her problem.\nThank you for wasting time, driving back n forth across town for nothing before my workday, plus you know how cats love car rides. I won't be returning.
