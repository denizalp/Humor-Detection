Love this place! The food is fresh and all homemade and the husband, wife duo offer amazing customer service!! We eat here almost once a week. We like to order the donair plate. Our two year old son eats the food too and absolutely loves it. The plate is very large and filling and is full of veggies and meat! The taste is amazing as well. Highly recommended. Best Mediterranean in Toronto hands down!
