Overall great prices and quality coins!!!. Only problem I have unfortunately is with Don (coin dealer)!! Very rude guy and always gives an attitude when trying to purchase the merchandise. He gets annoyed too easily and I don't recommend dealing with him!! Overall, Tom is awesome!!! Definitely recommend this coin company !!!:) but stay away from Don if you can!!
