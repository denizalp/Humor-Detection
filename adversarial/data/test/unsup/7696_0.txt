Excellent hotel. Loved the set up and the full kitchen.  Place was clean and the bed was comfortable expect i could have used firmer pillows.  \n\nThis place is locted right behind the Hyatt and in a good location,  close to the freeway and Starbucks.  \n\nThe staff was warm and welcoming.  They do charge a deposit when you check in just as an fyi. They also serve a hot breakfast every morning and it's pretty decent.  I would have also liked some sausages but overall not disappointed.  \n\nI would definitely stay here again.  Loved the price,  location and the service.
