Slow service but when she did come around the server was way too involved in our dinner.\n\nI live in the neighbourhood so twice I have met a date there for a drink after work. Different dates. \n\nOur server recognized me and went on and on about how she had served us the week prior. Even after I dismissed it and tried to laugh it off, she insisted she had served the two of us the week before. I'm sure you can imagine my date wasn't too impressed.
