I dropped in for a few  a few weekends ago for a beer and a bite, which  happened to be Az biker week.\n Even with it being busy I still got great personal service. I ended up staying longer than planned and had a great time and made a few new friends ;) what can I say I do like a nice motorcycle and there were some absolutely beautiful customs there..
