I liked this place if I wanted to take my mom to a \"fancy\" Mexican place. Small and quaint. Had the seafood Chile relleno... It wasn't the best pairing of tastes. The pulled pork was really good tho! I'd say overpriced when you can get better Mexican food around Phoenix. Fuego Cantina, its sister restaurant, is better priced.
