The manager at DD Tom was nice enough to host our high school special education students. He answered everyone's questions and was really patient with our students. My students loved the experience that he had available. We all received a detailed tour of the small spaces DD. After students were able to decorate there very own donut. As you may imagine how eager my students were and the hands on experience was just what they needed.
