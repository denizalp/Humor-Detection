First time visit and will not be my last. After Kabuki was closed at Tivoli Village, I made a visit to the one and only Kabuki here in Las Vegas. Today I matched my Ninja Deluxe lunch with a delicious Dragon Roll and you shall never forget to drink something with your food, my choice was a Mai Tai. Location is good, inside and outside seating area. Clean restaurant and friendly service. Very satisfied.
