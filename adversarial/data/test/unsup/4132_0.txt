This location is visually seductive.\n\nTheir version of the vegetable spring rolls, hot & sour soup. Mandarin kung pao and fried Rice are successes, no question about it.\n\nThe Vegi rolls are bright, aromatic, spicy, sweet. An impressive cold appetizer.  \n\nThe hot & sour authentic soup is essentially an ancient doctor's curative healing magic combined with taste.\n\nMandarin kung pao a super familiar dish that delivers if you eat the peppers. And the fried rice, a basic godsend.\n\nMy expectations are met.
