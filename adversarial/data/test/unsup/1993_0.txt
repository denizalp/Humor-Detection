This place is pretty good. They have a really amazing evening special of a pizza with a 32 ounce beer for a reasonable price, which is what I always get. Even better, they offer a vegan cheese which is a bit lacking in favour, but has all the meltiness of dairy cheese. The space is pretty big and has plenty of room for  big groups. Would definitely recommend.
