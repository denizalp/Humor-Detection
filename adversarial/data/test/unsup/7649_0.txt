Pros\nSuper Cheap 7.00 \nQuick and Easy\nCons \nEverything Else food is beyond fatty and greasy everything deep fried. Definitely felt my heart hurt after a little of the meal\nFried Chicken kind of tasty\nBanana Egg rolls actually the bomb amazingly good\nIll never go back but glad I tried. My friend said if he was in the area and dying of hunger and happened to be right next to it he would try it again.\nLots of sketchy mystery meat
