La Pinata has moved and it's for the better!  Their new location is so much nicer than the old location!  Not that I minded the old location, it's just that this new location rocks.  The interior is nice, and they have an even nicer patio to enjoy the last of the remaining temperate days.\n\nThe menu is just as good as the old menu; I might have noticed a few changes, but not a lot.  The food is still spot on, just in a more appealing environment.\n\nCheck them out, you won't be disappointed!  JM
