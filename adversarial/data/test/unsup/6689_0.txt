The WORST experience with internet and customer service so far. They know they have a law where it's really only them or Cox and both treat you like shit, but Cox at least works better and notifies you when they up their prices. Century just disconnects you and makes you wait 7-9 days to get it back after charging you $200 in late fees. Yup. If that sounds good to you, go for it.
