I would rate them 3.5 now.  Since my original review this lounge has been discovered by the masses and is now overcrowded almost becoming uncomfortable.  The lounge isn't that large and with all the people actually gets a bit warm.\n\nI would now compare it to a swanky Starbucks where you essentially have to hunt down a place to sit and unwind.  The Vegas airport isn't that bad and serves as a descent alternative.\n\nAMEX needs to address this.
