Great food, great service, great dinner. Very pricey but knew that before we chose this place. My wife's King Crab dish was so so, but this is a steakhouse. Our server Sasha was the perfect amount of attentiveness without hovering. Bread was nice and warm. Steak was cooked perfect and seasoned nicely, although no sauces such as Bearnaise were mentioned. Sasha treated my wife to dessert for our anniversary which was a nice touch. We will be going back to try the bar menu soon!
