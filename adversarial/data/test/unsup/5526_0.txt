There is a reason why you will probably have to wait for a table.  The place is very good!  The service was prompt, and unlike some others we never felt rushed.  Our order was delivered accurately (5 of us), and all at the same time.  Absolutely no complaints.  I don't usually give 5 stars, but Butterfields is close.
