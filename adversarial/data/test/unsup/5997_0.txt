Trying to put on airs in Cleveland.\n\nWe went here on the advice of a local friend who described it as a \"speak easy\".  First of all it's not.  It's just a regular, way overpriced, rather non-descript bar with couches.  The only thing of character is their fabulous drink menu -- which is fabulous.  However, they charge $18 per drink.  That is just stupid.  More than anywhere in Manhattan, more than anywhere South Beach, more than anywhere on the planet.  And I'm at some dopey little place in Cleveland?  This place is stupid.
