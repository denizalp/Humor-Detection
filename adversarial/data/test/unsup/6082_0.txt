Got in late and all the other restaurants at the Hilton were an hour wait (1 star for all of you!!). I guess it really wasn't that late...   No wait in Paradise for a lonely guy.  They had Octoberfest going on so got Wienerschnitzel with sauerkraut and potato pancakes.  It was fine.  The hostess was awesome and served me a couple of times at the bar area.  Breakfast tomorrow - paradise.
