My husband and I took his parents here for brunch on a Saturday morning.  All in all, it was a positive experience.  When we arrived we didn't feel like we were in Phoenix!\n\nThe pros:\n-The staff was really friendly and helpful\n-The food was delicious \n-The patio is dog friendly\n-We didn't wait long for a table\n\nThe cons:\n-I am not sure how I feel about the self-serve beverages \n-While most of the staff we met were friendly, our server seemed rushed and frustrated\n\n\nOverall it was a good experience and I would go again.
