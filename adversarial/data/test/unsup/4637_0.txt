0 stars doesn't exist? This place deserves none. DESERVES TO CLOSE DOWN. Disgusting,  run down, nasty restaurant (not in a good way). Makes you wait 1h30 for a dry mexi burger & fries?! Complained to the hipster \"manager\" (probably from the Plateau?...) Didn't make us pay a cent. Definitely didn't give a penny to our doofus, brain dead, pot smoking, \"don't give a f**k\" attitude, slob of a waiter (not worthy of being called a server).\nNever again.\nLook at my pics of this disgusting place.\nStay away...don't bring your children! \n3 Amigos is better than this.
