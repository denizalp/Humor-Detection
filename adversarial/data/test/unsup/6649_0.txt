Its never a good sign that when you are drunk, and the food tastes bad.  If Patrick, H is correct and this is the best pizza in Pittsburgh, this is just plain sad.\n\nGreasy, slow and expensive. It filled the void, but that is all I'll enjoy.\n\nI agree with the old comedy bit that pizza is like sex and even bad pizza is still good.  Consider waking up, rolling over, seeing someone there and saying OH GOD WHAT DID I DO LAST NIGHT? Yep, that's Pizza Sola.
