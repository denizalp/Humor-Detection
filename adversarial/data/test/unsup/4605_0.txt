When I heard that they were opening a Nordstrom Rack in Town and Country I was jumping for joy. :) So,  I finally went to the new Rack at Town and Country last night.  When I walked in the store I was like WOW this store is huge and well organized.  \n\nSara the cashier that checked me out was super friendly to me and we ended up talking for a couple of minutes too.  I will definitely be coming by to the Rack at Town and Country.
