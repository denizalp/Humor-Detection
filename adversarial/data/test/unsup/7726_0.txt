If I'm looking for quick, decent Italian food, Mama Roberto's is one of Mentor's better options. The garlic knots are pretty good, the salad is ok, and the portions are huge. They offer a pretty large menu, so there's something for everyone. Service is usually pretty good,although sometimes standoffish.
