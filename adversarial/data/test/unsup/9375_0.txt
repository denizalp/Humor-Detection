Centurion Lounges are all nice and this one does not disappoint, either.\n\nThere are the signature components like the fully-stocked hip bar, healthy spread of hearty food options, non-alcoholic beverage bar, swanky decor throughout.\n\nI think it's good that this place has a great flow and at least the time I visited, wasn't too crowded.\n\nLocation by Gate D1 is pretty central also.
