Love this place! Good hearty food, great service, friendly and quick.  \n\nI'm a breakfast freak, so give me a good size omlete, side of fruit( when I'm being healthy) and some sour dough toast and I'm happy. \n\nThe servers are always smiling amd friendly, the service is always swift, food served hot of the grill, and refills come swift. \n\nWe've been coming here for years and the food is always consistant. Reasonable prices, good location for us!
