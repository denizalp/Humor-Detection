I always park here because they validate your ticket for two hours of free parking if you spend a minimum of $25 in the mall.  Drop by the LCBO, pick up come groceries, get something from Indigo,... If you can get stuff done, you have a solid 1.5 hours to walk around on Bloor or through Yorkville.  There you have it. That's a solid tip and review. You're welcome.
