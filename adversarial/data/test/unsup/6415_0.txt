Pros:  service, view and interior decor.  Cons:  food and price.   We asked for a salad, which was just OK.   For the rest, we went with chef recommend items.  The lobster curry which was bland and lobster was tasteless.  The $70 steak, which was also just OK.  It is definitely not worth your money.
