The ONLY reason to visit this place is to collect material for a comedy sketch about obnoxious coffee shop baristas. It's literally that bad. Hey buddy, I've worked at two indie coffee shops and know how to roast my own beans, so please skip the lecture about the sin of adding milk or sugar to my $4.50 drip coffee. Also, please stock half and half. The milk you threw my way in disgust just made your very diluted cold brew gray. How does this place stay in business?
