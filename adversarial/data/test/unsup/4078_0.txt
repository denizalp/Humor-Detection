Far fancier in style and atmosphere than I had expected from the menu or the, quite reasonable, prices.  There's a valet and everything, and it gets insanely crowded.  At 5 pm I was told there was only one table for 3 before 9 pm, and they don't take reservations for groups that small.\n\nFortunately we got served, and the food was entirely decent, but nothing to rave for.  I had a tamale plate, the main course of which was larger and less brick-like than most of the tamales I've actually had in New Mexico.
