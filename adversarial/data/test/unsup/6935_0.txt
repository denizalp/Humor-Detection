Great activity for a cold and crappy pittsburgh Saturday. Had a coupon which I got for submitting my email. It was worth it, buy a game and get a game. I still have my yelp coupon too for checking in which I will use next time. Busy when we got there around 1030 or so and the crowd thinned considerably. And, oh yeah, I beat my hubby...2 games to 1. Tee hee! :)
