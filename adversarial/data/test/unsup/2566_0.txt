Very good lowkey neighborhood spot. They have fruit smoothies, tea, boba, and soft serve. I got a fruit smoothie and it tastes super natural and has a good balanced flavor. Very minimal decor\/seating, but it doesnt really need it because you go in and then leave with your drink.  Pretty average prices. Located in the shopping center next to Albertsons.
