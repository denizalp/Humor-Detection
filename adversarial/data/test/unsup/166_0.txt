I have purchased (2) Accords at Tempe Honda and both experiences were very pleasant. No hard sales and I feel a friendship with both sales people. Art sold me my 2017 Accord Sport and I highly recommend him. When I am there for service I always feel that I am in good hands. For a one stop car dealership I give them an A+.
