If I had a dog or a kid, I would totally bring either or both here!    This is a cool little park built up on a mound on the edge of downtown.  It's easily accessible from the Don River Trail.  There are plenty of swings and climbing rocks for the kids.  The best part is the slides!  They have a couple of cool as heck slides.  If it wouldn't have looked weird, I totally would have gone down the big one.\n\nThis is gorgeous!
