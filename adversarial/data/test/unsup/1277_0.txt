What could I possibly say that hasn't already been said? The STRIP is THE place to be when in Vegas for all things fun! Walk around and enjoy all of the food, drink, music, shopping, shows, bright lights, incredible buildings, street entertainers, the Bellagio fountains, FANTASTIC people watching...all the while with a beer or cocktail in each hand of course!\n\nThe Strip offers all of the Sinful Goodness that makes Las Vegas what it is!\n\nIf you're looking for a quiet getaway...stay away! Vegas is not for you baby! Viva....vivaaa...Las Veeeeegaas!!!
