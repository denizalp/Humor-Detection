This is one of my favorite, go to places.   Let's get real ,it's a franchise folks!  I was here after a high school basketball game. Great glass of Cabernet and 1\/2 price appetizers.  I caught up with an old friend. We laughed and talked for 2 hours, Jenna our  waitress couldn't have been more accommodating.  The appetizers came out, fast , hot and quite delicious. Try the fried ,fresh, green beans. they were  surprisingly delectable.  They have simple, inexpensive food that is served in a neighborhood setting.  What more could you want?
