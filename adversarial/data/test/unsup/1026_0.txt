I've now visited Starlight Nails & Spa twice and have been EXTREMELY happy each time. If you want the best pedicure you've ever had - ask for Tom! He gave me an amazing massage and put up with my squirmy self for almost an hour.\n\nThe second trip I had Jenny and got a shellac manicure. Tiffany blue with a silver ring finger. GORGEOUS. They have so many different options for shellac nail polish! It was hard to choose! :)
