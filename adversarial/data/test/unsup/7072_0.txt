Confused with all the bad reviews? One of my favorite restaurants at Aria. If you prefer rolls drenched with sauce and fried tempura rolls then this is not the place for you. If you appreciate good sushi, this place is amazing! Tried the uni, toro, salmon roe, and salmon nigiri - we loved every piece. Also loves the wagyu udon and jalape√±o roll. Great service by Mayu and great ambience, restaurant is very open and modern.
