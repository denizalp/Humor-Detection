We came here because the bellboy at our hotel recommended it and they \"bought\" our first round of drinks.  The girls here were alright but not that friendly and they were barely putting on a show worth watching.  We stayed about 10 minutes then moved on to someplace else.  It was a big waste of $30 and time.
