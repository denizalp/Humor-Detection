I just like the way the place smells. Maybe the olfactory response is linked to the wood floors, the lighting, the displays and the old world charm. But this girl isn't just beautiful she has brains. The staff is incredibly smart and helpful. They initiate contact, ask how they can help and then they deliver in a way I can understand. This is a neighborhood gem that must never disappear.
