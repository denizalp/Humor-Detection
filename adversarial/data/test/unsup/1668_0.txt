I never write reviews but we felt like we had to for this place. Food was awful for the price. 60 bucks for a Burnt burger with burnt bacon and buns, stale fries, wedge salad had one tiny piece of lettuce, the nachos were all cheese and soggy mushy chips. Marsala had zero flavor and the chicken was over cooked and dry. Please upgrade your kitchen staff along with your new menu.
