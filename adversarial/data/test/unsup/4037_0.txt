Food was good, never would have known this place if it was not for Michael on help. We ate around 2pm today and I am not hungry at all. Bathroom was clean that is a plus in my book. We got a dozen empanadas to go. Only down side for us was no tea or non sugar drinks, but I did have mango juice and it was delicious. Blink and you will miss this place just follow the directions on yelp. I LOVE YELP.
