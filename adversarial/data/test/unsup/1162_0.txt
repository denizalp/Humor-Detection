My lady is hot... My lady is HOTTER in her new pair of Oliver Goldsmith sunglasses!!! \n\nThanks to the staff at Framed Ewe for helping me choose the perfect birthday gift! The selection here is fantastic, so it really helps to have an expert help to choose the perfect pair!\n\nNot to mention how good it feels to shop local!  Definitely one of the best additions to Union at the Biltmore!
