I've only gone here only once but my experience of it was awesome! First thing you'll notice is a huge menu of drinks and various cafe foods and snacks and for an inexpensive price! \n\nIt may seem wrong to go to a coffee shop, not order coffee, and then give it 5 stars...BUT what I did order was amazing! I decided on the goat cheese sun dried tomato wrap and it was only $3! It tasted wonderful and the vibe of this place is super comfortable and hip. Will definitely be back to try the coffee and pastries!
