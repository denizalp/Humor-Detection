I've been called the Best Boy, but never the Best Buy. Maybe I should start selling myself so that can change.\n\nLast time I was with my queen in Cleveland we stayed at the motel right across from here. The next day, we stopped by to get a headphone splitter and some other goodies, and they had what I needed. \n\nTypically high prices but I'm not complaining. No literally I'm not complaining. I was just stating it for the record. Get over it.
