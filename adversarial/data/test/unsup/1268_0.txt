I have the complete opposite experience with this company.  They were recommended by my insurance person, after experiencing a water problem.  The insurance guy said they were fast, and he wasn't kidding! They are thorough, courteous, conscientious and clean up after themselves completely.  I even asked them to help me with a few other little things I needed done, and they did, no questions asked, no extra money.  \nGiving respect begets respect, I guess.
