Very comfortable, welcoming neighborhood spot. Nothing particularly unique about the menu but the food is affordable and consistently quick and yummy.  The blueberry granola are the kind of pancakes that don't need syrup, bacon's crispy, hash browns are just right.  But the service is the best part.  A bunch of total sweethearts at Melrose Kitchen.
