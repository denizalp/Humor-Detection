Yummy donuts and speedy friendly service. Picked up a few donuts for some kids at my child's school who were great little helpers.  Who doesn't love a soft chewy chocolate donut with sprinkles?\n\nNice big KKD factory with windows to see the donuts being made!\n\n$1 donuts, $7.99 for a dozen, not the cheapest but at least they're sweet and tasty.
