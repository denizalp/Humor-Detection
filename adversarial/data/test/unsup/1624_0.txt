Most if not all 7-Eleven stores in Las Vegas have slot machines.  Must be a nice moneymaker for the business.  This particular branch, I believe, has 4 of the one armed bandits.\n\nWell, I wasn't here to gamble.  Just needed gasoline and a snack.  Store looked fine both inside and out.  Merchandise was well stocked and organized.  The hot food was fresh and tasty.  Service was good.\n\nNo complaints, and I'll probably be dropping by regularly whenever my wife wants to shop at the outlet mall across the street.
