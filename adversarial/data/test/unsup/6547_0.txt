I was really hungry and it was getting late at night so I stopped by here because I was craving sushi. They were having an end-of-the-day sale (30% off) and I got the sushi combo 3 which came to being about $11. I found it still pricey with the discount but at that time I was really hungry. The sushi itself was okay, I ate it for the sake of eating but I would not buy this at the regular price.
