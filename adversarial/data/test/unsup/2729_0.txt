Very bizarre person and show. A lot of videos and he spent little time on stage in comparison for the show. The side show was better but not worth the 150+ we spent for two rows off the stage. If you want to see it get the cheap seats and they will probably be much better. He uses some pyrotechnics which can hurt your eyes that close in front. I would not waste my money on him again  go see anything else.
