Best indoor soccer place I've ever played at.  The fields are nice and large and doesn't smell like some other indoor places I've been to.   I love playing here but I've never understood why we have to pay ref fees every week on top of our team registration fees.  They should just add it into our team registration fee.  It feels a little shady like we are paying the ref under the table.
