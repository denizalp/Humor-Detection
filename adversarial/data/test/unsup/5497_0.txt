My wife said to me before the show started, \"I hope it's funny and not just dirty.\"  Well needless to say all the comedians either talked about pot and\/or their penis.  In the case of the girl comedian, she talked about pot and wanting to have a penis.  \nI have seen comedy in many places.  Worst show ever.  We left before the show was over.  Oh by the way, no air down in the dungeon.  36 degrees Celsius at least.
