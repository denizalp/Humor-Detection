SO good! We were going to go to The Persian Room but there was a 20 minute wait. We really felt like Mediterranean food and I remembered that this place was close to opening. We took a chance and luckily they were open! Very similar menu to Persian Room, but not as robust of course, with some smaller options like wraps. Very fairly priced, considering the quality of the food was close to Persian Room, but half the price! We will be coming back.
