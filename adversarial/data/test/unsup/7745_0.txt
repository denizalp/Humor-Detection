Gimmicky, glitzy place. No way...in Vegas?...kidding?! \n\nBut I digress. \n\nThe food sucks. Nothing special, and overpriced. Of course the decor is novel and the sounds are obnoxious and maybe scary, so it's a theme that loudly announces itself if you're into that. \n\nSince I've been, you don't have to. Skip it.
