They had a previous review removed because they didn't like that I called them out for profiting on selling nazi memorabilia. Enough said.  I personally went to this store and was browsing around for some football merchandise. I was appalled that I walked into what was a nazi section and I was shocked. I asked what the deal was and they said it isn't against their policy to sell any merchandise that there is a demand for. This place profits from selling items from the Third Reich. Don't shop here.
