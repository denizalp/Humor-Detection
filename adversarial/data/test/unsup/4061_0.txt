I was super impressed with the professional attitude these men showed. Kim was excellent and very informative in our classroom time. Once we we were out on the range their was no bs. I felt safe out there and my instructor Aaron was awesome. Took the time to show me what I needed to know. I would recommend this class to everyone. No nonsense but you will learn what you need to know.\nThanks guys for a great experience
