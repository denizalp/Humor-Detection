God this hike is dreadful. It's so boring. The terain is boring. The view is boring. This is an easy walk, wouldn't call this a hike. The few times I've done it (both clockwise and counter clockwise) I've been swindled into going with my friend and her dog (who is old and small) so if he can handle the 6 mile loop, you know what that says. There are so many hikes to do out here that are way more fun and a better workout.
