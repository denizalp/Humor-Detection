I love the simplicity here, the d√©cor, the menu, the staff - clean cut and to the point.  I come here with a wine drinker so I usually get wine too.  I think they have a great selection of reasonably priced wines that are also good quality.  The restrooms are fun.... walking up\/down to them when you've had a few cocktails and you're wearing heels, not so much.
