Very disappointingly refused to honour a voucher bid on at a charity auction because it had a 6 month expiry date which I hadn't noticed. Even after explaining I had been in hospital for some time, no accommodation was made, and no suggestion of a discount or option to use towards something else.\nPoor customer service and fairly uncharitable!\nWon't be using them or recommending any time soon!
