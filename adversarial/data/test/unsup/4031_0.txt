I got hurt because I was holding a 50lb box, and I slipped in a puddle of oil and tore my ACL in the warehouse I was working at. Mr. Wilmur fought against this large corporation (I will leave the name out for legal reasons) and got me full benefits. This really helped me and my family stay on my feet during my recovery. I recommended at least speaking with him if you think that there is a possibility that you are being cheated out of your benefits.
