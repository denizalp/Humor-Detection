I'm automatically in favor of any place that offers extra food for free--the day we went, our server brought us an order of fried bananas for dessert on the house.  The friends I went with go often, and apparently this is pretty common for this place.  The food was tasty and the portions large, but I don't think the food was particularly exceptional.
