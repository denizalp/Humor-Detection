I mean...do you have to leave a review when you have a photo of a cockroach in your bathroom? They spend so much on making the outside look awesome to attract tourists, but the inside is outdated , dark and dreary. The beds are mid-evil torture, and the cockroach just topped it all off. It is worth spending a little more, or spend a little less and be near Fremont, but skip this one.
