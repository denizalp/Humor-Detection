Dr. Castre was a very professional and easy going dentist to work with. She understood my needs and offered her expertise and recommendations. The facility is very modern and I felt that they are practicing dentistry in a modern environment and tools. The staff at dentists of Scottsdale were extremely helpful and friendly. They were able to explain all aspects between appointments, billing and follow ups. \n\nHighly recommended
