Saint Joseph's Oratory of Mount Royal is a Roman Catholic minor basilica and national shrine on Mount Royal's Westmount Summit in Montreal, Quebec. \nThis is the first contemporary Basilica I have visited. Very interesting architecture and gardens.\nIt is Canada's largest church. Its dome is the third-largest of its kind in the world after Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome. In 1924, the construction of the basilica of Saint Joseph's Oratory was commenced; it was finally completed in 1967.\nAlso a great gift shop here.
