TFC is on tv! \n\nI'm not used to the Cebu style Filipino food. Not necessarily my taste. Everything was very flavorful.  I like how they serve some items on the banana leaf.  They were very kind to offer us a free item for us to try.  \n\nI did like the lechon. \n\nThey have a lunch menu. Don't pass that up if you arrive before 3pm.
