Decided to get some take out from Maing Wok based on some recommendations from friends. Ordered crab rangoon, sweet and sour chicken, and General tso's chicken around 6 PM on a Sunday. Everything was terrible. The entire meal looked and tasted like it had been sitting out all day. The food had clearly been microwaved. There was no other patrons and no cars in the parking lot. The person behind the counter was more interested in the DVD she was watching than getting my order ready. With all of the takeout options I highly doubt we'll be back.
