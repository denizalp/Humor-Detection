Worst bar service in town.  Completely ignored while waiting to order a drink at the bar, finally served a drink like I was an annoyance.  Picked up the glass which had sticky fingerprints all over it, asked for a new glass which was equally as dirty.  Place was cute, has potential, but will never go back, too many good choices with much better service and clean glassware.
