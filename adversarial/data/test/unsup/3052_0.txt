Popped in as they were closing. Associate knew the exact color I was looking for and took me to the slab yard to have a better look. \n\nThe following day I came in. Everyone was super helpful and patient.  They lifted out every slab of granite I wanted to look at with the machine. I took my precious time and they were extremely accommodating.  Chose two slabs for my kitchen counters for them to hold for my contractor.  Also went home with some samples to make sure I made the right choice.
