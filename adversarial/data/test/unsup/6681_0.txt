We came here for brunch.  Got a veggie skillet and it was delicious, asparagus, spinach, goat cheese.  Came with sour dough bread and flat circular potatoes.  Everything was delicious.  The skillet was great, but I feel like the omelets were bigger so if you are hungrier, get an omellete.  Treated ourselves to a mimosa kit, 4 types of juices and a bottle.  \n\nCon:  valet parking.  why can't i park my own car for brunch? It is complimentary but a bit annoying.
