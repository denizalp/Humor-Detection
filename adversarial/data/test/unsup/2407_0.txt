The chicken is to die for and with all those sauces, you can relish in them. Cole slaw is just perfect in the amount of mayo. As for the fries and toast, they're fine. But those chicken tenders, which I'm pretty sure are cooked to order since both times I went to the drive through I waited probably around 8 minutes each time, are amaze-balls.
