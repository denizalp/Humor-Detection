Friendly smiling faces here!  This is my mother in law's favorite store. We were shopping all day and she asked me specifically to help her find this store.  It's conveniently located on the first floor near Macy's.\n\nLots of well made coordinating clothes for all sizes but a different system here. If you wear a size 8 you would wear a size 2 here.  They'll help you out. It's a range system.  If you're a 14 and over you wear a size 3.  They have half sizes too. Great jewelry and great service:)
