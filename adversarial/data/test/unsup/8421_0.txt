I have been here twice now as the places closer to mountains edge were not up to par.  \n\nBoth times I came, Chris did my gel manicure. Both times I have been super happy.  I have been able to wait four to five weeks between visits and nails still look great.  The nail shaping turned out great and I love the colors .\n\nThe staff is really friendly and professional. Everything is very clean. This will definitely be my go to place
