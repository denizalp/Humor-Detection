I have been dining at various Lawry's for years and the LV venue does not disappoint. Traditional, elegant and the food is just perfection. I suggest signing up for their club card as the rewards add up swiftly and come in very handy when you eat here as often as I do. \n\n(My only complaint is the way the patrons choose to dress when they come here. Sloppy and disheveled:( This is a top-light classy establishment so, please have some dignity and show respect for the business itself. )
