Dinner buffet....HORRID!!!  Only thing that was descent about this buffet was the soda.  Thank goodness we did not have to pay.  I would caution anyone about eating here, especially if you have to pay for it.  Everything I sampled was disgusting or had some strange taste, like the melted cheese for nachos.  How do you mess up melted cheese?  Oh wait, the carnitas taco that you make yourself were tolerable....but everything else was so disappointing.  If I were given passes again I would throw them away, I wouldn't even torture someone by giving them away.  Spare yourself!!!
