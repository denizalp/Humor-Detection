The outside a 3*\n\nThe inside a 4*\n\nThe service 5*\n\nThe food a 6* Oh wait it only goes to 5. \n\nI had the pulled pork and a side of dirty rice. TT2 does what the other BBQ joints have not. He uses a really good bun instead of a hamburger bun. The pork was great with goof flavor and the sauce was good. \n\nThe rice might have been my favorite part of the meal. \n\nWish they had Mt Dew!
