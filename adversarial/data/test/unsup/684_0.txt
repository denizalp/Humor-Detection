Took some time for someone to get to our table.  I think there was some confusion with the host getting us a server.  AJ walked by and realized we hadn't been helped and quickly stepped in and took over our table (note this wasn't in his section)  He did a great job taking care of us and turned our first experience at nacho daddy around.  The food came out and was excellent, the tostada nacho platter was bomb!  We will definitely be returning
