This place is my all time favourite Chinese food place. The seafood is so fresh and prepared do well. You can see the tanks that they keep there seafood in and see these they take good care of there stuff. I've been here multiple times and have tried multiple things but I think the best dishes they have is the house style crab and the house style oysters. Both of them are spicy and fried and oh so delicious.
