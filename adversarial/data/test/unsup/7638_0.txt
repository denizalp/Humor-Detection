This is the worst, most expensive dry cleaners you could ever find. My clothes came back dirty, I don't even think they were cleaned, just pressed and popped into a bag. You would think for the money that they must do a wonderful job, I guess not.\n\nI only came here because they were close and it was convenient for me, but I learned that convenience isn't the key.
