Primanti's is what it is, a place to take out-of-towners to give them a taste of Pittsburgh food. I'm not impressed with most of their food (the fries have no flavor whatsoever!), but the chili is very good - spicy and tasty. There's nothing special about this location, but at least it's connected to the bar around front, so you can eat your food there and watch the game or socialize.
