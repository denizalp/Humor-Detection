Where do the reviewers come from?\n\nOrdered Chicken Parm carry out.  $16 and some change.  Not exactly cheap.\n\nDefinitely nothing homemade about this.  Absolutely frozen breaded chicken patties.  Severe let down.\n\nCould be the worst chicken parm I've ever had.  And this was at the end of a 14 hour shift so I was good and hungry and would have eaten nearly anything.\n\nI've been largely disappointed by almost all of the \"authentic Italian\" places around Cleveland, and this is  no different.  There is absolutely nothing authentic about grabbing some frozen patties, and throwing some sauce and cheese on top.\n\nGet your act together!
