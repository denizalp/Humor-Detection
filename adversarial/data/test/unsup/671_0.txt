Was looking to exchange an unopened game which I received as a birthday present. However, upon showing the game to the merchant (a chubby asian looking lady) I was rudely told that they were unable to exchange games from Wal-Mart and that they couldn't do anything for me. I understand she couldn't do anything for me but in the way she handled herself, I felt necessary to write a review. Game Stop is known for having trolls working for them...
