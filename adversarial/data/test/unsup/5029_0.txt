I'm not frugal or ashamed ... at times ... I'm just damn cheap. \n\nYou will not believe what items you can grab for one dollar when name brands and 3rd world child labor is involved. Viva capitalism! \n\nToday, I battled mutants and spent $30 on VHS tapes, DVDs, backup tools (like a hammer and screwdriver) and disposable toys (Beware.are of the painted lollies, though)
