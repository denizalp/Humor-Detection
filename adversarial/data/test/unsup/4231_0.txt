This Staples is a nice little store off of Central and Osborn in mid-town phoenix.  I go to this Staples for work all the time.  \n\nI really like coming to this Staples.  First of all it is near my work, and second of all it they are very helpful and friendly.  \n\nIf you are ever in Staples and need help you should ask for Ernie.  He will help you find whatever you are looking for.
