Wow! I was looking to see if there were going to be any shows here this summer only to discover that the TTMA has closed down permanently after the end of last year's concert season. From what I read, a soccer stadium is being built in its stead for the Pittsburgh Riverhounds. \n\nMy last show here was Dream Theater with Trivium. *sigh*  Memories...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XpFeQDfivi0\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=z18mPEeUOQA
