When you step in a restaurant and you know you are going to hate the experience but you've got a groupon... That is what happened here. \n\nFirst of all, the nightclub loud music made it impossible to enjoy ourselves. The server did not seem to enjoy her work at all. \n\nThe food was ok at best.\n\nAnd the last straw was the ladies room where the stalls were so small that the doors were unable to open completely. I had to climb on the toilet in order to get it. Awful experience!
