A new low for any mom and pop stores. Exemplary for when one shouldn't open up a restaurant. The kitchen was filthy as were all the kitchen equipment.There was so many things wrong with this place that I will only put a synopsis\n\nFood was horrible.\nManagement and service was terrible.\nNo health inspection score posted and the kitchen and establishment reflects it.\nMy new comparisons for all restaurants will be \"is it worse than New China?\"\n\nI would recommend this place to all my enemies or to people looking for cheap explosive enemas.
