This place is awesome!   I will never go anywhere else for a haircut, highlights, etc.  Lydia is amazing, and the rest of the staff is so nice. I have finally found someone, after 10 years of Iiving in the area, that can give me a great haircut that looks good AFTER I go home to shampoo and style it. And such a natural looking highlight!  Thanks!!!!!
