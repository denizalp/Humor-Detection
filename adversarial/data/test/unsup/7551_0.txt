Do NOT order the CHEESESTEAK!  Do NOT order the CHEESESTEAK.   It basically hamburger patty sitting in hot water all day.   Get either the pastrami, cornbeef or roast beef.  The cornbeed is my fav especially with an egg\n\nAs a footnote DO NOT ORDER THE CHEESESTEAK!!!!!   Don't be fooled by the #2 seller label!
