I was happy to find this place since it's reasonably priced and I felt comfortable during my haircut. As a guy, I don't need much done, but when I do get a haircut I want it to look good! \n\nI strongly recommend that anyone new to Madison check out HAIR. Be certain to call ahead to make an appointment (I got in the next day) before you get all dolled up to get your hair did.
