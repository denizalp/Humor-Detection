This fun little place has wobbly tables and can be way too packed during the lunch rush. That said, if you want a tasty cheap meal in the area you can't do much better than varsity. The service is polite and efficient but I don't think they ever wipe the tables down. In conclusion cute lunch place but not a go to for a fancy meal.
