So this is a mall, which contains lots off mall-ish stuff. It's super clean and that is important and sometimes overlooked. There are lots of stores and pretty much whatever you need. When at the mall I instantly question why I didn't just order this crap using Amazon prime, but then I see the pretzel stand and I have my answer. \n\nPretzels. It's always pretzels.
