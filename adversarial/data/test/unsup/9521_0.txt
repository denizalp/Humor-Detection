Very good Lebanese food!  I get the Chicken Kabab plate with Tabouleh and it is always great.  Chicken never over cooked and spiced just right.  The Tabouleh is also excellent with not too much Bulgur Wheat in it (I don't like it when they do that!).  I also hear the Chicken Shawarma is excellent. They don't skimp on the portions either, they are huge!  I highly recommend Green Corner if you like Lebanese food!
