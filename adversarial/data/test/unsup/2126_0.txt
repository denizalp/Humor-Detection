Excellent nail salon!  I am just visiting the Phoenix area and really needed my nails done after helping my brother move.  Yelp reviews directed me to this salon. The owners; Kimmy & Tim, both took such great care to assure that my nails were beautiful! They are both so personable and kept us entertained while they took care of us. Salon is clean and sanitary, and I would definitely come here again.
