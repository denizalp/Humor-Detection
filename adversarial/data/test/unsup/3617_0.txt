Sadly \"Big Jim\" poorly represents the company. I was excited to do vinyl lettering on my vehicle to start my business and while waiting for the lettering to come in, I came into the funds for a vehicle wrap. I went back 6 days after paying to upgrade the order and he had never processed my request for vinyl lettering and was rude to me so I got a refund and took my business elsewhere.
