Eh whatever it is another stupid night club.  The music is good and if you follow them on fb you can avoid the kid nights and the crappy djs you hate.  It is really cool inside and posh.  Dress sophisticated.  Chicks get in for free (at least the half dozen times i have been there) but dudes can expect to pay $20 a piece.
