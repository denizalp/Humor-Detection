Delicious, no frills food. Service was quick and friendly, everything tasted got and fresh and the value is amazing. For around $25 two of us got soup, a main dish, drinks, and dessert and everything was pretty good. The place is not the nicest but it's clean and the servers were prompt and for the most part running around, working hard to clear dishes and bring you your food as soon as it's ready. Will definitely return with my family.
