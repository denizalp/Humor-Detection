This is where you go when you want to feel New York Posh.....full-on dark mahogany fancy decor inside. You won't feel like you're in Phoenix. It's reputation as one of the country's best steak houses is well deserved with outstanding cuts of beef and succulent seafood. The prime rib sandwiches during happy hour are a plus as is the complimentary valey parking. But be sure to dress appropriately and bring as much pretense and Biltmore snobbery as you can. After all, you have to play the part....so enjoy it!
