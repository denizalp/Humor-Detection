This little taco truck is great! \n\nThe tostadas are perfect, just right amount of toppings so you can hold in your hand and they stay crunchy and have lots of flavor. Variety of great salsa I use every drop. \n\nIt's just a taco truck but the price and quality and nice staff easily earn 5 stars from me. \n\nThey stay open tell 2am on most days. Check them out.
