I wasn't happy with the results or the increased prices at the Southern Highlands groomer I had been going to so I thought I would  try Elite for my long coated toy Yorkie.  So happy I did!  She listened to what I wanted  and gave my guy a great grooming at a reasonable price.  I am definitely coming back!!!!
