A while back I in error put a negative review for Per Spectacles which was a misunderstanding on my part. I have since removed it and want to,say that we were treated with the utmost courtesy and were completely satisfied with their prices and services.  My wife had this poor experience with a different company and I by mistake chose the wrong company to blame.  Please accept my apologies.  We will do business with you again.\nJ, Cappello
