Extremely Horrible Customer Service! Doesn't acknowledge you the Both times I was in here, first time by owner who had no clients at all. Second guy stated he didn't want to interrupt my 2 min phone conversation but after I was off phone, just stared at me for 2-3 mins without a simple \"hello. Can i help you?\" Again, no clients & he's the \"GM.\" I felt discriminated against both times. Addressed it & they simply denied. Would NOT recommend this place! Guaranteed cheaper prices\/better selection & better service at \"Lock n Load\" or \"New Frontier Armory.\"
