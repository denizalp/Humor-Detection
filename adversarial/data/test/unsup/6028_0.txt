Server lady was super nice and attentive. The atmosphere is wonderfully decorative matching southwestern style. \nFood is sub par. Needs a lot of salt. The Sopapillas were lifeless and soggy. Everything lacked flavor. Had the stacked enchiladas with chicken and a beef stuffed Sopapilla, and a cup of green chili stew. Meals come with a basket of Sopapillas and chips and salsa. I don't recommend.
