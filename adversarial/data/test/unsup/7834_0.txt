A former Popeyes chicken establishment, they've been able to retain the same type of crispiness and taste (mild and spicy!) that I was hoping wouldn't change.   It's the place for my once-in-a-long-while over indulgence for good ol' fried chicken!\n\nThe service is at par with fast food places, I've never ate-in but have only done pick up.  The location is accessible but it's close to Markville mall so sometimes traffic can get busy.  \n\nI'd go back again ... and again. lol.
