We went here with a large group of taco enthusiasts. The Salt+Lime tag line should be: \"tacos for old white people who think everything is the greatest thing they've ever had.\"\n\nFor future old white people interested in trying the tacos here, I've prepared a translation table for their menu:\n\nBarbacoa = pot roast\nAl Pastor = sweet and sour pulled pork\nRoasted corn = sweet corn mush\nCarne asada = burnt steak\nMole = not mole\n\nNone of us will be returning customers. Good luck with this place...
