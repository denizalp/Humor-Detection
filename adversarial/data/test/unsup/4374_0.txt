Great deal for the sheer amount of clubs attended. However, I did not get the full experience, and let this stand as a lesson to all who go to Vegas: DO NOT walk into the crawl already intoxicated. This happened to my group and we were all turned down simply because one of us was deemed too drunk to go into the club. Also, make sure you are on the bus early because it will leave you.\n\nI hope to try again, hopefully with a more responsible crew this time around...
