Nice park!  It seems huge-- wish I had more than fifteen minutes to have a look around.  I hope to visit again soon, take a few pictures, and perhaps update to four stars...  I didn't chance upon the lake that is pictured on the photos here...  Like I said, this park is huge!  And from the short time I spent there, it was very clean, too.
