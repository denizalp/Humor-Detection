I came here on a busy Saturday night on a date. They donot accept reservations. We were seated in a quaint waiting area\/patio in the back. it had a fire place and nice decor. We were seated rather quickly for how busy the place was. Inside is extremely noisy. that is my only complaint. otherwise, the food is decent and all shareable. Our favorite was the green bean tempura and edamame appetizer. upstairs had an outdoor bar as well. I'm not sure that I would come back, but definitely glad that I went!
