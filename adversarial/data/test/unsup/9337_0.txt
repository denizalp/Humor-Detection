I have now dined at this diner 4 times and I have not been disappointed a single time! Their staff has always been friendly, the service is quick, and the food is absolutely delicious! The prices are very reasonable and the portion sizes are quite filling. I thoroughly enjoy their comfort food and will continue to visit.
