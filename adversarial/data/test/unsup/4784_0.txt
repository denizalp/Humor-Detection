I was so excited to get my Zombie Apocalypse gear that I took a long drive from summerlin to this place.... got out on my wheelchair..... and then got up to the front entrance and discovered the ramp was WAY TOO STEEP to fuckin climb!! I was pissed to say the least ..... Got back  in my Mustang and left with out a thing in hand. \n\nWith ADA laws and this place catering to vets they should level out the ramp going into the store!! Oh well ....guess the Zombies are gonna have at it with me now....   X(~
