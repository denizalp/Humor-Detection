I had free pizza today as part of their opening day celebration! Apparently the first 10 customers that came in received free pizza for a year. Everyone else that came in today received free pizza for the day.\n\nThe best free pizza I've ever had. They have unusual sauces there: Spicy sriracha sauce. Olive oil drizzle. Pesto drizzle. BBQ bourbon - so much yum!\n\nHow does 1000 degrees compare to mod pizza or pieology? It's right up there with the greats. Fast casual, customizable pizza is extremely popular right now. 1000 degrees is honoring this new trend most excellently.
