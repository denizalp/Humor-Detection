I love checking this place out. Although its close to us, we rarely drop by because of other similar stores with similar items with a little more variety(HomeGoods, Rocket Fizz, International Marketplace, etc.)\n\nI'm always in the kitchen\/foods section of the store because I never know what cool stuff I may find. I saw authentic Paella Pans from Spain, and am so happy that CPWM carries them again...Paella party for sure when the weather gets warmer!...ALOHA!!!\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(8\/100) \"Paella Party!\"
