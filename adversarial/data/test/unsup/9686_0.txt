Ani wrote about how she was fooled by all the great reviews and I absolutely agree although I did have a suspicion. I wasn't wowed by the location to begin with. Then the service was absolutely awful to the point the manager came out and offered us free dessert. It was a great gesture but the experience was already frustrating. The food was fine but nothing more than three stars.
