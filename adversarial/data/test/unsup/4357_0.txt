Think twice before hiring these guys!!! they did a horrible job on my floors and claimed they were going to patch all crack and make repairs where ever needed. The patch work they did do is so bad and I am embarressed with what has been left of my floors! After spending nearly 3000.00 I may have to lay tile or hardwood to cover up...
