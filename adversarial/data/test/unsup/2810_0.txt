I have never been so disrespected. I had been going to this karaoke night for 5 years and the owner said that because I'm not ordering as many drinks as usual the DJ was told not to allow my songs to play. They are also racist because they play country songs to filter out the \"black people\" when as they describe \"it gets too dark\" I will never spend another dime in that drug infested racist place!
