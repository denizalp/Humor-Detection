I have been here a few dozen times over the years. My favorite part of their menu is breakfast. It's perfectly cooked and the portions are huge. If you have your card handy some options cost less from 11pm -6am. I am so impressed with their fluffy pancakes that I am no longer taking Mom to other breakfast restaurants. \n\nI stopped coming here for dinner once I discovered The Oyster Bar next door. However, they serve a good deal during lunch and dinner too. The staff here are super nice and friendly. I hope you give them a try.
