What a great pool to lounge in! The shark tank was beautiful to look at and fun to swim around. The water slide was really neat too. More than enough lounge chairs available and even some in the water that was really nice! Would def like to come back! (should also note: I came here in the month of August during the week and it wasn't over crowded at all).
