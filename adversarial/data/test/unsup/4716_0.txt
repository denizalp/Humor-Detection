I found another Jimmy John's in the area.....I'm addicted to their Subs....sooo good.  Of course, I order my usual #9 Italian Club w\/Hot Peppers, $5.50.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/UdoRqx5AYhhGBH9GGtUZ7w?select=ym9uaNFNqiVqdTUFGht8sw\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/UdoRqx5AYhhGBH9GGtUZ7w?select=cnXDJkcZ2-4ikvr3W-lHOQ\n\nThis place is as fast and consistent with the quality of their Sandwiches as any other location.  I like how it's right off the 101 and Raintree, very easy to get to.  I'll be back soon.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%
