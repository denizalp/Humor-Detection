Best Thai food I've ever had. We ordered the chicken pad thai, the pri khing, and the crab noodles. Everything was delicious and VERY flavorful. If you like spicy, order a two and you can always make it more spicy... when they say their 3 is spicy, they mean it!\n\nThe chicken satay was excellent as well. The family that owns Krachai has a lot of pride in their food and takes their time preparing carefully. They were so kind, and that made the experience even better!
