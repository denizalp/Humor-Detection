So we had reservations for 930 on a Friday night and were seated immediately upon our arrival. The (almost all-male)staff were attentive, informative and friendly. \n\nOur meal:\n\n-Edamame with shaved seasalt\n-Sashimi yellowtail with miso and jalapeno (yummmmy, Bobby's favorite)\n-Black cod in lettuce cups with filo flakes (my favorite, so perfect)\n-Sashimi with garlic chips (little too salty)\n-Salmon sushi\n-Toro sushi (very tasty fish)\n-Dessert: edamame icecream atop a brownsugar brownie,Caramel sauce, and tiny sliver of decadent brittle...the icecream scoop was so tiny that we really couldn't taste the edamame. \n\nA super treat for sushi, but be prepared to spend money!!
