I've been going here for over 13 years.  I have never once been disappointed. Everything is always fresh and made exactly how I order it.  The service is very friendly and the food is delicious. If you go at anytime other than the traditional lunch time and order fish tacos, the fish is fried fresh for you.  I'll take Zabas over Chipotle ANY DAY!
