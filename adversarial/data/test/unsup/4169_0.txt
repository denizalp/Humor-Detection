After a year in Houston we moved back to Charlotte and thankfully they had a townhouse available for my family. The entire staff from Manger to Maintenance Techs are always friendly, professional and accommodating. The property is clean and quiet and convenient to everything including interstates. My kids and I are looking forward to the pool and our dog loves the dog park.
