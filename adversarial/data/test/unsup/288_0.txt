What a great airport!  I live in Vegas and do a lot of traveling.  McCarran really is one of the best airports in the country.  Here's what I think about the airport:\n\nPros\n- FREE WiFi\n- Good selection of restaurants\n- Easy to get in\/out\n- Easy to get a cab, limo, or bus\n- Logical layout\n- Security lines move quickly despite being very long\n- You can gamble while you wait for your flight\n- International gates are very convenient to get in\/out\n\nCons\n- Shopping is sub-par compared to other airports\n- International flights are in a separate area\n\nI love our airport, can you tell?
