Went there today and got some new sights installed. Very friendly staff , extremely knowledgable, and overall helpful. The man who installed my sights (the gunsmith I presume) let me look at the sights and told me about each. The other gentleman gave me some helpful advice as well. Overall I had a good experience and recommend others come here for any help.
