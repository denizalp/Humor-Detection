I always have to make a stop at kenzo every time i come to dt toronto. Their broth is very tasty and their noodles are cooked just right - the tonkatsu ramen is my go-to item every time i come here. The gyoza dumplings are huge and basically a meal in itself. Only thing i dont like is that their tables are wayyy too close together :(
