Went here to watch the Raptorsget knocked out of the playoffs (boo)\n\nGood atmosphere for the game, not too busy and was able to get a booth. Food was really good and you got a hell of a lot for what you're paying. Pints are pretty cheap for this area too.\n\nAlso fell in love with the asian server working there! Will be back to try get her number and if that fails then more cheap food\/drink will be had!
