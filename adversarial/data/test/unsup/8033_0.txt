I always stop here before I spend my hard earn money on hookers, gambling, boose and buffets.. and SO SHOULD YOU.\n\nThey call the ice cream here custard. I was always confused which is what but there is no doubt in my mind that this is a must visit if you are in Vegas. Just a little bit off of the strip and new OG (olympic gardens strip club.. for the guys).
