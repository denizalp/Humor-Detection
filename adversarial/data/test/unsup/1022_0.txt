I drive 7 miles out of the way and past several other pizza places just to get pizza from avon zeppies. The staff is very friendly and polite.....that's the main reason I go there! \nPrices are reasonable. My order is always ready on time. \nFood is fresh and pizza is loaded end to end with toppings! The home made salted chips are one of my favorite items on the menu!!!
