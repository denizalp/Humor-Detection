I went here for a bachelor\/bachelorette party.  Although the girls didn't get to see any of the men in action, the sight of my friend getting double teamed by two strippers was well worth it.  (His wife-to-be sitting right next to him, natch.)\n\nFYI to the Ladies - the men don't take the stage until after 11PM.  We got bored and decided to head to the Palms, instead\n\nFYI to the Men - get 2 strippers at once, but I'm sure you already knew that. =)
