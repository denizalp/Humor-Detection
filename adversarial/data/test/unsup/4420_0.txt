This place is okay at best. Good to come here when all the other places on main are fully booked. It's your typical bar with a decent kitchen. \n\nThe food is good. But definitely overpriced for what it is.. But that's the norm on main. So it's expected. \n\nFrench fries are decently good. \n\nBe forewarned their menu is very very limited. Also, avoid the patio, it's as if they don't give a crap about it. Old peeling wood, broken umbrellas, horrendous foul smelling pond. Not what I want to see and smell when I'm hungry for food.
