They are the worst property management company I have ever dealt with! I have 11 months left on my lease and it's going to be hell!! I moved in to a house that was not ready to move in to. I waited 4 days till I got a new water heater and am still waiting for my dish washer to be repaired. I get the run around on everything. They have to ask the \"owner\". I'm so frustrated I want to tell the world!! Do not use them if you are a owner, nor should you rent from them!!
