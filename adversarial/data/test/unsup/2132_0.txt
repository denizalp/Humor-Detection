I went in to pick up a package from UPS and was taken aback by this little spot.   A travel agent, passport photos, Sears depot, shipping services, coconut water in bulk and what is this?!  Farm fresh eggs?  I was seriously expecting a frame store.  I've lived around there for years and had no idea what this place was all about.    it was like a teeny little strip mall (for ANTS!) all in one shop
