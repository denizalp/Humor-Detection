I have the darnedest time figuring out the differences between the Hill-stone, Houston's, and this place.  Evidently some of the subtlest market positioning ever is taking place at their corporate headquarters.\n\nHaving said that, I like the place.  The cornbread is the stuff of legend, a modern day manna if you will.  Just read every other review.  Also, the way they roast their chicken is top notch.  I believe 3 of my favorite dishes there feature it.  Great American dining, even if it's hard to distinguish this place from a Houston's.
