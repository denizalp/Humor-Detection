During her first visit to Pittsburgh, my sister stated that she had never been to a museum.  Knowing she wasn't artsy or super into history, I decided to take her to the Sports Musuem inside the Heinz History Center.\n\nIt is a great idea for someone who has never been to a museum before (and is over the age of 15).  For under 15, try the Carnegie Science Center
