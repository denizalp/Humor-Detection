Delicious and honest Thai food in a relaxed and unpretentious atmosphere. Whileâ€‹the presentation is thoughtful and pleasing, it doesn't overshadow the actual food which is fresh and flavourful. Starters are great for sharing tapas style and might be better than the entrees which while well prepared, and fairly standard Thai restaurant fare. Smoothie and iced tea options are very good as well. We were too full to try any desserts but they sounded good.
