1st- What a weird lay out.\n\n 2nd- Is that a meat cutter on the bar? (I had a lot to drink) \n\n 3rd-I heard the bathrooms are cool-but never made it that far.\n\n  Basically, I am not sure how I feel about this place.\n  We only had one drink and did not eat.\n  It was Pub Crawl so I will forgive our waiter for the 20+min wait for our\n  drink... \n   \n  Summary~I will go back.(if for no other reason than to check the  bathroom out!)
