My family and I have been here many times and loved it for over a year now. However the last visit we made, the service was terrible, the portions were smaller for increased prices and they charged us for chips and salsa. She said the 2nd serving of chips is always additional money. Mind you, there were 5 of us that went...our family size never changed. We spend an average of $60-$75 on each visit. Due to these changes, our family will no longer be visiting Anaya's.
