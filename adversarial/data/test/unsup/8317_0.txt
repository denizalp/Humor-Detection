This office is absolutely amazing. I had searched around for a place I could get adult braces without having to spend too much or wear them too long. Dr. Van Sluyter was the answer! After 5 months of correcting my teeth, my braces are now off and the results are amazing. Not only am I pleased with the my treatment but I am very happy with the staff. Everyone is friendly and helpful. It is a small office that offers very personable customer service which I love. I will be switching over for my routine cleanings moving forward.
