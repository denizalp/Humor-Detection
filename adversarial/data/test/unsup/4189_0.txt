The tram will save your feet from extra walking and from the heat outside. The access points are kind of hidden in the casinos\/hotels but you just have to follow the signs. Most of them are in the back of the hotels so it does take some walking to get to it. It's a bit shaky but like a typical monorail.\n\nThe tram runs from 8am - 4am. It goes from Monte Carlo to Crystals and then to the Bellagio. It's 2 minutes and 31 seconds one way! Save yourself from the heat and your feet!
