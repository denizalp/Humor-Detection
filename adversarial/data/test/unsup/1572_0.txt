Beautiful facilities!  Clean, spacious, and modern.\n\nThe main room is large and has ultra-high ceilings.  \n\nInfrared sauna is available for use.  \n\nAll the staff I've interacted with have been extremely friendly and welcoming.  \n\nThere's a huge range of classes for all levels throughout each  day of the week.\n\nThis is definitely the best studio I've visited in the downtown core.\n\nNote:  Lockers in the front are small so really they're just for your wallet, phone, and keys.  You can check your coat with the staff at the front.
