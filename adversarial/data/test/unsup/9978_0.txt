I just went to the open house with free classes advertised on their website.   I drove a half hour to find a run down studio, with door open and lights on but no one there.  This was well over an hour after the start of the first class and before the one I was going to.  I wandered throughout the building and not a soul was there. So I left through the back and got locked out behind the building. Of course I left.
