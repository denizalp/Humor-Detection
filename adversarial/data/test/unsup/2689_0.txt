Long time patron of this establishment.   The service can be hit-or-miss at times, however there is great food and prices to be had here.  Their steaks are very good.  Maybe not the best in the city, but well worth the $15-20 price range for a rib-eye or top sirloin.  I was craving a decent steak house in Centennial Hills, and this place fit the bill.  We will return, again and again.
