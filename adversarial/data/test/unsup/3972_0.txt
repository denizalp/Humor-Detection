One their specials is Chicken Fried steak.  It was not a special on 9\/15\/17 and I asked my server Darla if I could get it anyway.  The manager said yes!.  It was fantastic. great gravy too!.  My service was excellent and the Mango tea was awesome. However there was no Mango coffee (joke between Darla and me) .  I love that they come from a place of yes for their customers.  And the check process was fast and convenient.
