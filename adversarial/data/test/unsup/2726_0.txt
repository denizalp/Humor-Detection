If you're at the Cosmopolitan hotel and youre looking for a sweet treat,  you need to stop by Milk. Their soft serve is incredibly delicious- not too sweet. They are a little pricey for such a small portion, but that's to be expected.  I didn't get a chance to try out their other items on the menu... at one point, I was tempted to buy their cookies to bring home since I was only in Vegas for vacation. But if I do return to Vegas in the near future,  I'll definitely be back.
