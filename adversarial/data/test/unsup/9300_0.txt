Don't let this company push you into signing any contract until you look at all the other options out there. When we changed our mind they charged us a fee for canceling and offered a credit. The credit could only be used for future work....knowing we were no longer interested in paying 11,000 to put an overlay on our existing cabinets. Not to mention they wouldn't even honor a coupon in the Home Mag. Terrible customer service.
