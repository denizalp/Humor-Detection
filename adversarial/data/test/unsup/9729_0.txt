It's a tradition of mine to stop by every time I'm in Vegas!  If you don't want to try the expensive food next door, you can come here to and also grab a slice of pizza at Secret Pizza or eat at Eggslut!\n\nMy go-to is the Cereal Milk Soft Serve!  The mild saltiness in it was perfect, and I love the smooth texture of the soft serve!  Get the crack pie too if you want something sweet!
