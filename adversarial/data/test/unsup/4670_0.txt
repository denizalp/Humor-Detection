Hollie nails and spa is a clean, spacious setting. Nice music playing and a big screen tv. John did a good job on my pedicure. The chairs and tables look new. Very comfortable, updated pedicure chairs. Prices are about the same as other salons in this area. This salon is close to my house so I will be back!!
