In my opinion if the restaurant has \"Pho\" as the first word in its mane, it should be their signature dish. So that's what I recommend here. I went there with my three friends. Four of us had several appetizers and each a bowl of pho. After trying I can say that the pho was fine for sure, but the appetizers were not so good. They were flavorless and didn't have enough spices that make Vietnamese food special. The atmosphere was standard but clean. The prices were not high. Overall, not bad...
