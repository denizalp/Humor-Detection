Made appointment online Thursday they can't get her until Monday...not really 911 right?\n\nI give him my cc on Friday and stayed home all day Monday.\n\nHe finally calls me back at 3pm after I left messages asking where they are.......\n\nOh my truck JUST now broke down.\n\nNOPE, I do not want these people on my property. Unprofessional and rude.
