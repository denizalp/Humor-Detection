This review is for their Super Bowl.. ahem Big Game Party. We queued up with others waiting in line and immediately became aware that we were surrounded by Pats' fans. \n\nOnce inside we secured a table with our new buds. Two big screen TVs and a great sound system allowed us to enjoy this exciting game. Service was wonderful and the bar food was reasonably priced. There were giveaways, cash, throughout the game and beyond. Oh, and the wrong team won but a good time was had by all.
