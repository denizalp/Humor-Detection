Had a great time here! We did the Lab! WOW! It was a little difficult with just two of us, but the guys at the front desk gave us a little extra help. I liked that there were twist and turns you did not expect. So glad we did the late one because we had the room to ourselves. We didnt make it out, we missed it by 1 clue! I cant wait to go back and try another room!
