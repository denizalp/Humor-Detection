Me and my ex went here with no real expectations at the end of the school year, and I'm a harsh food critic. But if you like burgers, if you like bars, if you like happy (yes I said happy, not fun, not a good time, but the actual feeling of being happy) then this is your place! Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had in my life. The choice selection is superb. I just wished it was bigger.... something my ex wishes also wishes a lot.
