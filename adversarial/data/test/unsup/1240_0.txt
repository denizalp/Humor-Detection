The menu is great, and the portions are generous. It seems that no matter what time you go, the bar is already full - which means, to me, that this place is \"happening\".\nInteresting cocktails and helpful, attentive staff - except the one time it was important! (We couldn't seem to get our waiter' attention.)\nIt's a bit loud in there, but if you can deal with that, it's a great, mid-priced, consistent spot to have dinner. \nI go even if I'm alone, because I love their pasta.\nEnjoy!
