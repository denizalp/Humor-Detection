highlight of my trip to vegas. some of the best sushi (and food, in general) i've ever had, after living in new york and san francisco. chef takashi is funny, humble, and clearly loves what he does - offering delicious, honest food to his customers. was a wonderful and memorable dining experience, would fly to vegas again just to eat at takashi!
