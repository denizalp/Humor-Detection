Have been leaving message for a MONTH now, trying to get an appointment at one of their offices. I keep being told that the person who answers the phone can't make appointments, and being transferred to a voicemail box. NO ONE has called me back to make a basic appointment.  I already had the referred submitted by my primary doc, and now I have to pick a new doctor and program. WTH is wrong with this place?!
