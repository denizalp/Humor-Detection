Heading east to Firefly in Dover, my girlfriend and I decided to stop at Melt -- I've heard, read, and seen a lot about Melt via social media and on television, so I wasn't going in here blind, but with high hopes and my fingers crossed.\n\nI can say that Melt, for the most part, delivered.\n\nWalking in, the place is cozy in appearances and also in size. The aesthetic reminds me of Stella's in Grand Rapids in Michigan ... okay, I'm going to guess 99.7% of anyone reading this doesn't know what that means. It just has a very nostalgic vibe to it with a few arcade machines and cartoons playing on many of the TVs. My first impression is good.\n\nAfter being seated, we were greeted by one of the most kick ass waiters ever, Dave. He was helpful in going over the menu, was knowledgeable about what was on the beer menu and the city of Cleveland, and was just all-around very helpful.\n\nMy girlfriend opted for the chicken and waffle grilled cheese and I went for the chorizo and potato grilled cheese. My girlfriend's sandwich was ridiculous -- I wish I had taken a picture. It was an absolute monster, and is unlikely to fit in most normal human's mouth. We had pictured a filet of chicken breast between two waffles, but nah -- Melt puts the waffle between the bread. \n\nNow, good things tend to come in small packages, but this is an exception. Incredibly crispy, tender, and juicy chicken, a delicious raisin-filled waffle, a subtle spicy sriracha kick, and a little bit of sweet maple syrup on the side to dip or pour at your leisure. This truly was one of the better sandwiches I've ever had -- my two criticisms are minor. One would be that with all the bread, it's a bit dense... especially because of the waffle. My second would be that for being a grilled cheese, the cheese seems to be an afterthought on this bad boy. Regardless of that, this is most definitely a sandwich worthy of a purchase or two or seven.\n\nMy sandwich was a little less jaw dropping, unfortunately, mainly because the filling in my chorizo potato grilled cheese wasn't all that ample when compared to the thick bread on my sandwich. The flavor itself was good, but there was a little too much bread. Also, I feel like this sandwich was a little dense as well... in this case, a little more filling or, better yet, some sort of sauce would have been great.\n\nThe fries were pretty decent, but not fantastic. They came out a bit cold and a little on the soggy side, but the flavor was there. I love fries with skins still on them.\n\nI'm no doubt nit-picking with my score, because the service and chicken and waffle sandwich were both top notch, but the fries and the chorizo and potato grilled cheese aren't something I'd likely re-order -- especially with a menu of grilled cheeses as extensive as Melt's.\n\nIf you're craving something greasy and cheesy that will make you feel a little remorseful after finishing it, Melt has you covered. I will most definitely come back.
