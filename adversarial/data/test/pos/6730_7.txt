Was super early for a meeting so I popped in here to grab a solo bite. The beer list is impressive. They didn't have my first choice and they didn't have my usual (Bud Light Lime) so I got something that sounded cool. \n\nI noticed a woman looking at me from across the bar. She was older but wearing white pants (Summer). I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with a side salad. Salad has too much dressing.\n\nAnyway this woman won't stop looking over so I'm flexing my muscles just a little bit when I pick up my phone \/ took a bite of sandwich etc. I glanced over a few times but turned away when she looked.\n\nBar is cool. Chairs are comfortable. Old timey kinda vibe. This older woman also had that kinda vibe and it was a vibe I was very much into. But alas, I looked at my phone and was late for my meeting. I was way to much of a coward to talk to her.\n\nGreat service. She looked like her name could have been Sonia.
