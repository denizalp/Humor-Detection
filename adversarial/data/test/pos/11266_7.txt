Do you like bodily fluids? How about giant needles?\n\nIf you answered \"yes\" to one or both of these, then this is the place for you. Here's a list of why this should be the only place you ever donate blood again:\n\n1. Bonnie - she's the best\n2. Infinite powerades (doesn't even matter that I prefer gatorade)\n3. snacks on snacks on snacks\n4. phenomenal phlebotomists\n5. did I mention BONNIE?!\n\nThe first time I gave blood here I threw up right in the big comfy chair I was sitting in. They still let me come back and now I'm a veteran donor. Blood, platelets, RBC's - you name it, they've taken it from me and I wouldn't give anywhere else. UBS Airpark for life.
