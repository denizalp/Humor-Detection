Upon arrival, it seemed KDK had a good selection and variety of vehicles, but the customer service was sleazy, rude, and insulting. The Sales Manager, John Cirner, said hello to me as he went to use the restroom, and came out ~15 seconds later and did not approach me to introduce himself and attempt to shake hands (Thankfully he didn't) He asked what he can help me with and I said I would like to test drive some of the cars on his lot, and began to ask questions about getting pre-approved. I asked if John was trying to run my credit with a hard\/soft pull, and John responded with, \"Oh, it's just a normal pull.\" Embarrassing tactic to avoid the question. After some back and forth, John Cirner told me I was being unco-operative and was giving him a hard time. He claimed that I had told him I was financing a car and that he had asked me on the way in if I am financing today, and which I said yes. Clearly I didn't, corrected him, and told him I had cash. He immediately hands me the keys after copying my ID, and claims \"I should have said that when I walked in.\"\n\nI have talked to associates about this group, and this is a common theme with this group.
