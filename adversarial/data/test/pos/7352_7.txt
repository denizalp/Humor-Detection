Horrible!  Horrible!  HORRIBLE!!!  If you are going to this restaurant due to seeing it on RESTAURANT: IMPOSSIBLE, don't bother!  It's not worth it!  My husband and I were there today (Oct. 1, 2012) at 12:30 pm.  It took about 5-10 minutes after we were seated to get our drinks ordered.  Then our food order was taken. FIFTY MINUTES later, we were STILL waiting for our food!  People who came in well after us got their hot food while we sat there!  We finally got up and left, paying for our drinks, and got lunch elsewhere.  The pre-pubescent \"server\" with short, blond hair (Hayley??)  couldn't have cared less and had a crappy attitude!  Robert Irvine needs to come back and kick some butt, though I doubt this would help with this staff who obviously don't care about the customers.  I agree with someone else's comment that this place needs to be on Restaurant Stakeout!  Once the \"thrill\" of seeing this place on RESTAURANT: IMPOSSIBLE wears off, I give this place six months tops before it's gone.   I wish I could give this place less that one star as a one is WAY too high!   Don't bother coming here.  This place DESERVES to fail!  Definitely won't be back!\nNOTHING was done to try to make up for the issue.  One would think that we would have been told not to worry about our drinks. !   Nope.  NOTHING.   My husband is a diabetic.  He had already taken his insulin thinking that we'd have our food within 20 minutes at the latest....not be sitting there FIFTY MINUTES later without food!  We had to get him something to eat. The owner just gives a lot of EXCUSES, just like she did on RESTAURANT: IMPOSSIBLE.  I can handle an APOLOGY (which we DID NOT get!); not incompetence!   The fact that this place barely has three starts should tell you something.  NOT worth going to!
