I'd heard some great things about FEZ and decided to give the place a try. \n\nAtmosphere:  five stars. I call it \"effortlessly trendy.\"  There are also a variety of seating options: the bar area, conventional dining room, patio, or comfy couches in the lounge area are all very appealing.\n\nSome very extraverted individuals graced the bar.  Definitely a unique place AND no TVs in the bar--points in my book.  The wine list was quite expansive, and there were some creative cocktails to choose from. Plus, there's a nightly happy hour with drink specials. Saturdays are brewsky nights. \n\nWe ordered hummus and veggies. The hummus was mighty garlicky (yet incredibly tasty), and we had to order a second round of veggies. I glanced at the menu--many of the items would have hit the spot!
