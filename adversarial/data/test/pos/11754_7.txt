Wifey loves country music, and when she requested to go line dancing for her birthday, we went with a bunch of friends after dinner at Yonak's. Although this may be too outside the box for some, I like this place for the simple fact that it's a chill atmosphere with people just coming out to have a good time. \n\nNo lines or crowds to deal with, only $5 cover, no hipster\/hoochie mama vibe like clubs\/bars on the Strip\/DTLV, casual dress code, lots of room to move on and off the dance floor instead of dancing elbow to elbow\/shoulder to shoulder, and free line dancing lessons of their assorted dances throughout the month for those interested. Even the regulars are quick to help you out. An older gentleman said \"I don't know how Y'all get down, but I'm a Redneck, and this is how we do it!\" LOL! Definiely takes practice getting the steps down, and this gentlemen was very kind and helpful. Fun times indeed!\n\nDelilah the Armadillo is no longer hanging from the ceiling, but if you're looking for a great time with friends, break out of your \"too cool for country\/line dancing\" shell and give Revolver a shot. Life's too short. Live a little and create lasting memories. Hmmmm,  this definitely ain't XS, but I wonder how many people would RSVP if it were an Elite Event??? ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  4
