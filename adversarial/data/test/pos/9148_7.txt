Love the show... very entertaining. Worth watching --- not just dancing, there's also funny skits, and pull people from the audience --- so raise your hand and participate. \n\nThese guys are very talented and original. Can't wait to take the boyfriend here.\n\nFree drink and popcorn with your tickets.
