I never, ever leave a poor review, but there is not one saving grace about this restaurant.  We start out with the disgruntled waitress, Kayla. It is more than apparent that this waitress is so unhappy with this job, she makes it unpleasant for the customer.\n\nSalsa and chips at the table - salsa is a complete waste of time - watered down and you can buy better at Safeway.\n\nWorst margarita ever.  Who serves warm margaritas? This drink had approximately 3 ice cubes and little or no tequila. Only half the rim of the glass had salt. \n\nNow to the food. First, if your plates are scalding hot, how long has this dish been sitting under the warming lights?  I'm not sure if the tacos were hard or soft shell due to the fact that they sat under the hot lights so long the top of the shell was hard but the middle of the taco shells fell apart because they were so soft.\n\nThe enchiladas were hard and crusty outside and all the cheese had run out across the plate.\n\nUnfortunately this place has really slipped.
