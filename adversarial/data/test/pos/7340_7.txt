Still amazing. I haven't had Popeye's in years. So good. But the cashier seems to hate her life LOL. That's why three stars. I asked for no salt on the fries (excuse the ignorance because I haven't eaten here in years!!!!) Every question i asked the cashier rolled her eyes and said something like \"they're already battered....ughhh\" etc etc.\n\nI had to hold back...\nAnd just laughed and said okkkay gurl. \n\nMy friend with me even said she's always like that. I cant believe it... she needs to cheer up and relax her face. Not cool! And if you hate your life... do something about it. No one is forcing you to work there.
