Well the name of this establishment says it all for me. Detroit Coney Grill is awesome and the owner Dave is the TRUTH......wohoooo. The wife and I went here for lunch this past Monday and when I walked in I IMMEDIATELY loved the place. Dave was wearing a Detroit Lions shirt.....another staff member was wearing a Tigers Visor.....and we showed some mad love to each other over that thrilling comeback by the Lions over the Dallas Cowgirls.\n\nEnough about that though let me talk about the food.....first of all since I don't eat red meat.....I decided to try there buffalo chicken pita. Let me tell you people it was the BEST buffalo chicken I have EVER tasted. I mean it was soooooo goood because they use Franks Hot Sauce and that makes all the difference in the world. Now for those of you who haven't spent anytime in the Midwest there are 3 things you must try if you ever visit that part of the country.\n\nFranks Hot Sauce\nBetter Made Potato Chips\nFaygo Soda Pop\n\nThey sell all of these items at the Detroit Coney Grill.....I was truly in heaven on Earth. This is establishment has been open for only a couple of months.....but I am really hoping Dave can get a spot open over here in the East Valley. So I need all of my fellow yelpers to pay Dave a visit in Tempe.....enjoy the food.....even if your not a Detroit sports fan.....LOL!!!! Then get your fannies back here on YELP and show Dave and the Detroit Coney Grill some love so we can get one here in the East Valley......wohooooo!!!! Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!
