[Lunch buffet review]\nSaturday and Sunday, from 10am to 3pm, they have lunch buffet for $9.99.\nI came here at around 2pm. \nEverything on the buffet pans was ice cold except for the fried pork which was in different section. \nWhen I sat down, I noticed a lot of tiny ants crawling on the table... Ew. There were more than 20 - 30 of them so I had to switch the table.\nI saw a lot of good reviews on this place so I was very disappointed. I do not recommend their lunch buffet on weekends. Maybe if you come here at 10am, the food would be hot. \nThe only thing I liked was the fried pork and the lady working here was very nice.\nStill, not worth $9.99. Bad dining experience.
