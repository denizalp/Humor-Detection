I came into the store looking for a prom dress two months ago and they helped me find the perfect dress which I loved so much. However, as I was taking my dress out to get it tailored, I noticed that I lost a lot of weight in the past months and the dress was very loose on top. When I asked the tailor to fix it, she said because of the delicate beading on the back, she cannot fix it without damaging the whole design. So I was terribly sad because I knew this was the one dress that I wanted. Fortunately, my mom suggested that we go back to the store and see if we can find a smaller size. Although it was totally against their policy, the sales associates exchanged it for me after making sure that the smaller size did fit perfectly. A big shout out to Leah for being so helpful! If you are looking for a dress for any special occasion, this is the place to go to. Amazing staff who knows that would look good on you before you even know it yourself!!
