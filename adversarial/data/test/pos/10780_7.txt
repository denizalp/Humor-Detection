Me and my man were searching all over vegas for the best furniture, yet best deals in town. Before coming here, we probably came across 12 furniture stores that seemed to give a rather good deal. But when we randomly came to this store, the owner himself and his wife came to help us look around which I thought was really nice of them. We fully furnished my man's house here, so yes, we bought A LOT of their furniture. Not only did they give us the best deal in town, their service and furniture were outstanding. I'd definitely come back here when I need furniture
