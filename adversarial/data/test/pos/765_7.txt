Had damage to my 08 Acura TL - dents on hood, roof and trunk. They took my car in, had a rental car ready when I got there, and did an excellent job on the repairs. In fact, when replacing my hood they had to re-do the 3M and it turned out even better than it looked originally! Highly recommend, Fil Duarte and John D'Allesandro did a great job taking care of me.
