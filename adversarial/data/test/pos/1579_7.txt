Good hot dogs if you absolutely have no other clue as to what you wanna eat for dinner. The hotdogs are tiny so you'll need to buy 3 to get full. The fries are ok, and they put mustard in every hotdog unless you tell them no. \n\nMy husband likes this place, I tolerate it. Wouldn't come here on my own. Lol
