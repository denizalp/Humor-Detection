Caveat Emptor:  Let the buyer beware.   My mother has lived there since around 2007.   For the most part, she has enjoyed the facility and her fellow residents.  However, there are some things the marketing department or brochures will not tell you.\n\nMy mother transitioned from the hospital to the assisted living center at The Terraces.   She almost died of congestive heart failure due to a lack of attention and care by one of the nursing staff.  Only at the urging of a sibling did the nurse call the paramedic.   My mother received excellent treatment and care at Ridgecrest in north Phoenix.  She refuses to go back to the Terraces assisted living center.\n\nThroughout the year, my mother has been missing items from her apartment.  It started as small things- not too valuable so we never reported it.  But recently, my mother (who is still mentally sharp)  the missing items have included jewelry and cash.\n\nIn trying to report this distressing issue to management,  it appears management conveniently blames the resident due to the ages and mental states of the clientele.  In my humble opinion, this insensitivity to a legitimate safety concern shows a lack of respect and care for a resident.\n\nThinking of The Terraces?   Beware!\n\nI do not want one of your loved ones to experience what my mother has gone through in the last year.
