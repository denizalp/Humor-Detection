My wife and I don't care much for buffet. Why? Cos it's food based on quantity. Hotels offer buffet to make loads of profits even if you think you have cleaned out that tray of whatever Alaskan or Antarctican crab legs. Fact is they bought it by the ton and it's dirt cheap for them to prepare. \n\n\n\nAs we moved by the pathetic line that crowd the buffet restaurant at Wynn, we laughed and 2 minutes later we stumbled upon Terrace Pointe Café. It was quite empty and the atmosphere was spot on. Plus no stupid family with kids running around with ice-cream cones. \n\nWe had a booth that was lined in red vinyl. A café setting that sets itself apart from what we have been to before. It surpasses the rather old-tasteless bling bling Bellagio cafe with a darker and more sinister tone. But we like! It's a café where couples have done sinful things and taking a break for a quick bite. It's a café where I can imagine Trent Reznor or Marilyn Manson would dine.  It's a café where if you have kids running and screaming, the servers might cage them and cook them into  sinister yet delicious soups. \n\nWhat seems like an overpriced $16 smoked burger and $16 clam pasta turned out to be very good. Service was a tad bit slow but both dishes were made with care. The prices are on par to Houstons.\n\nWe ate like champions for under $35.
