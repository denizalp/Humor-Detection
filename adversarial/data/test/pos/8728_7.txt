MMM ... Yeup, you best believe I can get rocked with the BBQ at Lucille's!  \n\nOh, sure, there'll be a lot of reviews here pointing out it's chain-ness, the cheesy decor, etc. yet when you're at Tempe Marketplace, this is an excellent dining option.\n\nI'm still sad they pulled the Carolina Style Pulled Pork from the menu. \n\nAs much as I hate to pay $5 for a freaking strawberry lemonade, I get it just about every.freaking.time. It is that good! \n\nThe biscuits with apple butter are heavenly. \n\nMy last trip in, Dude and I split the two meat combo: Pulled Pork and Tri Tip, mashed potatoes and mac and cheese for our two sides.  \n\nThe pulled pork was just alright, kind of tough. The tri tip though? Phenomenal. Sauce it up for a good time. \n\nMac and cheese is sinfully delicious. Heck, I'd drop in for just a bowl of that stuff. The server claimed there is bacon in it; however, I wasn't able to detect any. \n\nFriendly service, BBQ comfort food  . . . Just bring your stretchy pants, 'cause you're going to need them.
