Sign up for a Yoga Nirvana yoga retreat to Hawaii if you want to stay hidden in the middle of the woods-- a 40 minute drive each way to the beach, in grimy unsanitary cabins that remind you of sleep-away camp in Flagstaff when you were 15, with a Yoga instructor that downplays you with every inquisitive question, who has no plan of action nor willingness to claim responsibility of set expectations with a price tag of $1299.  Not only did Jim Keegan (owner of Yoga Nirvana & retreat leader) not live up to the expectations set prior to the retreat-  (2 meals cooked by private chef & 2 yoga classes a day) -but when a question was proposed due to lack of planning & communication his response was one which became defensive & condescending with passive aggressive behavior using tactics of intimidation. YIKES (red flag #1)\n\nBut what really did it for me was the conversation over our first dinner where Jim proceeded to express his disapproval of the horrific traditional female genital mutilation practices by the Afgan people saying they \"should be extinguished as a culture of people.\"  WHOA --- Yes female genital mutilation is evil but so is genocide! I was in complete shock! I mean isn't my Yoga instructor teaching consciousness awareness, compassion, patience & positivity? For the sake of love & revelations,  weren't we here on a retreat? Meanwhile at the dinner table it was genocide. COMPLETE YIKES! (red flag #2)  p.s. female genital mutilation isn't even a practice in Afghanistan.\n\nSuddenly my yoga instructor, who I claimed as a teacher of 8+ years became a complete stranger.  That night I decided to myself that I'd be leaving the group & that there was no way I would be able to surround myself with this type of energy off of the Yoga mat, let alone spend the next 6 days in Hawaii a 40 minute drive from the sun rising & setting over the ocean, in the middle of a forest.\n\nGoing with the flow until the right timing presented itself, I left on my own journey the second morning after witnessing Jim as he simply watched, from behind these pavilions where we were having a.m. yoga practice, 3 of his students who were lost due to lack of communication. After some time had passed my conscious forced me to get up from my mat & walk out from behind our location, signaling to the students --where they even started there own practice. Not only did Jim not welcome these students to the practice, but Jim had the audacity to question me as I walked by him,  \"are you or aren't you practicing?\"  I GASPED!!\n\nThe real question here is, \"Jim, are YOU or aren't YOU practicing?\" \n\nLike I said, Ive been a student of Jim's for over 8 years, from way before the beginning days of Yoga Nirvana studios & am in complete shock that meeting him out of the classroom was like meeting a complete stranger...a stranger whose embodiment is the complete opposite of his own teachings.  Ive asked Jim to refund only $200 of the $1299 cost to cover my dinning expenses & other yoga instruction of which I attended at a local island studio & his response was \"why should I... you are leaving voluntarily?\" followed by a simple \"NO.\" After some serious reflecting, for over a week now  --  I have come to the conclusion that Jim Keegan has been teaching what he MOST needs to learn & practice himself. Any PHD would call this projection.  This person does not in any way, shape or form embody his own teachings off of the mat & out of the classroom. \n\nThis is a true case of :: 'PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH' \n\nCan I get a witness? Yes I can -- because 2 other students (full names upon request) also decided to separate from the group, who joined me due to the negative energy, nasty attitude & total confusion\/ chaos that started upon arrival to the island & our first destination 'COSTCO!!!'  \n\nMy heart goes out for you Jim & while experiencing the practices of my life in Hawaii lead by both Kali Ray Torres & Psalm Issadora, Ive humbled myself to you, committing myself to a prayer for you every time I step on my mat.  Your time will come....will it be karma, fate or destiny? \n\nNAMASTE
