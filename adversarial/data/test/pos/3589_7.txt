I visited Luke Wholey's earlier tonight for dinner with my parents.  I'd been wanting to try it for a long while now, so given that they're fans of good seafood and that I had a City Dining Card for it, this gave me the push necessary to try it.\n\nWe started out by ordering the lobster bisque fries ($11), given that it was one of the more unique menu items and that many other Yelpers recommended them.  They consisted of fries over lobster bisque with chunks of lobster topped with scallions, and were the highlight of the meal.  If you like poutine, you'll enjoy them, for sure.  Because I wanted to try the lobster bisque by itself, I decided to order a cup of it with my meal ($7).  This turned out to be a mistake, given that it was too salty and rich for my taste, and that I felt that it was overpriced (for a cup).  If you're considering stopping here for lunch, bear in mind that you can get 4-5 times the amount of crab-lobster bisque of comparable quality across the street (with more seafood, no less!) in a quick serve setting at Wholey's Fish Market for less $.\n\nFor our entrees, my mom ordered the crab cake salad ($15.95), my dad ordered the baja shrimp volcano ($28), and I ordered the crab stuffed salmon ($30).  While my salmon was well cooked and tasty with the sauce, it didn't blow my mind the way I expect for an entree at this price point.  Also, the bok choy served with my entree seemed a bit limp when served, and there was a piece of skin underneath my salmon.  While these may seem like minor details, I have a higher standard for fine dining-esque than for mid-range restaurants, so I can't let them slide.  I tried a piece of my mom's crabcake and some of the potatoes from my dad's volcano, and again, they seemed tasty, but not mind-blowing.  They both seemed satisfied enough--though they're not as exacting as I am when it comes to eating out.\n\nOn the a positive note, our service was very good, so I have no complaints there.  The atmosphere is more casual than I was expecting, which fits with the atmosphere of the Strip District, but not with the fine dining-esque nature of the restaurant.  I concur with another reviewer that I'd be willing to give this place another shot for lunch (or happy hour), I don't think I'd be willing to pay dinner prices again.  Since my opinion is hovering between 3 and 4 stars, I'm splitting the difference and going with 3.5.
