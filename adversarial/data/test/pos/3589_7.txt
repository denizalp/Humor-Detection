This place is wonderful. Went in with $500 and came out with 2 12 inch subs, an amp, a deck and speakers that they upgraded for free. They even gave me a free auxiliary cord. The service was great.\nNot like a big chain store to screw you. They worked with me and went down on prices to fit my budget.\nDefinitely will return here. Came with a 1 year warranty and a one week tune up.
