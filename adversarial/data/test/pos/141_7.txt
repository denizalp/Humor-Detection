This is the pool at Mandalay Bay. To be honest, there's about 3 or four pools, a beach, and a large wave pool.\n\nHead out early to snag some chairs. Otherwise, just have a fiver ready and get one of the staff to help you find some open spots. It beats wandering around in the heat wasting swimming and sun-soaking time.\n\nThere is a 21+ area that you have to pay to get into, that's a different club altogether. We didn't check that out as it was pricey for guys. Girls, you can tan topless in that club. Not sure if they'll have a problem with you being topless in the main pool\/beach area. You may have a problem with all the yokels wandering by staring.\n\nYou can get waiter service at your seat, including buckets of beer. There is also a bar, a restaurant, a faster-food\/take-away type area, and a store selling supplies like suntan lotion, sunglasses, trunks, etc. Useful if you forgot your sunglasses and lotion, especially when it's 107 degrees out. I got some killer bright red sunglasses for $20.\n\nThe wave pool is fun, you can body surf and try to take out kids, lifeguards, and teens who are trying to be too cool to actually get in the water. Nothing more fun then embarrassing self conscious teenagers.
