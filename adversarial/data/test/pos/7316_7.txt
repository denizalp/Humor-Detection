I have been to Isla many times over the last five years or so years. What keeps me coming back is the tasty food and FAST service. It's like they can sense that you are crazy hungry, and they accommodate. It has never let me down. I have had the grilled chicken salad, the guac and trios of pork, chicken and beef tacos, along with rice and beans. All were flavorful, authentic, (not bastardized, greasy Americano\/Mexi fare) and filling.  But in a good way, not the \"oh jesus that was good but greasy, check in with me in a few hours\" kinda way....\nI hadn't been here for a long while, and I wanted to make sure that they were still up to snuff. I wanted to write this review as if I had never eaten here before, just to be sure I was being fair to my fellow yelpers. Upon sitting, I was greeted by a warm, salty plate of fresh tortilla chips, nesting on a metal stacked tier below a trio of fresh salsas. Nice. I like variety. A nice Pico, a med green salsa and a nice mild red. I do love spicy, but these are not so much,  but still nice. Won't overwhelm the palette before dinner. My Margarita Classica went down with shocking ease (A little too fast for my taste, I may need help) not too sugary or muddled, and I could still taste and appreciate the tequila.  I ordered another right quick. I had the Baja tacos, which are beer battered and fried, but not too greasy, which is an A+ in my book. My Hubby had the filet of beef burrito. I couldn't make out much, other than a few inaudible groans, which is a good sign. The atmosphere is semi dark, and the restaurant seating is nestled away from the casino floor, which is nice. (I can still hear the slot machines, but can't see them, so at least that's a plus.) The staff is still super friendly and quick, so if you are not in a hurry and want to linger, just tell them. \nThe prices still rock, especially for the strip. I like that. \nThanks Isla, for being consistent, simple, and yummy. Not the best around, bit still good and a great value.
