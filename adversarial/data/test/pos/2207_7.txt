***This was my first ever trip to an aquarium and I found Shark Reef's Aquarium to be really enjoyable given their good sampling of ocean life (starfish, jellyfish, sharks, piranhas, sea turtles, octopus, stingrays, and more); if you have more experience with aquariums though, you may walk away disappointed with this one given the high admission price ($18 for adults)***\n\nI have never stayed at the Mandalay Bay, but I have been inside the resort many times to dine at their restaurants (Burger Bar, RM Seafood, Aureole, Fleur, House of Blues), attend events in their convention center and stroll through Mandalay Place.  Despite all these visits, I have never been to their Shark Reef Aquarium, which is probably because it is so tucked away--over by the convention center on a side far from their main parking structure.\n\nMandalay Bay's Shark Reef Aquarium has advertisements that boasts it is North America's only aquarium dedicated to predators.  I am not sure if that is true, but given that I have never been to an aquarium, I felt this attraction was well worthwhile.\n\nBesides the sharks, there were lots of great ocean life here.  I thought easily the most impressive was the jellyfish.  The tanks allow you to get really up close and personal and you get to see the beautiful colors, lighting and movement of this species.  It was really a sight to see and just by looking at the jellyfish, I can tell many science fiction movies have been inspired by jellyfish in their attempt to depict alien life.\n\nThe Komodo dragon, while incredibly still, was also impressive looking.  There were several interesting fish to view--from a very large and rare version of a catfish to the more well known piranhas.  Giant sea turtles were also on display as well as stingrays.  You are allowed to touch some of the stingrays, which is a rarity at this aquarium; there were very little interactive exhibits--the attraction mostly features ocean life behind thick glass and posted signs providing quick yet interesting facts.\n\nIn terms of the sharks, they were fun to see.  They have an okay variety and some were super quick and hard to photograph while others seemed to be deliberately slower and thus more menacing.  The sharks felt small though; if you have seen the footage of the shark recently captured on film at Manhattan Beach, the sizes of the sharks here may feel slightly underwhelming.\n\nThe aquarium has a good number of exhibits.  It is a self-guided tour and it will take you anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours depending on how interested you are in reading the information displays.\n\nService was fine.  There were only a few polite staff members throughout the aquarium since it is mostly a look and see attraction.\n\nPrices are high.  For adults, it is $18 to walk through the aquarium.  For me, the price was fine because I have not been to any other aquariums, but customers with more experience with aquariums may walk away feeling this attraction is a bad value.\n\nMandalay Bay's Shark Reef Aquarium is a great option if you are not that familiar with aquariums and ocean life and want to get away from the shows, casino, food, and clubs that dominate The Strip.  It is also a very family friendly entertainment option with a family friendly gift shop.  You can also book the aquarium's private room for events and such like a child's birthday.\n\nMandalay Bay, like other casinos on The Strip, has free self parking.  It is typically very easy finding an open space.
