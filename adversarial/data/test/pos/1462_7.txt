I love beer.  So while on a weekend snowbird holiday (myself frm Seattle and my partner from Chicago) I decided to check out the great beer of Arizona.   Yelp indicated this was the closest brewery to the resort I was staying at.  I was disappointed to find out that they not only didn't brew their beer at this location, but they didn't have a wide selection of their beer.  On the upside they had an amazingly large tap selection along with a massive bottle offering.  Staff is very knowledgeable on the beer and superb recommendations. We told him our pallets and every time the beer was delicious.\n\nWe also ordered food.  The pizza here was very good, I highly recommend it.  I also loved the feel of being a dive bar even though it was in a shopping center.  Oh yea, it's in a shopping center.   We were confused too.  To be 100% honest, this was the best place I went to on my weekend in Scottsdale.  I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good craft beer and a low light dive.
