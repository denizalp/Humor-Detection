Came with mama and we both enjoyed the hip environment and the food too!  At first we were a little not sure what to do.  Full service?  Got order?  Grab a table?  Then we were greeted and explain the process.  COOL!  We ordered, got sat, and got our drinks.  I ordered the the class burger with cheese.  Mom ordered the Magic Shroom Burger.  We shared an order of the truffle fries.  It was very good.  Burgers were juicy not dry.  Food was HOT when I came to the table.  NICE!
