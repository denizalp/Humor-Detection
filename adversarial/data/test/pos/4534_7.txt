The desserts here are awesome!  It's not a place to score a steal of a deal but they offer delicious treats.  Unfortunately, their coffee items are a lot pricier than regular coffee shops (e.g. Starbucks) but the flavor of their coffee is on par with most places.  I can't say enough about the gelato though...love it!  Great way to indulge, especially during the summer months.  Their box treats, however, are a bit pricey.  One caramel can cost as much as $1\/each and a package of 5 or 6 small macacrons can cost well over $10...yowsers!  Still, I do like coming here when I'm inside Caesar's Palace.  The place is a bit hard to find for people new to Caesar's Palace but if you just look for Rao's or the buffet, it's as easy as rounding a fountain...enjoy!
