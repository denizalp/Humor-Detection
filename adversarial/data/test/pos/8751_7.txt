But I resisted!) \n\nI happily found 2 pairs of shoes (both at 60% off retail.) \n\nI had neglected my shoes for 5 seconds while making dinner reservations on the computer at my friends place and puppy went *MUNCH* on the only pair of shoes I had with me on my trip. \nOopsie. \n\nOff to to Zappos I go. \nGabriella Rocha Mary Jane Heels for 60% off retail.
