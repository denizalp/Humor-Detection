I was pretty bummed at the onset of Halloween weekend because I was planning for Hard Fest in LA, but as is par for the course, I procrastinated my way out of tickets. C and D came to the rescue with tix to Fabulous, which had mostly the same lineup, but better. What's the catch? It's in Vegas. So I call up my new favorite person in the world R and she was down for it. So whaddaya know, road trip!\n\nThe show was at Orleans Arena with Deadmau5, Armin Van Buurin, MSTRKRFT, Crystal Castles, Bad Boy Bill, and more. A pretty stellar lineup. R and I were staying at the Rio with D and C, who graciously provided us with a bed to sleep in, and we met N and S for dinner before the show.\n\nThe venue was nice, though we did have to venture through the casino to get there, passing by the requisite regular gamblers, grannies, weekend warriors and local weirdos on the way while getting the very obvious \"these guys don't belong here\" looks. Awesome.\n\nThe will-call line was longish, but brisk, and security was fast and loose. R and I chatted up this young gay couple... they must've been, what, 19? Nice. Pretty soon, we were in the venue. And oh, what a venue it turned out to be. It was an intimate event: just 13,000+ electro fans and a killer lineup of dj's and bands.\n\nThere was a main stage surrounded by bleachers, which was great for breaks, and a second stage outdoors. The outdoor stage was nice, though they ended up closing early because of noise complaints. Noise complaints? In Vegas? Really?\n\nAnyway, it was amazing. We danced all damn night. Good times, good music, good venue, good people. Can't get much better than that.
