I stop by here to pick up the Portuguese shrimp puffs.\nThey make them really well here.\n\nI also recommend the coffee here, cheap and good.\n\nThe baked goods and pastries are my wife's dept and she usually buys a bunch of that.\n\nI just meet her at the cash and do my husbandly duties and pay for everything....
