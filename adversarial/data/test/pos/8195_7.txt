I love this place. I've been going to Peking Garden for over 8 years. Probably more. They've been an integral part of my growing up.\n\nOrder in, take out, you name it, I've done it. Multiple times.\nWhen my mom found out she had celiac, we asked if they could whip up some gluten free dishes for us. No problem. They use corn starch wherever they can and you can bring your own gluten free soya sauce - they'll use it. Any business willing to do that for you deserves your loyalty. Service is always impeccable.\n\nI'm about to break this place down for you like an MC Hammer jam, so strap yourself in. If you're not salivating by the end of this review, I've failed you.\n\nFirst of all, the decor is simple. The place is small. Parking is awful. And yet this is still the best damn Chinese food place in the city. You should make a reservation because everyone who is anyone in the Northwest knows what's up - this place is more legit than making out with a supermodel and having her call you back.\n\nNow if you know what's good for you, you're going to order a lot of food. Follow this simple guide.\n\n0. Deep fried wantons. We always begin with these. They come with a sweet and sour sauce so good that you'll have to restrain yourself from plunging your entire face into the tiny bowl it comes in. I'm more serious than cancer. \n\n1. Sizzling Rice (Tomato, Shrimp, Veggies).\nWhen they deliver this to your table, it's piping hot. They pour on the sauce. It fizzes and crackles and the delicious aroma floats into your nostrils. The shrimp taunt you with their pink little bodies - but don't worry, you'll be eating them soon. The water chestnuts are crisp. The peas are amazing. It's like eating rice krispies with sauce poured out of God's private vat. \n\n2. Ginger Chicken\/Beef. We get the chicken - it tends to be more crispy. Ginger beef was actually invented in Calgary - fun fact. I'm betting the chef here invented it, in between writing sonatas, curing diseases and writing a best seller - because their Ginger Chicken\/Beef is genius. \n\n3. Salt & Pepper Chicken. If I was on death row and someone asked me what I wanted my last meal to be, I'd probably just make it an entire bucket of salt and pepper chicken from Peking garden. It's a bit spicy. It's hot. It's crisp. It'll arouse you in ways unnatural.\n\n4. Garlic Snowpeas & Broccoli. As soon as you pop one of those heads of broccoli into your mouth, you're going to swear to high heaven that someone in the back made a pact with the devil in exchange for the world's greatest garlic vegetable dish recipe. Even kids who hate broccoli will have to be physically restrained from pounding the entire dish back.\n\n5. Sweet and Sour Pork. Big pineapple slices. Boneless pork. I would rather eat this dish than spend a night with Scarlett Johansson. If Scarlett Johannson invited me to eat Sweet and Sour Pork with her, she'd leave bearing my triplets. \n\n6. Palace Style Chicken\/Prawns. These go off like a nuclear bomb in your mouth, but instead of being devastated and facilitating the end of the second world war, it's going to send your eyes rolling into the back of your head and facilitate the end of your hunger.\n\n7. At this point your waiter will have refilled your water roughly 75 times, or every single time you take the slightest sip. Just let them do it. They love it.\n\n8. Beef, Chow Mein & Veggies. I once took the most beautiful woman I knew out for dinner and ordered this dish. As she slurped the noodles into her mouth, getting sauce all over her perfectly symmetrical face and the pearl white table cloths, I had never been more attracted to her in my entire life. I relive that moment every time I hit the right REM sleep pattern. \n\n9. Honey Shrimp. You know why I love the Chinese? Because somewhere one of them thought \"Let's take honey. Let's take shrimp. Let's combine them.\" - and it WORKED. If I was a bear, I'd traverse the entire Kananaskis country to crash through the front window of this place and eat all the honey shrimp they had. I'd only maul people who didn't finish their plates. I'd leave the staff entirely alone - and I'd take a complimentary breath mint on the way out.\n\n10. Beef in black bean sauce. Do you remember the first time you fell in love? Now you will.\n\n11. Cashew Chicken. This is my least favorite dish here, and I'd still eat an entire pick up truck full of it before I'd eat at any other Chinese restaurant in the entire city. There's cashews. There's chicken. And you're going to eat it, and you're going to love it.\n\nI could go on, and on, and on. I've eaten all of the \"white-people friendly\" dishes here. Haven't had the Peking Duck - working up to it. Haven't had the shark fin soup - I find that unethical.\n\nThey used to have a poster of Jackie Chan on the wall. My only complaint is that it's gone. \n\nGo here and eat their food. Tell them I sent you.
