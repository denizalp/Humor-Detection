Yup, will never go back to this place.    Reserved two non-smoking rooms.   Walk into the lobby, place reeks of smoke.  Being a casino in Las Vegas, I do realize that it will smell of smoke, this place was wayyyyyyy past smelling like smoke.  Being a newer building, their ventilation system should be on point. \n\nGet to the front desk.\n\nMe-HiI have reservation for Max \"\" \n\nEastSide-  We have your room for two queens, may I see your card and ID please.\n\nMe- They are non smoking correct?\n\nEastSide- All we have left are smoking room, it's a first come first serve basis.  \n\nMe- But I reserved the room online, from your website.\n\nEastside- I am sorry all we have is smoking.\n\nMe- May I go up to the room, and see how stinky it is.  I don't want to be stuck in a stinky smoking room for 3 days.\n\nEastside-  The only way we can let you in the room, is if you finish checking in.\n\nMe- Is there any other non smoking rooms available in the hotel, I don't care if it's more expensive or cheaper I don't want to be stuck in a  room that reeks like ciggerettes.\n\nES-  (Gets on phone with manager)  There are no other rooms available.\n\nMe-  Ok cancel my reservation, I will find somewhere else.\n\nEs- (back on phone with gm)  If you cancel your room, we will have to charge you for tonight because you did not cancel your reservation within 48 hours.\n\nMe- That's fine, I'll dispute the credit card charges.  You gave my non smoking room away that I reserved, and the only things available are smoking rooms.  I am not going to stay in a smoking room at this hotel that reeks like ciggs.\n\nEs- (manger calls front desk)  We have found a room for you.  It's on the third floor which is non smoking it's not facing the strip though.    \n\nMe-  @#$% fine I'll take it.  \n\nGet to the third floor, the floor reeks of smoke.   Room smelt better for the most part, did have hints of cigarettes.  \n\nNow I know that the cigg smokers are going to be like F that guy what did he expect coming to vegas.    A lot of you don't realize how bad that stuff stinks.    And I did expect the casino to stink, but not the whole damn hotel.   \n\nI will not be back.  Mainly on how I was treated by the front desk.  I mean really....  You won't even let me go check out a room to see how bad it smells after you sell the room I had booked and then you miraculously find a non smoking room after I threaten to dispute my credit card if you charge.   \/end rant
