I haven't been here for awhile, and wow, it's really turned into a dirty shit hole. \n\nSmells like dog urine, the old linoleum floors are stained .... Looks (|&smells) very run down. \n\nThe inventory is poor, and a lot of the items are dirty and dusty. Made me wonder how long that doggie toothpaste had been in the shelf for.\n\nThe women behind the tall counter didn't even look at me when I walked in ..\n\nWhen I walked behind the free-standing building, all I could hear were dogs barking. They sounded extremely stressed  - the same bark you hear at any dog shelter. I have no idea what their \"doggie daycare\" includes; the dogs I heard didn't sound very happy :(\nThey keep the dogs in the basement, and take them out for a pee at the park, and then circle back down into the dungeon. I've seen it a million times, while I eat lunch in the park. Such a sad sight ... ugh.
