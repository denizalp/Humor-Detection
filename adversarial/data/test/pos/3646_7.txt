OMG, this place is so delicious. Greg and I have made a habit of trying to get as far away from hotels for food as possible and so the coffee pub fit perfectly into our well oiled machine. \n\nAfter a simple \"breakfast\" search in our general area, I saw a well rated place with two of my favorite things: coffee and pubs. After clicking through some pictures I came across the a lobster omelet. LOBSTER OMELET. That sold us. Well, me. I sold Greg. \n\nTo be honest, I can't even remember what he had, but you can guess what I had. I can't tell you how many times I've ordered a \"SOMETHING\" omelet or \"SOMETHING\" scramble, and you get it, and there's egg, there's cheese and assorted accoutrements, but there's only evidence that the \"SOMETHING\" was maybe once a part of the ingredients. Coffee Pub knows no such practice. That was a LOBSTER omelet. It was good. It was lobster-y. It's something I want to eat the next time I go to Vegas. Hell, it's something I want to eat for breakfast today. \n\nAs a note, I love me a good potato. Hash browns, baked, mashed, fried, I just love it, but the pub potatoes, or whatever they may have been named, were just ok. Luckily I do remember Greg getting potato pancakes (hash browns) and they were fabulous. So get those.
