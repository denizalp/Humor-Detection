I really like the cool space in AiRia, DJ always play great music and I highly impressed with the good service from their security that allow me and my group to sit at VIP cause they appreciate us came early at Friday when they just open. But seriously, I need to SIT! This place doesn't have a place to sit at all if you don't open a table! I wish they could develop the bench or the a cool place in the bar for sitting.. that would be awesome..
