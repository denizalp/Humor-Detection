Maybe it's because it's dipped nearly 20 degrees in the last week in Vegas, but I seriously think it's brrrrrr cold!!  When it's cold, I think of any food that's warm and cozy (ramen, chicken noodle soups, jigae, beef stews, pho, cinnamon rolls).  Soyo sure fits right into the warm and cozy because they offer all kinds of Korean comfort food.  \n\nWe enjoyed...\n1.  starchy potato pancakes - Might I say even more enjoyable than the kimchi pancakes?\n2.  seafood soondubu - It's got a combination of tangy, spicy and warm your belly goodness!\n3.  chicken wings in special sauce - these are some mutant wings!  they are gi-normous!  delicious.\n4.  dolsot bi bim bap - this totally hit the spot for the windy days this past weekend.  it was hot.  not spicy hot, but HOT in a stone pot!  i love how this dish is always presented in a hot stone pot, but soyo really does it right.  The mix of rice, veggies, and beef comes out seriously sizzling, so when you go to toss it with the sauce, you have to really dig in to scrape the now crispy rice membrane at the bottom.  for those crispy rice lovers, that is certainly not a bad thing!  chewy, crispy, tasty rice!\n\nConclusion:  Korean comfort food at it's best.\n\np.s.  bomb panchan.
