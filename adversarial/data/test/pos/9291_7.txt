Ok, I know its sort of lame, but let's pay $25 to get into an ice bar! Yay! Luckily everyone agreed, and we went. I had a great time, but that might have been because we got 2 drinks with the $25 admission, which isn't that bad for Vegas prices. One of the bartenders was awesome and the other one had a serious stick up her ass. But I digress.\n\nIt's actually -5 degrees Celsius, so it's not that cold. Plus they give you a parka and ugg boots (which I have totally fallen in love with. Their so comfy). The ice chairs are covered in deer skins so you don't slide off and bust your ass, but you have to hold the ice cup with both gloved hands or it will dump your drink on the floor (Nathan) and then you'll have to lick it up (also Nathan) instead of ordering another drink like a normal person.\n\nThere's also a lady who will take your picture, which you can get for free on their website, or pay $20 for. Which to choose.... Also, there is NO SMOKING inside, which was devastating for the 2 men in our party. And the included drinks come from a pre-made list, so don't get your hopes up for ordering something fancy. But you can buy different drinks at the bar like martinis.\n\nI would go back. It was fun, and I like those shoes...
