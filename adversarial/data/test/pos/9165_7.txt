Wow!  I've been to Vegas a billion times and never even knew about Red Rock.  My mister wanted to continue with our off the beaten path exploration of Vegas, so off we went to Red Rock.  \n\nAfter spending most of the day shopping, it was late in the afternoon, but we still headed out to Red Rock.  Me and the little one were a bit tired and truthfully, I could care less if we saw Red Rock or not, but my mister was determined to see it.  I searched for the location on my mister's iPhone.  After about driving 20 or 30 minutes toward Summerlin, we got to what I thought was our destination...Red Rock Casino and Resort.  My mister explained that he was looking for the state park.  How was I suppose to know?  So, I searched on the iPhone again and found the correct directions, but it looked like it might be closed already since it was 4PM.  Not ready to give up, my mister wanted to pass by, just so we'll know where to go next time.  \n\nWe arrived at the gate, and low and behold, they were still open.  Since it's spring and the day is longer, the park doesn't close until 7pm.  We paid the $7 entrance fee and my mister was happy as a clam and was proud of himself for his persistence and not listening to me.  After driving toward the Red Rock, I was glad that my mister didn't give up so fast.  The scenery was BEAUTIFUL!  It was so surreal.  I didn't realize there are trails that go through the park. It's very peaceful and it makes you just appreciate nature.  We took the 13 mi scenic drive and stopped at the vista spots to take pictures.  We had to be quick because the sun was going down fast.\n\nWe'll definitely come back.  Maybe take a hike or have a nice picnic.
