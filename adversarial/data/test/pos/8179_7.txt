First off...what kind of Chinese restaurant don't speak Chinese?! \nIf you don't speak Chinese you should at least let people know. But the server\/kitchen guy just ignored us. \nService was not great and the food did not taste any better. \nTried ordering a fried pan noodle and got the response, \"no have\" with a crappy attitude.
