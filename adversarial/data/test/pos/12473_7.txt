We had a bit of mixed experience here, but I'll be generous and go with 4 stars. Really, I'd say more like 3.5.\n\nOn a positive note, the name and overall concept is really fun. We were drawn in mainly by the name and the unique menu of poutines. We arrived around 9 on a Saturday night and were seated outside on the patio at a table that we later found out was weirdly located right in the middle of the entrance to da Club that's also in the same building. I was looking forward to experiencing the interior, but my friend wanted to enjoy some people watching and it was a nice night, so I was cool with outside. \n\nThe hostess cleared a table for us very quickly and our server came over with menus fairly fast. The menus were a little dirty, which always turns me off a bit in restaurants. We asked our server about the size of the poutines. We wanted to have some cocktails and poutine as our meal. We were thinking of ordering two or three of the smaller poutines. He initially said we should order two poutines and a burger, but having had burgers for lunch, we opted to do the three small poutines. WAY TOO MUCH POUTINE! We had it for dinner, then breakfast the next day, then dinner again. This is what we had:\n\nVladimir Poutine- Smoked Meat, Beet Confit, Crispy Onion and Russian Dressing. This was my favorite because the beet confit really made the dish. There was a good ratio of fries to cheese to gravy but I literally had ONE piece of smoked meat. Not good. I honestly did not even see any crispy onion, but maybe it blended well with the fries. Minimal dressing. Overall, this was really tasty, but if you're going to put meat in it, there should be more than a couple pieces!\n\nNapoleon Poutine- Poutine with Foie Gras- Unlike the Vladimir Poutine which was missing the meat, there was definitely a good amount of fois gras on this, but it was a little too much fattiness- fries, gravy, cheese, foie gras! Amazing for a few bites, but it could be balanced out with a veg like the beets in the Vladimir. \n\nFidel Poutine- Lobster bisque, lobster meat, cheese, shrimp and scallops. Sounds amazing right? LITERALLY THERE WERE THREE OR FOUR TINY ASS SCALLOPS. Maybe there were one or two pieces of lobster. I didn't see any shrimp! If you're advertising seafood on the poutine, please, PUT SEAFOOD ON THE POUTINE. \n\nNow, was the poutine good? Yes. However, I felt a little ripped off on the meat and seafood front, especially considering this poutine is not cheap at $15 plus per poutine. \n\nWe also had the Moscow cocktail- basically a Moscow Mule. There were good and strong but nothing really remarkable. The cucumber is a nice touch though. \n\nThe service was super relaxed and we were definitely not rushed. However, our server went MIA as we were finishing our meal and we were forced to relocate from our table to the bar because da Club was getting ready to open at 11 and we were sitting right in the middle of the entrance. Okay, so we move and we go sit at the bar and have some beer but no server.... then, what seemed like an hour later, our server materializes and seems confused as to whether we paid our bill (we hadn't). So being, good ethical people, we tell him we had not paid and offer up our cards. At this point, I kind of would have rather been out of this place exploring the rest of MTL rather than waiting around for the server. \n\nAnother negative point, the bathrooms, located downstairs in da Club were filthy with clogged up toilets and dirty floors. Nevertheless, there was a random gaggle of girls eating a full sized pizza over one of the sinks... um, okay. \n\nMy recommendation if you come here would be to just go for the fun name and atmosphere- have a beer and a Vladimir Poutine. Do not sit outside or near da Club. Go inside by the window. Don't expect great service or a lot of protein on your poutine.
