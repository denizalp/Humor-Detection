Our night started off at another location, but after the mood wasn't set quite right by the staff, we had started to look for another place to come and dance. I had pulled up The 1OAK website on my phone to get information, meaning what time they  open, music, and what not. I could not find a 'dress code' section on the website.\n\nWe drove to the Mirage, and was instantly turned away by the doorman. Not because I was dressed poorly, but because I was in \"flats\".\n\nMy designer, not cheap \"flats\"..........\n\nI would understand if I was in a pair of dirty flip flops, but I wasn't.\n\n I had told him that I recently had a procedure done, and he said that it didn't matter. WOW. Is your place ADA approved??????????\n\n It was the \"dress code\", (that I can NOT find ANY where, might I add. I'm looking on my laptop right now.) Their dress code is not posted outside of the club, on their website, NO WHERE. He said that I would be a \"liability\" because I wasn't in heels and that the club has had \"glass break.\"\n\nWhat? What does one even have to do with the other? I'd much rather step on broken glass in flats than high heels....or is that just me?\n\nI am absolutely disgusted that because I can not physically wear high heels that I, as a customer was turned away. That I was a \"liability\" because I was in flats, when I'm sure you know that some of these girls are a liability in themselves, because they can barely walk in those damn things! \n\nIt's funny that the one thing I did find on their  website, was Rob Kardashian in a simple black tee, and a baseball cap, but I am not allowed to wear flats? \n\n..............Pretty interesting dress code.\n\nI just wonder that if I would have brought a cane, or if my friend had pushed me in a wheel chair if I would've been turned away too, since I wasn't in heels. The doorman didn't even offer me a manager, or some one to speak to.\n\n I am surely disappointed, this, was truly a \"1 Of A Kind\" experience. I truly felt discriminated against, I never plan to return to 1OAK, and I plan on letting a lot of people know about it.\n\nI have contacted 1 OAK, and they said that they do plan on ***adding a dress code section to their website.... Something, in my opinion, should be posted anywhere and everywhere in the first place. \n\n^^^^^^^^^*EDITED**  5\/21\/13*^^^^^^^^^^^^\nHere's the quote from their website,\n1 oak las vegas . com\n\n\"Our Dress Code can be described as \"upscale chic.\" Hats, t-shirts, chains, excessive jewelry, athletic wear, shorts, baggy attire, sunglasses, sandals\/flats, and tennis shoes are not permitted. Entry is always at the doorman's discretion.\"\n\nJust keep in mind Rob Kardashian...... Black tee... baseball cap. This business isn't run correctly. It is very biased, and you would probably enjoy your time somewhere else... Take it from a local.\n\nBest of luck.
