I got my hair cut a few days ago again with Sansam, and I really wasn't impressed with my visit at all.\n\nShe repeatedly said how I hadn't been there in a while. I'm thinking she was either upset at the fact that I might've gone elsewhere to get my hair cut last (which I hadn't) or that she had more hair to cut. Regardless, I don't understand how this would've been her problem.\n\nThe other problem is that she didn't manage to cut my hair that well this time either, as I have random hairs flying around in several different parts of my head.\n\nHer parting statement to me was, \"don't wait so long next time, come back in a month.\"\n\nBased on this experience, I'm nearly positive I've not returning to this venue. It's too bad, 'cause I had been satisfied with her work several times prior to this experience.
