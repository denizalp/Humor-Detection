This is a great little coffee shop. Located on the main floor of the SLS!\nMy favorite part of this place ? The Almond milk they will make your coffee with. The first time I ordered a cappuccino with Almond Milk. It was awesome. \nThe Baristas are Patient and kind. Which you do not always get at other places .  They also have some really good breakfast items.  I got an egg and cheese Panini to go , it was a great breakfast.
