So, I've spoken before about hidden gems...\nI've never been to a hidden PALACE before. \n\nThe Emperor's Palace is located on Rockwell in an older section of Cleveland's Chinatown area, on a street that is, to say the least, secluded. It is a MASSIVE storefront, with a whole collection of Chinese Zodiac animals (full sized statues, mind you,) guarding the large parking lot across the street. The front is done up in brass finery and the whole place just looks...impressive. \n\nTwo other things that are impressive, the food and the service. \n\nThe hostess was very gracious, seating us herself and then answering any questions that we had about menu items. They have many wonderful, round tables with that spinning section so you can share your food choices, and believe me, you'll want to. \n\nWe decided on an eclectic collection of steamed and baked buns with pulled pork, shrimp dumplings and several appetizers. The main dishes we got were and AMAZING General Tso's chicken, and a chicken with garlic, ginger and Chinese okra that were just wonderful. The service, btw, was outstanding. Glasses were never empty, and plates were gone like magic. \n\nTheir menu was massive, with a large selection of things like congee, many vegetarian dishes and a whole host of treats. \n\nThe decor is very elegant, in golds and rich woods and a very nice atmosphere that lends itself to a nice evening with friends and conversation. \n\n(Speaking of which, many thanks, BTW, to our friends Richard and Sherri who introduced us to this place, we WILL be back.)\n\nWhen we went, there wasn't a large crowd, but I'm guessing that this may be due to the secluded nature of the Emperor's Palace, but I hope that you'll try it yourself and see. If you want to be treated like a King, you've got to visit the Emperor!
