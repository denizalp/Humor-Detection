The food at Jim's is is great but I have to write about the service. Not the waitresses, who are always wonderful, but the cashier. She's an older lady and is very rude to her staff. Not sure why since her staff are always on point and friendly. I've always had good and friendly service when she's not there, but when she is there especially on the weekend, she can be very rude to the girls who are doing a good job. Not a good way to impress your customers.
