I bought a voucher for $29 on some deal website.  I made the appointment they were really friendly and helpful when booking.  I got to the salon on my appt day, they seemed super busy.  My hair is super damaged from going to China town (cringe, what was I thinking) to have my hair bleached.  They fixed me all up!  Antonio was really nice and wanted to do everything he could to help me get my hair back.  They gave me a deep conditioning treatment which helped a lot, they also toned and dyed my hair (at an extra cost) and also gave me a great trim and now my hair looks great!  I say, for $29 try it out.. its worth it!
