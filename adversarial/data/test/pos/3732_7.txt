We went for the painters and poets on Saturday. Lots of people outside, music, and just a great atmosphere.  We go inside, get a table and sat for  20 minutes before our waitress brought our drinks. Wine came in dirty glassees but the waitress did bring clean glasses\/wine - after another 12 minutes.  \n\nWe ordered tapas. One a calamari dish; I thought there was plastic in the batter but the chef told us that the cook didn't clean the cartilage from it. And that sure made me feel better...\n\nI liked the fish tacos because they're a unique build your own mini taco deal. They just have to remember that when guests order tapas that includes sauce, they really need to provide spoons.\n\nThey comped a dessert because of the calamari and the wine issue which was a great thing to do. \n\nThe staff was friendly but everyone seemed extremely rushed and just not happy. Maybe it's different on any other day besides Saturday so may go back on a week day.\n\nOverall, very cool place and people but wait time and some of the dishes could be better. If  more people were on staff during the weekend, things would be much better.
