This is a delightful and popular restaurant serving a wide array of Italian favorites. I went for a group event and a large compartment within the restaurant was reserved for us. The servers were every attentive and friendly and the food was very good. And the portions were really huge! Most of us ended taking home part of our orders. \n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant is very casual and the low level of lighting make for a more relaxed mood during dinner. One of my main complaints about dining places in Scottsdale - especially in the Old Town section of Scottsdale Rd. - is that parking is difficult to find, but that does not apply to this restaurant. In addition to the parking areas surrounding the building, the restaurant has additional parking just across on the southern side of 1st Street, and of course there are additional parking spaces on 1st Street itself.
