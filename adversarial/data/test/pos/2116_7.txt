Before when they first opened I was a huge fan of this place.. but now i'm wondering if the taste has slightly deteriorated with their jump in popularity??\n\nTheir burgers are definitely good.. if I could give 1\/2 stars they'd definitely be a 3.5.. but i'll have to drop it to a 3 because you will be expecting more than what you get from the long wait and hype.\n\nYou probably won't go wrong with any of their burger choices..
