To preface this review, my wife and I booked a couple nights after our wedding, but were rather disappointed with our experience. For the review, ...geez...where do I start?\n\nI'll start with the good stuff, the stuff that was provided , yet that would be expected in a hotel that charged half the price.\n\n(1)  Online check in, so we just had to pick up our keys. This was convenient.\n\n(2)  The \"suite\" was decent size, but I'm not sure what made it a \"suite.\" The couch?\n\nAnd...that's about it. Now for the stuff that disappointed:\n\n(1)  When we checked in, wearing my tux and my wife in her wedding dress, there was nothing more than a \"congratulations.\"  Not that we were really expecting freebies, but we kind of expected SOMETHING - champagne, some drink comps even... Nothing.\n\n(2)  The girl at the front desk put us in what she said was a \"quiet\" room. Nothing could have been farther from the truth. Although I understand she can't control our obnoxiously loud neighbors, she stuck us on a corner overlooking the pool. The pool has a DJ or something at 8am, so forget sleeping in at all after a long night of Vegas celebration.\n\n(3)  The shower was abhorrent. Lake Mead is at record low water levels, California is in its worst drought in recent history. Our bathtub leaked...constantly...the entire time. I'm not talking a slow drip. It was a constant and steady stream of water.  \n\nMaybe the leaking affected water pressure because the shower was all kinds of jacked up.  Don't stay at the Rio if you enjoy warm showers. Turning the temperature as hot as it would go, for 5-10 minutes, was not enough to avoid an uncomfortably cold shower. One word can describe the bathing experience at the Rio: miserable.\n\n(4)  In case you sleep through the bumping music at the crack of dawn, they ensure you are awakened by the sun. Although there are blackout shades, they're not in very good shape, so it was impossible to close them completely. As a result, at about 6:30am, a bright beam of light shown right on to our faces. Aahhh, what a pleasant wake up (sarcasm).\n\n(5)  There's supposedly WiFi, but the log-in information is never provided, so just expect to use a lot of your phone's data plan while you're here.\n\n(6). There was supposed to be checkout via the TV, but that didn't work. We got an error message that said to try back in 5 mins. Well, we didn't have time for that, so we tried to call the front desk and got put on hold for 10 mins. Never talked to a live person, so tried to leave a message... We just hope that it worked.\n\nThe only reason we'll ever come back here is the Voodoo Steakhouse, which was amazing. That, or if we leave something behind, God forbid.
