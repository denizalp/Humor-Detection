I absolutely LOVE the Food Network, so when I wasn't in the mood for a full-on buffet, my friends and I went to Mesa Grill for brunch. I was looking forward to this meal, but was disappointed. I ordered the Barbequed Lamb Salad and the lamb was dry and not appetizing at all. The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is that the Scrambled Eggs Chilaquiles were amazing.
