What's Macau?  Macau is not a Bird of Prey.  Macau is not edible either....  unless you're China in which case you consume Macau and give it an interesting designation known as Special Administrative Regions.  What's Macau famous for?  GAMBLING of course at least for nearby tourists.\n\nOther items of interest of course is Culinary base such as Portuguese-style Chicken, Bacalhau, Pork Chop Bun,  Portuguese Egg Tart and many more.  Where would you FIND Macau flavours in Toronto? Due to the proximity of Macau to Hong Kong, it has always been popular items in Hong Kong style Cafes and it is the same way in Toronto.\n\nPromoted on their Take-out Menu and their counter as 5-star food with Food Court prices, it really doesn't matter as there's really no competition of any nature within this Multi-cultural City.  If any, probably not with 5-star Hotel Chef derived from Macau.  I think of this as similar nature(Food Court) as Gournmet Garden(Malaysian\/Singapore) except it's Macanese.\n\nBacalhau(Cod Fish) Ball(7\/$3.50) - Deep-fried Balls with crispy thin exterior holding soft Potato Mash with Bacalhau dices.  It was A-OK for a snack at that price and the Bacalhau is surprisingly not overly salty.  It's not addictive enough of a snack but if friends want to try, I'll bring out the coins.\n\nPortuguese-style Chicken(5.99) - This is nothing like any of what the HK-style Cafes would offer as the Portuguese sauce is neither as gluey, spicy, or salty.  Maybe that's the reason it's not as attractive to me as a sauce on it's own as my palate is used to the more savoury version.\n\nAdditions(Olives, Boiled Egg, Sausage) that makes it different from my prior experiences at those HK Cafes that only serves with Onion, Bellpepper, Potato. \n\nThis dish gets the saltiness from those Garnishes and looks better in presentation.   The Steam Rice that came with it wasn't fresh but the Portion of the Portuguese-style Chicken and the perfectly cooked Dark Meat evens that out.\n\nClosed Wednesdays.
