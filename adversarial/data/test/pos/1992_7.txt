always delicious!!! And not to mention that they are a Christian company that is closed on Sundays and they don't support same sex marriage!! The lines were crazy yesterday due to the supporters of chick-fil-a's public post about not supporting same sex marriage. Went for breakfast at 6:30 and there were only 5 cars in front of me. Saw pictures through out the day for lunch and dinner and the lines were out the door! We go here a lot as the food is just great! They never let me down.
