Booked online, but no one was at the airport when I arrived at 7:30 AM. Since I'm a patient guy, I waited 30 minutes before I called. They couldn't find the reservation, even though I had a confirmation email. I was told it wouldn't have mattered, since they were booked up (due to CES convention), and wouldn't have been able to pick me up. They had all my contact information (email, phone numbers), they could have sent an email, or text, or CALLED me to inform me of the situation so I would have waited and walked all over the baggage claim area looking for someone. I ended up taking a $30 taxi ride to the hotel. I have used them before without issue, but there is no excuse for not notifying me that they were booked up and couldn't handle my reservation. I would not recommend this company, as there are many others to choose from, one of which will get my future business.
