Friendly and chill vibe, playing a nice mix of 80\"s to now music. 7 chair\/tables with a couch and stuffed chairs to spend time with your peeps. Inner Circle is on Scottsdale South of Thomas on the East side in the mall with Hot Yoga University and AZ wine, across from Pep Boys. We came in for a relaxing moment and coffee with my small people on a Friday late morning. Sue greets you with a warm smile and a menu. The menu hits all the highs with satisfying and tantalizing sandwiches and salads. See the yummy avocado toast I noshed on today. My kids enjoyed the nutella banana toast. The got on it pretty fast so no pic there. I appreciate supporting my friend and her dreams. Please do the same, you wont be disappointed
