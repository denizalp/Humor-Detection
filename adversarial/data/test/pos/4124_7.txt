This mcDs is a joke. Ordered 2 happy meals. They give me 2 bags with cutie (orange) and chicken nuggets. No fries. No toys.  We got 4 paper bags for 2 happy meals. A Bfast burrito and 2 sandwiches.\n\nWent back in to get the missing stuff, and they were  dealing with two OTHER  incorrect orders.. Omg. \n\nGirl at the register looks lost, seriously.\n\nThe dining area actually looks pretty nice.. But messy.
