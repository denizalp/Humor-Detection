The representatives who hire for this company are very corrupt. If you are not a \"certain\" race and dress a certain way they will not hire you. After sitting in the waiting room waiting for an interview dressed in interview attire they \"dismiss\" me for no reason. All the others were sitting in the waiting room on their phones the whole time yet I'm the one who gets \"dismissed\" for no apparent reason at all. Yet another person walks in for an interview with a t-shirt, jeans, and dirty Nike basketball shoes greeting the front desk by saying \"ay yeah I'm here for some interview\" and gets called back. So glad I didn't get myself into this illegitimate company!!!
