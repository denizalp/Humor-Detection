Despite having beeping parking sensors, a rear view camera I still managed to reverse my car into a huge wall in a recent snow storm in Utah. Cadillac of las Vegas recommended AW Collision so here goes.\n\nIt is at the bottom of the W. Desert Inn so super convenient for most. Parking is good and as you walk into a very clean but basic waiting area, two leather sofas , a flat screen tv but little else. Bathrooms were clean but had no towels and there was no reading material other than an older brochure for Land Rover.\n\nThey quickly provide an estimate which was reasonable, and what I really liked was their willingness to order, prepare the replacement bumper prior to my appointment for repair. This meant rather than lose my car for three days , I simply showed up and waited an hour while they took off the crumpled bumper and replaced it while I waited about 90 minutes. Good.\n\nWork was good but on inspection I found the alignment of my bumper was out a little, they quickly took it back in the shop and it was readjusted. \n\nGood body shop I will use again but hopefully I won't have to......
