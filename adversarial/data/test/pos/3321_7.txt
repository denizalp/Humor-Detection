So in case you didnt know, Burger Joint opened it's doors here in Henderson! They are locally owned and operated small business headed by locals Damian and Jose.  Right here In Sundridge Plaza (Eastern\/Sundridge Heights)\n\nSo why should you prefer this place over other burger places??\n1. It's NOT the typical massed produced fast food joint, burgers  here dont have the preservatives and artificial flavors.\n\n2. The burgers are hella good! Seasoned well. Organic. Black Angus \nBeef from Bartels Farms.  Very good quality beef.\n\n3. My beer aficionados friends highly approve of their beer selection. \n\n4. They have vegetarian\/vegan option.  Of all days I came in, it was my Meatless Monday, and was very happy to see Roasted Portobello ...even happier tasted delicious paired with fennel escabeche.\n\n5. From reading the menu and seeing the artisan ingredients used for the different burger selections it shows that Chef Damian is really talented, there are burgers you wont see at other places. \n\nOur burgers were cooked as requested every single visit. (Med\/rare and well done)\n\nThe Bleu Cheese with shallot port syrup\/bacon mayo that I asked for wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun was really good! The creamy sauce balanced out the sharpness of the bleu cheese.\n\n6, TRUFFLE!! Truffle fries is on the menu...\n\n7. Tator Tots - made in house...that's another reason that pulled me in here, crazy, I know. Honestly Im not crazy for tots, mostly because everyone uses the frozen variety.. Chef though crafts his from a mold that's a little bigger size. The result, crisp on outside, moist AND FRESH potato inside. Ya'll who gripe about not getting very many are just used those bitty preserved ones...smh\n\ntip: ask for it Truffled!! It's not on menu. \n\n8. Those who love Foie Gras, well you'll be in heaven. Foie is not on the menu but if they have some they can add it to your burger...or make you foie gravy fries..YEA FOIE GRAVY fries!!\n\n9. They have burgers to please everyone.(see #4)  Even non foodies like Mr. B, who likes things plain, traditional.  The Classic burger here with the added burger patty  we requested was pretty impressive.  I knew hubby would approve.  Like I said beef quality is really good.\n\n10. The staff is cool, the prices are on par with speciality burger places IMO.  What I dont get are the  people who spend average 5$ on cup of coffee everyday, then gripe on $$ they spend on a speciality burger?? ...ookay.\n\nThe ambiance is chill, it is family friendly,  the dining area is modestly decorated. There's some awesome looking pix of their food hanging on the wall though ;)  I like they're open late on Sundays, cause most places around here are closed early. The first few visits here, I was surprised to see it busy, with repeat customers,  especially since they haven't done any advertising.  Obviously the  local neighborhood knows what good!  Burger Joint is another good asset and option to eat in this area!!
