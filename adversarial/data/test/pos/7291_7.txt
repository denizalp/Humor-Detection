im trying to set an appointment for my wife as new patient and the receptionist ask me \"does she speak english????\" \"she needs to set an appointment by herself\"  i was like are you serious? did you just tell me if my wife speak english?\" As a husband I think we can set an appointment to any relative with their consent. So huge turnoff and so unprofessional. get rid of that receptionist She really has attitude,
