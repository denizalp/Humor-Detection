You tricked me Sam's Town. I fell for the 9.99 (with card) all you can eat Prime Rib\nbuffet. EWWWWWWW. . The best part about this buffet was the fountain drink.  The \nPrime Rib was bland and overcooked. The green beans were frozen, the pasta \nwas horrible, and the rice was too salty. The Mexican fare was beyond crappy. Frozen tacquitos, canned re fried beans, and greasy machaca were some of the choices available.  Having lived in Las Vegas for almost 7 years, I have been to a number of buffets. However, none were as god-awful as this one.
