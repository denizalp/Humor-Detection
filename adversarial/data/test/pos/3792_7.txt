So we were in Phoenix for the day and had a lot of plans. Thanks to all the places I've read up on here, I thought we'd have a full day of activities and lots of places to go to. I had plans to pop into IKEA for a little while and we ended up spending the bulk of our time there. \n\nHere's the scenario . . . \n1. we have a house that we've lived in for a few months\n2. we have about a million plans for the house\n3. we don't have a lot of left-over money to do it with\n\nIKEA for us is a life saver. True, you won't buy any sort of heirloom furniture here. If you're looking for that, definitely go elsewhere. But if you want to have a stylishly decorated place, IKEA is a must. Even if you don't buy anything, you get a lot of ideas. I was practically drooling over all their organization choices.\nIf you have them, bring the kids. There is a play area where you can check them into, but I have to tell you that my kiddies had a blast playing in the second floor. They were pretending that each \"room\" was theirs and having make-believe dinners, meetings and parties. \nI also love that the restaurant charges less on account that people have to clear their own table. I'd like that to be the case everywhere else. I'd happily clear my (and everyone else's) table at other restaurants for a lower price. $.99 kids plate, $.50 coffee? Sign me up! \nOverall, I LOVED it. My husband said he felt like sheeple for a while there, but I don't care. I'll take inexpensive, simple and stylish anytime. I also like the whole idea of paying for the plastic bags. I'm writing to the candidates convinced this should be some sort of law.\n\n\nYesterday . . . \n\nmy son: Can we go back to IKEA today?\nme: uh, no.\nmy son: but I need to\nme: you NEED to? why? \nmy son: I want you to make meatballs but we don't have any flags for them\nme: oh. uh, some other day, ok?\nmy son: ok, but we need them ok, that's what makes meatballs taste good. \nme: (laughing) ok
