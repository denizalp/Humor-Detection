My husband and I drove 45 minutes for the grand opening just to find out they had a closed sign outside. The man inside told us they were not taking anymore people keep in mind this is at 1:00pm. I asked if they had takeout and their reply was no. I was excited to try this place but just by their accommodation service very disappointed.
