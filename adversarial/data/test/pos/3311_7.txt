These knuckleheads had my computer for three weeks and when I got it back it worked worse than before.  Every time I called it was one excuse after another.   I called one time and they said that they lost it.  I got a call the next day and they said they found it.   They overcharged me for lousy service and I had to take it to another place to get fixed the right way.
