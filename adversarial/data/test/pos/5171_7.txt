Wanted to try this place for awhile..... little disappointed. Did not realize where you eat is in an old house and you are eating in a space of a bedroom, assumed eating areas would be open. First, we were sat next to a screaming baby on our date night, dropping our own kids off so we asked to be moved. It's just very uncomfortable eating with others in such small rooms, very awkward and not what we expected. We just ordered appetizers and they were good but nothing memorable to make me want to go back. Maybe we'll check out the patio in the summer but not interested in going back to the restaurant area.
