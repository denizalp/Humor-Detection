These are the best cupcakes in or around Madison. It's a locally owned shop that goes out of its way to have a large selection made with local ingredients. I'm never disappointed when I visit. I've tried at least 18 different kinds of their cupcakes. Not sure what my favorites would be, but I love the Wedding Cake, Carrot Cake, Almond Blueberry, Margarita and many more!
