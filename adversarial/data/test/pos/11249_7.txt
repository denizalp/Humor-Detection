I feel bad about this 1 star. I wanted to give zero but that's not possible! \n\nFirst, the location is borderline sketchy. Then the place is only borderline clean. But the food - it's so wrong in so many ways! \n\nWe had some sort of beef soft taco that was sooooo salty our tongues hurt after. The chicken salad\/nacho was drenched in guac and sour cream it got so soggy it looked too gross to eat. We did anyway (we paid for it after all) and regretted it immediately. Like the beef, it was very salty, the ingredients didn't come together and it was just so, so very wrong. \n\nSo if you're craving for Mexican food, skip this one. There are boatloads of other places  you can go to.
