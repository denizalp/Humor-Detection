If I could give Negative stars that's where I would rate this establishment.\n\nI have never in my life been treated as horrible as I have been from this place.\nThe staff is more than lacking customer service skills, they would have to have social skills first. we bought a bike from this location in summer last year, since January we no longer have this bike. but in between that time, His bike has been in the shop 3 separate times. Twice for his speedometer cable and once for his battery, They were less then helpful and never remembered there own lies to keep their stories straight. I can't remember a single encounter (except the day we signed papers, of course) that was pleasant or remotely helpful. This bike spent almost as much time in their shop as it did my husband driving it, Anyways.. We have been waiting 2 full months for a service plan we purchased to be refunded back to us, and apparently there is only One person in this entire store that knows how to look that up and JOSH is NEVER THERE. I have never seen someone who gets paid to be out of the office more than in it. Today I called and left messages to be called back so I can get the status of my refund that should only take 6-8 weeks and that was at 10am by 5 pm still hadn't heard back so I called again, Not only was I hung up on, I was transferred to extensions that didn't exist.  Our experience from this place from the get go was bad. The first day we went in one of the sales guys pushed so hard for us to buy a bike we weren't even sightly interested in and wouldn't take no for an answer I finally has to get a little snippy so he would stop being so pushy.\n\nI would not recommend this place to anyone!, They are disorganized, extremely rude and I have found a poop covered stick more helpful than any person that I have talked to or dealt with at this place. If you don't mind being treated like crap, ignored, hung up on and flat out lied to.. This is the place for you.. If not I recommend somewhere that will appreciate your patronage and your hard earned money.
