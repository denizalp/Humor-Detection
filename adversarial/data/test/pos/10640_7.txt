Honestly, I felt like I was taking a bit of a gamble on this place.  The reviews aren't too endorsing and I haven't been having a ton of success with trying new places for lunch.  That being said I was hesitant.  I went to this establishment years ago when it was Luccia Shea's.  Overall, I recall being disappointed with my experience and didn't return.  With this establishment moving in I figured sure why not.\n\n\nSo I went with the \"cluck cluck\" (grilled chicken sandwich) $8.50.  It came with chips I asked if I could sub them out and of course she says no.  I said I would pay a difference to which she says yes, but really all this meant as I found out later, you can add any side to your meal at the price listed in the menu, and your sandwich will still come with chips.  Thanks, clearly I knew I could do that.  SO I added steamed broccoli (I believe $2.50), the VOTD.  \n\nAtmosphere wasn't bad.  We sat at the bar to eat.  Our food didn't take too long to come out.  My broccoli was really good.  A nice al dente, some seasonings and warm.  I ate that first.  I made a comment to the bartender that I didn't want the chips remember, but she was kind of like, \"oh well, they are on there.\" Yep they were.  My sandwich was pretty standard.  I was disappointed with the portion of chicken.  It was sliced super thin.  The toppings were all fresh but seriously one of the best parts was the bun.  Oh my, it was good.  Tasted freshly made that day.  Nice and soft and flavorful.  Not sure where they buy them from but they should keep it up.   \n\nOverall a solid A-Okay place, probably would go again.
