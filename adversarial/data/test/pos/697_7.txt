This place is amazing. I usually go all the way near down town to get my acai bowl fix and Im so glad this place opened up so close to home. I had the pitaya bowl and it was literally perfect. I could swear by it. \n\nThe place is very clean and organized plus the staff is so friendly and know how to hold a great conversation.  Love the vibes of this place. Will definitely be making this a regular stop for me!
