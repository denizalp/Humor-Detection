If I could give this place a zero, i would. I'd love to give it two, but only if by giving it a two, I could use both of my middle fingers.\nRude staff. Rude, nasty clientele. \nWalked in with a party of 7, including some kids, because Zipps a few doors down was on a wait. We wanted to drink some  beers, eat some food, and watch the game. Our party was not even greeted by a staff member. It was around 6:30.\nThere was an older couple sitting by the door, as well as some drunks outside on the patio, who also made us feel most unwelcime, saying, \"thank God \" when we walked out after waiting around 10 minutes to be acknowledged. These are older, well behaved kids who were looking forward to pizza and football.\nBottom line: Go to Zipps. Unless you're an old, crusty alcoholic with a shitty attitude. Then, go to Clancy's.
