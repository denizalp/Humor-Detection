I'm old now. I don't stay out late. I only wear heels and makeup when I absolutely have to. So for me it's hard to get impressed by a club, esp with so many in Vegas. This place was alright.\n\nThere are plusses to this place. We were on the guest list and yes even guys got in for free before 10:30. At this point there was no wait to get in. I also appreciated the signs out front that tell you where to go for what line. Girls also got a wristband for open bar until 11. Open bar meant well drinks, but they used 10 Cane for their well rum. Wow. Love 10 Cane. There was never more than a minute wait at the bar. I went to the one near the hallway to the restrooms and all three bartenders there were very nice.\n\nEven the security guys were nice! Many of them even chatty! Lots of reviewers said the bouncers were all very rude but I guess since we were there early they didn't get in a sour mood yet being around a bunch of obnoxious drunk people. I know I'd get annoyed too.\n\nNow the minuses. The dance floor is ridiculously small. We didn't even attempt to dance. The outside area is large, but the pool is laughable. I can't imagine there being a dayclub at that tiny thing. Is the real pool hidden somewhere?\n\nThe huge minus is when you exit, you have to walk down about four flights of metal stairs that are probably the real fire escape. Talk about weird. Drunk people in heels walking down four flights of metal stairs? I'm surprised I haven't heard of anyone suing!
