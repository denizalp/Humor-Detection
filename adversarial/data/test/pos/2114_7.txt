Anyone who is looking for authentic, Persian cuisine - stop looking! Tasty Kabob is by far the best establishment I've been to across the country. My fianc√© ordered a dinner entree of lamb kabob skewers, basmati rice and salad. I ordered a chicken kabob and kufta kabob (koobideh in Farsi, minced ground beef in English) with basmati rice and salad. There is a nice lady who greets you and takes care of your order when you first arrive; I found out later she is the owner. So when I asked for the regular kufta kabob plate (2 skewers) - she recommended I try a mixed plate instead. She was right! The mix of chicken and kufta gave it such a better taste than kufta by itself. There is a short wait time (thank God) because we had just left the gym and we were famished. Happy as hell that we didn't have to wait a long time, we devoured our plates. It was absolutely delicious, and I cannot forget to mention how huge the portion is. I just wish I took my usual pictures for my fellow Elites and Yelpers so you all can run over here tomorrow. \n\nAnd whomever ends up coming here, send me notes and post the pictures! You won't regret it.
