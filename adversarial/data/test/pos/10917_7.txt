After our 2 recent 'not so great' experiences @ the Fiesta Mall location, C said he wanted In N Out so we came here. We've had good experiences in the past BUT not today. Our cashier, Thalia, just didn't listen. I ordered a med drink ($1.55) with a Cheeseburger ($2.50) then a #2 (Cheeseburger, Fries, Med drink $5.75)but she assumed I only wanted the drink that came with the #2, which was wrong, so she only rang up one drink. Plus, AS ALWAYS, I ordered C's Cheeseburger with extra, extra, extra, extra Pickles. Thalia only rang in extra twice. Today that equalled 8 pickles.\nRegardless, C said his burger was fine. The bun was grilled nicely & the cheese was just melting. Winner winner Cheeseburger dinner.\nMy Cheeseburger was protein style w\/ no onions & mustard instead of spread. Why does \"no spread\" translate to 'No Pickles?' Just because I don't want 1000 Island dressing DOESN'T mean I don't like Pickles. In fact, just as a general rule, STOP making decisions for me. I've been eating at In N Out for 39 years. I think I know what I want.\nListen to my order. Place the order the way I order it. We'll all be happy & 5 Stars would be a sure thing. \nCashier didn't listen. Dirty dining room. Great Cheeseburgers. Wish there were Pickles. 3 Stars.
