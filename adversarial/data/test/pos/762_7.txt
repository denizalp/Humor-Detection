We always enjoy our stays at Mansion Hill Inn. We get to Madison 2-3 times a year, and although we don't always stay here (it's on the pricier side), it's definitely in our top 2 hotels in Madison.\n\nThe Inn is charming, the rooms are comfy and well appointed, and the innkeepers are such nice people. \n\nTurndown service includes fresh cookies, and a handwritten note. Such a cute, thoughtful touch.\n\nOther amenities:\n\n*complimentary wi-fi\n*bike share kiosk on premises (complimentary passes too!)\n*complimentary newspapers (NYT, MKE Journal Sentinel)\n*free continental breakfast\n*complimentary refreshments and snacks\n*couches and wood-burning fireplace in lobby\n*Aveda products in bathroom\n*bar area in lobby serving beer and wine\n*Frette linens on bed\n\nWe love staying here. The combination of timeless elegance, sophisticated comfort, modern amenities,and attention to detail make the Mansion Hill Inn one of our favorite hotels to stay at whenever we want to splurge.
