I'm smitten with Maizie's.  This two month old bistro has it goin on.  \n\n* Cute trendy space, with a distinctive wine rack\n* Urban vibe in a Landmark Tower storefront\n* Neighborhoody feel\n* Well-rounded menu with something for everyone\n* Friendly service\n\n4 stars with potential for 5. We went here for dinner on Monday.  Loved the space and decor - everything was tastefully done from the small sectional lounge area to the communal table to the small bar area (beer, wine AND liquor, btw).  It oozes neighborhood caf√© with the small tables (seating about 30 or so) and the fact that we knew people at 2 of the 10 tables - so for a Monday night this place was hopping.\n\nThe owner Maizie and her father were a delight to talk to - answering questions we had about the menu and about the restaurant in general and checking up on us regularly.  My dining partner had the  1\/2 pound bleu burger with buffalo sauce and I opted for the Santa Fe chicken Panini with a huge supple grilled chicken breast, jack cheese, guacamole and ortega chile.  The variety of sides make it possible to get creative - slaw, fruit, cottage cheese, hand cut potato French fries or noodle kugel (the sweet Jewish dish I opted for which came with raisins, cinnamon and sliced apples). \n\nService was good, but could be better or more seasoned.  The server who handled us was OK.  We let him know when we received the check that he had forgotten to charge us for the soda and iced tea and he went back to fix the error.  Wow.  That's a first for me.  Typically places I've been to have waived the drinks when they've already given you the check.  No big deal, just unusual and a bit gauche.\n\nI like where they're going with the late night dining (till Midnight) and brunch service (can't wait to try the breakfast burrito).  Bring it on - I'll be back again soon to make it a regular stop.
