So, I was pretty disappointed. It is my first time in Vegas and I've heard what amazing food there is. I ordered the Halibut, the presentation was beautiful but the fish was not. It was very very dry and the outside was overlooked. I eat fish 2-3 times a week and this was just ruined. I ate it of course but this should've been done perfectly. The kale that came with it was just a few little pieces, this was also a bit disappointing. \n\nOther than the food the service was wonderful and the view you cannot beat. Maybe go for dessert and wine?
