more like little fn paradise.  \nthis is the only place that I don't mind consistently treats me like shit because there goddamn food is such a treat. the samosas come with a small red dipper that they could tell me is made of their chefs saliva and belly hair and I'd still triple dip cause it tastes so dang lovely. like seriously. what is that wonderful crap? \n\nterrible service at sit down and over priced if u order delivery. but I always go back with a smile... like the beaten husband I am.
