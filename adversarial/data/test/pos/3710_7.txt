My first memories of Babcock ice cream go back to kindergarten when I would visit my dad on campus. I always got a huge cone of chocolate ice cream. I don't know if recipes have changed but it was my favorite then and favorite now and the servings are still generous. Recently I've been getting Mocha Macchiato. My other staples are chocolate peanut butter and berry alvarez when it's available. Try a few samples first!
