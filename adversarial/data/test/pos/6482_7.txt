It took me a while to find the location of this place but with some help I made it. It is part of the Parkway West complex of buildings just above where the former mall sat. The Alcove is located in building number 6 which also houses the main lab of Quest diagnostics. It sits just to the right of the Post Office.\n\nUpon entering I was warmly greeted and given a menu which I would assume would be available for take out. With a Yelp check in you are entitled to a free cookie-chocolate chip or oatmeal raisin. He told me that their soup of the day was tomato which he said was excellent. I opted for one of their daily specials - chicken DeVinci on a hoagie roll. It comes with cheese, mushrooms, peppers and a tangy sauce. Since the sauce was a little to hot for me they substituted a marinara sauce in its place. He then told me that if I wanted to make it a combo I would get a fountain drink and a choice of either French fries or potato chips for just $2.00 more! I was amazed at the fact that most of their selections are under $10.00 just to start with! He also told me that breakfast items were available all day if I so chose.\n\nAfter placing my order he gave me my chocolate chip cookie and took my name so they would bring it out to me. This place is small but it fills up fast over the lunch hour. I got my sandwich and fries in about 10 minutes and believe me it was so good, I was blown away! The fries were also delicious and even though I knew this was a probably a standard cookie I was amazed at how fresh it tasted! \n\nBasically all you have at your table are napkin dispensers. You get your condiments and utensils over at the fountain area. There is a separate area if you wish to purchase coffee. \n\nAmong their offerings are various salads, hamburgers, hoagies, paninis, and wraps.  They have a listing for snacks and sides which include queso fritters, white cheddar macaroni and cheese, grilled cheese, hot dog or a cup of soup.\n\nI can't wait to return and try something else on the menu. Good food, great service, and very reasonable prices. A definite must!
