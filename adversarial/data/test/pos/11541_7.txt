So I don't know if the employee taking the order was just not paying attention, didn't care or if it was the person making the order but I am beyond irate that my order was messed up and then they wouldn't even answer their phone. \n\nI had my boyfriend go to Taco Bell tonight to get me dinner. Now I am on a low carb diet so my order was a specialty order \n\n3 sides of beef \n1 side of onions \n1 side of sour cream \n2 sides of cheese \n1 side of lettuce \n\nA couple hours later after I hit the gym come home and shower I go to eat my food I was so looking forward to and my damn order has no onion, it's nothing but beans, cheese, lettuce and sour cream. \n\nUmm wtf where is the meat and why is there beans instead of beef?!?!? \n\nI guess my mistake was having him go to this location instead of our normal one on ft Apache. I also wish I could give it no stars!!!\n\nThank you for effing up my order and ruining my night!!!
