Mmmmmm gelato.....I love all things icy and creamy and full of flavor and the gelato at Gelato 64 fits the bill!  My daughter and I were out of the house on a rare evening and we happend to be in the area.  Now my daughter has a HUGE sweet tooth, HUGE.  This kid would eat sugar 24\/7 if I let her.  She had eaten a good dinner so I promised her desert and we happend on Gelato 64.  It took us 15 mins to decide what we wanted.  The girl behind the counter was very patient and offered samples of anything we wanted.  And you name it, they had it!  I finally decided on some Salty Carmel gelato and it was delicious!!!  My daughter got the same and she was in heaven.  I guess the number 64 stands for how many flavors there are and it does make it a very difficult choice because, honestly, everything I tasted was so yummy!  It's not far from home so we will be back!
