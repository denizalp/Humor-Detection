I've had Rollin Smoke on my bookmarks for over two years. Finally got to roll on over! Had to roll myself out, too.\n\nWe had the pulled piggy sandwich plate and the brisket three ways. We had the mac n cheese and the corn nuggets for our sides. The food was FANTASTIC.\n-Pulled piggy sandwich was perfectly smoky and had comparably less fat to other establishments I've been to that have served pulled pork sandwiches.\n-Chopped brisket: juicy due to being a bit fattier than my preference, but served like it's supposed to\n-Burnt ends: my personal favorite\nSliced brisket: perfectly tender and ready to pull apart\n-Corn nuggets: YES PLEASE. I'd eat these all day long if calories didn't count.\n\nTwo things I would change about Rollin Smoke if I could: the location (super small parking lot) and the seating arrangements. Unfortunately we came on a really cold day and the seating area is rather sparse. This resulted in the doors opening and closing a lot, so our food got cold pretty quickly.\n\nVerdict: I do NOT plan on waiting another two years to return, so you shouldn't either.
