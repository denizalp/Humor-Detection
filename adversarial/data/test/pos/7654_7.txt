A hole in the wall restaurant! I don't ever crave for Mexican food but this place was amazing! Better than the popular El Gordo in my opinion. I love their tacos! I am a huge fan of tripe (if you don't like intestine stay away but if you do you must try!) it was sooooo amazing, crispy, juicy and flavorful. Also tried their beef burrito, they use the tomato rice inside!!!! My favorite type of rice... So freaking good. I would defiantly come back again and again and again. And take my family here to try!
