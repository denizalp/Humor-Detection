Location: On the main, in what I guess is considered the Mile End. Again, being a walk-everywhere kinda gal, I'm going to say that Laurier or Mont-Royal are the closest subways (5-10 minute walk from there). Street parking is available [metered].\n\nThe place: I wasn't excited or blown away by the space. First, there's one communal table that looks like it's made with plywood but in all honestly, I didn't go inspect the thing so I might be mistaken about the thickness of the tabletop. The bulk of the seating is bar-type, which makes it somewhat difficult to go there with more than one friend unless you don't mind talking loudly and shifting seats around so you can actually see your people, without pissing off your neighbours for taking up too much space. The decor was average, the place a bit dim, and they've got some Australian stuff for sale, mainly the dreadful Vegemite (though if you're Australian, you automatically love this).\n\nThe goods: I didn't like the coffee. Way too bitter and I'm pretty sure my Macchiato didn't have that drop of milk that is necessary to smooth out the espresso. It was more bitter than anything else and my teeny, tiny cup was half -full (at Olimpico, it's full - just saying'). That being said, I had one of their veggie muffins (savoury) and not only was it super freshly baked, it was outstanding. I mean, seriously f-ing amazing. I'd buy that sh*t in bulk. \n\nService: Leaves to be desired. I personally found the staff to be unfriendly and indifferent - I mean, what does it take to crack a smile? A can-opener? I didn't really feel comfortable when placing my order, but more like I was bothering them. Pas cool.\n\nPrice point: I don't remember how much I paid but if I recall, it was on par with other places.
