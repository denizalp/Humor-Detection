This show was simply...\nBREATHTAKING.\n\nWords cannot express how magical it was. Without spoiling the show, I will try to describe the awesomeness of \"O.\"\n\nCurtains opened like WHOOOSSSSHhhhh\ndid a little twirl, somehow disappeared into nowhere\nGiant pool on the stage,\noh wait now it's gone! Woah it's a dry flat stage now!\nPerformers are popping out of the water... where did they come from? Don't they need to breath?\n\nAh stage fog. I love stage fog.\n\nWhy is that guy on fire?\n\nOh yeah I keep forgetting to look up. Performers are dropping in from the skies!\n\nJUST GO SEE IT!\n:)
