The chocolate is amazing, the homemade turtles are to die for, and so are the chocolate covered mesquite almonds. \n\nOne problem. The owner is not friendly and has no sense of humour. I want to love my local chocolate shop...but instead I feel like I have put him out by showing up, no banter, no smiles, just business. Many visits, always the same...\n\nDisappointing. Chocolate should be fun right?
