Just got a D grade health inspection in June 2016 from Maricopa County Environmental Services.  With violations with sushi chefs not washing hands properly after touching food encrusted curtains, having hydrogen peroxide bottles next to chocolate syrup at the prep station, and not having proper temperatures for foods. This place is food poisoning waiting to happen.
