The pizza is fine, though definitely greasy.\n\nThe reason for the 1-star rating is the service.  The delivery driver threw a fit when I refused to tip him because he hadn't followed my simple delivery instructions (which has resulted in me never getting delivery on various previous orders, so it's important).  He wouldn't give me my pizza, demanded a tip, and we felt threatened.  I explained calmly that I was sorry, but following the instructions was very important, because of the issues that can and do arise.  He ignored me, and kept demanding a tip.  He acted like he had done me a favor by even being willing to deliver my pizza (You're a delivery driver.  That's your job).  Finally, I took the pizza from him, said \"Take care,\" and closed the door in his face (not much choice given his forceful proximity).\n\nHe then CALLED ME using the cell phone on file.  Talk about a privacy violation!  I didn't answer, of course.  Then, he texted me, yelling at me.  He sent me multiple texts over the next few hours, all extremely rude.  I was polite, but firm.  I even gave him the out of saying I was going to assume he was just having a bad night, but he just kept on.  Clearly, that's just how he is.  And, he was literally the rudest delivery person I've EVER dealt with.  In Pittsburgh, that's saying something.\n\nThe food isn't worth it.  Go somewhere else.  There's no reason to pay to be harassed.  One more call or text, and we'll be making a report to the police.
