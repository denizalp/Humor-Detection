Found a gem in this plaza! Everything was fresh and mixed right in front of my eyes! Start with base, sides, proteins, mix-ins, sauces and finally toppings. If you are hungry, your bowl\/burrito will be gigantic! XD \n\nTheir proteins are high quality and freshness on the sides. Soft shell crab is very unique and rarely see it in any other poke shop. More than 9 toppings, tamako\/sweet eggs, tobikos, fried onions, roasted garlics and etc. \n\nStaff are friendly and kinda dance with the songs played in the restaurant. \n\nFree WiFi here!
