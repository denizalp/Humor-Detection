I love Tory Burch! I own a few bags and shoes so I'm a fan!\n\nColor and decor of the store is bright orange and gold, it's a teeny store but who cares, you can find accessories, shoes and clothes...and a sales section.\n\nIf you bring in your better half he can sip on a Corona while you try on your favorite shoes! \n\nI was in here trying on some cute canvas flats but sadly the fit was not right.  Service was wonderful and cheery.  I love a staff that can treat me like royalty!\n\nI'll be back.
