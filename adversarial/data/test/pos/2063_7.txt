Meh. BWW just isn't all that good. And this location seems particularly bad. The service was incredibly slow. We even actually had to go hunt down a server to ask for drink refills and silverware. We ordered a multiple of food to share and we never received any plates or anything.\n\nThe wings were really bad quality and too greasy. The ranch and blue cheese dipping sauces were bleh. The salad was alright. The buffalo mac 'n' cheese was just mac 'n' cheese with buffalo tenders on top. The potato chip nachos were meh. It just wasn't good food.
