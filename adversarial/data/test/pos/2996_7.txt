Keepin it simple.\n\nBurgers were great. Absolutely great. And if I rated just on burgers, I'd give this place five stars. But I dont.\n\nI was really bummed they didn't have the cheese ale fries - which I heard was fantastic. Who runs out of cheese at a burger place?!?\n\nService was odd. They were friendly...however having six different people come up to you every five minutes with your mouth full of burger was slightly excessive. It passed the point of being attentive to the point where it seemed they were rushing us out...even though there were only two other groups of people there. \n\nLittle pet peeve of mine - employees with cellphones will always create a negative experience for me.\n\nMoving on...ketchup bar!\n\nToasted Marshmallow - disgusting.  It was a cross between vanilla yogurt and icing. Think and runny.\n\nRagin Cajun - nice with a little kick!\n\nThai Ketchup - it was good! Maybe could use a bit more spice.\n\nChipotle Mayo - It's no Copper Blue's,  but it's pretty good.\n\nIn conclusion,  I must admit I like this new little burger place. But perhaps I'll do To-Go next time.
