No Slut Shaming\n\nI finally received the opportunity to try the highly anticipated, obsessively over hyped, also known for its extremely long  lines (especially after a night of twerking in 5 inch heels at Marquee) since opening in Las Vegas 2016, alleged best egg sandwich in LA \"E G G S L U T...\"\n\nI'm not a fan of poached eggs so I passed on the specialty slut but the Fairfax was right up my Pescatarian alley! For nearly $9 bucks this vegetarian egg sandwich consist of cage-free soft scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions and sriracha mayo in a warm brioche bun. As delicious as this sandwich is... honestly its just an egg sandwich! Would I order it a gain absolutely! Would I wait in line 1 1\/2 hours... absolutely not!
