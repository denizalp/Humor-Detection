This is definitely my favorite spot to get pho in Vegas. I have been to many others but they're all either too salty, soup is not hot enough, or that they just put way too much MSG that I can just tell after I taste the soup. The service here is great and offered us water right when we sat down. I was the only one in my group to order pho and thought that they would only give me a small slice of lime like most places but instead, they gave me 2 big slices and they were super juicy
