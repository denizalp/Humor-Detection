Felicia is absolutely amazing! I've known her for so long so I knew I could trust her with my hair. I came into her salon with an Ombre. It was dark ( almost black) on my roots and the bottom was blonde. My goal is to to get completely blonde all over. I know this is a process since my natural color is so dark. The last hair stylist I went to raised her prices and told me this wasn't really possible without damaging my hair. I showed Felicia a picture of how I wanted it to look. I knew it wouldn't go completely blonde right off the bat because my hair is naturally so dark, but oh my gosh, we were close! It looks amazing and I absolutely love it! All of my friends even complimented and told me how good it looks now! She really cares about her clients and will be honest with you if it was something that she wouldn't recommend or is not good for your hair. You won't be disappointed when you go see her.
