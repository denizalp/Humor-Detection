this place is a danger zone for your wallet. go if you are able to exercise restraint. i went in here yesterday for the sole purpose of browsing but came away with a dress by \"pink martini\" (ooh la la! i love their dresses. this is the second one in less than a month). \nthey're reasonably priced clothes and you can find some great deals. the only downside is that there's two dressing rooms and no mirror inside. i had the misfortune of having to wait on \"oh MA GAWD that dress looks sooooo like cute on you\" chicks yesterday. once inside with my small pile of dresses, i had to sheepishly check myself out in the communal mirror and i'm pretty sure i got judged by the annoying girls that i had been glaring at a few minutes before. so if you want to try on stuff, make sure you don't have to meet anyone right after!
