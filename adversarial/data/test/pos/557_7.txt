I visited Ishi tonight with some fellow yelpers (Megan P., BJ S, and Sam P) tonight and I was pleasantly surprised with the selection even if the inside was a bit grungy :) .  Our waitress was great - she had some awesome recommendations and I was very very pleased with her suggestions. I was barely able to eat the two rolls I ordered there was so much food and the display was very aesthetically pleasing!  I'd honestly rate this as a 3.5 experience, but because the service was great, I bumped it to 4.   If you are in the university area and want a low key sushi place, I'd recommend swinging by.
