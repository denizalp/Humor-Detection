Just tried sending my boyfriend, a guest at the Hotel this week, allergy meds and some goodies to make him feel a little better and was hung up on by the gift shop after my first call and then left on hold so long with the front desk after trying to order from their amenity menu (a simple order of dark chocolate covered strawberries @ 5\/$20) that I've decided to just order from an outside vendor.  \n\nThis was for a man who practically LIVES in Hilton properties and am so disappointed I couldn't get Benadryl (sold out) or any allergy med, saline spray, or dark chocolate besides Hershey's sent up to him.  They DID have Visine for $10 and was trying to add to the order when I was hung up on by Elizabeth after listening to her with another customer and didn't even ask if I was still on the phone before slamming the receiver.  \nCustomer service: XX FAIL XX\n\nThanks a lot, Laura at the Front Desk and Elizabeth in the Gift Shop, ****NOT****.\n\nMy boyfriend gets a full day stuck in \"miserable\" because your \"hospitality\" was far from professional, \"hospitable\", or thorough while trying to place a simple order before his work day.\n\nMaybe the HOSPITALITY business isn't where you two belong.  I'm glad it wasn't anything more important.
