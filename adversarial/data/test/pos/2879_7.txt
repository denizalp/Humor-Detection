Motor dogg here! Been a long time since I've done a review, quite frankly got tired of some of the yelpers out there complaining about how the ice was not cold enough in their glass! So here's a real review. Get your pimply face over to La Ristra. This place is better than Los Dos Molinos and The Blue Adobe.  I had the blue corn enchilada dinner  with beef and Christmas Style sauce and the pinto beans.  All I can say is wow!! Flavor country my friend......and a fried egg on top? Get outta town!!! Now for all of you gringos this is New Mexican style food.......look it up. Most New Mexican style food has one to two flavor profiles in a dish. But La Ristra has kicked it up a huge notch. So when you get there try the Green Chile Beer with the chips n salsas.  Now if you think tomatoes are hot or the salsa they serve at your local Garcias is muy caliente (real hot for those of you who don't habla) then order the taco with ketchup and go grow a pair then come back. However if you like it spicy and a delicious mouth watering burn then hall yourself and your squeeze down to the Ristra.  Oh........and make sure you bring an appetite. Oh and Kristina it's NEW MEXICAN  food! And yea I know.......HALL IS SPELLED WROng!
