I've been coming here since September and it has been a great experience and a big help towards me living a healthier life. The cost is a bonus as well. \n\nThe biggest negative is other patrons who for whatever reason refuse to follow rules (such has wiping down machines when they finish). I wish the staff would crack down on this a little bit but overall I am happy with my membership.
