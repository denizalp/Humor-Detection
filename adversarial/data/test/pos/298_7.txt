Wouldn't take our dogs anywhere else. We have two mischievous dogs who get into things more than they should thus frequenting the vet more than most. Dr Brooks is very knowledgeable, helpful and you can tell how much he loves the pets. We've had a few after hours issues, it's so nice to have a doctor you can trust anytime of day or night. They never try to take advantage of you or sell you anything unneeded and have been able to \"squeeze\" us in when needed. I've never been happier with a vet!
