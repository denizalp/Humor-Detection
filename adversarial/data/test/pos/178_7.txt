Same location, new name but same smiling faces. Stopped in for the first time since the facelift and re vamping of the cafe. Another cool new twist would be the handcrafted from scratch drinks they are providing. Stop in and find out what's new with your old favorite.  I got my usual Thai tea smoothie. It was perfect and long over due. Can't wait to come back again and see what else has developed since they are still getting the cafe ready. There is new seating too which gives the places a different look and feel. Come check it out.
