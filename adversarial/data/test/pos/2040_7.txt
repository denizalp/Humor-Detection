Place is so good in it's own unforgiveable bourgeois way that I can easily see how it can motivate masses to skip paying taxes or even rob banks. Trust me, their scallops are that criminally good. The service makes you feel like Prince William is your redheaded step-brother and they have been waiting on the edge of the seat to wait on your hand and foot. Did I believe that my salmon was helicoptered in this morning from some cold Norway? Yes, it was. For its all $36 worth I plan to believe in that story and you'd better do the same. I thought place is the best in summer when you can sip on the cocktails and watch Cleveland skyline from the deck but turns out it's absolutely magical in winter as well. \nAnd for those who are still circling the dating drains: yes it is worth to take a girl here on a date. First of all, she will appreciate it more than some authentic discounted Asian noodles facing the kitchen in Tremont; and secondly, no she is not going to think you own a borehole in Middle East and will buy her Gucci every weekend. Why not? Maybe because she googled you in and out. Or if not maybe because you drove her there in the Honda with a mileage equal to 3 trans-Atlantic flights. Regardless she will never forget Pie W. Or you.
