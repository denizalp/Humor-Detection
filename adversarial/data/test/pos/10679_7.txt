5:30 in the morning comes too early for me, but somehow I'm a year and a half in and still look forward to each morning workout at MUV. Jhon's creative and thoughtful approach to physical movement is balanced with fun and playfulness, and his crew of instructors create a welcoming, supportive atmosphere that is unlike any traditional gym. It's fun, challenging, addictive, and - most importantly - accessible for people of all fitness levels.\n\nThere's also a slight chance that sometime soon Jhon will confess that he's been secretly training us to be an elite ninja strike force. \n\nAnd he has a Tiger.
