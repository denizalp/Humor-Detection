I called and talked to somebody about ordering a cake for my dogs birthday.  They said, \"No problem, we will have it ready for you today.\"  Now, a typical person would believe that to mean you will have your cake ready for you when you go to pick it up.  So, I leave work to go pick it up and this is not even close to me.  I get there and the doors are locked.  I look around and see a post it note on the door saying, \"Sorry cake guy, hospital issues.\"  I understand that things happen, but at least give me a call and at the very least, use my name!  Luckily, Boneappetit in Ahwatukee was able to accomadate me with a couple of pupcakes in a pinch.  My point: I never even got to check out their store or products, but I would never go back because of the terrible customer service I received.
