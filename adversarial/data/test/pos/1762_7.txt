Yes, this was my first Yelp Event and yes, I feel like a better person for attending!\n\nLuckily, Satay is down the street from work so I got here very fast and walked in to see Misti Y. and her husband Bobby working their tails off to set up!  Yelpers enjoyed the whole patio, and tables were sprinkled with Yelpilicious items, including buttons, chapstick (see my Yelp Career Fair Review for my excitement over chapstick), bottle-opener keychains, and Yelp madlib bar napkins.\n\nI was able to meet a large number of rather awesome Yelpers so it I probably shouldn't name names, but I was so happy to finally meet some \"regulars\" aka Matthew C., Raymond B., and Blair B. whose reviews I really admire *blush*\n\nThe food was yummy - a smorgasbord of satay with peanut sauce and cucumber salad, spicy hot wings with raw jalepenos (love those suckers), crab rangoons, roti with curry sauce, samosas, edamame and veggie eggrolls.  We also enjoyed Singha beer towers (those things are enormous!)  I had to rely on Bobby's beer \"pouring\" skills for a full glass.  I also tried an Asian pear\/sake cocktail with a cucumber (delicious).  Misti Y. named a cocktail the \"Yelpish Red\" and it was enjoyed by all.\n\nSatay really set us up with a good deal - their happy hour is $3 appetizers, $3 house wines, $5 martinis and tropical cocktails\/Yelpish Red Special drink, $24 beer towers, etc.  Our bartender was awesome and he set up Santana on a giant sound system outside.  Jay-son who I believe owns\/manages Satay checked on us, mingled, and gave us all coupons for our next visit.\n\nI had a great time and definitely would return to check out the rest of the menu.  I peeked inside and the interior is very nice.  I have to say that the peanut sauce and the raw jalepenos rocked my world.  I think I scared Blair B.'s husband a bit when he saw me down a few raw jalepenos - but I never claimed to be normal! :)\n\nCan't wait for the next one!!!
