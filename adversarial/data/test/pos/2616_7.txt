We chose this vet because Dr Gillus is a vet there and he owns a frenchie boston terrier mix.  Frenchies can have a lot of issues so we felt more comfortable.  But we'd heard positive things about the hospital as well.  We've been here several times since we bought fonzy and more recently fifi home and have been very pleased with the care they've been given.   We have seen two other vets too and they were great as well.  Great explanations and seems thorough.  I highly recommend you give this place a whirl for your pet's health care needs.
