We returned here for dinner with friends after a long absence.  A bowl of New England Clam Chowder was good but rather floury.  And Diane never received the Oyster Crackers she asked for to stir in her chowder.\n\nChicken Lettuce Wraps with fresh leaves of lettuce, an Asian sauce, and marinated chunks of chicken mixed with pieces of celery and water chestnuts were excellent as always.  My Seared Ahi Salad was also fresh and plentiful.  I would order this dish again.  But it took a long while for me to receive the Soy Sauce I had specially requested.\n\nSo, other than a couple of nettlesome service errors, this was an enjoyable dining experience.\n\nXXX-1\/2 stars overall!
