Here's what I like about this place:\n- Great atmosphere.  Someone got inspired by the cut glass in the storefront window and did a great job of running with that as a theme throughout.  Everyone looks great in this lighting and it's easy on the eye.\n\n- Artovision.  No television, but a tv that is just displaying interesting old ads and art work.  Nice.\n\n- Interesting beers.  I don't even know what I had, but it was good.  I think they have rotating craft beers on tap.\n\n- Nice size for a neighbourhood pub.\n\n- Critical mass.  On a friday night, the bar was nicely full.
