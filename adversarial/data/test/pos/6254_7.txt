It's a small theatre. It's a great theatre.\n\nIs parking free? Yes. \nDo they have beer and wine available? Oh, yeah.\nDo they tend to cast hilarious actors and productions? But, of course, good sir. \nWill I laugh? If you don't, you most likely don't have a soul. \n\nRecently came to preview The Divine Sister and loved it. Hilarious. The setting is super intimate -- the audience is basically part of the show as the stage is rather close to the seats. \n\nOther items of note:\n\nBathrooms. Rather cozy and roomy. I'm a fan of a good bathroom and try to mentally bookmark where they are across town. This one goes in that book for sure. \n\nLounge\/Atrium. Tons of seating and plenty of space to grab a beer and wait for the show to start. \n\nStoked to come check out another production very, very soon.\n\nBottom line, I love this theatre. Great people work behind the scenes here and I'm happy to support the arts in Charlotte!
