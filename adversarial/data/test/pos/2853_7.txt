Never again...this place is awful. I walked in on an 88 degree day, there was no AC on. Since this is a family run joint, I didn't let the warm room discourage me. Ok...don't let the nail polish bottles on the wall fool you. The selection of colors is minimal because they're all old or empty. I got a pedicure and manicure...the lady did an ok job but I did not see her sterilize anything. The people who work there are not the nicest either...save your money or go elsewhere.
