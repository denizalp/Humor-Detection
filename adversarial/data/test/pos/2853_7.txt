This place is either the best example of how to launder money or the worst example of how to run a business. Here is the executive summary:\nThe Good: The equipment (at least until recently) The equipments  are top of the line brand names, at least until recently, when they started to remove them for trendy apparatus that no one uses, but would make the manager the highest amount of commission.\nThe bad: Well where to start? the Locker rooms are filthy and a contagious disease waiting to happen, this is more evident specially during the weekends. And this is not due to lack of staff. In this place even the assistants have assistants. But no one seems to work in this place no matter which department. Whether its custodial, cleaning or accounting. Most likely because this place changes more manager than banana republics change presidents and none of them seem to have any business or managerial training. There are seldom a trainer on duty during the weekends as it should be. Whatever you do, DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR CC NUMBER! they would charge you for anything and everything that they think of. Of course they would reverse the charges when you confront them but at the cost of your precious time and sanity. The trainers are there for one reason and one reason only to push expensive training sessions on clients. It's a shame because the gym used to be very good one, but it has gone down year after year. I used to be a member for 5 years but could not take it anymore. Do yourself a favor and check out other gyms in the area they are all better whether its quality wise or  price wise!
