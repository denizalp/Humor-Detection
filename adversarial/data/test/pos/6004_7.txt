Amazing beef inbetween 2 buns that melt in your mouth like an atomic mission completed successfully on taste buds that scream for more.\nCali fries didn't disappoint, although I would've preferred a little less sauce but I'm sure if it were served with not enough sauce, then I'd be wishing for a little more..damn humans! Never satisfied.\n\nSpeaking of satisfaction, this place meets the crave of the traditional cheeseburger with a 'BUH-BANG' because like any secret to a great meal, it's best when it's made fresh right after you order. \n\nWhen you arrive, head up to the counter, place your order-the menu is laid out simple enough so we can decide real quick, pay and chow down to the beef and cheese classic that holds comfort in my heart under the category 'food'.
