Do not send your children to this \"school\"my daughter was here  for a few days and I had enough... She was a new student for kindergarten; first day school she was dissmis without verification of who was picking her up( so safety it is not in this school at all) and she was not the only child involved on the same incident; what they did about it????? Nothing...The Director never take his sunglasses off to speak with parents ( I don't know what is he hidden behind those sunglasses)please C get educate.. Oh and I was told from him (C) that I was not allow to call to found out how was my daughter,that the phone was for business only.... Them I told to myself and ask . What kind of world  are we leaving today? A Catholic school. What kind of education are you teaching to the students?What kind of love are you showing to the students and God? When you are not allow to call to the school to see how if your love ones?Love , Involve & Care if the better way to show your love to your Love ones... You can talk a lot but if you don't show it does not exist
