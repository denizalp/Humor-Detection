I'm not a fan of this location! I literally had to flag someone down for assistance. Employees walked by and did not say a word. I waited in a line to pay, which is annoying to say the least. Then they push you ti sign up for the credit card, which I already have. To add to all that, they didn't take off a sensor on one of my items, so now I have to go back tomorrow just to get that taken off.
