Would someone please tell sales associate 6, aka Erik, that is NOT polite to tell a customer she looks stressed and that no one needs to hear out of the blue that he has grout in his feet and is in a lot of pain.\n\nThe last time I shopped at this Petco, the cashier (a different one) seemed nervous, distracted and reeked like alcohol. I asked if if he had been drinking and he didn't answer me.\n\nI think I'm done with this Petco and will continue to shop at Petsmart. Their prices are better, anyway....
