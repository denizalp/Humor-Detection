I wish I could give this place zero stars.\n\nI returned to Sonic after my first review because I saw a bunch of people sitting in the outdoor seating area, and I thought, \"Maybe they got their act together.\"\n\nI went through the drive-thru to get a large Cherry-Limeade--probably the best thing Sonic does.  I didn't order anything else.  That was all--one large Cherry-Limeade.  The dude on the drive-thru mic asked me if I wanted to make a Route 44 size for ten cents more.  I love a good upsell as much as anyone--sold, my friend.\n\nI pulled forward and there was only one car in line in front of me.  It was parked at the window.  I pulled up and waited.\n\nAnd waited.\n\nAnd waited.\n\nAfter 5 minutes, I thought about pulling away, but figured I'd gut it out if for no other reason than this review.\n\nSo I waited some more.\n\nAnd waited.\n\nAnd waited...  \n\nAfter thirteen minutes--yes: 1 3 m i n u t e s....Thirteen long, dull, pointless minutes where there was no interaction at all at the window.  Two other cars were stacked up behind me. I could tell from the body language that the girls in the car in front of me were angry.\n\nFinally, someone shows up at the window and starts passing bags of food through to the two girls in front of me.  It was at least six or seven bags, and a four-carrier of shakes.  \n\nI'm sorry--if you have a large drive-thru order like that, you pull the car to a parking spot to wait.  You don't make a dude wait thirteen minutes for one freakin' Cherry-Limeade.  That's Basic Drive-Thru 101.  If you can't get that simple thing together, your business is screwed.\n\nI finally get to the window and the dude at the window says, \"You had three shakes, right?\"\n\nI said no. \"A large Cherry-Limeade.\"\n\nHe turns to another guy.  \"Can I get a large Cherry-Limeade, right away?\"\n\nSERIOUSLY?  I wait thirteen freakin' minutes for a single friggin' drink and you don't even have it ready when I get there?  Oh, screw you, Sonic of Sun Prairie.  When your crappy restaurant goes belly-up, I will be there to dance in front of your For Sale sign.\n\nThis place has been open for MONTHS. There is no excuse for incompetence like this.  \n\nI finally get my drink--more than 15 minutes after my initial order.  Fifteen minutes for one large drink, folks.  And they still charged me full-price.  And my Route 44 upsell was completely forgotten.\n\nIf the owner of that Sonic ever reads Yelp:  Hey, dude--sell out to someone who knows what the they are doing.  Running a fast-food restaurant isn't hard. I know--I did it for three years, successfully, mind you.  Your employees are lost. Your food is lacking. And sitting in a drive-thru for fifteen minutes is unforgivable.  Even Culver's will burn people through in less than ten minutes.\n\nGo away, Sonic.  You're bad at your job.
