This place is very clean and neatly decorated. They have gluten free pancakes available, of more than one kind! That was a nice surprise because I miss ordering pancakes for breakfast. Service was a bit slow, but the place was busy at 1030 on a weekday and I wasn't in a hurry, so it wasn't a big deal. I would recommend this place if you happen to be in the area.
