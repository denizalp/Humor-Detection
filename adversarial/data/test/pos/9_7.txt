Oh NYPD, two steps forward- three steps backwards. I only wish your pizza wasn't good, it would be easier to never go back. \n\nI placed a phone takeout order and was quoted 20-25 minutes for my large pizza and garlic knots on a Sunday night. I get there 35 minutes later and walk in and wait to be acknowledged at the take-out area. There were five employees behind the counter, all facing the kitchen line. No one could be bothered to look towards the entrance to maybe greet customers. After five long minutes a guy turns his head to the side and yells out \"Hey- my man!\" Which apparently is NYPD speak for \"Good evening- how may I help you?\"  The man never asked if I needed help- and instead went back to staring at the kitchen staff working away. \n\nFinally after ten minutes a different employee saw me and asked if I needed help. I have him my name and paid for my food. He silently walked away and went back to staring at the kitchen crew. It seemed like there was zero leadership working. It looked like a member of management was back in the kitchen- working hard helping make wings and other food- which I admire, but there was no one in front of house- which was a disaster. \n\nAfter 55 minutes, my food was given to me. Not one word was mentioned as to why it took so long, or God forbid an apology offered. Just \"here's your pizza\". Now I realize it's a first world problem when pizza is taking 55 Minutes, and I also understand sometimes things happen. What I cannot understand is the complete and utter lack of customer service. If things are going wrong in the kitchen- or they are behind, etc- just say so. We are all human. I'd get it. But say SOMETHING. To act like it's normal that a simple order takes an hour while everyone avoids talking to customers is insane.  If it is so busy the manager has to help cook, then someone needs to be designated as front of house- and meet the needs of customers. It is inexcusable that five employees are standing with their backs to customers and no one can be bothered to greet people and expedite orders.  If things have gone so bad in the kitchen- then someone needs to take care of the customers and explain what's going on- and apologize. Offer a free dessert maybe. Or comp something. Do anything, other than ignore your customers and when they finally get their food act like everything is normal. \n\nIt doesn't matter how good the food is, if it's a total\nnightmare to try and get it. The level of apathy is off the charts here. This NYPD location is where customer service goes to die. Skip it, you'll thank me.
