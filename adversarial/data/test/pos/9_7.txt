Such a cute restaurant! There are vegan and vegetarian options! \nWe ordered the Koshari which has rice, lentils, elbow pasta, chickpeas and tomato sauce. Great flavor. You have to order that! We also ordered the Cauliflower Shawarma which is also good. To finish up our meal, we had  a Qahwa which is their version of a turkish coffee. Will come back to try other options!
