LOVE LOVE LOVE!  \n\nAfter recently moving to Charlotte, I was having anxiety about who would be able to maintain my blonde highlights and cut because I am quite picky.  After speaking with a delightful employee on the phone, I made an appointment with Edward, as I was told he was the best when it comes to blondes.  My color came out PERFECT.  By perfect I mean 100% spot on.  The color itself was multidimensional, vibrant, and even all around. Charlie gave me a fabulous blow-out after Edward was finished.  I look forward to my next visit at Salon 1226.\n\nWell done!
