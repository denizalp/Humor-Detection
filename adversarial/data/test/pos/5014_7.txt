Pino is a decent place to relax for a drink but it seems to be struggling with an identity crisis of \"am I a pub? am I a restaurant? am I a lounge?\" - and it was indeed a bit odd that such a huge venue was relatively empty on a rainy Friday night. especially since the rain didn't seem to be stopping the crowds on Crescent Street from going to other places.\n\nthey have an outdoor seating area upstairs with a long canopy over it - this was great, because we got the cool fresh air and none of the rain. and it's actually fairly spacious, wrapping around the entire place (it's on the corner). \n\nI ordered some of the house white wine. it was about average, though it also was fairly cheap, so I'm not complaining too much. service was pretty fast too.\n\nthe fact that it is so roomy here might have made it seem less busy than it was. there were plenty of patrons up near us, but there were two HUGE rooms inside (on the second floor alone) that were empty. what gives? maybe they focus more on large-scale events.\n\nseems like an alright place to relax for a drink or two, but not much more. I like low-key, but it was a bit too low-key for me.
