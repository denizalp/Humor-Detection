Holy shit show. We waited 20 mins to be seated. With open tables everywhere. They kept saying we don't have a hostess. They wouldn't let me order a burger and sub a chicken patty. \n\nWaiter: we don't have chicken patties\nMe: but you have a chicken burger on the menu.\nWaiter: yes, but we can't use the patty for burger style you want. \n\nWe've been here a million times and they have always done it. Place is under new management. Asked for the manager contact info and he said they don't have any of those.
