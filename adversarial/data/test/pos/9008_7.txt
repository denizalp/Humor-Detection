I don't really get this place. It's absolutely lovely, the location is awesome, and if you want to grab lunch and then browse books, you would be wise to try this place. \nBut the food...? I am not a picky eater by a long shot but I found this menu limited and unappealing. I finally chose the BLT salad, but it was way overthought--a hunk of iceberg topped with tomatoes and bacon and, it seems, barbecue sauce? It was not the light lunch I anticipated. \nThe fried green tomatoes appetizer was kind of good but similarly overwrought, what with the pimiento spread. \nOur (adorable) waiter explained that the food concept was \"Southern but not really Southern\" and I guess I would have to agree with that. I hail from south of the Mason Dixon, and this strikes me as food that some Yankee on a highfalutin cooking show would think is Southern. \nI am not at all tempted to return, at least until they round out the menu with some more solid, traditional, Southern-inflected classics.
