Update:After careful consideration, Timo's has reached out to me to indicate that they have removed their Foie Gras item.  I feel that this is a responsible decision based on their part and this reflects their standards as a business.  Therefore, I am removing my past rating and replacing them with what I truly feel that they deserve.  I will revisit and am more than positive that I will have a stellar dining experience.  Thank you, Timo's.
