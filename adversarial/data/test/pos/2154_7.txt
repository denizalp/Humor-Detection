Despite the fact that all the servers look like maybe they just got sexually assaulted, the wings are not bad.  They used to be better and then I imagine they got a new cook or fired one that realized they were too good to be working at The Vine. \n\nI've heard a lot of people say they ordered the gyros or the fish tacos or some kind of french dip and were THOROUGHLY disappointed.  Of course you were disappointed, the place you're eating at has pictures of Smirnoff vodka on the tables and is serving two dollar Long Islands while some ASU  douche bag is doing Karaoke to a really dated Kid Rock song: YOU'RE AT A BAR, ORDER BAR FOOD.  Order a burger or fries or something fucking fried, don't order the sea bass entree at a place with a three dollar cover on weekends and drunk dudes playing pool in the corner, asshole. \n\nThat said, the wings are actually worth a trip to The Vine as are the dirt cheap drink specials.  I am a fan of three dollar Long Islands, and appreciate the fact that they're drinks are stuff.  I also notice that if you go here during off hours, like during a weekday, instead of putting on satellite radio they will play an album straight through.  One time I heard them play the entire Blue album.    \n\nThe Vine is good for very specific things; happy hour drinks, wings, late night shot specials.  Don't come here and expect more than that.  Don't come here when they're not running specials because paying full price for The Vine is going to piss you off considering the quality.  Don't come here with your Mom on Karaoke night and don't bother if you're offended by servers that look like they auditioned for Rock of Love (but are notably friendly and not at all incompetent).  Also, don't come here and take 19 Jager shots then punch your boyfriend in the face in The Vine parking lot after he got your car towed for parking at the nearby Wendy's.
