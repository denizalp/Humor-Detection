I have never been so utterly turned off from a company by shady practices so fast before in my life. \nLet me explain.\n\nI own a home in Dobson Ranch that we purchased over a year ago. My cousin lives in a smaller town several hours outside of the city and decided to move to Phoenix. I mentioned to her after she secured employment that I noticed a house right down the street from mine (4 houses down approximately) that had been available for at least a month or more, and it was worth driving by to call the company. \n\nWe drove by the home for rent and my cousin called. The home was still for sale and we were directed to the website. We both searched several times and could not find the home listed on the Renter's Warehouse website. We tried to call several times, and it was very difficult for her to get a hold of someone, during business hours and after (either times). My cousin was able to get a hold of someone and we tried for several days to arrange to look at the home. My cousin finally got a confirmation that a woman would be showing me the home tonight at 6pm. At approximately 5:30 I was concerned because it was starting to get dark already and if there was no electricity in the home we would not be able to take pictures to send to my cousin, let alone even see our phones in front of our faces.\n\nWhen I walked a few houses down to the front of the property, there was what seemed to be a family standing out front. I assumed maybe this was who I was meeting and started a conversation only to learn that it was two other separate families also waiting to see the home.\n\nThe woman that pulled up to show us the house, by the name of Rae, first of all, was late. I was polite but mentioned to her it would have been nice to know other people were interested in the rental. What was interesting is my cousin said if the walk through was good she was applying immediately and wanted to know if anyone else was interested in the house. Whomever my cousin spoke to assured her no one else wanted this place? She said that she \"Always shows her homes this way\" and that I looked familiar to her. I responded I couldn't possibly be familiar in the slightest, I had never talked to her and I was viewing the home for my cousin. She said \"I'm sorry if you feel uncomfortable\" - with her tone of voice it was a little off-putting and I explained it was not about being uncomfortable at all, it was simply the fact of being knowledgeable about a situation I was walking into, and I liked to be prepared.\n\nWalking into the home I asked about electricity due to it being dark. SURPRISE, no electricity in the house. She ran around frantically and opened the blinds, explaining that \"Oh I opened the blinds so YOU CAN SEE.\" If she could have been any more facetious I would be shocked. She was downright rude. \n\nAfter the three separate parties including myself looked around IN THE DARK I tried to take a few pictures and tried calling my cousin to let her know my concerns. The woman (who did hand me a business card, which I guess was the only positive thing) started rambling off fees and how the process is first come first serve. Basically making us feel like the whole process was a competition so whomever put in their application fee (non-refundable) would be the first person to get the home for rent as long as they had credit scores over 600. Regardless of credit scores, she said if your score was less than this, they can still work with you, but only if you are honest. She rambles on about a previous customer who had a Harley Davidson repossessed, blah blah blah.\n\nI still can't get over how rude this woman was. Because we are renters and it's a good market she felt the need to say AGAIN as I was walking out the door loud enough for all the other prospective renters to hear \"I'm so sorry you felt UNCOMFORTABLE!!!!!\"\n\nI don't know if this woman realized I was also checking this company out so that I could possibly rent my home out to them next month, but it doesn't matter. I called my cousin immediately to tell her to NOT PUT IN an application with this company. Especially after reading their reviews I can be sure of two things happening:\n\n1. If she put an application in for this home, she probably wouldn't get the home and would have lost out on at least 50$ if not $100 for her and her husband both to apply.\n2. Once I type this review on Yelp, KEVIN O will be responding on behalf of the company, because he literally argues with other customers regarding their yelp review.\n3. I will never, ever, recommend this company to any fellow homeowners or anyone prospectively looking to rent a home in the Phoenix area. \n\nI've been a renter for 15 years and a homeowner for almost 2 years, and I've never received worse customer services, from the very first impression. \n\nTERRIBLE.
