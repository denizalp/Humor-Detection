Butcher? Sayyyy what? They make their own sausages? \n\nI'm down, like 5 clowns. \n\nNo seriously though. We hit up Meating on Queen in Leslieville for a couple of so-sa-ges to bbq with the friends. Not a large spot, but has that typical butcher feel that you seek when you're on your way there. \n\nThey have a ginoooooormous amount of sausages. I'm talking a case from one end of the wall to the other, all of which are made in store. From your typical flavor flavs to some exotic and speciality ones such as the Ecuadorian. We went with two of those. I can't even really tell you what was in it. The dude behind the counter told us at the time but all I know is it was fabulous. Two reasons that make it a bomb sausage: it's massive, like to the point you need a custom made bun. Which brings me to my second reason, they have the homemade custom buns there for you to purchase along with your meat. Winna winna sausage dinna. \n\nIf you're ever in that neck of the woods, you should definitely check it out. The have fresh cuts of local meat as well as numerous baked goods to boot. Super cheap too!
