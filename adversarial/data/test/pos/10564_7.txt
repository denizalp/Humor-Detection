It's funny because I agree with each and every statement Katrina L. has made about this place...\n\n- Back alley potholes and metal staircases are a stupid idea for a club\n- The bathroom setup is a bit stupid and awkward with the woman's bathroom consisting of two (SMALL AS HELL) stalls\n- Cover was $10 which I guess is normal for most clubs but I typically go to dive bars with little or no cover\n-There is also no bank machine in the club\n\nDespite all of this I chose to give it 3 stars because:\n- I was expecting the worse of the worse for a bar in clubland and I had a blast here\n- There was no lineups and no attitude at the door\n- The atmosphere was cozy and didn't feel pretentious \n- I thoroughly enjoyed the decor\n- They didn't have coat check but the bartender let us put our stuff behind her bar for the entire night\n- Although some of the transitions were a bit awkward I felt the music was a good mix of new music and old school classics (I actually screamed out to a friend \"didn't this song play at our grade 8 graduation?!\"\n\nIn the end clubland is not my cup of tea but it's nice to know that if I must venture there I have a few options that won't make me want to kill myself!
