Of all of the many poke places that I've tried since they've started popping up like flowers in the spring, Calii Love is the one that feels like the first dandelion growing on your lawn. It appears as a cute flower when you first see it, but turns out to be a weed. \n\nIt's a clean looking establishment with all the looks that us Yelp-ing hipsters love. That simple aesthetic and allure of healthy food was enough to pull me in. I've had many poke bowls before so I knew exactly what I wanted here. However, unlike most of the others, Calii actually had good seating space! Thank goodness. \n\nI ordered a bowl, happily sat down, and dug in. And what I found was... disappointment. It lacked all the things that I loved about poke.\n\n Poke is an adventure in the mouth. Experiencing those different textures and flavours. The delicious, soft salmon, the fresh crunch of all the veggies, and the added flavours of various toppings. \n\nCalii's poke just felt flat on all of those fronts. Maybe you could call it a whitewashed poke. Or as if someone played broken telephone, describing a poke bowl. They have the looks of their contemporaries but not the flavour. \n\nPerhaps I'm being too harsh due to my disappointment. I expected Calii to be the end of my restless search of the perfect lunch spot. Now that I'm really thinking about it, it wasn't as terrible as I put it out to be. Just very disappointing. Overall a 2.5\/5.
