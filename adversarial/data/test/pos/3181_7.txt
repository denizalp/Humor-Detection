Wow, talk about covering all your essential food groups: grease, oil, lard, and fat. Oh, I forgot the maple syrup: pure sugary goodness. I ate waffles.. fried chicken... salmon cakes... bacon... grits... It was a food coma done right. I have to disclose that the after-effects include: waist expansion, sleepiness, and an insatiable need to be still and slothlike. \n\nDespite the health risks of eating at Lo-Lo's, it's pure bliss: a symphonic orchestra of flavors that should be experienced on a regulated basis - try once every few months.
