Where do I begin with this restaurant. I called ahead of time to make sure they were Nigerian before I ordered there. The guy I spoke to didn't even sound Nigerian. But he told me he was and that they had egusi. First red flag. Just because you have a Egusi does not make you Nigerian. I asked again because he did not sound Nigerian but he convinced me to Order there and to try out their \" fresh\"Jollof rice. The second red flag was when I looked through The pictures on Yelp and saw they had spaghetti on their rice!! no sane Nigerian would put spaghetti on rice.  I've actually never seen this before! Second red flag. \nHowever because I needed to order something because I was at work I just ordered through Uber eats. This is a warning to all Nigerians!! Their Jollof rice is abominable! So greasy they use jasmine rice not par boiled, it was greasy and nasty. Tasted like East African Somalian rice or something but way worse. They did not have puff puff and dumped spaghetti on my rice to make up for it. I wanted to scream. The plantain was mixed in the rice and very squishy. The only good thing was the goat meat but still was not prepared like our Nigerian goat. I was just so offended at the rice and spaghetti! And the lie that they were Nigerian.\nWhite people, yes you can eat here and you will enjoy it because you do not know the difference. But African people especially Nigerian people beware. Their food was so off I can't even pinpoint what country they're from. And they have the nerve to use our word \"Jollof\". Please!
