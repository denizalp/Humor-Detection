Unprofessional,\npoor service\nthey make sure you know they don't care one bit about your service, won't do anything to facilitate things, inferior to Canada Post or DHL. I would not use Purolator for anything.\nThey don't call numbers, and if they don't get you, then you can either wait a week or go to 800 Kipling, a totally inconvenient location. You have to wait all day for them and then they don't even show up and say they buzzed in when they didn't. Their dispatch says they have no way to reach their drivers - since apparently telecommunications or computer communication is too advanced for them.\n\nlike Bell Canada, they promise to call you back, and then don't.
