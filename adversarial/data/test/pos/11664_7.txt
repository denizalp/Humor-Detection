After several trips to this adorable kids' furniture boutique within the past week, I am super impressed with the level of customer service that Amie, the owner, provides.  She even met us there on a day she doesn't normally work to answer some specific questions on the products we were looking at.\n\nI woke up dreaming about the glider we are going to purchase from Huddle, so I would say that's a good sign... I wish I could share a picture, but there are not any images of the gliders on their website.  I can say with certainty, that it's one of the most comfortable and stylish gliders of all of the ones we've looked at.  There are several models in the store and there is a huge variety of fabrics you can choose from to 'design-your-own' combination!\n\nSure, this place is pricey... but it also carries the highest quality and unique baby \/ kids furniture I've seen.  They are the main distributor of the Young America \/ Stanley Furniture line.  Another plus?  It's locally owned!  I feel so much better spending my $$ at Huddle than at one of the corporate megastore chains.  \n\nOn top of a July 4th sale that they are currently having, Huddle offers free delivery and assembly of their products.  I am getting excited about the baby's room and can't wait for the crib and glider we ordered to arrive!
