A pleasant experience and professional staff\n\nGreat service, I went to FastMed Urgent Care with for a rash on my arm.  I wasn't sure how long I would have to wait, we all know how busy urgent care can be.  I signed in and filled out  the required paperwork.  The waiting room had a few people however I was called back very quickly.\n\nAfter taking my vitals I went into a patient room and the doctor arrived a few minutes later. After speaking with the doctor I was given my prescription and discharge instructions and was out the door faster then I imagined, not a bad deal for urgent care.\n\nThe staff is friendly and helpful and doctors can address any concerns you have.  When your primary care physician isn't available this is the place to go.\n\nIf you ever find yourself in need of medical care and want great service from professional health care providers who are dedicated to your wellness, look no further.
