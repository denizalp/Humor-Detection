Totally hip, totally fun, totally delicious. Servers were attentive, playful and far from uptight.  Great all around dining experience -- Vegas style!\n\nStarters:\n\nGrilled robada apricots with toasted pecan purée, shaved pork belly, watercress and crispy guanciale -- Different and tasty!\n\nWagyu beef tartar with crushed caper aoili, slow poached egg, pickled mustard seeds & crispy chocolate!  Heaven on earth!  \n\nFoie gras custard brûlée with bing cherries, toasted cocoa nibs & salted brioche -- My favorite way to have foie gras.  DAYAM it was GOOOOOD.\n\nMain Courses:\n\nMaine scallops with braised oxtail, wild mushrooms and salted caramel reduction - Fabulous-O!  Salted reduction was genius.  \n\nThe short ribs were dynamite.  They were so tender and quite the party in my mouth!  I've been dying for something like this after watching an episode of Master Chef season finale.\n\nDessert: \n\nEfferescent grape mousse with greek yogurt posset, carbonated grapes and lychee sorbet. Unique! Never seen anything like it on any menu & pretty darn amazing.  Didn't think I would like it but wanted to try it because it's so different.  What a perfect combo of balance... especially with the lychee sorbet.\n\nApple fritters with root beer panna cotta, apple cider sorbet with sassafras ice cream. This is supposed to replicate what you would get at the fair, but with a sophisticated twist.  The edible paper was so cool.  Definitely a lot of intricate details involved in crafting this piece of art.\n\nUNIQUE & EXCELLENT in every way!  Talk about creative.  Must try the grape mousse.  I was a bit nervous but the pastry chef knows what she is doing.  Complex, creative & delicious. Better move quick though because the options change with the season.\n\nAt the end of our meal we were given warm sage milk.  How fitting and perfect to help cleanse the pallet.
