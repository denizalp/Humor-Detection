Ordered: Calimari, Antipasto, Spicey Buffalo Wings, and Garlic Knots.\n\n1. Calamari (actually low grade pig rectum slices mixed with a few tentacle bits...seriously, look it up). This is D grade frozen cheap supply, sold as seafood. The only way this can be considered seafood, is if the pig was a surfer, or ate crab legs and shrimp cakes every day of its sad life, waiting to have its turd-cutter transformed into sliced overpriced greasy lies.\n\n2. Spicey Buffalo Wings. Yes, it chicken...9 of 12 wings were freezer-burned LEGS, not wings. The chewiness, freezer burn, and overall \"wet skin\" texture of the heat lamp cooked wings was more like a zombie chew toy, than a delicious chicken wing. Yuck.\n\n3.Antipasto...Romain lettuce, sliced CANNED black olives, Sliced Red Tomato, worst provolone I've ever tasted, D-rate salami, and, well, that was it...other than the water-slide water called \"Italian Dressing\" that came with it. Pepperoncini? Nope. Green olives? Negative. Flavor? Nooooooope!\n\n4. Garlic Knots. These dough balls must cheap This crap-shack in operation. Delicious? Nope...but after eating a freezer burned bouquet of bad choices, I guess a near flavorless ball of dough, low grade olive oil (not even 100% olive oil), and flavorless garlic mush, formed into a blown out balloon knot, this became the highlight of our night. \n\nIn conclusion, I'M ON VACATION, and after a long day of fun, on our last day, decided to waste $40 on straight-up garbage. I'm looking at a pile of wings, half a disabled salad, and a some pig anus rings. The Garlic Knots were superb though! If superb means lackluster bread nuggets.\n\nPs, we drove to get pickup, because delivery was going to be AN HOUR AND A HALF! We're a mile away! How many tastebud-less drones could possibly want to ingest this garbage at once? \nHopefully NOT YOU!\n\nAdd me as a friend if you \"Feel\" my review! Peace and Prosperity!
