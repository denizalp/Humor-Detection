Joining its cousins Hot Chick Safeway and Ghetto Safeway, I proudly present to you... Striving Safeway! \n\nThis Safeway is like a perfect, symbolic microcosm of what's happening in downtown Phoenix. Until a year ago or so it was a major ghetto. Now it's a nicely renovated, modernized grocery store with a few uppity elements, in a solidly ghetto environment. Just like downtown in general. The parking lot still smells like poo. But there's a full-scale Starbucks cafe inside. A few homeless dudes continue to lounge around the entrance. But some lawyer in a suit is throwing change at them as he walks by. I think you'll feel comfortable here whichever end of the spectrum you're on.\n\nEDIT: I just made up Ghetto Safeway. But Randy K just reviewed Deserted Safeway out in Mesa so the family is a growing one.
