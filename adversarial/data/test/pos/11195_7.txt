Bad bad service ! The lady in the front is rude and nasty she doesn't wash her hands! \nShe left me waiting on drive thru for an hour at 103 degrees outside! She was awful! I don't think I will ever come back here again!  I love me some good food but I also love me a good service with it!  The food is ok but they won't work with you if you want to change your order up a little!
