After reading the fantastic reviews for Cafe Summer, I decided I should give this place a try. I love me some taiyaki and egglette waffles. I've seen Yelp pictures of said items and told myself that I'd set my expectations low - they didn't look right but the many 4 and 5-star reviews brought me here.\n\nDespite having lowered expectations, I was still underwhelmed and unimpressed by the quality of their products. Some drinks look all cutesy on Instagram and shit and that's where it should stay - don't bother eating\/ drinking stuff from here. It's a waste of money, time and calories. Go get diabetes elsewhere!\n\nTaiyaki:\nLimp. Anything limp is plain sad. Nothing should be limp. A good taiyaki should have some crispness to it so it can withstand melty ice cream and toppings. To somehow compensate with this Viagra-needing cone of sadness, it's served on a wire cone. We chose Nutella, vanilla ice cream and Oreo crumb. Their Nutella filling tasted a lot more like grocery-bought chocolate pudding with a hint of Nutella. The Oreo were in chunks not crumbs but that's not too bad. This thing as a whole is bad. 1\/5\n\nEgglette Waffle:\nThis is supposed to have crisp shell and soft interior. You get a flaccid \"waffle\" on a plate. Presentation is boring and consistency is even worse. This is more like little balls of pancake. We got the matcha egglette that didn't really have much matcha flavor to it. 1\/5\n\nEach dessert costs anywhere from $5-6. It's too much considering the sub par quality you get. Sure, the service is kind of great. There was two of us and we were only given one spoon. We asked for another spoon but it never came. We took a few bites, paid and left. We vowed not to come back. Not worth the drive.
