Like many others, I am glad to see something new in the selections of restaurants on Fremont East. I have been to FGB a couple of times and like many others, I've never been overly excited about it.\n\nI won't lie to you and tell you I was excited to see it coming into view over the past few months - because truthfully I thought it was just a joke! I would have preferred to see a more local spot owned by people that might charge a bit more for a quality and unique product. Even for a burger joint, it can be done better. It's true that it's around the quality of a McDonald's .. On that I agree with other reviewers that have mentioned it.\n\nIt's new and clean and I hope they make a bunch of money, but I don't see a lot of reason to go there unless I'm truly out of options for food choices. \n\nAnyway .. HAPPY EATING !
