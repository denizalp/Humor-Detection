When you first get to the Strip, everything seems so close together. Well, there are only so few casinos and resorts between the Mandalay Bay to the Stratosphere. (Although the part of the Strip that matters most other than the one-time trip to the Stratosphere for the tower+thrill rides ends at the Wynn, unless you forget to do your research and end up staying at the Circus Circus\/Sahara.) Wrong. See, these behemoths manage to fit everything into their resort because, well, they're rather large and therefore has adequate space for everything you could possibly need if you were contained to any single one of them. So getting from one to another takes longer than you might assume at first glance.\n\nAccording to Google Maps, attempting to walk from the Mandalay Bay to the Wynn will take you 49mins (2.5mi), and the Mandalay Bay to the Stratosphere 1hr 22mins (4.2mi). I'd probably take double that time. I get distracted a lot in Vegas.\n\nEither way, if you're traveling alone or with one other person who'd also rather spend their money on great meals and entertainment than taxis, you have a solution to protect yourselves from aching feet, wasted time, and improper allocation of funds. It's called the DEUCE. I didn't care to discover this option until my sixth trip to Vegas (discounting all the times I went before I turned 21), which was a serious fail.\n\n$15 for a 3 day pass = that's what I'll get on my next trip to Vegas.
