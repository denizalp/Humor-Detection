Excellent customer service at the front desk. The receptionists show huge patience to my uncle who is a tourist and doesn't speak English fluently. \nExcellent customer service. I've been here couple times and my rooms are always clean and neat when I comeback in the end of the day. Personal items appear untouched while other stuffs are organized.
