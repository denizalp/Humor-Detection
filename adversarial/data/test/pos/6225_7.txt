I'm seriously shocked that there are not more neg reviews on here about this place because I hear people bitching all the time. \n\nFirst of all, do not expect to make a quick 'in-and-out' experience. You walk in and put your name on the List.. yes, list with a capital L. What is interesting is they ask you what your question\/comment\/concern is but when you finally get called five hours later, they ask you to explain your question\/comment\/concern all over again.\n\nLet's just say you have a Blackberry Pearl 8130 and the roller ball does not work anymore. Hypothetically, of course. So the highly skilled guy behind the counter looks at it for 2 seconds and says \"Oh, looks like it needs to be replaced...\" I'm pretty sure I already said that. \"Unfortunately, we don't have any of these in stock..\"\n\nWha? Come again? You don't have any more of one of your most popular phones in stock, in any of the 542 colors it comes in? Boy oh Boy.\n\n\"Here, you can call this number and request they send you out a new one.\" Great, the same number that told me I had to go into the store to get it replaced.\n\nOh brother what a bummer.
