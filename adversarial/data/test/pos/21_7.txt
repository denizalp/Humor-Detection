My Yelp compatriot Joi is an Omni black card member so, when she was booking our rooms for a trip to Montreal, she offered to book mine as well so I could get some of her excellent perks. While I'm baller status on Delta, I don't quite have an allegiance to any one hotel chain (typically going for last minute deals and such on booking sites) so this was all very new and exciting for me. Now, I didn't get the insane suite she did (check out her review for the majesty) but I did get some pretty rad amenities as a result of her status, including a really great room on the 17th floor, and a welcome wine and cheese plate with fruit, plus complimentary coffee or juice room service each morning. Nice! It pays to be a loyalty member! \n\nThe room itself was really great. Spacious and clean. Turndown service each day with a chocolate on my pillow was a nice touch. The bathroom was tidy and they were real on top of the housekeeping, even when I left my room later in the afternoon. The king-sized bed was also SO SO comfortable. I don't typically sleep great when traveling but I zonked out for a good 10 hours my first night here. \n\nBecause we kept kind of wonky hours for work I ordered room service three times here. Once just dessert my first night in because I like to treat myself when I'm away from home, the other meals were more out of necessity--a late dinner after a work event went past closing time for most restaurants in the area and a breakfast before I checked out. For the dessert, I went with a chocolate lava cake with gelato, my favorite dessert of all time. Kiiiind of disappointing. Very dry and not exactly warm in the middle. But it fulfilled my need for chocolate so *shrug emoji*. My late nite meal was the bagel service--two sesame bagels, smoked salmon, red onion, capers and cream cheese. This was pretty good. I mean, it's hard to screw up a bagel. For breakfast, I ordered the night before via the sign on my door and got the liege waffles with bacon. Both were also good, but a little on the cold side. Particularly the waffles which got a little hard when they cooled down. But it was pouring rain outside so the alternative (hunting down food in the rain) was not so great so I happily scarfed down those waffles.\n\nThe location is great if you're into doing some of the more touristy shopping and such. I didn't explore the area TOO much but if you want a real downtown city vibe it's the place to be. Very close to a few metro stops too, which makes getting around the city a breeze. Cabs are also easily accessible out front. \n\nOverall a very solid option for lodging. Not sure I'd personally stay here again just because I'd prefer to find a new neighborhood in town that's more my speed but if I were booked here or found a good deal I would definitely revisit.
