As anyone who's ever taken a cab from the Las Vegas airport can attest, one doesn't really get the choice of taxi companies...You simply stand in the long queue, the staff member tells you which sign to go and stand near, and the next available cab pulls up, loads you in and whisks you off.\n\nI was assigned to slot 19 where a taxi from Ace Cab Company was waiting for me.  The driver was friendly, they had a flat screen on the back of the passenger seat playing loud, flashy promotional videos for various shows, entertainment, shops and resorts around the strip (which I promptly switched off). There was also a credit card machine with chip reader available on the back of the passenger seat as well.  \n\nDo know that there is an extra $3 fee if you pay by credit card rather than cash with this company.
