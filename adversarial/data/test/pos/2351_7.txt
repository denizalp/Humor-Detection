We came here on a Wednesday night and ordered at the bar \n1. NY steak and potato - 10\n2. Mahi Mahi - 10 \nUsed the $10 Groupon for $20 to cover the meals and left $3. \n\n- Brewer's closed at 8pm, so we went to the bar instead. \n- This place is also a Station Casino. A lot smaller scale.  \n- Service was very friendly. \n- Initially, I wanted the prime rib, but the waitress said they were all out that night. fail. \n- This place can't cook a steak. I asked for a Medium and they gave me a Rare. Manager came and said they would make another. This time I asked for Medium well hoping that it would be easier, but they gave be a tough well done! I didn't want the chef to go through the hassle and making another one. \n- Ahi Ahi was bland. Add your own salt and pepper. But expected since labeled healthy choice. \n- Potato was boring. I can make a better potato at the Feast buffet! \n- Although the service was very good, the food was very sub par. Cooking steak should be mastered 101 for a chef
