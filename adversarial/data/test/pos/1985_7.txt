Chicken wings are one of my \"secret\" cravings - I'll usually prefer them to other foods they're associated with (aka pizza). A good chicken wing, however, is hard to find as there's not a balance between the chicken and the sauce. It's quite a statement to proclaim that an establishment serves \"the original Buffalo Chicken Wing (tm)\", and \"the best wings in the world\". \n\nAnchor Bar continues the tradition of East Coast favorite chains first finding their foot on the West Coast (Shake Shack, White Castle). They are located in the Grand Canal Shoppes Food Court inside Venetian|Palazzo. They have limited seating in the actual counter but there's plenty of seating in the food court. When the No1DP and I were there they had samples of their boneless wings.\n\nI got the Original Anchor Bar (Buffalo) Wing (medium spicy) with seasoned smoky chipotle fries and a Pepsi ($14.50).\n- Portion size was big enough for two people. Unlike chicken wings I've eaten that comes as a traditional side for pizza or sold in grocery stores, each chicken wing was a fatty mini drumstick. The No1DP said that had he known the portion size was that big he would've been happy to share my combo.\n- Anchor Bar is the only business to do a chicken wing right, equal portion of crispy chicken wing skin and sauce. Usually a chicken overwhelmed with sauce is trying to hide the quality of the chicken. Each chicken wing was cooked properly.\n- Celery sticks were thin but crisp.\n- The bleu cheese sauce isn't strong and is made to complement the wings, celery sticks and fries.\n- Fries, though adequately portioned, needed to be more crispy. This is the reason for the -1 star.\n\nI had over half my food left so I gave it to two homeless guys camping out in the bridge that connects the Palazzo to the Wynn. They looked like they needed food more than we did.\n\nIf split between two people it comes to around $7.25\/person so I would recommend this as a suitable cheap yet delicious lunch\/dinner option in the Strip. They also serve other flavors of bone-in, boneless wings, salads and sandwiches for people who want to make their meals more interesting.
