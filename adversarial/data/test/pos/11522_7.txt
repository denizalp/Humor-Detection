Jesus died for our sins and I ate here for our review.\n\nMy name is Hitt, I'm from Pittsburgh PA.  I do many things but one of the things I like to do is experience everything I humanly can from foods to places plus people and things.  Rather than write a long review and clutter the reviews with anymore long reviews (no knock, you guys are great) I'm just gonna get right to the point...\n\nThis place? \n\n- Let's get the worst out the way, the fries, they're just fries. But,\n- the Fish!!! Man that Panko breading!!!!!\n- The cole slaw is for slaw lovers like myself\n- the wait can get crazy, go early.\n- The panko breading, did I say that?\n-  don't leave without getting something from the dessert table!  Yellow cake, pineapple cake, cherry pie, you name it they got it!\n- the hospitality was great and the price was standard ($10 per person) take cash.\n- eat in but not before saying grace\n\n8\/10
