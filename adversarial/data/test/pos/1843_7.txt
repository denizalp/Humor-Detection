Does Last Chance need another review? Yes. This store used to be my all time FAVORITE store. I got some of the best buys on designer jewelry, clothing, shoes, towels, glassware, make up........ This store used to carry all the Nordstrom online returns. and many of the returns from Nordstrom's. Now those returns, if they are not damaged are going to the RACK. Last Chance is getting all the damaged goods. And boy are those goods damaged:(\nAnd the prices have gone up. VINCE dresses used to sell for $19.97. Now they sell for $49.97 and they have holes and\/or stains. I saw a pair of designer shoes for $99.97. They forgot to take the RACK clearance sticker ($39.99) off. Brought it to the attention of an employee and she said that's our store's selling price for designer shoes.\nLast Chance also does not run weekly specials like they were famous for. \nYou may still find that needle in a haystack bargain, but you probably have a better chance being struck by lightening.
