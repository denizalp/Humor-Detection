the owners are rude and awful.  They think they own the shopping center and they do not, the send people away, which is good, who wants to shop there anyway.  Great people that I know will not ever go to this place.  They would rather go to TOYS R US OR BABIES R US, which are cheaper and management and these stores are nicer.
