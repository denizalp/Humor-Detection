This review is for the bakery portion only. It appears from reading other reviews that maybe the café is the better part of this spot. I've had this spot bookmarked for awhile and looked forward to stopping in. Everything in the case looked awesome and I really wanted to like this bakery.\n\nI'll start with the good. The staff working when I stopped in were very friendly and the bakery offers a 10% off with Yelp check-in offer which is nice. The Maple Bacon scone I bought for my husband was really good. It had the perfect blend of the sweet maple and smoky bacon. My Almond Cakepop was tasty and had a nice amount of the almond flavor. The chocolate on the outside had a nice flavor as well. \n\nThe rest of the items I purchased were disappointing to the point that I only took one bite before determining that I could not eat more. I literally can't think of another time this happened to me with a baked good. My husband asked three times if I was serious because he thought I was playing a joke when I told him there was a baked good I couldn't eat. The Cotton Candy Macaron and Orange Mimosa Macaron were completely stale and had almost no flavor. The Confetti Cupcake fell completely apart when I was removing it from the wrapper. It was sopping wet with oil and tasted like oil. Same oil situation with the mini Red Velvet and Oreo cupcakes. The prices on everything seemed a little high which I don't mind for quality baked goods, but most of this was inedible. \n\nI feel bad even writing a review like this, but I don't want anyone else to waste their money on the baked goods here. I might return and try the café since the reviews on the café seem to be the reason for their overall four star rating.
