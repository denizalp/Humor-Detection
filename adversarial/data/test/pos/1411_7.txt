On our recent visit to Las Vegas Oct. 14th me  and my four married girlfriends came to this branch to purchase couples toys. Their sales associate Justine, gave as a demo on items we wanted to surprise our spouses with.  We asked for the prices  of  certain items as you would before deciding to purchase. All three items were quoted at $200. To which we thought was a good buy. At that point, I asked if Military discount applies, to which she said yes. With the 20% discount, the items were considered sold. The merchandise were tested then Justine handed the ite ms to the checkout counter with all smiles while we looked for a massage oil to go with our purchase. Upon checkout,  the items were scanned without the advise and emphasis that all sales were final. After calculating in my head the total including the 20% discount, the price didnt add up and we questioned the checkout girl. She quickly replied \"it's the taxes.\" We took our bags and got in the car and a friend asked how much taxes are in Las Vegas compared to California. We all agreed to take a closer look at the receipt when we got to the hotel. After enjoying the casino slots and tablez  for an hour and a half, we checked our receipt and found an irregularity. The $200 price quoted before taxes a nd discount was actually $224.95 x2 and $214.95. We spoke with the manager, Tim Miller. After giving him enough time to investigate, his decision on the situation was to give us 40% on our next visit and emphasized that all sales are final, which they DID NOT do at the cashier. Despite protestation of our five families, in support of #vegasstrong we felt it was our responsibility to not give in to terrorism, despite being mothers of  young children. We have fully supported Vegas commerce by playing in the casinos, dined, a nd watched shows, as strong supporters of anti-terrorism. We played your half empty tables, walked your barren street with courage, we watched your half empty shows with sadnesz. We are happy to spread around benefits to your economy. It saddened us that the weekend was quiet. In support of your commerce, we decided to purchase the items in Las Vegas when we could have easily done so on Amazon. We would have gladly paid for these items for the actual final price and that all sales are final but we are working on our principle. You don't do that to an educated individual whose only purpose was to support #Vegasstrong economy. I cannot begin to express how disappointed I am.
