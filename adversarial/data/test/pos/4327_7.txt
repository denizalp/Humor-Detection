A decent Filipino restaurant that accommodates large parties well. We celebrated my aunts birthday here and made reservations. We were advised to place our orders 2 hours in advance (via telephone) for our party of 10.  When we were seated at our reservation time, we didn't have to wait long for food. It was fresh and served at a good temperature. \nWe ordered a lot of food, including: pancit, pancit palabok, lechon kawali, BBQ sticks, Kare Kare, binagoongan crispy pata with eggplant, and pinakbet. All tasted fine, but of course I've had better versions elsewhere. The stand out dish was the binagoongan crispy pata with eggplant. It is a deep fried pork leg that is super crispy and fatty. The sauce is really tasty, it is bagoong, a salty shrimp paste. Definitely, not your typical everyday Filipino cuisine. This cholesterol, sodium filled dish is best saved for special occasions. \nI was most excited for their halo halo after I saw photogenic photos of it on social media. I was disappointed in overall flavor and presentation. I've had better with various versions of halo halo within Seafood City. \nOverall observation, many diners there were part of tables 6+ and even there is a separate room for overflow\/party use. The service is pretty good too. \n\n*****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge*****\n50\/100
