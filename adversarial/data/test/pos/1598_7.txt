It's a No for me! I want to give it a zero but the food is always hot so I'll give credit when credit is due!....but that's it! This place is extremely over priced for the quality and quantity of food given! I have tried it several times, trying to like it. I actually purchased it once with my own money and I said NEVER again! I was so mad because I spent so much money then walked out side and realized I over spent! I basically ordered the special but because I didn't ask for it as \"the special\" they charged me individually which was more (strike 1)...when I asked the cashier she casually said she didnt know how to fix it and politely walked away...(strike 2)...I got home the food was hot but the pizza wasn't flavorful like the cheese tasted like a 50real\/50imitation blend the sauce had zero flavor the crust was ok cooked well not too chewy or too hard...but the wings were tiny and not fresh like someone didn't pick up their order and they rewarmed them (strike 3)! I vowed never to spend a dollar there again...but my daughter gets free coupons for grades (she's smart or whateva) and she like using ALL of her freebies no matter what...the rating is the same even when its free! #hardpass
