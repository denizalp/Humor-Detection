Mmmmm. Better than Five Guys, hands down.\n\nAfter raving about how delicious Five Guys was, my friend recommended that I try Burger Nuts in Willoughby. Burger what? And where?\n\nOff I drove to Willoughby, in search of a heart warming fast food burger. After passing the location a couple of times (there's a lot of signs on the road at night...for some reason I couldn't find it too easily), I finally made it in.\n\nWalking into Burger Nuts looked like a replica of Five Guys. Free peanuts and even the menu was similar (although it looked like Burger Nuts had better desserts). I ordered the #1 and sat down.\n\nMan, was that burger a great burger. Unlike Five Guys, the burger patties were PLUMP. There was two plump patties (making it 1\/2 a lb?), with bacon, spicy jack, and all the condiments as well as their special Burger Nut sauce. And the BUN of that burger. It was so nicely toasted and reminded me of Chinese buns bread- not the normal smashed down buns of fast food restaurants of today.\n\nAnd on top of that, there are choices for FRIES. Chili fries, cajun fries, the list goes on. I definitely got the sweet potato fries. Mmmmmm.\n\nI didn't finish my burger. I was stuffed. At Five Guys, I devoured the whole thing. But at Burger Nuts, the burger was just too plump and juicy for me to finish it. MMMMM.\n\nIf you're looking for a solid fast food burger, definitely go to Burger Nuts over Five Guys. Any day.
