Well, let me tell you, this place is unique! I only wish this place was closer to home I would eat hear everyday. The quality of the steak and fish, and the flavor, and the sauces are unbelievable, especially for the price. All for under $10. We went there for a cheesesteak but the old owners moved on. But we were lucky to stumble on this place because it is fabulous!
