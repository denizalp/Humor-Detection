Okay, so I have never been to a Michael Kors store, and was excited to check it out. I have always liked the simplicity and beauty of these purses. \n\nMy husband and I walked in, and there was a very tall gentleman in a nice suit standing by the door. He obviously worked there, as he greeted us. Security? Not sure. Got about two feet inside the door and Rachel greeted us as well. She was carrying a very large calculator as well. I thought 'well, that is different. Have never seen that before now'. I looked around and saw prices on the walls in front of different displays. She informed us that they have certain items marked down, and if we needed to know the exact price of the discounted items, to just ask. Okay, so that answers the question about the calculator. I just decided to figure it out in my head, as I didn't need to know the exact price of anything until I was ready to pay.\n\nShe asked where we were from, so we had to answer 'from here...ha ha'. Then it hit me that yes, we were still on the 'strip'. We walked about 2 feet more and were greeted by yet another employee. OMG. I just wanted to enjoy my first time inside of a MK store. The quality really was nice, and I did find some things that I would put on my wish list for birthdays and stuff like that. I really didn't need anything this time, just wanted to peruse the store. \n\nIt seemed like they had an employee standing around every few feet, kind of high pressure. I guess this is a good sales tactic for pressuring customers to buy. You almost do feel obligated to buy something with all of their willingness to help. Kind of annoying, but I just kept looking around until I had enough. The tall gentleman was still by the door when we left. \n\nI still love Michael Kors purses, but I might just order one online when I am ready for a new purse.
