I'm from out of town, and as usual I waited till the last minute to fix my nails when I go on a trip. Part of the fun of traveling is checking out other nail salons and getting to know some locals. \n\nI tried first on a Sunday. First of all, they have the weirdest entrance. The business is listed on the door with a whole bunch of other listings so you really have to focus on the right door between local store fronts.  As you enter the first door, you are blocked by a second door that is locked. To the side is a call box. I entered the correct number for Miss T's, and then I'm buzzed through.\n\nI then walk up two flight of stairs to get to the actually door to the nail salon. The woman opens the door, I tell her what I need, and she says sorry no openings. Okay, no problem. Back down the stairs and out the door. Next day, same thing. I make all the way to the door only to be told: No sorry, come again another day! \n\nThe second time I was more desperate. I said please. I just need a nail color change. The lady politely lets me in. It felt like an apartment with certain rooms converted into a salon experience. I was led to the front room where I got to sit on a beautiful chaise facing the window overlooking the street while she called her assistant. Alas, still no one could come to my rescue. \n\nI ended up going to the nail salon down the street. If you come here, I suggest calling ahead. It's kind of a hassle getting all the way up to the door only to be told, no come again another day...I suggest they tell you while your still on the first floor, or make a note at the entrance to call ahead if you don't have an appointment. Otherwise, you're left feeling like a fool for even trying to get into this place!
