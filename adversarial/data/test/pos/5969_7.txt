Okay, listen. You're cool, right? I don't mean hipster-cool, trucker-cap wearing, bleeding-gums ironic Kardashian-damage trust-fund doofus. I mean cool--as in, you appreciate treasures off the beaten path, and you can keep a secret. You're cool? \n\nOkay. Here it is: this place is the best Mexican food in town. It's better than Carolina's. I love Carolina's, but this is better. Here's why: Pitic's tortillas are handmade like Carolina's, but they're not as dry--they're a tiny bit doughier, a little thicker, and to me they're just about perfect. Ditto their frijoles. Pitic's have a great smoky flavor that just goes on for miles. Chorizo, machaca, all the stuff I've had there has been so good, so savory. \n\nAnd then there's the salsa. \n\nThere are two kinds--a red and a green. Both freshly made. The red is very savory, with hints of chipotle and other good stuff. But my favorite is the green sauce, with huge chunks of fresh jalapenos and tomatillos. They're both pretty hot--to my taste the green is hotter, which is exactly what I'm after.  I usually get a quart of it to go, to get me through the week. \n\nIt's a great family-owned place with friendly service, and the Pitic bar is a hoppin' dance club on the weekends. It's close to the airport if you're on your way in or out of town. Treat yourself right and get some real authentic Mexican food. But please don't tell the hipsters. This is our little secret. \n\n(and yeah, their ads on digital channel 38 are camp classics. Tune in!)
