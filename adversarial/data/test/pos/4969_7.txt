If you are tired of the same tonkotsu ramen that has been popping up in every city, this is the place for you to excite you're taste buds. Using a combination of clams, pork, and chicken, the signature broth packs a delicious flavor bomb in both the shoyu and shio versions. The addition of the truffle oil further adds to the already unique flavor of the broth. \n\nAs for noodles, they are more similar to soba noodles than your typical ramen noodles. The bowls come with marinated bamboo shoots and two slices of sous vide pork tenderloin chasu. Addition of the marinated soft boil egg and pork belly will run your bill to around $20 CAD before tax. \n\nAlthough pricey, I think this is definitely one of the more unique offerings in the Toronto area. Glad to have tried it!
