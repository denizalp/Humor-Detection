The wine menu was as thick as a dictionary.  Great sign!\n\nThen a classy gentleman dressed to the 9's walks by, hands us his business card, and introduces himself as Paolo.  He is the sommelier and would be happy to answer any questions.  Another great sign!  Based upon our meal, his recommendation for a red wine from Alba was incredible.  Full bodied, smooth, and paired well with both a beefy bolognese as well as some seafood.  Ask for Paolo!\n\nOur server Michael was friendly and provided fantastic service as well.\n\nFritto Misto:  just like what we had in Northern Italy.  Fried calamari, shrimp, sardines, endives and some red pepper was served with a creamy tangy dipping sauce.  Simple but delicious.\n\nCaesar salad:  Whole leaves tossed with parmesan and a creamy light anchovy dressing.  The side order of anchovies was plentiful.\n\nBolognese:  Ground beef in tomato base with al dente green & white taglatelle.  Delicious!\n\nTarajin with Crab and corn in a creamy uni sauce:  The only time I've had tarajin was in Alba during tartufo season last year.  The pasta is exactly the same (made with 30 egg yolks)!  It was delicious.  I loved it paired with the house pinot grigio.  Only negative?  I wanted fresh truffles!\n\nTrippa:  just like we had in Rome.  It was the most tender and simmered in a rich tomato stew.  If you like offal then you will love this!\n\nThe restaurant is massive and can cater to large and private parties.  It's pricey but definitely worth it!
