Terrible service and below average food. Went with a friend last Saturday and we waited 15 minutes for someone to come and take our order. They don't have assigned servers and the staff is often confused. Took another thirty minutes for the food to come out which is understandable since it was a busy night. But my curry was cold, watery and tasteless. The only saving grace was the naan. If you want authentic Indian food, go to Bombay grill. Yes, it's slightly more expensive, and a little crammed but the food is delicious.
