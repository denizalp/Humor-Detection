STAY AWAY!!!! If I could give negative stars, trust me, I would. WORST gun buy experience I've ever had. As soon as I walked in asking for a colt AR, I was rudely interrupted as he told me that what I wanted was wrong and ordered to buy something else. When I asked about my original request I was told that the gun wasn't made anymore... Odd seeing that every other gun shop in town had them? The large guy behind the counter was rude to me and demeaning to my fianc√©e.
