Decided to try Hong Kong Taste out today.  I ordered the sweet & sour chicken, vegetable fried rice, and an egg roll.  Everything tasted bland and had a soggy texture to it. Was it edible? Yes, but not enjoyable at all.  I don't think I will be ordering from here very often.  I don't recommend a visit if you can help it.
