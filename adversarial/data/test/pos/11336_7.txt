So, I'd heard a lot about Sneaky Dee's through the grapevine, and I finally got to check it out.\n\nFirst off, I went on a Saturday night, so, as expected, the wait was ridiculously long. We ended up finally opting for a seat at the bar, especially in light of the fact that the tables didn't look all that much more appealing anyway. And it definitely beats eating on the floor.\n\nFirst thing I noticed was that it was very loud. Again, saturday night packed house, nothing can be done about that. What the hell, my lungs needed the workout. I also highly dig the extra-late business hours.\n\nThe place itself is pretty grungey, but seemingly clean. The servers, though running around like headless chickens, were also very cute and friendly.\n\nAs for the food...my friend and I ordered the nachos, and I was a little frightened by what I was served. Not frightened due to what it tasted like, it was pretty tasty in fact. I was more alarmed that the sheer size of this friggin' thing was going to flip the goddamn bar over. Seriously, we both ate until we almost burst, and there was still half of it left! The drinks were also served in a timely fashion, and the price was right.\n\nIt should also be worth noting that the price of food was pretty cheap, considering the amount of food you get. I'll definitely be back at some point. Next time I'll have to be sure to adopt 17 kids to take with me, and maybe the food will end up being fully-eaten.
