Extremely poor buying experience. These people will decieve, lie and mislead you in order to GET AS DEEP AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN INTO YOUR POCKET. I was given pricing on a new F150 on Dec 17 and attempted to purchase it on Dec 31 by making a down payment on the phone (we reside approx 100 miles away). My sales representative \"Corey\" would not return my calls or emails stating he was \"too busy\" with end of year sales. I attempted to purchase the same truck again on Jan 7 and requested a different salesperson, since mine was obviously \"too busy.\" New salesperson \"Grant\" called me and said the previous price quote offered by Corey would NOT BE HONORED and informed me that I would have to pay over $50,000 for the same truck that was offered to me only 20 days previously, for $44,500. STAY AWAY FROM THIS DEALERSHIP. THEY ARE DISHONEST AND GREEDY
