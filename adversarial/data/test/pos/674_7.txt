I was surprised to see a club rated so highly on Yelp.  Believe the hype!  This place is pretty awesome.  But then again I came on a Monday night so it wasn't super crazy packed.  It probably would be a different experience if I had to shove and pilfer the bar for drinks.\n\nThe way they decorated the place is pretty neat-o.  There are always girls dancing in the pool with no shoes on.  Sexy!  Large dance floor similar to the one in Tryst, overlooking the outdoor pool.  Cabanas galore.  Hot girls, everywhere.  Hot cabana boys too.
