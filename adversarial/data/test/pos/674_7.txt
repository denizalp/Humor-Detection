I love New York City!\n\nHaving spent two summers, when I was 15 and 16 years old, living in and touring Manhattan and the surrounding Burroughs; I got to explore and enjoy this fascinating city. The rest of my family were on their European tour, and dropped me off to stay with one of my sisters who worked downtown. \n\nI was pretty much left to my own devices for several weeks. And I got to experience what big city living was like.\n\nIt was nearly a daily routine for me to have breakfast at one of the corner diners as I watched all those people hurry about their daily lives. \n\nThat was quite some time ago, but the memories of that city still remain with me after all these years.\n\nAs my wife and I were on our way towards Prescott, this one Saturday morning, we opted to stop by this diner in Surprise because it was just right off of the 303 on Bell Road. Their menu looked appetizing and intriguing enough that it piqued our interest. And it definitely piqued my curiosity as to how close they could get to duplicating New York's unique breakfast flavors.\n\nI must say, that except for the traffic, the noise, the humidity, and the big city odors wafting through New York City's air, this establishment's food did an admirable job of bringing their home town's flavor to Surprise, Arizona.\n\nI had a custom omelette with Spinach and Ham, and accompanied it with Maple Bacon and a 3 stack of Pancakes. My wife had the French Toast and Maple Bacon as well.\n\nThese really hit the spot! \n\nAnd having the live Earthcam of the Time Square area was a nice touch to bring some type of big city ambiance to what is basically a suburban family and retirement community.\n\nThey had many more offerings in their menu for both Lunch and Dinner, and we really are looking forward to returning and sampling their other offerings; as we were quite impressed with their cookery!
