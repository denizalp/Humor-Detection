That was probably the best brunch I've ever had. Everything was great. There wasn't one thing that I put on my plate that I didn't enjoy. The service was really good too. Our every desire was fulfilled and we ate until we couldn't eat anymore. My body needs some time to recover, but it was worth it. Make sure you try the crab, lobster and sashimi. Those were my favorites. Not to mention, maccarons.
