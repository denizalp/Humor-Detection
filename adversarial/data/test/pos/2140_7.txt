I've always enjoyed Old Town Scottsdale. Tons of great shopping restaurants bars and an overall fun vibe to the area. Kind of as a clash between old west charm and new modern La Style. Definitely worth checking out if you're in from out of town. Plus during baseball season the Giants play right here. You can hit the game go to some great restaurants bars and hotels.
