A very clean store, some of the staff very pleasant other need a group lesson on dealing with the public especially the owners wife and family they seem to have lost the art of smiling and communication from the time the doors opened and some of the cashiers throw your sales slip at you once you finished paying and grumble at the next person..if they speak at all. The biggest problem that I am sure originates at head office is not having the sale items offered in the flyer. Many times if you dont get there at 9am on Friday morning when the sale starts you dont get the items listed and once they are gone they never, or very seldom, seem to ever be restocked. The place is a large pain in the butt for this and its a common complaint I hear from everyone. If you are going to advertise and item, have enough available to let some of the public have a chance until Tuesday at least. Some people dont have the ability to be easily mobile and this is such an unfair injustice that because we are incapable of travel due to illness we dont ever have the chance at sale items..this has lead me increasingly to shop elsewhere even if I have to travel further I no longer waste my time...
