I was on my way to Pho Thanh and I spot a sign - a new Vietnamese restaurant just opened up.  Since it's only 2 mins away from my original destination, I figured - meh why not.\n\nOh wow...I'm first to review this place!  Sweet.\n\nIt's a nice, cozy place.  Looked more like an Italian restaurant than a Vietnamese but it doesn't matter.  It's clean and it had jazz music going so good enough for me.\n\nIn any new Vietnamese restaurant, I always start off with the usual order - Pho satay and spring rolls.  If they can't these 2 things right, they'll never see me again.\n\nThe spring rolls was nice and hot...and greesy!  Just the way I like it.  The Satay was familiar.  It reminded me of Saigon Y2K.  I had to ask the owner.  So apparently, he owned Saigon Y2K in downtown!  Aha..I knew it!  Anyways, he sold Y2K and opened Saigon Royal in Douglasdale and then sold that and opened this joint.  Well he did good.  I've always liked Saigon Y2K back when I was working in downtown.  \n\nFood = 2 stars\nWould I come back = sure, 1 star\nAtmosphere = 1 star    \nPrice = $34 for 2 bowls, ice coffee, and spring rolls....steep?  yeah a lil' but that's average.  0 star
