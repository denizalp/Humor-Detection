I'll be honest that I've never heard of this place.  I took the 506 across from Yonge and I knew it was going to be a bit of a ride along Carlton and Gerrard to get to Greenwood.  When I arrived at Greenwood and crossed the street I noticed there was a bit of a line up.  I thought to myself was this line up for Maha?  It was about 1:20pm in the afternoon on a Tuesday and there was a line of about 20 people in front of me.  For the 10 or so minutes I was there the line did not move at all.  I was meeting a friend and I was texting saying that there was going to be a bit of a wait.\n\nI was in line pretty far away from the storefront so I couldn't even see how busy it was inside.  I asked the person in front of me to confirm if this was the line for Maha and she had said yes.  I said wow this was quite the busy place.  She said that they were featured on TV and blogs so I could see how this place would be packed.  That happens in the city sometimes where a place gets popular and then it's harder to get into the place at least for a while and sometimes that popularity can last.  \n\nA server came out to the line looking for parties of 2.  The person in front of me who I had spoken to was a party of two so she moved right on in to get a table while everybody else in line was 3 or more it seemed.  Since I was a party of 2 I was hoping she'd return asking for another party of 2.  She did in fact come out and I was able to get a table outside on the patio for 2 before my friend arrived so it worked out.  It seemed rather lucky there were only 2 of us otherwise who knows how long we would have had to have waited to be able to get a table.  This place seems so popular that people are willing to wait in line mind you this around 1:30 on a weekday and there's a line.\n\nWhen my friend arrived it didn't take us long to decide what to get.  We went with the Cairo Classic which is a plate of seasoned fava beans, tomato feta, sliced boiled eggs and balady bread with a single falafel ball.  For our other dish we wanted to try the mind blowing chicken which is a plate of salad with tomatoes, onions and parsley mixed with the chicken drizzled with mayo and tahini with more bread on the side.  To drink we ordered the black tea with mint.\n\nWe were catching up because we hadn't seen each other in about a year and a half and while the weather was basically perfect outside it seemed that the meals were taking quite some time to come.  It was quite busy the place but I rarely eat this late in the afternoon for lunch (now after 2pm).  The tea came and it had quite the presentation with tiny cups with mint coming out of the top of the pot.  When the food finally came we were quite famished.  I have to say the wait to get the food was only offset by the fact that we had pretty much been seated quite quickly and didn't have to wait too long in line luckily.  \n\nThe classic came out first and we had started on that.  The chicken shortly followed.  We were making space on the table the best we could considering we were sharing both dishes.  The servings are decently sized and the taste was good.  I especially liked the classic because the beans although spiced were not overwhelming.  The falafel was good as was everything that made up the classic plate and I especially liked the texture of the balady.  The chicken and salad while good didn't really blow my mind.  I'm not sure if the anticipation or the wait made it more of a higher expectation but overall for both dishes and the experience I can't say if I had to wait longer that it would have been worth it.  \n\nThe wait for the plates was quite long to the point I was getting worried.  We had some places we wanted to go that day and we had to skip one because time didn't really permit.  From being seated (around 1:30pm) to the time we ended up paying and leaving it was about 3:15pm.  That's almost 2 hours for us at the table ordering, waiting, and eating.  While the food was enjoyable the chicken salad dish wasn't spectacular (it didn't necessarily blow my mind) the wait seemed much longer than expected.  If it was this busy on a Tuesday afternoon and it was this long for the food to normally be served I can't say it was really worth it.
