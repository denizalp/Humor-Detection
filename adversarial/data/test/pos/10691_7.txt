I'm giving this place five stars solely for its breathtaking panoramic views of the Las Vegas strip.  \n\nI saw the line going around the corner when we came out of Little Buddha and I don't play the line game.  I walked up the bouncer and fluttered my eyelashes as best I could and viola we were in...How come life can't be that easy?  But I digress...\n\nYou go up through the elevator and walk through a hallway and you see the city lights right in front of you.  Simply breathtaking.  \n\nDrinks are pretty stiff, music is alright and Bouncers are everywhere making sure that people don't get out of control.  Ahem, like my own Mr. L who decided to do a strip tease and a swan dive off one of the chairs.  I had to do the eyelash fluttering thing again to stop Mr. L from getting us kicked out.  Apparently, a woman's work is never done...  \n\nI also liked the crowd at this bar,  it wasn't full of 21 year olds who just became legal and so they're spilling their drinks everywhere.  Nope, just my husband...
