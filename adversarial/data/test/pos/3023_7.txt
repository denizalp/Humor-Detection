We were duped into coming here by the huge sign that advertised $100 of free slot play simply for joining the player's club.   Unfortunately, you can only play on \"promotional machines\" and you only win money if you hit the top jackpot.  We won smaller things many times, but you can't cash out.    LAME.   If you do join the player's club, you get $5 of ACTUAL free slot play, which we turned into a couple bucks, at least.    But know that if you come all the way down here, you're getting $5 of free play, not $100.
