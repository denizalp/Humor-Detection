Amazing!!!! We had an estimate visit with John and the whole experience was professional to say the least!\n\nHe brought us full color brochures and powder coated samples of the frame and it matched our gutters and trim work perfectly!!!!\n\nWe are looking to upgrade our track, motor, and garage door and I wanted the glass garage door style.\n\nJohn right away said \"that style would look fabulous with your house!\" examples pictures that he brought were exactly the Avante glass panel garage door that I want.\n\nMy husband was impressed I found him because this town can be wacky.....believe me even after remodeling and still contractors in and out the past year.....quality companies can be hard to come by.\n\nHubby spoke with him on the certain motors he prefers and they even spoke about side mount vs top middle mount pros and cons. App controlled doors, different levels of frost on the glass......they can do it all!\nLess than 24 hour turnaround for the estimate.\n\nNot sure how they compare price wise but KGDG will be the company I choose!!!!!!!!
