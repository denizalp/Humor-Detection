Let this be a warning to all...You get what you pay for here. We are working on our second lease here (only because we are saving money to move out of state) and we can't wait until it is up!  The complex has income restrictions, so there are some interesting individuals living here.\n\nWhen you first come here to look it seems nice. There are some pretty flowers at the entrance and the office is nice. Then you start talking to the office staff and it starts to go downhill. They will give you the pricing sheet and floor plans and take you on a tour of the unit model you are interested in. They have you fill out the application and they request a holding fee for the specific unit you want. The holding fee has to be a money order, but the fee is refundable. If you end up not getting the unit they give you your money order back...The one you made out to them...Talk about a hassle having to go through their corporate office to get your money back because the gas station you bought it from won't refund the money since its made out to someone else!  If all works out well and they start processing your application be prepared for a headache when it comes to your income, especially if you are a tipped employee. Once you get them to understand how much money you make they will make you jump through a few more hoops before you get the approval. So you get approved and they set a move-in date. You agree to show up on a certain day and time to sign the lease, so when move-in day comes you can just show up for the keys. You show up on time and they don't have a single sheet of your lease prepared, so you wait on them to get their act together. They finally get everything together and you start signing...Then you start noticing that there are errors on some pages, so you wait again for them to reprint new pages and sign again. You get everything signed and they tell you that you are all set to get your keys on move-in day. Then move-in day comes and they can't find your keys, oh and maintenance isn't quite done working in there. Are you kidding me?! \n\nGood luck if you have any maintenance issues. You put a work order in at the office and you are lucky if you see the maintenance guy within a week. You are even more lucky if they actually fix whatever is wrong! Usually they tell you that a \"vendor\" has to come out and look at it. Oh and I can't forget the bugs. The ones that bother us the most are the scorpions. So many scorpions. I understand we live in the desert, but there is an infestation and they don't care. We have 3 small children and the advice we got was to put all of their bed legs in glass jars so the scorpions can't get into their beds. Gee thanks. \n\nIf I could give this place less than one star I would. I don't recommend this place to anyone. The rent is cheap, but for what you have to deal with for a year it isn't cheap enough! There are so many vacant units here its amazing they are staying afloat. This complex should be your last resort if you are considering living here.
