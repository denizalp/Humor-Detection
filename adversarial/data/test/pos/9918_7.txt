Had the lunch special of sesame chicken, which included plain low mein, egg roll, and an egg drop soup. \nFood was on the poor side. Chicken was coated in the cough syrup type sauce and the other side dishes was flavorless.\nI had gotten the pork fried rice before however and it was legit. So there is a tip, stay far away from the lunch combos and just get the fried rice and skedaddle.
