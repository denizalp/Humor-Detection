Bellagio or Wynn...that is the question. We decided to go to the Wynn Buffet (we were staying at the Trump, across the road).\nI think the trick is to a little bit off peak, for a couple of reasons:\n1. - The wait is not very long if you are not there at 7 or 8 in the evening...we hit the buffet at about 6:15 and waited less than 10 minutes, and;\n2. - I think everything is less picked over and fresher when it's a little less crowded.\nOK, it's a buffet, but a really terrific buffet, with cocktails and the whole deal!\nThe selection is awe inspiring, from the fish to the steaks to the pasta and salads to the dessert, cheeses and everything in between. Really magnificent and the chefs do a great job of preparing everything well and keeping new dishes coming out hot (or cold if required) and on time.\nI know, for $75-80 for a buffet, it should be terrific...it is. I only wish I could eat more.
