It seems my udpate from the day after I went has been deleted!!!!!\n\nI got food poisoning all nite long and the following day after I went there!!! I wrote that almost right away to edit my first impression (once I felt better....)\n\nForget about the food in this place being good!!! It may taste good but can be harmful! I never went back there and never will!! ever never, even if you pay me!\n\nIf my update is deleted again, I will simply remove this review from my account!!!
