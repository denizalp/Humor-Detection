I would give it 5 stars but I haven't bought anything....yet. After shopping all day for a futon or small sofa bed, this was hands down the best service I received anywhere. It looks like it would be expensive but the prices were really good, I liked that things came in bright color options and they recommended me to their website for options not in store. I will definitely be back.
