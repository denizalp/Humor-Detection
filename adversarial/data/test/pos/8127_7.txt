Biaggio's was a comfortable little pizza shop. We dined in for family dinner tonight and it was great.\n\nThe gentleman who greeted & waited on us was very nice (I'm sad that I didn't catch his name). He was very attentive and showed a lot of appreciation. I would assume he owns the joint(?). Regardless, the customer service was great.\n\nWe ordered a TON of food:\n\nGarlic Knots - these were huge! I was expecting bite size garlic knots; these were more fist-sized. The soft doughy center was easily complimented by the perfectly baked exterior that featured a slight crunch. I do, however, wish there was a ton more garlic on these. I absolutely love garlic & that flavor was lacking, in my opinion.\n\nFried Mushrooms - YUM! It is rare to find fried mushrooms that aren't completely hidden behind breading.  These were the perfect ratio.\n\nChicken Wings - another customer stated, \"they have the best chicken wings in town\" while he saw me flipping through the menu. These were definitely delicious. The wings were moist & tender - served with buffalo sauce & ranch.\n\nPizza - half Meat Lover's (sub salami for mushrooms) & half White Pizza. The pizza was good - I wouldn't say it's the greatest I've ever had; but it was certainly delicious. The Meat Lover's side had a very generous amount of pepperoni, italian sausage, meatballs & mushrooms. The White Pizza side was tasty as well - I love ricotta cheese!\n\nThumbs up for overall experience!
