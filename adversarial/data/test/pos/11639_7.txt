This is what happens when Chuckie Cheese, Dave & Buster and BW3s  have a three way and give birth.  Atmosphere is LOUD!  Must know sign language to communicate.  The physical plant is huge and over two levels.  60k sqaure feet include a bowling alley, movie theatre, video games, bubble wall and disco.  \n\nDecent tap selection with a handful of micros and select beers including DogfishHead 60 minute IPA, Chmay Triple and Southern Tier.  Bartenders are talented, especially this young man named Andy.  \n\nWe were there with a group of 10. Food is mostly bar regular fare with a couple of unique items with mostly nice presentation.   Our server was attentive and our drinks stayed full.  This was their first week of operation and the kitchen was in chaos.  It took about an hour for our food to come out with a very small crowd in the house.  I had buffalo wings.  Sauce was thin and uninspired. One of our group ordered the fried fish, coming out frozen in the middle.  The dinner was comped.    My wife had grilled chicken breast and sweet potato fries.  It was fair with decent portion size. Friends had the chicken flatbread and it looked very good. \n\nOverall, I found prices to be on the high side for a sports bar menu and atmosphere.  I will give them another try once the kitchen is in order, but need to find a quieter space.
