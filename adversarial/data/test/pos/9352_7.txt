It's like the other Sprouts locations, but on steroids. The products are largely the same, but with the best variety I've seen yet. The cheese section? Freaking amazing. Want to pick up some fresh meats? Try not to feel daunted by your choices. I'm going to drop by like a million times to stuff my face with all the ripe fruits and veggies I can, all at surprisingly low prices. \n\nThis is what midtown needed. Ever since Fresh n Easy left, there's been a vacuum in this neighborhood for a grocer of this caliber. It has finally been filled.
