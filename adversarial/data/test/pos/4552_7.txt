This is our most favorite breakfast spot in town. It is always a 20 to 30 minute wait (No Reservations allowed) and worth it! I would recommend you go there not in a rush and wear stretchy pants... Because you will not leave there hungry!\n\nThis is an amazing pancake House with a Hawaiian twist. Every time I go there I think I know what I want to order...then I see somebody else's food and change my mind. Everytime I branch out of my comfort zone and get something new I'm never disappointed.\n\nThe seating is small and somewhat cramped but the staff does a tremendous job of making sure all the tables are bussed and filled very fast. Our waitress is always such a sweetheart and gives us our drinks to go at the end. It is such a nice touch to have such great customer service!\n\nNow for the food! Where do I begin? My husband's favorite is the adobo rice omelette... But he loves their skillets too. I have too many favorites to choose from including the Portuguese sausage, spam & garlic sticky rice, all their Eggs Benedicts, Mac salad, and of course their Loco Moco! \n\nThe interior is painted cheerfully bright with different colors and upbeat Hawaiian and reggae music keep the customers happy. I would definitely say the vibe here is completely Island-friendly and super chill.\n\nAs for the pancakes... My 6 year old is a complete pancake foodie and claims their red velvet are the best in town. She always picks this place for breakfast and I can see why because they treat her like a princess and give her the hook up with the extra whipped cream. My husband loves the German chocolate pancakes but claims he will have a heart attack if he eats them more than once a year. All the pancakes are incredibly decadent and today, when we went I watched a woman steal her husband's Banana Foster pancakes and ate half of them before he even noticed lol.\n\nI highly recommend you come here and take your time it's worth the wait. Give the menu items you've never tried a chance because your mind will be blown!
