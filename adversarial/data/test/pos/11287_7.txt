Everyone knows about the hunk** factor at Cheese Magic. Dudes that work there are super cute. However, there was a dry spell of hotness between July 2008 and April 2009, when I didn't fancy a single Cheese Magic employee. It was a rough era of my life, buying cheese minus the eye candy. My ex's best friend used to work there, and when he left, he took most of the gorgeosity with him.***\n\nI'm happy to say that the cute boys are back. In addition to providing great distraction, the Cheese Magic boys are actually nice. They'll patiently wait as you decide which of the ten types of goat cheese you want, and as you struggle to figure out the quantity in grams. Who knows a thing about grams, anyway? Not this girl. Luckily, I learned today that they actually prefer talking cheese in inches. So, an inch of havarti, two inches of brie, eight slices of gouda. \n\nI got a slab of Woolwich goat cheese from Orangeville, ON (the one I raved about in my Bier Markt omelette review: http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/esplanade-bier-markt-toronto#hrid:6Kyv5TOMgTeEAfO7I-rOzw), some Danish blue cheese, Finnish Muenster and La Sauvagine.\n\nI asked for that last cheese by description only. This week I had some amazing cheese at Tara A's house but she didn't know the name of it. She said she goes to Cheese Magic and asks for \"the cheese that's a cross between Brie and Camembert\" and they know which one to give her, so I did the same, and they let me sample it (as all cheese shops should!) before buying it. It was indeed the one! Now I know.\n\nI had to subtract a star for the lack of labels. Looking back at the cheese I bought, I can't remember which is which, or what some of them are called for future reference. I guess we can't all be smokin' hot AND practical.\n\n**Yes, I'm bringing back the term \"hunk\", along with \"no guff\", \"radical\" and \"bogus\".\n***Yeah, it almost broke us up. What can I say - he was a megahottie!
