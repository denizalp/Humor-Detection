The architecture may be nice, have elevator music and all the fancy schmancy stuff but the customer service sucks and swallows. The employees are rude, they ignore the customers or simply turn around without answering a simple question. I was there yesterday and it was impossible to find someone to help me find a book I needed even the computer said there were two copies left.\n\nThanks God for Amazon.com.....they got 80 $ from me, which means I saved 10 $.\n\nIndigo got 0$ and probably will not get anything for me in quite a while
