Warning: this review is going to be unsettling.\n\nThe food was typical hibachi food which I think is always delicious. The chef was great. Service was friendly and prompt. We saw the menu said auto gratuity for parties of four or more. We were five. So we asked. Then the waiter made a motion with his hand, waving it over his face and said, \"no that's just for black people.\"\n\n!!!!\n\nWhat!!!!!!\n\n!?\n\nThat's all.
