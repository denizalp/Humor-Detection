I LOVE Trader Joes!\n\nI dont know if it is that I am a sucker for branding, a sucker for inexpensive pretty bouquets of flowers (and you see them as soon as you walk in)...and if I lived in another state, I'd be a sucker for their $2 Chuck.\n\nThe only thing about Trader Joes is that they are always packed, so I have to remind myself to BE PATIENT.  Sometimes in the produce\/cheese section it's so crowded and people are just standing there staring, like they have never seen food before.  It's the same thing at whole foods but I mind it less at Trader Joe's bc I'm not spending $80 for a block of cheese and a radish.\n\nTheir goat cheese is amazing, and its the staple of my summer spaghetti (melted goat cheese, roasted red pepers, in spaghetti, w basil).  \n\nLet's just say if we were in a post apocalyptic  society, and I was the ruler, I would accept Trader Joe's jalapeno & cilantro hummus as valid currency, bc it is delicious.\n\nEveryone loves their Orange Chicken.  Its a no brainer.  I keep it in my fridge for when I want Chinese food, but I dont feel like dealing with ordering Chinese food.\n\nThe roasted butter nut squash soup is epic.\n\nThey got rid of their Masala sauce which breaks my heart.  Why?  Why would they do that?\n\nBUT--they make up for it with their marinated meats which I love.  And the spiced mangos...my favorite snack.\n\nHow can you not love Trader Joes?
