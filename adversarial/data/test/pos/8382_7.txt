I drive by this place all the time in the evenings, but one Saturday afternoon I finally drove by while it was open. I decided to do a U-turn and check it out. I'm a fantastic driver.\n\nDo you know how wondrous it is to just happen on a weird little place like this? It's nooks and crannies are full of surprises, and everyone you encounter is willing to have a little chat. I just strolled my happy ass into the place and knew immediately I would come back. It's the closest thing in Phoenix I've found that resembles Slab City out in the desert between us and LA. Damn, this place is cool ... and so strange ... and as I wandered around the micro succulent garden, iced tea in hand, the sounds of Santana's Black Magic Woman fluttered through the air. Um, is this place literally calling to me right now? Morgan, you freak, you are home! \n\nMight even have to rent the Airbnb out back. Who doesn't love an outdoor shower and an eclectic vibe? Oh, yeah, the uptight and unadventurous. This place isn't for you.
