My wife and I came to Las Vegas to see a Country & Western concert across the street from the Luxor.  The Luxor is big. It is easy to find.  When we arrived finding the \"right\" place to drop off the car took a little time to locate.  The staff coming in was very nice and professional. However, the man who checked us in gave us no information, and he kept using the term \"guys\"  \"You guys\".  I am a university professor\/grandfather and my wife is a physician.  Being referred to as \"you guys\" was inappropriate and unacceptable. \n\nThey upgraded us to a \"better\" room.  When we got to the room, we wondered what we were upgraded from, because the room was clean, neat, yet small.  \n\nThe room was a surprise.  There was NO coffee pot nor courtesy bottled water in the room.  There was no refrigerator.  There were no pay-per-view movies.  We couldn't find a list of hotel services and locations.  We couldn't find a menu for room service.  After three days, we are still unsure if they have room service.  We looked it up on the Internet and in fact, they do have room service, but you wouldn't know it if you just checked out the room.\n\nThe Casino is huge, but there are few places to eat, and most have very limited hours.  On Saturday, we got back and couldn't find an open restaurant.  We asked one of the security guards at midnight who told us it was the Deli and a McDonalds.  After roaming for awhile we found a group of restaurants open until one outside the hotel..  \n\nThe Luxor did a great job getting us to the venue.  There was a shuttle going across the street.  We tried to get information about the tickets and we were given different information.\n\nThere is no desk in the room.  It is not expensive to stay here, but the lack of amenities and being forced out of our rooms to get any services seemed like we are being encouraged to gamble.  There was no entertainment, no music in the hotel, and my wife and I don't gamble.  I guess we are not the Luxor \"appropriate\" guests.
