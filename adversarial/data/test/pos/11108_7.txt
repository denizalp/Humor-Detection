I stopped in this place years ago when this was a Penzoil franchise. Not a good experience. I was desperate because I couldn't get into Oasis Auto Center ($23 for oil change) where I normally go. So I thought I'd give Jiffy Lube a try. Yes, I paid almost double what I normally pay  ($42 and change)  but I was willing to pay for the \"convenience\". \n\nA few minutes later the manager asked me to come out to give him basic info, name, address, etc.. Then the hard sell began. Tranny flush. air filter, coolant, yada yada yada. I explained that I'd just had the car serviced by my Honda guy and if I did need an air filter (which I didn't) I'd buy my own and put it in.  I also explained I have my own coolant at home. I said \"I just need an oil change\" to which he replied \"I'm just doing my job sir\". I've been in sales dude. If your leading pitch falls flat, leave it the *&^% alone!!  Until about 20 years ago, I did almost all my own auto repairs (my generation actually understands that stuff). Now I can afford to pay a mechanic to do it, but I've never been ripped off because I know my way around cars. I absolutely hate it when you walk into a place like this and they assume you are stupid. He finally backed off and agreed to let me just get my oil changed.\n\nWhen I checked out, a young kid told me I had an oil leak and a transmission leak. Yes, I knew this, they are minor leaks. The car is 15 years old. If I need a repair, I'll take it to my Honda guy, not this place!! He also told me I could get a top off at any Jiffy Lube, which really means if my oil is low, I can stop at any Jiffy Lube and get another heavy handed sales pitch for overpriced oil and anything else you don't really need. \n\nI won't be back.
