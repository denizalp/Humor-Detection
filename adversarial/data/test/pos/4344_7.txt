There was a large delta between my expectations for Bouchon and reality.\n\nWhat I expected was a nice, high-end brunch. What materialized, however, was a disappointment. Service was third-rate, which was especially surprising at this price point, and our various egg dishes were mediocre. \n\nThe special for the day was a relatively lame breakfast sandwich which felt damp due to the tomatoes used as a topping. The accompanying pomme frites were even soggier than the aforementioned croissant. Hands down, I would have gladly eaten an Egg McMuffin and a side of McDonald's fries rather than what Bouchon served to me last weekend. Looking back, I should have sent items back, but did not even contemplate doing so at the time. \n\nNevertheless, I remain interested in trying brunch at Bouchon's Beverly Hills location to help determine whether this experience was an anomaly. I have to think everything here cannot really be this poorly executed on a regular basis.
