Very expensive, but they provide a wide selection of food varieties. You have to pay extra for the seafood side which is not worth it! The cashier made a comment about lobster tails, which was untrue.very disappointed!! \n\nThey have Japanese, Mexican, bbq, etc. that was nice, but they didn't have a wide selection within the varieties. The salad bar was virtually non existent. They don't even have sunflower seeds!! \n\nThe food itself isn't that great. The crab legs were the worst crab legs I have ever had, the prime rib was for sure not prime. \n\nThe dessert selection was nice and tasty though. Find a different spot, not worth the price of admission.
