Pass-tea...not pasty as in nipple tassels or the other term for pale.Every time I come here there's always something I've set my taste buds on having but it's not available. One time, it was banana beer. Another time, it was chicken tikka Massala pasty.\n\nBut the service makes up for it. The times that I've been here, the servers were very friendly and chatty. The recommend substitutes for what I want but they didn't have have been great. No banana beer, I got to try ginger beer. No chicken tikka Massala pasty, I got to try veggie tikka Massala pasty. Both of which I probably would've never tried.\n\nCrabbies Ginger Beer: \nFrom Scotland. Very sweet and a mild taste of ginger. Ginger is good for you. Sold by the bottle. 5\/5\n\nStrongbow Hard Cider:\nYour typical apple cider. An apple a day, keeps the doctor away. On draft. 4\/5\n\nBanana Beer:\nFrom England. This is hard to find even online. Total Wine is out of these beers until who knows when. Your neighborhood grocery store doesn't have this. It's super delicious. Like a banana dessert made better because it's beer. This is currently my favorite beer. Sold by the bottle. 5\/5\n\nVeggie Tikka Massala Pasty:\nI love how I couldn't tell I was eating something vegetarian. I'm a huge carnivore so for me to like this is a big deal. The red curry taste was fantastic. Very filling. 4.5\/5\n\nChips with Garlic:\nBaked thick-cut fries...chips in English. They bake the garlic with the chips so you get a bit of a burnt garlic taste. I love garlic, period so it doesn't bother me. The chips are slightly crisp on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. Ketchup on the side. 4\/5\n\nChocolate Bread and Butter Pudding:\nYou can get this with vanilla ice cream or Creme anglaise...or both. The bartender helped me decide between this and the PB&J pasty so you can guess which won out vote. Homemade bread, cream with alcohol. Slightly crisp edges. You can taste the alcohol. 3.5\/5\n\nStrawberry Pavlova:\nThe presentation is very pretty and impressive. I did not expect something so pretty to come from a pub. It has a meringue base, cream, kiwi slices, strawberry slices and halved grapes with raspberry coule. It's light, fruity and creamy. 4\/5\n\nThey have happy hour from 3-6pm and 10-midnight everyday and it's $1 off draft beer and wine. Mondays: 14oz cider for $3. Tuesdays: $1 off all bottled items. Wednesdays: $5 glass of wine. Sundays: happy hour all day. They have Rogue Hazelnut beer on draft - another favorite of mine. You can come here solo, with a friend or with a group - you'd never feel lonely.\n\nThe bigger tables to the left of the entrance are church pews. Something about that that makes me feel guilty so I choose never to sit there. The bar is the perfect spot so you can watch them prepare pasties.
