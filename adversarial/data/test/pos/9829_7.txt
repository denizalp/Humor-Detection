My husband has been OBSESSED with the \"BBQ pork rice-noodle soup\" at this place for years. He thinks the BBQ pork is some of the best you can get in Chinatown and the price for this soup (very filling) is super-duper cheap.\n\nSo why 3 stars?\n\nWe went there last night and the lady behind the counter was chewing and sucking on a piece of chicken (or duck?) and then immediately used those same hands to chop up some meat and collect it into a takeout container (thankfully not our takeout container). \"Gross-atating\" as we used to say in elementary school. Lady, you work in a restaurant, get it together!!
