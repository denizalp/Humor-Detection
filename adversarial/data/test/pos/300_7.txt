New to poke.. this place is happy to help you with your first poke adventure (I watched the guy in front of me as they explained how it works) .. \n\nOn today's visit I had the 1\/2 brown rice, 1\/2 salad greens bowl with salmon and ahi tuna .. seaweed salad, loaded up with edamame, mango, radishes, cucumbers & avocado (its extra $), yozu & spicy garlic sauce dressing .. yum! \n\nI always go 1\/2 rice, 1\/2 salad greens because all rice bowl is too much food!! \n\nThis place is clean, plenty of seating .. they also have non-poke options and a chicken teriyaki lunch special! You won't be disappointed with this spot!
