This was our first experience at Stone & Vine.  We made a dinner reservation on Yelp for a Wednesday evening.  We arrived about 10 minutes early and were promptly seated after being greeted by the hostess.  The restaurant has a very nice ambiance that I would describe as modern and trendy.  It is also well appointed and very clean.  There is an outdoor patio area that looked really cool, although we dined inside.  Overall ambiance - 5\/5.  \n\nWe ordered a Bruschetta Board, Calamari Fritti, Chef Salad, Godfather Pizza, Penne Vodka with Shrimp, and Five Cheese Ravioli.  We thought the pizza was excellent with exceptional flavors and a crispy thin crust - we actually ordered a second pizza because the first was so good.  The calamari and salad were just average, and the two pasta dishes and bruschetta were good.  Our favorite bruschetta was the mushroom, goat cheese, and truffle oil.  We had wine with dinner and the selection was adequate.  Portion size is above average on most dishes and pricing is fair.  Overall food rating - 4\/5.  \n\nThe service was pretty good although the server was a little slow with drink refills and didn't make quite the connection with the table as I would have liked.  Overall service - 3.5\/5.\n\nThe group enjoyed our dinner and would be interested in dining here again.  Next time we'd like to try a few different selections from the menu, and maybe dine on the patio.  We've also heard good things about the weekend brunch and would like to give this a try at some point as well.
