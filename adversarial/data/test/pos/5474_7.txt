First and foremost, there's a drive thru (For Starbucks apparently) but it wasn't marked Starbucks until we got to the order speaker, which we then had to drive thru. Confusing. Also, this store's order location and pay location was confusing. There's two entrances but the order location is on the far right of the store and then we had to pay at the counter behind us. Weird. We sat down to wait on our food, which came quickly, but the order was incorrect. The person who brought our food invited us to go get our chips for our sandwiches but when I got mine and opened the bag, someone else came up to our table to confront us saying it didn't come with chips (my order, at least) and that I had to pay for it. My friend went to fix her food and pay the cost of the chips but the guy later returned to me with a paper showing I owed money on the chips still... Which my friend had already paid for. Very unorganized and embarrassing to approach us like that with other customers looking at us. On top of that, my egg whites taste like rubber and the veg out sandwich, my friends order, with only a couple turkey slices added to it, isn't worth $10.00. Won't be coming back, please find a friendlier staff.
