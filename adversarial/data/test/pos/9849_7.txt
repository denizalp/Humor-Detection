As I said before in one of my other reviews, our work EDR doesn't always cut it, so sometimes we order out. Kung Fu is great and delivers quickly, but when you work graveyard, sometimes you don't have that option.\n\nCafe Verdi is open 24 hours, and the food is okay. It's not top of my list, but it's open and it delivers, and when you can't take lunch before 3.30am, it's the best out there.\n\nHowever, this past order will be my last, as I placed an order online during a quick 15 minute break, with an estimated time of 30-45 minutes. After a little over an hour I called Cafe Verdi, and after a very lengthy hold time, I was told by what sounded like a very frazzled manager that the delivery guy left as he didn't have a room number. Now, I've ordered from here quite a few times before, and mentioned that I work at the front desk. It's not like a new customer. Never before has that ever been a problem.\n\nThe guy offered to knock $6 off the offer, and said it was really busy but he would get it out as soon as he could. Another NINETY MINUTES PASS and it's still not here.\n\nOh hellz naw.\n\nI called back the restaurant and was put on hold 15 minutes until the phones unceremoniously dumped me. I had myself a little woosah moment because now it had been two and a half hours and I was pissed, and it's not like the food is worth that kind of wait. I called back, finally got the manager again, who sounded like he was surprised (I can act surprised too, buddy), and I cancelled the order.\n\nTen minutes later, the delivery guy finally shows up, and I told him we cancelled the order. As I walked away I heard him go, \"Oh, come on!\" and he's lucky I was at work because I had half a mind to take him to task for such a pissant response (pardon my language, I have stronger words I'd rather use).\n\nI won't be ordering from here again. It may be the only thing open at 3.30am, but I'd rather get a mocha from Starbucks to hold me over until I can get real food with people who give a hoot.
