Not bad, this buffet is big!!! I got the 24 hour pass and we ate around 9:30... They close at 10pm but kept serving until everyone leaves! And all the food is still restock!! Wow very good. Dinner plus taxes and everything I saw it came to be $35. We got the 24 hours pass and didn't need to pay. \n\nLots, lots, lots of food. They even have a pho station, wonton , and other stuff. Out of all buffets for just the 24 hours! would this would come in 2nd and  bannchanel first.
