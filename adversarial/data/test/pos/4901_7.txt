After reading through all the pretty great reviews about  Surrender, my friend and I decided to give it a shot. We were headed into Vegas mid-week and wanted a place to dance and hang on a Wednesday night. 30 minutes after we arrived, I wished we'd skipped the place all together. I guess this place is only for kids (ie. those under 25)\n\nWe got to Encore around 11:30pm. We contacted a promoter, and got on the guestlist. The line to get in - both for those on the guestlist and those not  - was long. But it's Vegas, so hey - that's to be expected. As we waited in line, I felt totally overdressed... Not \"overdressed\" in that was I overly dressed up: 'overdressed' in that I wasn't naked enough. I had on 4 inch strappy heels, a top-of-the-knee length black dress with a deep neckline, plus makeup and jewelry. I left the hotel thinking I looked good... cute... ready for a Vegas club...etc...\n\nBut apparently, I SHOULD have been wearing the following: a skirt that barely covered my ass, heels I could hardly walk in, a top that was see thru and make-up that belonged in a drag show. THAT is the \"official\" attire for Surrender - at least, I assume it is, based on what 95% of the ladies were wearing... Alas, I was in that 5% of \"women\" that didn't come half-clothed.\n\n.. And I'm putting \"women\" in quotes here because very few if NONE of the \"women\" in here looked like.... well, women! OR men! At best, the average age of a Surrender patron looked to be about 22 years old. No joke. I am 31 - and F you if you say that's old!!! lol. It's not - but standing in line, both my friend and I looked at one another and whispered \"Oh Sh*t - what the F are we doing here with all these kids?!\" I felt 100 next to these fresh-outta-high-school looking babies...looked young and ACTED young! Most of these girls teetering in on their high-heels took them off 5 minutes after they got inside. Ugh, that is ghetto - if you can't dance in your heels, don't wear them to the club. What for? So you can look cute in line? lol... \n\nAnd THEN there's the MUSIC... Who the F can dance to that sh*t?! All that house\/ trance crap, are you kidding me??! But then again, not many people were dancing... seemed to be all about drinking, standing around with your \"girls\" or your \"boys,\" checking out all the other \"girls\" and \"boys.\" Hell, it was more like a high school dance, lol.\n\nAnyway... we got in free, which was the only highlight, cause if I had to pay cover to go to a place that sucked that bad, I would've been kicking myself for the rest of the trip. As it was, we stayed 2 hours, hoping the crowd or music would improve. When it didn't, we left. And all this BS about the \"ambiance\" of Surrender.. people on Yelp act like this was the most AMAZING-looking club, \"so pretty\" etc... LOL!!! Have you guys NEVER been to an upscale club before? Wow, a pool in the middle! Lights outside... That's SOOOO awesome! Damn, you can tell the people reviewing this place are barely 21, lol!!\n\nSO FINAL SYNOPSIS: If you're under-26, are white or Asian, don't want to dance and just want to flirt and drink with perves and scantily-clad girls and boys while the DJ yells 'Lemme hear you Vegas!\" every 10 minutes while the crowd screams (lol!) , Surrender is your place. It's like a Gymboree for 20-somethings; a place for all the kiddies to hang...For all the adults (ie. 30 and up), spend your time elsewhere on Wednesday nights in Vegas.
