I was there in line for the ribbon cutting, shook Dick's hand and said \"thanks for coming to Arizona\". At the Scottsdale opening I was in line but in the first 100 through the door. The turn-out for the Tempe opening was a bit quieter, this time I was about 12th in line. The same guy who was customer #1 for ALL Portillo's openings was there too, flew in for one night then back home this afternoon. (in the ribbon cutting photo he is on the extreme right border, white hair, camera.) The usual suspects for the ribbon cutting were there. \n\nAt Portillo's -the- thing to order is the Italian beef, dipped, with hot peppers (which are rather mild). Although they don't display the banner, their beef is Vienna Sausage, made in Chicago.\n\nGod Bless Dick Portillo! Thanks to the Tempe Marketplace Portillo's staff for making it a wonder meal, and a wonderful opening!\n\nParking: They have their own lot you can enter off McClintock or it's easier to enter the mall and park in the far south-west corner and walk the 20 yards and have an easier exit. The restaurant is literally at the (NE) corner of McClintock and University.
