I stumbled upon this shop when we were at Scottsdale Quarters. I took 3 of my old cell phones the next day to this shop at Scottsdale quarters. Jon analyzed the phones and he fixed one of the iPhone. Jon has good knowledge and he is very friendly. He explained me the issue and fixed the device in 35 min. He even cleaned the device as there was some damage due to lithium diffusion. He replaced the battery and boom the device worked like magic. Very reasonable prices and has warranty on all the replaced products. \nThis place is a one stop solution for all your device problems. \n\nPS: They don't fix HTC M8 and M9 due to some device issue.
