It was time for a new sofa and I was leaning towards something blue. I've searched online for weeks and finally decided to go with RC Willey. I called the Summerlin store to make sure the couch I wanted was available and it was. I made arrangements with Steve to come by and look at it later that day. The couch was right at the entrance, sat on it and decided in minutes. I did all my research ahead of time and really knew what I wanted. I walked around for a bit to see if something would catch my eye and Steve came up and that was it. I was in and out of there in 30mins. \n\nI bought the couch Wednesday and it was delivered on Tuesday. I was half awake when they came by and just signed the form. Today, I'm re-arranging my living room and noticed a rip in the inside cushion of the sofa. I decided to inspect the loveseat also and saw 2 rips on the left and right side. I called RCW and they're coming with a whole new set on Monday. \n\nMonday arrives- a brand new set is delivered and I find the same problem with it. Their solution is to have someone come back and tighten the seams. Once they leave, I also notice the lack of stuffing on the arm rest. I decide to wait until they send someone so I can show him what I noticed. \n\nFew days later- They guy they sent to tighten the seams agreed that the inside of the arm rest lacked stuffing and recommended for another replacement. \n\nLast sofa delivery- The seams are good but I was not completely satisfied with the arm rest still as you can see from the pictures. The rest of the family thinks I'm being picky so I settled. Yes, I settled. I was tired of making appointments for delivery, I just wanted it done already. \n\nYou be the judge.
