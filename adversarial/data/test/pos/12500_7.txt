Wow, their selection is HUGE. There is so much to choose from, I don't know where to begin. There's even an entire taco bar and meat carving station. Pretty cool!\n\nI was able to make it in just before dinner started on a Saturday. So I was able to pay brunch price ($8 cheaper than dinner) but get dinner items ;) Surprisingly, the wait wasn't long at all - maybe 10-15 mins? But my group did go at an odd hour (just before 3pm, which is when dinner begins).\n\nStandouts were the truffle gnocchi (delicious truffle flavor!!) and the prime rib (tender and juicy). The eggplant tofu from the Chinese section was surprisingly good, too. As for desserts, the creme brûlée was my favorite!\n\nEverything else I tried was decent, but not noteworthy. The pork belly was way too salty. The sushi was pretty average.\n\nNext time I'd actually like to try their brunch\/lunch items haha.
