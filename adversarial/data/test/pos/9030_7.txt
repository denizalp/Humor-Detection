I contracted New Planet Moving to move my furniture from Houston to San Jose. I contacted several companies to get competitive pricing and favorable terms. I work in Contract Management, so I am quite used to reading the terms and conditions for the Contract. New Planet Moving 's quote and terms seemed reasonable to me, so I signed an agreement with them to move my furniture. The sales person promised me that that they would perform the move themselves, instead of subcontracting the work and my stuff would be stored in their climate controlled warehouse in NV. One of my criteria to select the moving company was use a company that performed the move themselves. In this business, there is a lot of subcontracting and your stuff can be loaded and unloaded on trucks several times and since this is not their stuff, they really don't care about ensuring the safety of your stuff. Another reason to select them was that since they have a warehouse in NV, the delivery would be much faster as it is comparatively closer to CA than TX.\nThe salesperson was really nice and responsive initially. She also said that their minimum was 2000 Lbs and my estimate was at 1500 lbs so I would add additional 500 lbs at no cost, if I wanted. Once I paid my deposit everything was downhill from that point forward. Everything that she told me was a lie. \nOn the day of the move, someone from a totally different company (Houston Movers R'US) shows. The foreman, who barely spoke English, took two steps into my living room and started saying that I had too much stuff and that I would have to pay more money to move everything. I have never seen such rehearsed and poorly delivered sales pitch. I mean literally this guy took two steps, and started his rant about too much furniture. I lived in a two bed room apartment, and he was still in the entry foyer! So first, he took out his agreement and wanted me to sign his agreement for the move. BTW this agreement was totally different than the one I had signed up for. The original agreement did not have any elevator charge; the additional fee applied after 75ft not 50ft and was $2.5 per 100lbs instead of $75 for every additional 50ft. So I had to read the contract with him line by line and cancel\/change all the terms to the ones I had originally agreed to. PLEASE NOTE, CHECK THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE CONTRACT THAT YOU SIGN ON THE DAY OF THE MOVE, THESE TEND TO CHANGE FROM THE ONLINE QUOTE TO ACTUAL SIGNED DOCUMENT ON THE DAY OF THE MOVE, the one you sign on the day of the move supersedes the ones you previously signed. \nAfter loading all my stuff, the foreman spends some time on calculations to account of extra items and tell me that I owe him an additional $1100. Then he gives me another spill from his \"sales\" speech, about how I seem to be a nice guy and he will like to work with me, so he will cut me a great deal and round it off to $1000. Seriously!! So I asked him to show me how he calculated the additional $1100. So he started explaining his calculations and then says that he made a mistake. He calculated the additional weight and multiplied it by the rate for additional cubic ft, instead of additional weight rate ($0.79 per lb). So now the new number for additional charges was $600After reviewing the items he had included in the additional list, I reminded him that I still have about 500lbs that I can add at no additional cost. So he had to revise his numbers again, now I was 1 lbs over the 2000lbs limit. So there were no additional charges. But this entire experience was horrible. New Planet Moving never showed up, they subcontracted this work to another company which was not what they promised. The company that showed up to load my stuff was completely unprofessional and wanted to squeeze additional money right from the get go. \nDelivery is another story, but by this time New Planet Moving completely washed their hands of this contract and told me to directly talk to their \"sister\" company Houston Mover R'US.
