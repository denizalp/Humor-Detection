Food is good, service is to be desired.\n\n\nI work in the same plaza as this place. Yesterday, a really nice gentleman stopped by our office and told us about their specials and was personable, so I thought I'd give them a try.\n\nThe food is good.  I ordered the turkey, bacon, avocado combo for $8.50 and also ordered a lemon bar.  The bread was a bit greasy but over all yummy.  I am a bit confused as to what a pocket vs bread is.  When I ordered, I was asked which way I wanted my bread, I asked her recommendation and she told me to get the pocket. I'm pretty sure I didn't get the pocket as she recommended since it was just a regular sandwich...that took over 15 mins to make.\n\nSo here's where the 3 stars instead of 5 stars come into play.\n\nWhen my co-worker and myself arrived, there were a few people seated, already eating.  We walked right up to the cashier and ordered.  A few minutes after we ordered, a group of 4-5 guys came in. As we stood around waiting for our food, I noticed one of the guys in the group already had their food.  Then my co-worker got her food. I noted that was odd because I ordered my food before everyone.  After a few minutes, I was given a bag.  I looked at it and thought it was light, I noticed I wasn't given my lemon bar. She packed my lemon bar and we walked across the parking lot, back to the office only to realize they didn't give me my sandwich!  So basically, they forgot to give my HALF my order. I received a cup for my drink and the fries. And had to ask for the rest of my order because they forgot.  Seriously, how do you forget to give a customer their sandwich?\n\nWhen I walked back in, the cashier recognized me and told me they tried to chase after us but was too late. Which is odd, considering we were walking across the parking lot.\n\nAll in all, food is good.  I'll probably be back, but I will probably place a phone order and triple check my order before I leave.
