I come to this one often enough. Today we picked up a Cinnamon Crumb Cake which was far better than typical supermarket bakery fare. The cake itself had the consistency of a danish with a very nice white butter cream frosting in between the layers. Yeah, you wouldn't think...\n\nAlso likeable are the little trays of pepperoncini, olives, mozzarella balls, and peppadews they sell.\n\nThis was also where my first experience with the magical, sweet, spicy African pepper known as the peppadew occurred. Thank you, Giant Eagle.\n\nComing here makes me jealous of youngsters. Why? Well they have some area where parents can leave their children so they can shop. Inside the kid's area are video games for them to play, and adults 'aint allowed in. Well, I've never asked. That would be awkward and a little weird. \n\nHow about letting bored husbands and boyfriends in, eh? Maybe put a widescreen TV too? Or make a separate area for tagalong grown- ups? \n\nI mean, those little buggers were playin' Halo in there! Halo!!\n\nI kid...the kids of today. Where in the hell were the Ataris and Nintendos when I got dragged along with Mom on a shopping trip?\n\n\"Now you can't go to Phantom of the Attic until we're done at Giant Eagle, ok?\"\n\nGrrrr...
