I saw the new Michael Moore movie here today (yeah whatever, I'm a commie, deal).  It was the first time in at least a year that I saw a movie here, and I was reminded of what a really grand theater this is. They have great sound and picture, not to mention seating. It's nice to have another theater in the heart of the city so one doesn't have to travel to Suburbia just to see a flick. \n\nAgain the concession prices are outrageous. $9 for a small bag of popcorn and a medium Pepsi. $6.75 for a matinee ticket.
