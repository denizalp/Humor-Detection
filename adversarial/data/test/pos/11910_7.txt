If you can help it, DO NOT WEAR TIGHT PANTS TO THIS PLACE. I wore a stretchy, forgiving dress, and it was a smart move.\n\nI came here with Kris and Edwin for some tasty AYCE. Our server was absolutely delightful. Friendly, disarming, knowledgable about the menu, she had it all. \n\nStandout items: \n- Coconut shrimp\n- Satay beef\n- Salmon sashimi\n- White tuna sashimi\n- Bangkok street style pad Thai (not mind blowing but I really enjoyed it)\n\nThe atmosphere is very classy, which almost makes me feel bad about absolutely stuffing my face hole. But rules is rules and I certainly had all that I could eat.\n\nI will definitely be back again, and in greater numbers, too!
