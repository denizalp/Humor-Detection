They should change the name to the SUXor because this place sucks.\nSnotty desk staff will take your 20 and still look at you as if you just took a dump on their counter, plus you will get NOTHING from them, so save your money and don't tip the desk staff expecting anything.\nThe rooms are DARK like so dark you can't read a book comfortably.\nThere are no full mirrors in the rooms, no minibar or minifridge.\nMy television was missing a remote control which took 3 calls and 5 hours to rectify.\nThe elevators incline at a very strange angle and it feels like you are on a ride at an amusement park only it isn't amusing.\nThe plumbimg made a clanging noise all night and day \n\"it's in the pipes\". It was like Chinese water torture.\nThe buffet at Pharaoh's Pheast was less than memorable, and don't go by what it says on the main floor, cause quite a few of the items that were supposed to be on the buffet were no where to be found.\nAlso, stay close to your room if you eat here, I was running for the bathroom not long after eating.\nThe internet connection they offer is neither cheap nor reliable as I kept getting disconnected and had to keep logging back in. \nThere are many other places to stay that look like they are better maintained, this place looks good a first glance, but a closer look will reveal that it is not worth it.\nI once stayed at the Embassy Suites here, and would go back there before coming back to the Luxor.\nActually most people I've spoken with like Alladin, Harrah's or MGM on the strip.\nOff the strip, the Hard Rock is great as is the Palms.\nAs for the Suxor, well, I've learned my lesson.
