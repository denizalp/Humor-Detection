Had a chance to stop by Farkas with some friends from out of town. Perfect reason! This store has been in my neighborhood forever and I've been so excited to try them out. \n\nWe found out about Farkas when my hubs was searching for a dessert to bring to a potluck celebration. He wandered inside this small bakery and got a whole sheet for our gathering. They were super good. The first thing he said about the Farkas guys is that they were really friendly and helpful. I had the same experience when we stopped by yesterday-they are really laid back and down to earth. \n\nWe got a few napoleons ($3) to share. They are huge! Do not be fooled by the pictures. Napoleons are basically layered desserts with a light crispy dough covered in powdered sugar. Custard and cream are layered in. So refreshing with the right amount of sweetness. Their other desserts look pretty good too.\n\nThe store itself is pretty homely-just a few small tables. It's mostly a bakery, old school Ohio City style without all the hip typography and fancy glass cases. Keep staying the same, Farkas.
