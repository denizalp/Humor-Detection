A small group of Yelp friends gathered at 346 Patisserie to spend some birthday time with one of our friends.   We got some gelato and then arranged the chairs and tables so we could chat, laugh, and just spend some fun time.\n\nI got two scoops of gelato--pistachio stracciatella and Jame's banana and 5 spice.  Both were very good but the pistachio was my favorite.  The petit chocolate chips in the pistachio were just perfect and not overdone in number.  The 5 spice gave the banana a different twist to the banana flavor.\n\nThe shop had a water dispenser at the rear of the store with cold water with lime and some rose petals to add flavor to the water.  It was cool and a nice palate cleanser after the gelato.  \n\nBefore heading out, I got a g√¢teau Basque and two black and white truffle macarons.  The macarons, listed as savory on the card by them, had a flavor that was off putting to me.  The Basque was excellent.  They had three flavors available and I got the fig.  While the Basque I've had before were filled more and had less cake than this one, I really enjoyed the Basque and I could see myself stopping off to get another one.  The problem is they're on the other side of town.  Maybe sometime on the way back from hiking at Lake Mead when it's cooler.
