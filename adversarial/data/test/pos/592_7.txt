In the couple of years since I last visited, the Roasting Company has added a \"taproom\" area where they have table service AND BEER. I had no idea!\n\nThe chicken is still absolutely great. Moist and tasty. I'd recommend the chicken and black bean con queso. Or one of the chicken pot pies if they haven't sold out. Add a scoop of salsa (mild, hot or very hot) from their salsa bar.\n\nOther than the beer menu (and spirits too), there is a Coke fountain and urns of sweet\/unsweet tea.
