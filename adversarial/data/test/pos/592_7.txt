**Yelp 100 Challenge 2017 50\/100**\n\nAs much as I loved the Bourbon room... damn, this place just oozes sophistication and coolness. Lots of leather furniture, paneled walls... even a smaller room made to look like a study, with books on the shelves around a \"fireplace\", which I'm always a sucker for. When you enter, there is a large, gold cage that forms a semi-private large seating area.\n\nCame twice during this past weekend, since we loved it so much - once at 330 am after the clubs for a nightcap, and once around 7 pm before going out. Both times, there was plenty of seating - never more than half full. Bartenders are quick but methodical. Perfectly made old-fashioned ($17), with orange and lemon garnishes, good quality liquors, and even perfect (large) ice cubes. They also have bowls for 4-6 people that use your favorite liquor as a base, served in a GOLDEN FLAMINGO. Didn't realize that this was so important to me until I visited the Dorsey.\n\nWill be back many, many, many more times for flamingos in the birdcage.
