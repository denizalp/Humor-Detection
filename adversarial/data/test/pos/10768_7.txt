Please don't waste your time or money coming here. Very disappointing. The museum lacked representation of the Five Families, which is the most interesting part of the Mafia as far as I'm concerned. Too much of an emphasis on Cleveland, Chicago, and Las Vegas organized crime influence. \n\nThe exhibits were kind of boring. A lot of text on the walls, and not enough artifacts or things to look at. I also found the exhibits to be disorganized and lacking any real direction. They attempt to go through mob history chronologically, but it just doesn't work. \n\nAnother negative was the crowds. Way too crowded and hard to move around and actually take in the information and visuals of the exhibits. \n\nI found the museum to be largely incomplete. Needs improvement and certainly not worth the $22. If you're looking for a Crime and Punishment Museum, go to the one in Washington, DC, much better, and a more interactive history of organized crime (they have Al Capone's replica jail cell and a better police lineup exhibit). \n\nI don't feel like I learned anything new beyond the typical Mafia documentaries they have on A&E. Some of the exhibits (e.g. the Tommy gun you get to shoot) seem more gimmicky, rather than being substantial...\n\n St. Valentine's Day Massacre is very well highlighted, though.\n\nThe most interesting thing at this Mob Museum was the John Gotti suit and outfit donated by Victoria Gotti. The section on famous celebrities\/Mafia films also was good, they have clothing donated by Sopranos cast members Tony Soprano and Paulie Walnuts. But this was largely incomplete and a small part of the experience. \nI also  enjoyed was the history of Las Vegas and how it came to be what it is today. They should consider just redoing it into a Vegas history museum and just have a small section of Mob information.\n\nGift shop was pretty good too, but that's not saying much. \n\nDon't waste your time.
