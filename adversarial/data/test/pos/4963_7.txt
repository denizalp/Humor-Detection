This is a clean, cool looking place with a dash of fun, making it a cool nook to hang out with some friends for teas and snacks.  I like the wall stencils that look like street signs that I can't understand, but with added hearts. Wow, that didn't make sense at all! Well, it will make sense to you when you go. Along with the various sized aloe plants in happy face pots, it ads some cute quirk to the room.\n\nThere's a little bit of a learning curve to ordering from the iPads in the middle of the table. If it's your first time here, you might need a quick tutorial but once you figure it out it's really beneficial because.. um, because there's an iPad in the table? I don't really know what the benefit is.  I guess it saves you from having to get up an move the 8 feet to the counter and placing your order. Our hot milk teas took around 15 minutes to arrive. I think they may have forgotten about us, but I might have just been using the iPad wrong. Without a person it's really tough to say.\n\nThe hot guava milk tea I ordered was super tasty - it wasn't too hot though, which makes me think they might have missed bringing them out right away.  Altogether though, Tea Funny seems like they've got their act together and I'd definitely recommend it as a fun alternative to coffee shop hang out.
