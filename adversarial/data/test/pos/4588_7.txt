Ah, the oxymoron known as the \"pork salad\". I travel all over Vegas looking for the best. I enjoy Chipotle and Zaba's enough, but I get superior quality and unbelievable portions at Rio. When I have friends stay from out of town, you can bet I take them here. They simultaneously love me for taking them and hate me for the knowledge that they don't have a Cafe Rio in their hometown. Hehe.\n\nStart with the base--the tortilla. They are homemade, warmed up for you as soon as you order, and stay soft all the way through your meal. I order my Barbacoa pork salad (all hail the sweetest and most moist pork around). My man gets a dual-protein burrito which is the size of a newborn and takes him two sittings to finish. The Mahi Mahi tacos are excellent too, as a side note. \n\nWhat I love so much about the service is that these guys don't run you down the line like cattle, which I've felt a part of at Chipotle during the lunch rush. Too many times at Chipotle I watch my bowl fly down the line away from me as I yell out \"I'm sorry...would I like what?!?! Oh, salsa! Mild please...\" \n\nWhen they ask you which dressing you would like, just say \"house\". I think it's avocado ranch and I could drink it from the cup. A perk of Rio is that horchata is served here. My salad is so massive and rich, though, I can't even finish IT, let alone chase it with sweet rice milk. \n\nBottom line: if you're going to pay $7-$9 for one of these meals (and you will pay that no matter where you go) make it worth your while and just come to Cafe Rio. Pull up a chair, because I'll be there stuffing my face.
