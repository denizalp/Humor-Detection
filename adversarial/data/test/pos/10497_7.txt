I don't really know what all the fuss is about for this place... It's an indoor garden... YIPPEE!\n\nThey had an extremely over-sized liberty bell with an eagle on top (looked like someone stole it off a Macy's Parade float). Live birds in cages (about 8 in total) fountains (two were positioned incorrectly and it screwed up the timing effect) and a big gaudy, non-functional ferris wheel...  \n\nWe came here because my mother likes it... Not my choice... And I do not plan on coming back, even if they change the setting... Go stand outside and watch a real water show!
