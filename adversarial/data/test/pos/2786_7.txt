Excess VIP and its co-founder Steve Edsall are simply amazing. We have been working with Steve since 2012 and he never disappoints. There are hundreds of hosts and VIP companies out there but rest assured after using Excess many times they have YOUR best interests in mind. Vegas can be a difficult place especially for parties of all guys... Each time we used Excess they were on time and on point. By pass the 3-4 hour lines to your arranged tables, booths and cabanas with bottles waiting. We have used them for clubs like XS, Drai's, Rehab, Omnia, Surrender and plenty more. Never had an issue and always got what was promised. Not only that but they arrive to the clubs early to make sure the managers and severs are ready for you and most importantly that you have the best section \/ table for what you have paid for....    Excess is not as huge as some other host companies but that means you're party is treated well and with the attention it needs, not as a number.  Promoters will promise you the world and winging it is not something you can do in Vegas. Trust me from worldwide travel experience give Excess VIP a call, ask for Steve and rest assured your time in Vegas is in the best possible hands... \n\n(Mobile review, please excuse my typos!)
