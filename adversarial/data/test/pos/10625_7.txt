One of my top favorite places to eat breakfast at in Las Vegas. The restaurant is not too far from UNLV which is very convenient for college students like me. When I go I always order \"The Little Boy Blue\" which comes with blueberry pancakes, two pieces of bacon or sausage, and your choice of eggs. I also order a side of their hash browns that are made fresh. You can definitely taste the difference between Denny's and Blueberry Hill.\n\nThe blueberry pancakes I order are so delicious! There's no need for syrup on these pancakes because they top it with blueberries, and blueberry jam. What's the point of going to a placed named \"Blueberry Hill\" without trying any of their blueberry concoctions?\n\nWhatever you decide on ordering in the end will not disappoint. My word of advice however, be ready to want to come back for more!
