Excellent Lebanese cuisine. They have shawarma, kabobs, daily specials, pastries, and more. I am so glad I found this place on Yelp. This place reminds me of being back home in Dearborn, MI. They make the garlic sauce the proper way here too. If you like Middle Eastern cuisine, then you will love this place. The only thing that I don't care for is the beef shawarma. It is actually the meat the Greeks use for the Gyros. I wish they had the lamb that the Lebanese use. I love everything else though. Stop in and try it!!
