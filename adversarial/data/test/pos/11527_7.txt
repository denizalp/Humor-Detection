Are u freaking kidding me?! This place is horrible! I am down to eat a delicious 5 thousand calorie burger any day, but not if it tastes like crap! I paid 16 dollars for a giant old tasting burger that had flavorless meat and came with disgusting soggy fries that look like burnt fingers!  It's dirty and a tourist trap! Too bad too! Everyone love a good burger! Never again Heart Attack Grill!
