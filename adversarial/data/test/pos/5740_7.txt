Drais Beach Club used to be a Las Vegas staple. The staff and dancers were nice and you felt respected at whatever level you paid or didn't pay to get in. \n\nThis week was a different experience. The ginger glorified \"section manager\" clearly values the attention of his Male clientele. He pushes and mans handle women who step in his way. But is ever so gentle when approaching a man. But dont complain ladies because if you do he tries to use his limited life authority to eject you from the section. I get some folks would rather check their self respect at the door for a $1500  bottle of ciroc to empress a few IG followers so I'm sure this routine PAYS OFF for the wannabe Arnold ginger guard. He probably plays this game a few times a night for a few extra bucks. \n\nAll that to say...The scene is old so just go for the concert...DONT PAY...do a guest list. There are other clubs that pay hip hop music now so don't make Drais you're only stop. The owner is a Trump supporter anyway.
