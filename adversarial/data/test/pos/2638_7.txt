4.5\/5\n\nThis place is really fun and has great food.  I have had it bookmarked forever and finally have been up in their area for a training class so I gave it a try for the first time on Friday.  I took a couple of coworkers with me and we all enjoyed our food.  We called in the order when we left the office and they had it ready when we got there.  I had the mushroom and Swiss burger with pesto on a potato roll.  I love that blending of flavors and my burger was really good, but decided at the time that the next time I would get a double.  The burger isn't really too small for the bun, but they are good, hearty buns and a double would really fill it out well.  The homemade chips are just like I like them, light, crispy, and brown.  A couple of them were soggy, but overall they were very nice.  I got to try an onion ring and knew I wanted to order them the next time around as well.\n\nSo...the very next day I brought my husband up to try it out.  We ordered a double and he chose the toppings.  It was something like mushroom, Swiss, bacon, and lettuce, with the onion rings.  I decided to try their brat with chips.  Everything was delicious.  The fresh buns really are a nice touch and we like the fact that you can bring up to 2 beers with you and drink them with the meal, as long as you are sitting inside.  I can easily handle and appreciate that.  The two gals working there are super friendly and helpful and add to the positive experience.  \n\nThe only reason they aren't a perfect five stars for me is that the burgers do have a pressed look to them that leads me to believe they might have been frozen.  If they did freshly-ground, never-frozen beef for those burgers, they would really be over the top.  Aside from that though, as a whole, they put out some great food in a fun environment with funky album covers, posters, and memorabilia all over the place.  I love Billy Joel with those bedroom eyes staring at me while I'm in the can.  All the reminders of when the best music was created.  I look forward to my next visit.
