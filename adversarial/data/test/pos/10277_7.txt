So I've made a lot of bad decisions in my life and not going to Dog Haus while I was a UNLV student and mere minutes away everyday certainly counts as one of them. I ended up at Dog Haus because one of my mates from London had a bit too much to drink the night before and wanted \"some dirty delicious American food\" this turned out to be one of the best decisions we made. Since it was first time we decided to order a few things and share. We got the little leaguer, hangover burger and the reservoir hog with regular and chili cheese tots. First off, they use quality bacon which is a must with me and their party is definitely fresh ANd well matched. I also am a giant fan of Hawaiian rolls and their sweetness totally pairs well with the savoriness of the meats and chilies. \nI like their combinations of meats and veggies and stuff and that most of their sausages are wrapped in bacon because you can never have too much bacon. \nThey also serve alcohol and they had several delicious looking beers on tap but I wasn't able to park take. Neither was I able to put their margaritas to the test. I love that they advertise having alcohol instead of basically keeping it hidden like another restaurant *cough*Chipotle*cough*  hot dogs and margaritas and GOOD BACON= 5 stars from me anyday
