I am not Hawaiian, but I have been snooping around Yelp long enough to realize that there are a lot of fine Hawaiians living in Las Vegas. They have been making their rounds to every Hawaiian eatery and yelping their love. Mahalo nui loa! \n\nI followed their yelpings to Island Style, a Hawaiian\/Korean joint. When I set out on my Island journey, I had sundubu and banchan on the mind. I thought it might be closed with I pulled up. They have highly reflective glass, so you can't see inside, but I trusted the open sign and went on in. The restaurant is definitely a little hole in the wall, but very warm and inviting. They have nice wooden tables pushed together to accommodate large parties. When I arrived, there was a family of probably ten eating. They all seemed very happy. There is also a large TV, and they were tuned into March Madness. \n\nI thought I should order from the counter, but if you are eating there, just take a seat. The owner, who is friendly and helpful, came over to take my order. I really wanted a kimchi sundubu, but they only have a seafood one on the menu. I didn't want to be picky, so I decided I would try something different. (Although, he probably would have made it for me. I might try next time.) He started suggesting things, and I guess it became apparent that I had never tried Hawaiian food, so he brought out the picture menu. You know you appear clueless when they have to bring out pictures of the food.\n\nI finally decided on a spicy chicken dish based on the pictures. Just pointed right at it: \"I'll take that one there.\" In the meantime, I got a nice hot mug of Korean tea, boiled peanuts and three banchan. Yum. Yummier. Yummiest! The tea was great. Boiled peanuts are always a welcome treat, and all three banchan were fresh and flavorful. I inhaled the bean sprouts in about four bites. I felt embarrassed ordering banchan refills as a solo diner, but the super friendly server quickly noticed my bean sprout love and arrived with a new serving noting: \"I think you really liked that one!\" I didn't even have to ask! The kimchi tasted homemade with love. I finished it too!\n\nI think they went a bit easy on the spice for the spicy chicken, but that is okay. I hadn't really conveyed an \"I can handle spice\" attitude given my picture-assisted ordering incident. The portion was very generous, and the seasoning was scrumptious. If you are not an onion lover, you might want to avoid this one. However, I love onions, so the onion festival on my plate made me smile, as did my overall experience at Island Style, and it only cost $10! \n\nI am not sure if it is a good spot for vegetarians given the spam and oxtail soup and other meaty options, but you could make a good go of it with a couple of servings of banchan. The thought did cross my mind that I could have been perfectly happy with my mug of tea and my three little bottomless banchan. I am no expert on Hawaiian cuisine, so I can't say it is as good as it gets, but I can say I'll be going back to see what other tasty things I can nosh on!
