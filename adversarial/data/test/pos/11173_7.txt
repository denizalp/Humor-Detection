This is the best Worst restaurant in Vegas.. and I say that with a smile. This restaurant is in the back of one of the most smelly, ugly, trashy casino's off Boulder Hwy and I wouldn't change a thing. Crackheads, Hookers, Pimps, homeless people, bikers, and other assorted charactors are all over this place... and I LOVE IT.\n\nThe Chuckwagon has the best food around, and the prices are great. They have many specials.. I like the Chicken Fried Steak special for 5.99 but they have many more. They have a 1 pound monster cheeseburger for 9 bucks. Cant beat that. You so can eat like a king in here for fast food money. \n\nI took my GF here for her first time and Metro was out front with a bunch of people on the hoods of the squad cars.. AHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  Awesome. Highly recommended and whenever I am over on that side of town.. I go here.
