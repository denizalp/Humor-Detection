Can I hug you all one more time and tell you thank you again!!??? We had such an amazing wedding! Thank you to Spencer, Tiffany, Rainy and the rest of the staff at The Wright House. Our wedding got canceled by our other venue 34 days before our wedding. We luckily found The Wright House and they were able to work with us to get our wedding re-scheduled and planned in 2 weeks! We did have to change our date but they were SO accommodating. We had about 3 separate meetings and we were able to put everything together with no problems. The vendors they use and recommend to us were amazing as well. I didn't have any issues with a thing. They decorated beautifully, the staff was amazing I cant say that enough, the ceremony was perfect and the reception was beyond amazing. The Provencal was breathtaking when I showed up! Everything I thought of and asked for and pictured came to life beautifully! I was a little worried about having a wedding next to us at the Ballroom while we were at the Provencal, but you couldn't hear the other wedding at all. There is enough parking and you didn't even realize they were there. Planning was simple, they give you a ton of different options for everything, they are very patient and understanding and they have a few different packages you can choose from to make the wedding exactly what you want. I was not able to be to the venue early before the ceremony so when I showed up my guests were already seated. I peeked out and everything was PERFECT! After our ceremony and pictures I walked around a little and noticed they went above and beyond to make our wedding special and to give it the exact feel and look we wanted. I cant wait to get pictures back from our photographer and post them! I cant say thank you enough!!!! You guys were truly amazing and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for pulling us out of our lump and all our original issues and saving the day!
