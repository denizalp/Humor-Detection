DO NOT RUIN YOUR VEGAS EXPERIENCE!!!\nI visit Las Vegas regularly and wanted to try LINQ this time. Unfortunately, it wasn't a good idea. Room was OK. Next morning at 8.25 AM (09\/20\/2017) Fire Alarm Went off in the hotel! 30 minutes later they were able to stop the alarm.  Entire hotel woke up! I only had 3.5 hours sleep. Then decided to go back to my room and try to sleep. Do NOT Disturb sign was on my door. At 10.25 AM Housekeeper start knocking my door constantly. She asked when I am going to leave? Check out suppose to be at 11 and she is coming 35 minutes early while DO NOT DISTURB sign hanging on my door!\n***Note: 2 HOMELESS guys were sleeping in my corridor.
