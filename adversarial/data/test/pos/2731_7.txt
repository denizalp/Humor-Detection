I feel lied to. MTV\/big brother\/movies really hyped this place up. After going out to some fabulous places on the strip, i can't help but see this place as a downgrade. Not worth the cab fare. When there are tons of great vegas clubs down the strip, there's no need to travel out of your way for a mediocre spot with bad music and long lines. \n\nNot to mention, if you want to leave, the only way out is an ELEVATOR. WTF? What if there is a fire?? What am I supposed to do? WAIT MY TURN?
