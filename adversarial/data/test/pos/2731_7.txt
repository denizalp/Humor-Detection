honestly maybe it's because i received so much hype about this place but i was disappointed after eating here especially comparing it to other AYCE sushi places in the west island, i find there wasn't many options for actual sushi rolls and they didn't taste that good and i found it took a while to receive my food it was so awkward i kept bumping my chair into the people behind me but she was kinda cute ngl but forreal forreal there are better places to eat foo
