For all the years this McD's has been here which is basically as long as I can remember it's been a staple in the Markland Woods area.  Essentially this is the 2nd closest McD's to where I live and of the two it's the only in a residential area (Mill Rd and Bloor) very close to the Etobicoke\/Mississauga border.\n\nThis McD's along with mostly every single one these days has been remodeled both inside and out to give a more contemporary and more upscale look when compared to the plastic and bright colors of the past.  Pretty much gone are the non-screen menus, plastic molded seating and dim lighting.\n\nIn all the years I've come to this McD's only once did I have a problem but more recently I find the staff very polite and the I've never seen the inside get too untidy unlike the one up near Commerce and Eglinton.  \n\nThis strip mall can get pretty busy as can this parking lot can get packed at times.
