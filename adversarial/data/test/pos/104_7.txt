This experience was not recent, but I forgot that I never reviewed! I haven't been back to Canary's since. The waitress brought over a cup of ranch- without putting it on a plate. She carried it with her thumb in the dip. That's worth repeating- SHE HAD HER THUMB IN THE RANCH. After she set it down on the table and took her dumb thumb out of it, she licked her thumb. \n\nEw.\n\nI shudder just recalling the incident. \nThat alone was enough to keep us from going back.
