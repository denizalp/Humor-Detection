A quick walk from station de l'Ã‰glise is the newest and coolest doggy cafe: Ruff Haus. We rolled up here with our posse of snorty, somewhat hyper Frenchies and took over the corner by the front window. We were greeted by the sweetest waitress ever, who came over with treats and fresh water for the pups. We humans settled in with the menus and ordered up some drinks.\n\nIt's a restaurant, so you do need to order food if you're going to drink booze, but the prices are all reasonable and everything came out quickly and was tasty.  I had the faux chicken wrap and it was really good. Lots of beers on tap and a full bar, so there's definitely something for every taste.\n\nAll of the staff is friendly and obviously, loves dogs. The owner was so happy that our crew came by and kept asking when we're coming back. She opened up the gym on the side even though it hasn't been completed yet so that the beasts could run around off leash and play. Unlike some of the other dog cafes, this one has little hooks all over the floor so that the pups are tied up and right by your table, they aren't supposed to wander (mine escaped at one point though and everyone was very cool about it!)\n\nThe place is super cozy, plays great music and people are constantly stopping by the window to laugh and smile at the pups...some even came in just to dole out pets and love. I left Ruff Haus with the happiest, warm feeling and can't wait to go back.
