I love walking into this place. I always feel like there are more people working in the restaurant than eating. It's like an army of lunch food makers. There are all sorts of snacks, treats, sandwiches, bread and other baked goods... and on and on. Everywhere. And it's all really nice stuff. \n\nThe sandwiches are why I go usually. I've had the soppressata, the porchetta, the prosciutto and a few others. All of them completely unique and incredible. I think the porchetta had chocolate pieces in the bread. Which sounds weird, and I didn't know that when I ordered it... But it was awesome. \n\nI seriously think this place makes some of the best sandwiches in the city, my only real criticism is that the bread is usually really dense, which I love usually - but on a sandwich with lots of ingredients like the ones I usually get here - I find that my jaw gets tired from eating these things. This may be the weirdest food review I've ever written. But I notice it every time I eat here. It's like a jaw workout. I still leave happy because the food is really really good. And maybe if I ate slower it wouldn't be as bad.... But ya - I sometimes skip this place if I don't feel like working my jaw into a big epic sandwich.
