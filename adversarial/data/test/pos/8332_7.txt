Not much to like.  Tucked away in the back of a small strip mall, Tom & Jerry's looks more like an afterthought.  I suspect management intended that, as indicated by the condition of the interior.  The red fabric seating is nearly black with embedded dirt, even though we have had steam cleaning in this country for decades.  The background music is \"70's Elevator\" and the smell of cigarette smoke somehow filters into  the dining area.\n\nI ordered the Lemon Pepper wings, which is coincidental, since I had been to Buffalo Wild Wings for lunch and had the same thing (easier to compare the same dish).  The wings were not nearly as flavourful or crisp as BWW, and were accompanied by beefeater fries instead of veggies.\n\nOverall, this would be a good choice for a nostalgic reminder of the diners you used to frequent before you developed taste.
