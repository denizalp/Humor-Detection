Our dog fell ill on a Saturday night. After checking around I found UrgentVet was open on Sundays. I preregistered our dog online, which gets you a $20 credit for new patients. The next morning, shortly after 10am I received an email for an appointment for our pet. \n When we arrived at the clinic, we were greeted by smiling and compassionate faces. We were led into an examination room immediately and our dog was cared for. The fact that we had an option on a Sunday was greatly appreciated. The whole staff was kind and provided explanations for all charges on our bill. \n Now our bill was steep and I would be lying if I said I expected to walk in and out with a bill less than $300. Our bill was much more than that but piece of mind is priceless. \nThank you to the whole staff at UrgentVet Pet Clinic
