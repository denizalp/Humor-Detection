I don't know how I have this place two stars 2 years ago when they clearly should have been a 1 star the whole time.\n\nA lot of you reading my reviews like to harass me for being \"harsh\" or whatever the F u want to call it. I'm my Personal opinion I call it being honest and blunt. Which I am at all times you can bet your a** anytime any day I will tell you how it is whether you like it or not.  Now let me just say I hate this specific movie theater and only come here because it's closer than others but I'm refusing at this point to come here to watch any movie we have been waiting to see for some time since my boyfriend and I don't normally make it out as much as we used too.  \n\nWhy do I hate this movie theater again?\n\n******TEENAGERS*********\nI do not miss that stage in my life what so ever.  Annoying as hell and only have gotten worse especially out here in Arizona. I'm sorry but moving out here 5 years ago has brought me to realize how ignorant\/racist\/stupid\/overly prideful arizonians are out here and it's really sickening. I would never raise my children in this state because of the type if people I've seen at this movie theater and it sums it up each and every time mostly during the summer.  Kids constantly kick your chair out here thinking I can be a rude twat waffle and kick this lady's chair and she can't do anything about it because my parents have all the money in the world and I can get away with murder.\n\nThat's the type of kids I see at this mall and theater every single time. It's awesome. NOT. (I'm totally rolling my eyes probably every other paragraph thinking of all the times I've been here)\n\nAt least in Northern California you have parents and people who have respect for people and the decency to stop their misbehaved children from ever acting like the idiots we have out here. Just sayin.\n\nLike I said this theater blows and will always suck because of all the little teens running around wild in this place. And too many to where if you did complain would be hundreds more waiting to kick the hell out of your chair, yell in your ears, laugh way too much so you can't hear a damn thing or spill food and drinks all over you and not apologize for it either.  How do you like to watch your movies? Maybe not in complete and utter piece but I can tell you I would rather listen to my dog cry like he always does in movies in my ear over all the above listed things at this movie theater. That's for damn sure!\n\n*awaits hate mail for being honest**\n\nX_x
