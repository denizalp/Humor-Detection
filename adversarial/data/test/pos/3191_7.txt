Wow.  Where to start.  This was one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant.  Normally I don't write up a review for a mediocre experience but this just stood out as exceptionally mediocre.  \n\nLet's start with a list:\n1 - visited on a non busy Sunday evening and decided to go with the mimosa special.  We were told that they don't have mimosas.  There is a sign in front of the restaurant advertising their mimosa special at $1 off. (This turned out to be lie #1)\n2 - we were told that bellinni's were on special (lie #2)\n3 - after waiting quite some time for our bellinni's to appear we were told that \"they had broken all their Bellini glasses and we would have to wait while they washed some\". - lie #3\n4 - we ordered the diavolo pizza.  We were told they didn't have the ingredients for it.  Really?  \n5 - service was extraordinarily slow.  On several occasions we saw pizza waiting on the counter with no one really doing anything about it.  One of these instances was our pizza.\n6 - we had cutlery for half the table.  It wasn't really all that clean.  We asked for some and got some after several minutes.\n7 - pizza was okay\n8 - had to constantly hunt down the waitress in order to a) order b) provide cutlery c) provide the kids meal dessert d) provide the bill e) correct the bill\n9 - bill arrives after we ask for it and lo and behold the bellinni's aren't on special.  We ask for a correction.  The waitress seems surprised that we expected a special on the bellinni's as communicated earlier by the same waitress (hitherto we shall refer to her as the liar).  The liar says she will get the bill fixed.\n10 - after quite some time the liar comes back and says she needs a manager discount and that the manager will come talk to us (okay no reason to but whatever)\n11 - after continuing to wait (while watching pizzas sit on the counter) the liar finally comes back with a discount (larger than expected) and says that the discount should have been applied automatically (lie #4).  We pay and leave.\n\nI really don't know what to think.  Did we just have a pathological liar who tells lies to cover slow service and a disorganized restaurant?  I mean who doesn't have clean glasses for a half empty restaurant?  Why offer bellinni's on special if they aren't? (Because they are $4 more each and if you don't watch the bill and ask about it they get the benefit). Or is the place simply poorly managed and can't keep ingredients in stock or train their servers?  Regardless, there are better places to eat in the extreme NW.
