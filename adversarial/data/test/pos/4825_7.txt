Their watermelon and mango bingsoo is seasonal only! Its fruity, summer-y and refreshing! \n\nBlood orange lemonade was a bit too sweet for my taste. I will stick to my matcha lattes\/frappes here instead until I figure out something new that I like. \n\nBingsoos that i've tried so far: matcha, brownie, and watermelon\/mango. The brownie one is good if you are a fan of chocolate indulgence. The matcha isnt overtly bitter however they add candy to it which makes it a little more sweeter than it should be. Watermelon\/mango is seasonal only - its refreshing and fruity. The one thing that i liked in common with all the bingsoos is how their shaved ice had the appearance of actual snow, thus melts into your mouth like actually tasting a snowflake that falls onto your tongue lol! Although I honestly would come here more towards the spring as the vegas heat strangely melts the ice a lot faster... Either that or time went by way to fast while conversing with friends for me to notice haha.\n\nThe first few weeks this place opened though, it was nice being greeted by one of their overzealous employees. I forgot his name but he was very convivial and would wander to our table full of friends to engage in random conversation when the opportunity strikes haha! I liked that his unique sense of customer service wasn't robotic at all but moreso ethusiastic. Having a flamboyant personality definitely did help with the overall guest experience as well.\n\nThe shop's interior was lovely, but that's only because I'm biased with anything white marble. They had small accents and trinkets that emphasized on the Disney character Snow White which had a unique and surreal touch of ambiance. I do like the idea of this place and can imagine myself coming through randomly for a sweet craving with random conversation; I only wish that they extended their hours more (hint hint 2am please) as it would be a decent alternative to Icy Juicy since its in the same plaza.
