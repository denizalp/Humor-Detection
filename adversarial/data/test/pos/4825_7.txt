Don't be afraid of The Bear, it's delicious.\n\nI only have one bad thing to say about Short Leash: the side salad is crap. It's literally just a bunch of dry lettuce leaves, maybe a little wet from when they were washed. I just put it on my hot dog, because eating it alone was sad. Is it that hard to add a splash of oil and vinegar? I can eat plain lettuce at home. \n\nOther than that, I love this place. Again, don't let The Bear scare you. Do it.
