The first couple of times I came here I made the appointment the same day and was seated and started on almost immediately, even though the salon was very busy. The last couple of times, however, I was still able to make a same day appointment which I appreciate but when I got in I had to wait over 20 minutes for someone to come do my nails. I girl walked in after me but was started on before me because she was a \"regular\".  If I'm able to be put on the schedule then I expect to start on time vs just walking in. My nails look good and the workers are friendly, but don't go here if you are in a time crunch.
