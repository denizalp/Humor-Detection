What I do remember was that it was the type of restaurant that you see in small town horror movies.\n\nI'm thinking the old lady retired, the kids are retarded and don't know anything about the food, and everything has just quietly been sliding downhill for years.\n\nEventually when they go out of business, (old) people will think \"Oh.
