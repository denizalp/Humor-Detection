My friends and I ate at Noodlehead in Shadyside and started walking westbound down Penn towards Lawrenceville. One friend was sore from running a half marathon earlier that day and would not stop complaining. We saw several people enjoying themselves in this bar and decided to stop in for a couple drinks. I liked the tree behind the bar and the red, circular vinyl booths. There were some intriguing women inside which only added to my appreciation of the place. The bartender was a really friendly guy and the beer selection was good. Those booths captured my attention more than the beautiful women sitting in them. Tom Waits lyrics have been stuck in my head since. \n\n\"Warm Beer And Cold Women\"\n\nOne of those nights.\n\nIt's warm beer, cold women, no I just don't fit in.\n'Cause every joint I stumbled into tonight is just how it's been.\nAll these double knit strangers with gin and vermouth.\nAnd recycled stories in the Naugahyde booths.\n\nAnd the platinum blonds, tobacco brunettes.\nI'll be drinkin' to forget you, I'll light another cigarette.\nAnd the band's playin' something by Tammy Wynette\nAnd the drinks are on me tonight.\n\nAll my conversations now I'll just be talkin' about you babe.\nBorin' some sailor as I try to get through.\nI just want him to listen now, I said that's all you have to do.\nHe said, \"I'm better off without you\" until I showed him my tattoo.\n\nAnd now the moon's rising ain't no time to lose.\nTime to get down to drinking tell the band to play the blues.\nAnd the drinks are on me, I'll back up a round.\nAt the last ditch attempt saloon.\n\nWarm beer, cold women, no I just don't fit in.\nEvery joint I stumbled into tonight that's just how it's been.\nAll these double knit strangers with gin and Vermouth.\nReceeding hairlines in the Naugahyde booths.\n\nWith the platinum blonds, tobacco brunettes.\nI'll just be drinking to forget you baby, I'll light a menthol cigarette.\nAnd the band's playing somethin' by Johnnie Barnett\nAnd the last ditch attempt saloon.
