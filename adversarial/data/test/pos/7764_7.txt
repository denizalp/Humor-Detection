Living in Ahwatukee there are not many places for a good traditional breakfast.  IHOP, Denny's, Crackers (Tried to kill us literally) so I am setting my bar low. \nI have been in three times and all three were pleasant experiences.  The first time I ordered OJ and the protein pancakes.  The OJ was not fresh but it was fine.  The protein pancakes were excellent.  Service was slow for the drinks but fast for the food.  Everything was warm and cooked well.  \nThe second time I went with two friends and ordered the two eggs breakfast with wheat toast.  The eggs were perfectly cooked as were the hashbrowns.  Both could have used some more salt and pepper but I was able to add that.  Service was good, a little slow but manageable. \nThe last time I went with my two kids and husband.  I ordered the same breakfast as above and it was good.  \nThe place is brand new and clean.  My biggest complaint is the uniforms.  I am all for trendy but the tight. short shorts need to go.  My waitress shorts should not be shorter than her apron.   Jeans would be much more professional.  \nCompared to my others options this one is rated on top.  Also the last two times I have gone the place has been crowded.  I think they are working out the kinks of being new and this will be a good breakfast place.
