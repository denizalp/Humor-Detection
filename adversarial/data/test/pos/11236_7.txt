We came for lunch and shared the fried green tomato BLT, the biscuits, and the chicken and watermelon and waffles. My favorite was the fried green tomato BLT. The flavors worked perfectly together: a little savory, a little smoky, and a little tart. The fried chicken was crispy and juicy but I didn't particularly care for the watermelon or the waffle. I could see how it would all work well together in one bite though! I would also recommend a cocktail; the blackberry bourbon lemonade was delicious.
