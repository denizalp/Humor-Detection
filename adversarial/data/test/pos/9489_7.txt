Ok yelp world, here's the cheapest deal north of the 49th parallel.  (Shhhh it's a secret, I've got a secret!)\n\nNew Fountain Fast Food is located in the food court of the recently renovated Metro Square food court.  And for $4 (yes four bucks) plus taxes you can get a combo lunch of carb, protein and sauce.  Not only that you also get a bowl of fairly decent hot a sour soup, and a cup of soy milk!  I had actually instinctively handed over a $5 plus a toonie, but the guy only took the bill and said it was 4 something and smiled.\n\nI ordered the Portuguese style chicken, which came out neon yellow, obviously sauce from a can, but it had big chunks of chicken and slices of potatoes.  It'd be exactly what I would have made at home, but with the soup and drink, I don't think I would have saved much money if I had to cook it myself.  Is this anywhere near the roasted chicken leg and Portuguese curry sauce I had in Macao?  Heck no, but I paid $7 Canadian there (which was relatively cheap for where I was) and this was fricken $4 bucks!\n\nBuddy of mine ordered the bitter melon and beef, which he said was fine.\n\nThe sauces here are all obviously pre-made and from a can\/bottle, but who the heck cares.  It'd cost me $3 just to buy the sauce from a market.\n\nIt's quick, it's decent, and its cheaper than Mickie Ds!  This place has had a price freeze since the 90s.  Why make lunch when I can just pop by here?
