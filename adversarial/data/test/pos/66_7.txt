When I stepped on the scale Saturday morning, I immediately resolved that it was time to hit the salad troughs and avoid anything that had a drop of flavour in it.\n\nI was quite glad to have 2 extra hours of training time when I decided to check my twitter just to see whats up. Whats up? yyc food trucks were down south, just near my neighborhood!\n\nSoo...I left my half-packed gym back and rushed over to deerfoot meadows and found JoJo's BBQ parked with a line up, despite the intimidating autumn cold. \n\nI've been hearing so much about these bloody food trucks from everyone I know thats tried them that I was BEYOND elated into dropping $20 into food I didn't need to consume in order to live.\n\nI ordered their Sloppy Joe special and their garlic fries. The sloppy joe meat was soft and fatty-licious but had a tinge of spice in it, couple this with some cheddar cheese and every bite became a square dance in my mouth! The garlic fries had real garlic in it and after I finished the bag, I spent another half hour sniffing the bag because it smelled so good.\n\nAfter this I went and sparred martial arts and had my fatty over-carbed-comatose state continuously smashed into the ground.\n\nOne of the worst decisions I made these past few days, lol\n\n13\/30
