Still my favorite bar in the world. I've taken to calling it the \"corner office\".  As Ohio City becomes infested by all these new suburbanites and W. 6th assholes (thanks a lot, USA Today), the Angle remains the one refuge in my neighborhood that is still relatively tolerable on weekend nights. I truly hate that Ohio City is now the new \"trendy\" place for the worst drinkers in Cleveland to hang out. The Angle is still for professional drinkers, not amateurs.
