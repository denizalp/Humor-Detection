I just watched an employee body shame a customer it was the rudest thing Iv ever witnessed them she made a fool out of the customer and talked about her to the rest of the employee and other customer that was paying A Manager or any one above her definitely needs to have a talk with this lady and teach her some manners and to have more respect for paying customers
