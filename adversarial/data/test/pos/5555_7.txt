Thank U baby Jesus, I have been waiting for Chick-fil-A to come to Las Vegas since I moved here three years ago. I am beyond ecstatic that they're finally opened, say they need open a few more. I grew up on Chick-fil-A so I think you can't go wrong with anything that you get waffle fries, Chick-fil-A sandwich, Polynesian sauce, Chick-fil-A sauce, sweet tea, lemonade, and their chicken tenders are all absolutely phenomenal choices. Their milkshakes are amazing as well as their brownies. If you have never had Chick-fil-A I suggest you go ASAP! It's the perfect place to take your family for lunch! They have a nice little play area for the kids! They are closed on Sundays which I think is absolutely amazing but that has nothing to do with the food of course. \n\nSo basically get out and get you some  Chick-fil-A!!!!
