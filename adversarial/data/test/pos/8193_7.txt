I frequent a different Smith's location usually, but haven't been happy with the service from the employees in the deli, so I decided to try this location on Aliante Pkwy out. One of the main reasons I visit Smith's is for the selection of Boar's Head Meats and cheeses they offer in the deli. Pleased with my first visit at this location, I have now been by a few times because I was not only happy with the service I received in the deli and the fact that they listen to my requests of how much I want and how I want it sliced, but the produce section was good sized and everything was fresh and priced decently. They offer a good variety of breads, pastries and bagels in the deli. The bagels are really good, I use them often to make sandwiches and I have to stop by before around noon to get the selection of flavors I want because they get picked through early in the day. Cashiers are friendly when I have gone through a line, but I love the self-checkout option since I usually only have a few items and I am able enter my Smith's rewards card with no problem giving me the proper discounts and cash back is also an option at self-checkout. The parking lot can get crazy busy since there are a lot of other businesses (cramped awkwardly I should add) in the shopping center. Driving through parts of the parking lot can be frustrating, but I'll continue to brave it because I like this location.
