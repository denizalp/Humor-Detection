WARNING = the review you are about to read has to be the longest review I have written yet.\n\nI can describe EDC Las Vegas 2011 in three words EASILY...BEST RAVE EVER!!  Never have experienced such love for the music and love for each other. Considering that there was over 85,000 people in attendance, the crowd was very cooperative with everything that was going on making the night fun and hate-free.\n\n=The DJS=\nBeing a Hawaii boy, it is very rare that I get to see a lot of my favorite DJs play live. Ive always seen videos of past EDC events and who performed. The beginning of 2011 I made sure that I was definitely going to EDC 2011. Bought my 3 day pass the minute tickets were released. Once the line up for EDC came out, I literally cried. ATB, Above and Beyond, David Guetta, Afrojack, Mt. Eden, Tiesto, Wolfgang Gartner, Steve Aoki, Laidback Luke, Skrillex, Benny Benassi, and more were all going to be there! Where else was I going to see all my FAVORITE DJS OF ALL TIME in the same place in the same weekend?? NO WHERE ELSE, THATS WHERE!! There was no disappointment AT ALL by any of the djs that weekend. Literally loved every set!\n\n=The Crowd=\nWith thousands of people around, MAJORITY of the people there were there to have fun and meet new and other exciting people. Im a kandi kid and I make TONS of kandi for massives. EDC is the only rave that I actually had to deny people from kandi because I either ran out to give or trade. The connection between everyone there was unexplainable. Its a PLUR thing I guess hahaha. To show how caring the crowd was, I literally saw a boy drop his wallet and didnt notice that he did so. No more then a second later, another boy picks up the wallet and runs after the boy to give it back to him. In a place like that, most people would just take the money and run. RIGHT ON KIDS!!\n\n=The Setting= \nNever been to the Coliseum in LA so I cant base my opinion on that. All I have to say is that the Vegas Motor Speed Way was the perfect place in Vegas to host a massive such as EDC. Given that the Speedway is much larger than the Coliseum, it provided everything to be in the same place making it a lot more accessible to everyone...AND THE AREO VIEW WAS INTENSE!! The stages were beyond compare decked out with lasers, lights, fire, and FIREWORKS. The artwork on display were sights to be seen. I really enjoyed the remote controlled fire sculpture TOO MUCH FUN. The firework show brought me to tear each night, the airplane  and blimp were neat, and the SKYDIVERS WERE OFF THE HOOK!! yes...I said SKYDIVERS!!\n\n=The Shuttle=\nThere was a $60 shuttle that was good for 3 days to and from EDC. It was definitely worth it, except the 1st night. We waited in line for almost 2 hours just get on the shuttle to get to EDC and it gets worse. Going back to the hotel, we realized that EVERYONE was going back too and that EDC didnt book enough shuttles for everyone. There was a total of 7 lines with at least 300 people in each line and only 2 shuttle per line. We were in the Vegas morning sun from 5:30 till 8:15 am. I had never been so depressed and helpless in my life. Fortunately, it got better as the weekend went on. EDC got smart and booked more shuttles and everyone was happy (kinna). But thumbs up for keeping us safe and off the roads after a night of partying!\n\n=The EDC Staff=\nNever have I ever encountered so many PLUR staff members. There was not a bad bone in these peoples bodies! They were very kind and very helpful. EXAMPLE have you ever traded kandi with a security guard? I THINK NOT!\n\n=EDC Cares=\nEDC made it priority that everyone is SAFE. The security was top notch! Serious but not dicks (except when peoples lights got taken away...that sucked). EDC also had cooling rooms for people to go in and enjoy the cool air instead of the hot Vegas heat. Get this...FREE WATER STATION!! EDC made sure that their clients were fully hydrated and AOK! Right on INSOMNIAC!\n\n=LVPD=\nLet me be the first to say...I HATE COPS. But at EDC, I loved the Las Vegas Police Officers! Hows that right? I guess it was the shuttle incident that pushed it to love. Because there were so many people waiting for the shuttles for so long and police needed everyone out, Insomniac called a shit load of taxis to pick people up BUT they were charging full price. HELL TO THE NO. The police officers understood and tried hard to get us our shuttles and made sure everything was under control. A cop even yelled at a taxi driver to shut up because the taxi driver was giving some ravers grief...how cool is that! To prove my point further...just look up some EDC pics. Youre bound to find pictures of ravers and cops together hahaha. Thank you LVPD!\n\nIt was a great experience! Everyone was dressed up and having an amazing time. If youre a raver, you need to experience EDC at least once. I will definitely be back next year if funds allow. Till then...lets keep the PEACE LOVE UNITY and RESPECT  going on all year round.
