Additional comments: THEY CHARGED $4776 for 2 people.\n\nThey booked us in hotels with a 7ish\/10 rating.  We had trouble showering because the shower head was broken.  We had to hold the broken shower head with one hand to shower.  Hotel lost power multiple times.  My friend had to get out of bed many times at night to turn on the A\/C and we were woken up by power outage light repeatedly. READ OTHER COMPLAINTS IN MY OLDER REVIEW.\n\nBreakfast was a joke and almost not edible.  It was so horrible that some of us didn't eat breakfast and went out to buy breakfast.\n\nI have looked up flights and hotels for people planning to go to Greece.  These hotels have amazing reviews, good ratings, and free breakfast. \n\nBoston to Athens round trip flight: under $650 per person\n\nDelphi Art Hotel (2 nights in Athens): $125 total for 2 people\nQueen Boutiques Suite (3 nights in Mykonos): $234 total for 2 people\nGeorgio Studios (3 nights in Santorini): $219 total for 2 people\n\nHave hotel call a cab: $10-$25 each way for group of 4 people) (total cab cost from airport to hotels to ferries: $80-$200 per group)\nHigh Speed ferries: under $70 per person (total under $210 per person)\n\nHotels were very good at booking cabs, rental cars, and restaurant reservations for us.  I'm pretty sure they can help you book high speed ferries too.\n\nThat comes out total $2398 for 2 people that includes flight, hotel & taxes, breakfast, cab rides, and high speed ferries.  I JUST SAVE YOU $2378.  YOU'RE WELCOME.
