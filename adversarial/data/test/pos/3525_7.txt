Garlic & Shots is a disgusting dump that I will never patronize even though I live in the neighborhood. We went on a Saturday afternoon at 3pm for a late lunch since we bought a Groupon for $30 worth of food for $15. It was a particularly hot day in Arizona and the restaurant was very warm inside because they were not running the air conditioning (cheapos), they only had the door propped open and it was stuffy and muggy. \n\nFirst impression other than the warm inside temperature was a foul odor and the place was dirty and disorderly like it hadn't been cleaned from the night before.  We were greeted by a apathetic hostess who looked bothered to help us. She said we couldn't sit in the regular part of the restaurant due to a party that we could sit in the bar. Keep in mind it's a Saturday afternoon and we have a 14 month old BABY with us, it's hot inside the restaurant and it smells... \n\nWe reluctantly said we'd sit in the bar. We asked for a high chair for which they had none. We were also treated like they were annoyed that we were there. So now we are a family with a small baby for which there is no high seat, in a hot, stuffy, foul smelling restaurant where we are forced to sit in a musty bar that's visibly dirty AND we're being treated very poorly. So we decided to leave since the whole experience was uncomfortable and the physical dirtiness of the place was not appetizing. \n\nWe told the manager we were leaving and he didn't seem to care at all. Not only is this completely disappointing because this restaurant is in my neighborhood and I was looking forward to eating there, but the conditions were unacceptable for any diner, baby or no baby. Food needs to be kept at an appropriate temperature and if it was that hot in the dining area I can only imagine the kitchen. The dining area needs to be clean, plain and simple. If the dining area is not clean then the kitchen can't be that clean either. Lastly customers should be treated with respect and if you're going to call yourself a \"restaurant\" and you are open for \"lunch\" then buy a couple high chairs. \n\nSo I can't tell you how the food in this dump of a restaurant is because we left and promptly through the $15 Groupon in the trash. We wont ever be going back there. It was a dump when it was John Henry's and it's a bigger dump now. \n\nIf you like bad service in a dirty, foul smelling restaurant this is the place for you, enjoy!
