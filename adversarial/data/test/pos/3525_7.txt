PROS: Student living is the worst anywhere, but this place is the cream of the sucky crop. It's also close to the college! \n\nIt's gated. Comfortable amount of space. Comes furnished (well sort of).\n\nCONS: semi-dangerous area. Really difficult leasing contracts. Dirty rooms.\n\nExpensive prices. it's not the greatest deal in the world. Staff has a poor time addressing problems.
