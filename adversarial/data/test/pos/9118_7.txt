I always stay at the Vdara when I'm in Vegas since my family has a room here. I love how the lobby always smells so good and how friendly the valet and front desk workers are. The studio I'm always at is always clean and housekeeping is great whenever I need extra items, even cookware! \n\nI guess the only problem I encountered was that housekeeping once complained about how much towels we asked for. My son loves bubble-baths and he made a huge mess one time so we had to use all the towels to clean up the mess he made. I guess they didn't really think about the fact that I was just trying to help.
