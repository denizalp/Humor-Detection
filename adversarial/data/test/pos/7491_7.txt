I was recently considering getting a new vehicle.  I had only heard good things about Toyota, especially about them maintaining value better than any other manufacturer.  I had met a Toyota salesmen, James Calero, through my work, so I thought I would check out Charlesglen.  \n\nEven though I had not seen him for quite a while, when I walked into the building he greeted me as though we were good friends!  I did not have an appointment, but of course he made time for me.  I told him I was interested in looking at a Rav 4.  He took me right away to look at one.  He showed me all the cool features and trust me there are a lot of them!  I sat in it and was pretty much sold in my mind.  The big test was for my Husband to sit in it, he is 6 ft 4\".  Unfortunately, he didn't fit.  So that went out the door pretty quickly!  James suggested we take a look at a used Venza, their newest vehicle.  It was way, way, out of our budget.  But James convinced us to have a seat in it.  It was by far one of the most comfortable vehicles I have ever been in.  The seats hugged me like a comfy blanket!  I didn't want to get out!  So we took it for a drive, the whole time James was very conversational.  I could ask him all types of questions about the vehicle and he had all the answers!  I'll admit I felt like I was in another world while I was driving, the handling and quality of the drive was amazing.  When we arrived back at the dealership, James took us inside and we looked at prices.  I admitted that the Venza was a bit too much for us and we would have to think things over, considering other options.  He reacted very professional, not pressuring us.  I walked out of there with a lot of information, but didn't feel overwhelmed at all!  \n\nJames did keep in touch, calling only a couple times to see where we were at in our car search.  I did tell him we had decided to wait for a bit to purchase a new vehicle.  He told me that anytime I wanted to come in or call him with questions, not to hesitate!  He hasn't called since then.\n\nAlthough we didn't decide on a Toyota, I had a great experience at Charlesglen.  I highly recommend seeing James Calero or Harris Kok, for any questions you have!  They are both very personable, helpful and experienced!
