My roommate and I came in to exchange $11 in coins so we could put that in their SRP billing machine for electricity. The cashier and the store manager we spoke to were VERY rude to us, and forced us to use the coinstar instead of accepting the coins we had already bagged into individual dollar amounts. I understand not exchanging the coins for people who bring in giant jars or bottles, but all the had to do was confirm each bag had a dollar in it, it took us longer to use the coinstar and (because coinstars eat your coins and charge you for every dollar you put in) we ended up only getting less than $9 back for which we still had to go to the rude cashier to get in cash. Food city may have cheap grocery prices, but they certainly don't care about their customers. Will not return.
