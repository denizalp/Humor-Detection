The best subs in Montreal. Home made bread and stacked full of meat. And when I say stacked, I mean stacked like Dolly Parton in the 80's. Now that's stacked!!! I always order the 14 inch #15 Manzo's Special.\n\nPizza's are supposed to be amazing as well, but I've never tried them even though I've been going to Manzo's for the last decade. I'm the type of guy that once I find something I like, I stick with it (hence the reason my wife is stuck with me). I'll have to try the Pizza next time I'm in Montreal.\n\nService is pretty fast for take out. I've never ordered delivery so I don't know about that.\n\nThe only bad thing about Manzo's is the location. If you go for take-out or to eat there (only has two tables), the parking is awful. There's only 2-3 parking spaces that are usually taken. You can park on the street, but again, they are mostly taken. There's no point in going there as you can order delivery. \n\nRegardless of the parking and seating issues, it's definitely worth a visit to try the subs!
