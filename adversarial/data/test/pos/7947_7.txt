IKEA, like most stores excels at a few things and is subpar on other things.  To take advantage of what IKEA offers is to know what they do best, which is one of two things; provide cool\/ stylish home furnishing & goods with a short useful life and  a few select basics  well made that can last a lifetime.\n\nAtmosphere - A maze with the smell of cinnamon to attract you to the end (like a mouse w\/ cheese).  Industrial, bright yellow & blue, w\/ attractive, middle to upper class home owners and college students.\n\nSelection - Modern furniture, lighting, kitchenware, linens, bathroom & bedroom ware, art and a kids section.\n\nWhat they do the best - I find their glassware to be inexpensive cool and of good quality.  I also have found quality lighting, kitchenware and metal bed frames.  Heck, I have a desk lamp and a bed frame that I purchased in 1998 @ the Pittsburgh IKEA that is still in use.\n\nWhat they do the worst - Some shelving and styles of dressers.  I purchased a dresser once that only lasted a year before the drawer bottoms bowed out.  I also had so-so results with an entertainment center.\n\nHow to shop - You have to fully exam each item you purchase for durability in design and function.  If you have a sense of structure and quality build, you should be okay in your selection process.\n\nOverall - This IKEA is HUGE with some great deals.  I went today and got a quality glass soap dish $4 (something that Wal-Mart, Lowes and Target had, but was made from plastic and retailed for $6) a matching glass $2, a stainless steel toothbrush holder $6 and a cool food s-s strainer $9.  \n\nI am glad IKEA has finally arrived in the CLT even though IKEA must be Scandinavian for The Peoples Republic of China (see bottom of your purchase).
