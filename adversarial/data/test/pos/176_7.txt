This place is everything that all the other reviews have said before me.  The food here is quite simply - awesome.\n\nI've been a few times.  I've ordered the Cajun Pasty and the Pesto Pasty.  Both are very good options if you like chicken.  I usually eat half and save the other half for the next day.  It's still good heated up the next day.\n\nWhat I like the most about this place is the food comes out remarkably quick.  I've gone for lunch on various occasions, arriving around 11:45 each time.  I've gone with one person or with 4 or 5 other people and the food always came out in a reasonable amount of time - even with the restaurant packed to the hilt with hungry folks.  I give them an A+ for their speed given their popularity.\n\nThis establishment is fairly odd in a quirky way that makes you want to return.  The decor has \"character\".  I suppose the intention is to replicate a English Pub.  I'm not sure.  They expanded the dinging room in recent years and the new dining room is full of these very long tables where the seating looks like what used to be a church bench.  A little awkward whilst you try to chump down on your pasty.  Nonetheless and church bench aside, however you have to sit, its definitely worth your time to visit this establishment.
