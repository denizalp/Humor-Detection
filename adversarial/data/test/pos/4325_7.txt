This store is practically a paen to all things candy and sweets. I first noticed it because they share a car park with the better halfs Primary Care Doctor; that irony is far from lost on me ;) \n\nMissing my Mom after moving to AZ, her chocoholic tendencies led to a carepackage of her favorite classics: Goldenberg Peanut Chews, Clark Bars, Mary Janes, and peanut brittle. I, who could care less if I ever ate chocolate -- save for occasional bitter European Dark -- was in Jelly Belly, Gummi Bear, and sour candy heaven! As an avid Pez collector, their selection, including Disney and Hello Kitty sets just made me happy. So many choices...\n\nIt is almost like a warehouse of candy, from nostalgia inducing classics to today's latest; even my 85 year old FIL can't resist a stop when we are nearby. Definitely fans, we will be regular visitors for sure! \n\n* helpful staff * \n\n** tremendous selection, including bulk items  **\n\n*** clean and well organized *** \n\n**** Vast array of Pez dispensers and sets ****
