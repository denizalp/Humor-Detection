First things first -- the continental breakfast is not very good here. Coffee isn't refilled well, mass-produced eggs served with questionable authenticity of gravy. Eek. If you find yourself here on a Saturday at 1am, the front desk isn't always very helpful on where to get food. There is no room service, but you can place an order from Flannery's Pub and they will deliver to the hotel.\n\nI found the staff here a bit strange. When I came to check in, I didn't have a reservation and it seemed like one of the ladies was in a bad mood and just didn't want to deal with it. It's okay, I understand. I have those days too. I don't blame her, but it was inconvenient to go to a wifi spot in the city, and THEN reserve the room to the online web site so that I could come back and say \"yes. I have a reservation.\" Maybe they have policies on keeping rooms reserved for online, but it would have been nice if she tried harder to help me find a room. It was easy enough for me to find one half an hour later on my computer on their web site. After making a reservation and checking in, no one told me about the parking situation -- so I ended up paying more than usual. Oh well.\n\nThe rooms are nice though and the jacuzzi suite is especially sexy, despite the walls being really thin. It's reasonably priced as well. If they improved the continental breakfast here and service was more consistent (although it may have been an off day), it would be a total win.
