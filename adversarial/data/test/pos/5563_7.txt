I've tried this place several times now. First time I ordered the Adana wrap and cigara borek after being informed they were out of kofte.  Twice they called me up to pickup my order only to tell me it wasnt ready when I got to the counter.  To their credit, the spices in Adana kepab were spot on but it was way too dry. The sauces came on the side which turned quite messy as I had to disassemble and reassemble the wrap. The cigara borek was chewy and the cheese mixture did not taste correct. It wasnt a bad flavor mind you, it just wasnt the right flavor. The second visit, I dined in with a friend and it was more of the same. No kofte so we got Adana wraps. The dine in service was terrible. After dropping off our wraps, the waitress basically disappeared. After a very long wait she finally came back out and asked if we needed anything else, and I asked for our checks. She disappeared again for 20 minutes at which point I went to the counter and asked a cook to get her.\n\nI've tried several times since to give the place a try, every single time I do they do not have kofte, regardless of time or day of week. I find this completely unacceptable, if you dont want to serve it, take it off the menu. \n\nI'm done with the place. This really would have been a several meals a week location for me but the complete ineptitude of the staff is too much to ignore. Don't waste your money on this place.
