I took my BMW in for oil change,spark plugs,tune up, transmission fuild change and gasic seal for a oil leak. LEO was very personable and professional he took great care of my vehicle and gave me a fare  price for the work that needed to be completed. I definitely recommend this shop for service. I will be using him in future for any other repairs my BMW needs. They also guarantee there work as well.
