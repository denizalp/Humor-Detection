This store reminds me of the stuff my grandma would send to us in Christmas packages when I was little. Tiny sombreros that my sister and I would put on Barbies, donkey piñatas, paper flowers, crèches, etc. \n\nStore is on the smaller side. I was terrified of knocking into something because there are breakables everywhere. I did end up buying some super delicate glass drink stirrers for $1.99 each. They're a whole dollar cheaper than the larger competitors across the street. Luckily the pieces made it back home to Vegas without breaking as the cashier wrapped them up well. \n\nThey sell lower end trinkets but their prices are really decent for a tourist trap area.
