5 adults and 2 children got together on Saturday night and we ordered several things from this newly opened noodle house in the Palms Hotel and Casino.\n\nWe ordered:\n\nCrispy chicken bao\nOkonomiyaki pancake\nGyoza\nTempura green beans\nBeef cheek bao\nSingapore noodles\nRamen mac and cheese\nDan Dan Mien\nBang Bang broccoli\nNutella honey toast\nSesame balls\n\nThe dishes were hit and miss.  I'm the Singapore noodle person and I thought it needed more curry--not for heat but for more curry flavor which was just too mild for me.  The gyoza were standard.  The Bang Bang broccoli was disappointing.\n\nOn the better side, the crispy bao chicken was good as was our dish of tempura green beans.  The ramen mac and cheese was a great fusion of East and West.  \n\nFor dessert, the sesame balls were OK and the Nutella honey toast was quite appealing if somewhast hard to cut and eat.\n\nThey need to do some work on some of their dishes.  It's just A-OK.
