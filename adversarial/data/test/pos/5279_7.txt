Apparently my first review got deleted... hmmm...wonder how.\n\n-They're not friendly, no matter how much money you spend\/plan on spending. \n\n-They don't talk all that much, so bring an iPod or a friend.\n\n-Their work is exceptional, it's worth the uncomfortable session. I've never gotten a bad tattoo there and don't think I ever will. \n\n-They're really knowledgable about after care, Alex turned me and my boyfriend onto Aquaphor, great stuff. \n\nIs their unfriendliness that big of a deal? Nah, just thought it's FAIR for others to know... since it's an open review site and people come here to see what people think of places and their experiences there so they know whether it's worth their time or not.
