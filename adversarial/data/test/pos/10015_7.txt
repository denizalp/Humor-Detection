The ambiance is weird. Seeing a DJ in a breakfast place with a mini disco ball above his head seems super corny. The Bloody Mary bar seems cool but if you don't like bloody Mary's the drink menu appears original and fun but the drinks taste very basic. Food wise it was very mediocre. To spend 17 dollars on a plate you think it would have a better spread. They use frozen potatoes yet emphasize how good the potatoes are. I expected fresh ones. the steak we ordered we asked for medium rare and it was well done and not seasoned. Everything was just bland. The decor is nice but I wish they put more effort into their food. I was really really let down.. also... flies are everywhere and it's gross.
