Fucka this placa\nJennifer and whoever the other dumb bartender who's name I didn't catch, I hate you.\n\nI used to come to this place every so often about a year ago, and I was given a rude reminder as to why i had stopped.\nThe security guard let us in around 8 pm and we took a seat at the tables right off to the side of the bar. The bartender was sitting across the bar smoking and no one else was to be seen. We see the waitress come out and give her a few minutes to spot us, but to no avail. About 5 minutes we get up to move, getting the hint, and the security guard comes over to tell us there is no server (on a Friday night?) and we should sit at the bar. Way ahead of you bud, but seems like the armed security guard has more customer service than the two bozos at the bar.\n\nMagically we are noticed and the waitress tries to chat us up, I politely tell her to fuck off (I worded it civilly of course) and put in our food order. Towards the end of our meal was the end of the dumb bimbo's shift, but she didn't bother letting us know she was leaving and that we should get the attention of the other bartender if we needed anything else, like most normal people would do (maybe explains why she's just a waitress?). Probably cause she knew we hated her and she wasn't getting a tip anyway.\n\nThis guy must be afraid of eye contact or something, cause I pretty much got the whole freaking bar's attention besides his. People even tried helping us wave him over. No avail. Took us over an hour and a half to get out of this dump, gotten out of a sit-down meal at a real restaurant faster. After getting fed up I finally walked over and waved my hand in his face and demanded my check. \n\nI don't ask for much when coming to run down bars, but really. The bar. It has corners. Look over to them.
