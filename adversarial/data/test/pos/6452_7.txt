Hear Ye Hear Ye: the new King reigns in Tempe car park! \n\nSolid Greek food in a clean, fast food style setting. We've only had take away, but the dining area is always neat, and usually packed. Workers remembered the Mr after his first visit, and are quite friendly, food comes up fast. \n\nScott loves the gynormous \"real deal\" gyros off the spit, alternating between salad, rice, or fries with his platter. The chicken souvlaki is very flavorful and tender and a good size of protein, the hummus is quite tasty, and their pita is always hot and fluffy. Their falafel is my favorite I've found in AZ, generous portion, crisp and not a hint of grease, with soft and well seasoned interior. The homemade lentil soup is delicious, with a nice spicy kick; I wish they would make avgolemono, it is our favorite and oddly very hard to find in the Valley, where we have no shortage of Greek food!\n\nI'm sure we will be back, quick service, polite employees, kinda healthy eats? Yup. Until then, Your Highness...
