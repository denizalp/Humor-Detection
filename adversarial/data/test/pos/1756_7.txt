I'm sorry to say, but HORRIBLE customer service. Went in to buy decor for Children's Christmas party on Dec 28th. Store not busy, two cashiers open, both busy with ringing up very large orders, all needing individual wrapping. I asked the manager to please open another cashier as I was in a hurry. (I'd observed four other staff tidying shelves). She said \"No\". So I left a basket full of over $200 in merchandise and walked out the door.
