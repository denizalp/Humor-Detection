This was the first in class workout I've ever tried and I fell in love.  Pure Barre works you harder than anything else I've tried.  My muscles are shaking every session (which is the point).  I suggest everyone tries at least one class.  You don't have to have any dance experience and you see results within 2-3 sessions.  My butt is firmer and my arms are buffer.  Take a class with Marirose or Veronica Weyand to make your workout extra intense!
