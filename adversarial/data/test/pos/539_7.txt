While the food was average, the service leaves a lot to be desired. The service is not attentive and careless. We waited 20 min for our order to arrive. Then, when the bill was requested, it got split in 2! Even though we did not order the exact meal! We were told, you said split in 2. We said, we asked for separate bills. Then the waitress raised her voice to argue with us. I shut that down immediately. She apologized. But I felt disappointed in the quality of the establishment.\n\nThe orange juice was freshly squeezed and not acidic.
