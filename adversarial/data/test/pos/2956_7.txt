All the DIY quick-fire pizza spots tend to blend together for me, but I've had positive experiences at this Blaze. They're located in the same plaza as Sprouts, so after double ad Wednesdays I'm too drained to actually cook the groceries I just bought so I often pop in here. I'm only half kidding.\n\nYou can get a plain cheese pizza, one topping, 2 toppings, or DIY (~$8) with everything you want. Multiple crust options and GF\/vegan available, along with side salads and desserts. The original crust here is comparable to the regular one at Pizza Rev, but the toppings are applied a bit lighter here. I do like how they have add-ons like arugula or various drizzles (pesto, buffalo, ranch) after your pie gets out of the oven. Portion is more than enough for one meal and service along the line is friendly, shout out to Sukari!\n\nTIP: Download the app for discounts and freebies. In a month, I've already gotten three offers (bogo, free drink, free dessert).
