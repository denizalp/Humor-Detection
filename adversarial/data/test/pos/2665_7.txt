I avoided this Starbucks for the longest time because of their long lines, both inside and at the drive thru.  I was also told that this Starbucks is one of the busiest locations in Las Vegas outside of the strip.  I started coming back to this Starbuck after downloading their app.  It's simple...place my order online, pay through my app, walk in, and grab my Americano.  Done!  Finito!  I don't have to wait in their long lines anymore.  Thank goodness for technology.  Starbucks is really consistent with their Americano and that's my go-to drink.  The service is great and their baristas are well trained at handling the volume of people here. Another thing to add, this Starbucks is spacious and very clean.  There's plenty of seating and enough outlets.  Starbucks is great for keeping me charged up. \n\nTIP #1:  tsp is right next door.\nTIP #2:  Blaze Pizza is right across the street\nTIP #3:  Greens & Protein in the same parking lot\n\n2017 Yelp Review #123.
