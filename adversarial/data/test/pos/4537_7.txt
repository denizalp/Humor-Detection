Very good restaurant that I'd definitely go back to.\nFood - I had the Mambo Cubano with sweet potato fries.  both were very tasty.  I was originally going to try one of the flatbreads, but the oven wasn't working.  My friend had the same thing and we didn't get appetizers or desserts, so I can't comment in detail about any of their menu offerings.\nService - we were there at 7 PM on a Saturday and the place was empty.  I think our server was the host... she was a little lost but she made every effort so any imperfections in the service are forgivable.  I see in other reviews experiences with poor service... it may be a timing issue.  Other servers checked in on us as well and were very friendly.\nAtmosphere - I liked the decor and ambiance, but was really surprised to see it so empty at 7 on a Friday.  it was filling in as we were leaving.  I liked that the bar and restaurant are separated by a hallway - it gave us the ability to enjoy a quiet dinner separate from the bar.\nPrices were cheap to me, but that's from the perspective of a San Franciscan who is used to restaurants being outrageously priced.\nI would definitely come back here again with a group for burgers, flatbreads, etc.
