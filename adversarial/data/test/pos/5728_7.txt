I don't make a habit of going to Jack Astor's, but I have to admit, I do love me some cheesy pan bread and Jacked-up bloody caesars. \n\nMy usual dining companion is American, and had never been to a Jack Astor's location. This means he'd never read the stupid things written on the back of all of their shirts and felt awkward, never had a server write their name upside down on a brown paper table cloth, and most importantly, he'd never had the cheesy pan bread!\n\nWe sat on their pretty John St. patio, we had mediocre service, we didn't really enjoy our lunches... aside from the cheesy bread. I will follow those greasy pans to hell, and now, so will he.
