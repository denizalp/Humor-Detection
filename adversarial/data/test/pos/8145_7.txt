Holy Moly Everyone NEEDS to Check This Place Out!\n\nThis is Greek food at it's finest! I enjoyed every single bite of food I had during my dinner.\n\nWe started with the Spanakopita appetizer which is stuffed with spinach, onions, cheeses and herbs in a crispy, flaky phyllo dough. The flavors were full force and how can you go wrong eating anything wrapped in Phyllo Dough?!\n\nMy guest ordered the KAKAVIA (Fish Stew) which was on special the night we were there. He stated it was one of the best he has tasted and he has had his fair of Fish Stews (in Asia Town). I ordered the PAIDAKIA which are Char-Broiled Lamb Chops. WOW!! Cooked to perfection and the flavor was outstanding!\n\nI need to go back and friends of mine who have visited recently talk about going back time and time again. What a great addition to Avon Lake!
