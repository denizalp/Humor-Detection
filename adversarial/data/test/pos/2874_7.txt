I recently spent a lovely evening at Dandelion Market enjoying some very good food. We had the entire second floor to ourselves and the service was fantastic. \n\nIt's a rustic looking pub, old exposed wood and brick with dim lighting and a cozy atmosphere. When I heard we would be dining at the \"Dandelion Market\" I was expecting a more open and bright place, more like a farmers market vibe. I was instantly reminded of the bars in Dublin at Temple Bar, which I believe is exactly what they were trying for. \n\nThey had a good sized menu of small plates for dinner, also some sandwiches and other items for lunch. I tried a bite or two of the fried pickles, grilled steak skewers, ale simmered sausage bites, tiger prawns, and the santa fe corn. I heard the market mac n cheese, baked potato croquettes, and the prosciutto crostini were all very good as well. \n\nThe service was terrific all night. We were there for about three hours and the servers kept our glasses full and made sure we were well fed. \n\nI can't wait till the next time I'm in Charlotte and can try brunch at Dandelion Market, it sounds delicious.
