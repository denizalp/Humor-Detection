DONT EAT HERE EVER!!!! ITS DISGUSTING!! We came in and asked for a taco bowl AND THE CHEF ASKED US WHAT IS INSIDE!!! she said \"um have you had it before? do you know what's inside?can you tell me?\" MY DAD HAD TO TELL HER HOW TO MAKE THE FOOD . my sister had a taco and the Carne asada was SPOILED!! SHE NEARLY THRU UP!!! everything had a lot of lime (trying to reduce the taste of spoiled meat) the onions were spoiled with a lot of lime and the guacamole WAS BLACK this is poor service and there should be an inspection at this restaurant they can get people sick!!!!
