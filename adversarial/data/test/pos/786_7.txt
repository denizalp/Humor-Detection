5 Stars and more for the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale AZ.\nIt seems that most people who live here don't realize the benefits of having the Mayo Clinic in our back yard!\nThe care of the doctor and hospital is superior and I and considering myself lucky having the best care in the world.\nWhatever you do check with the Mayo Clinic 1st.
