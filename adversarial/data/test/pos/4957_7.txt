Wrongs orders.......every time we order!!!\n\nYes their pizza is the best, but the hassle is just not worth it.\n\nThe first time we ordered, we got a non vegan pizza. Guess what? we started eating it! \nThe owner himself! delivered a refire and gave us a gift card.\n\nEvery time after.......problems. \nAlso the ladies that work there are very RUDE! I ask a question, they cop an attitude.\n\nFrankly, we have ordered a least a few times a week every week since and honestly the owner can have his gift card back that we never even used.\n\nWhat manager promises a customer something, then tells her employee to tell me \"oh we will take care of tnext time...\"\n\nOver it. Inconsistent service, sloppy management. Too bad the pizza and the owner is so good.
