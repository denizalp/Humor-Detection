Cozy place with good fried food and super cheap booze.  I expected some attitude from the locals when stopping in here before a party nearby and got none--partly because we were the only folks there but also the bartender was nice as could be.\n\nPerhaps some day I'll go back and point out the inconsistent apostrophe position in their signage and get punched in the face.
