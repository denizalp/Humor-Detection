The customer service and pay it forward attitude exhibited by Mason during my recent business trip to Las Vegas really underscores how this owner operates his business and views customers. I had an amazing experience using Mason and The Best Deal in Town they went out of the way to make sure I was satisfied and that's rare these days. Kudos to them and I will definitely be sending both local and out of town business their way. Do not hesitate to check them out, I could not have been happier with my transaction.
