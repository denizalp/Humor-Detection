3\/31\/16\n\n3.25 stars.\n\nFinally made it out here-- I bookmarked this place years ago!\n\nI arrived around a quarter to 11 am, so I'd missed out on a few pastries.  Since it was my first time here, I stood out of line to have a look at the pastry case, as well as check out the menu.  I don't enjoy looking up at wall menus above, so I probably missed out on some cool daily specials...  If you haven't visited Jobot before, you order at the counter and pay, receive an order number to take with you to your table of choice, and then wait for your hot food items to be delivered to you.  (Read between the lines: you MUST retrieve your coffee beverage\/s at the counter.  Understandable if ordering drinks to-go, but a little annoying when dining in, but OK.)  The only powdered sugar-free items left, besides savory rolls, were brownies ($2.75?) and brownie cookies ($1.75?), so I bought one of each.  I also ordered a cappuccino ($3.50), a Short Stack of Buttermilk Pancakes with Blueberry-Ginger compote ($8.50), and a side of bacon ($3).  I asked for no powdered sugar on the pancakes, as well as omission of the vanilla maple syrup, since the cashier knew that they'd recently switched from pure maple syrup to one that was a corn syrup blend.  (Kudos to him for knowing that info without having to ask someone in the kitchen!  Love it!)  I also asked if the whipped cream was homemade or from a bottle and was told it was fresh whipped, so I was looking forward to experiencing it.  Paid with a credit card on the iPad, so I didn't get to see my receipt until a few hours later, while I was at the art museum.\n\nCappuccino was lovely- not so much the coffee art- but the flavors and the mouth-feel. https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/jobot-coffee-and-diner-phoenix?select=OsmHkS0MntBnn2sUB6z8Zg  I don't add sweeteners to cappuccinos and drip coffees, since I usually pair them with sweet breakfast items.  I could taste the natural sweetness of the milk used- a very nice cup!  The two pastries were delicious: the brownie cookie had great textures and was moderately-sweet. https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/jobot-coffee-and-diner-phoenix?select=dJy7dqlEc30gefk8AXTdEw  The brownie was very tender and had intense chocolate flavor!  Found it a tad too sweet, though, so I preferred the cookie.  (Strange, as I've always had a fondness for brownies.)  The short stack of pancakes were definitely short! https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/jobot-coffee-and-diner-phoenix?select=GbBHngF-ROVPxqrm7vca6g  These were flat cakes, so I was glad to see the amount of blueberry compote on top.  I didn't see any ginger in the compote, though, so I was a little worried, and the whipped cream looked and tasted like it came out of a ReadyWhip canister.  Still, I enjoyed a bit of it swirled into the very sweet compote.  I thought the cakes were OK, with the blueberry compote a bit too sweet, until my tongue and teeth discovered chewy bits of spicy ginger here and there, and then I started to enjoy the entree!  And I was worried at the beginning, because the wafts of pork I detected smelt a bit funky.  The bacon looked soggy, too, but I took the plunge and bit into them and found the meat parts crispy enough.  I only eat bacon fat when they're crisped, so I was happy to be able to pick through the inedible fat (to me!) and count my blessings to be able to skim off some calories this way.\n\nIt's very small inside, and there's really only two tables that are welcoming (the community tables at the back).  There were some nice two-tops, but they're spaced very close to one another, and most were taken by other customers.  I also try to find tables with good lighting around them, so that I may take decent pictures, so I was glad that a young man didn't mind sharing a 4-top community table with me.  (He had his laptop, so I didn't want to encroach on his personal space...)\n\nOne HUGE complaint I have?  The loud, creaky wooden floor!  I understand this used to be a home (like many other PHX eateries), but OMG, so disruptive!  I wondered how people could study or do computer work here, but now I realized that most people nowadays use earbuds while working and thus can ignore other sounds, but I'm not one of those people.  [On the rare occasion you see me wearing earbuds, I only have them on in case a call comes through.  The only music\/sounds I listen to while dining out are the ones playing in the restaurant, bird songs (if patio-dining), or conversations of loud patrons.]  Having written all that, I'd return again, to enjoy more coffee and perhaps try the sandwiches.  Hope to be able to increase my rating to four stars- we'll see!
