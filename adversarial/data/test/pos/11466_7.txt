Inspire was widely recommended by friends and other Yelpers so I decide to choose this place to eat for my anniversary dinner. When entering restaurant, we noticed that the restaurant was really small and tight. I noticed the decor in the restaurant felt really cheap and they tried to imitate the feeling of a loft with exposed pipes. Came on a Wednesday night thinking it won't be super busy. Turns out all tables were reserved except two small tables near their counter area. So we got seated at the small tables. It was a tight space but it functioned. The waiter was nice and brought us water right away. The service was so far so good. What really drove down this rating was the food. \n\nOrdered: Chicken and Waffles, Indonesian Chicken Rendang and the INSP Burger. Did not order desserts because we felt sick after our entrees. The best part was the chicken and waffles as this actually tasted decent. But the burger was so oily that it made my partner almost throw up. Also, my Rendang dish tasted so mediocre that it tasted nothing special. It was also very oily. \n\nAll in all, everything except the Chicken and Waffles was so oily that it gave me and my partner heart burn. \n\nOverall, I probably wouldn't return to this restaurant ever again. This restaurant is just mediocre in my books and now I realize how overhyped this place is. Highly do not recommend.
