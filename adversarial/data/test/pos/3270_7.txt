There are things about FATS that I love.  Also, things that I hate.  Let's start with the things I love.  I love their TVs, I love their staff, I love their pizza, I love their draft .. this is rhyming, time to stop.\n\nPutting aside price, which I generally avoid  looking at whenever I leave the house, FATS is a really fun little sports bar.  I know some people won't like me calling it \"little\", but it really is.  Ok, it's quaint.  Let's just say it looks small.  But in fact, it's quite spacious.  We've gone several times to watch hockey games, or fighting events, or just whatever happens to be on.  Each time, plenty of fun was had.\n\nI need to talk a bit about their pizza.  It really is as awesome as you've heard.  But it's dangerous.  I'm no slouch when it comes to eating pizza, but I can eat FATS pizza far past the point of common sense.  You know, that stage at which your body is begging you to stop, but you push on.  It's how marathon runners make it to the finish line.  Yeah, that sounds much better.  I am a marathon FATS pizza eater.\n\nFATS has a decent selection of draft, but most importantly their draft is good.  Lots of places don't take care of their lines and you can really taste it in the beer.  FATS is not one of those places.  So if you are looking for awesome pizza, great beer, and a place to watch sports, you should get FATS*.\n\n*Yeah, I pretty much had to.
