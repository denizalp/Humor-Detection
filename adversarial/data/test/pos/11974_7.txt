Binion's is a classic steakhouse from a bygone era in Las Vegas, located at the top of the old Binion's Hotel and Casino.  \n\nI'd be inclined to rate the restaurant as perhaps 4+, were I to base the review solely on the ambience, quality of food, and service, all of which are quite good.  \n\nThe Good:\nAs I was not overly hungry this evening, I ordered the french onion soup and the crab cakes horsdervs.  Both were quite good; and I will single out the crab cakes as especially great.  Wonderful flavor, plenty of crab meat, and perfectly pan-fried.  The soup was fine, as was the warm, soft bread.\n\nI also sampled my date's prime rib, which was pretty much perfect.  Quality meat, cooked attentively and seasoned well.\n\nThe ambience is great; it harkens back to a slightly more civilized era...an era when high end restaurants were quiet, dimly lit, intimate affairs.  Today's more modern places seem to instead aim at making diners feel like pseudo-rock-stars, with loud music, high ceilings, and a general emphasis on trendy bling.  It struck me how nice it was at Binion's to simply be spared pulsing techno music and patrons that have to be shout to be heard over the dull roar of the modern dining environment.  As others have mentioned, the view is also great, and the service is attentive, professional and unobtrusive.  \n\nThe Bad:\nThe unfortunate fact is that Binion's Steak House is a high-quality restaurant sadly shoe-horned into a not terribly attractive casino and hotel that has not been updated or remodeled in the last 25 years.\n\nThe elevator feels creaky; lights on the buttons often don't work.  \n\nBut perhaps worst of all was the shockingly awful bathroom.  It's quite jarring to have a wonderful meal one moment, and then the next moment to find oneself in the sort of bathroom you'd be more likely to find in a Greyhound bus depot.\n\nFaucets are semi-functional and leaking, water is on the counter and the floor, and the toilet paper dispenser is the sort you'd expect to find in a rural gas station someplace, complete with a flopped-open case-cover which cannot be closed.  The bathroom was in need of good cleaning, smelled pretty foul, and basically created the sort of gut-level revulsion you can usually only find on remote interstate rest-stop toilets that have neither been cleaned nor properly remodeled since the Carter Administration.  \n\nWhy in the world such relatively minor details and minor expenses would be overlooked by a restaurant that is otherwise creating a fine-dining experience is beyond me.   \n\nThe Conclusion:\nThis is a great restaurant, and a refreshing step back in time.  One can easily imagine Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin or Elvis Presley relaxing with friends over great food here as they look out over the Las Vegas skyline of 1968.\n\nAnd for the quality of the food and service, it's also reasonably priced.  While not remotely inexpensive, the truth is one would quite literally pay double the price for this quality of food were one to eat at one of the trendier steakhouses located on the Strip.\n\nSo really, it's a great place.  Just don't go to the bathroom, and try to close your eyes on your walk thru the casino and your ride up the elevator.
