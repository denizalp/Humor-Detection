I had a C Class Mercedes. I needed service & called Schumacher Mercedes and asked if I had the car towed to their dealership, if they would offer me a loaner car. I was told I could obtain a loaner by the service rep. I had the car towed to Schumacher Mercedes within 30 minutes of the conversation. After I got to their service dept, I was told I could not have a loaner. If that was the case, I would have had the car towed to Phoenix Motors. I asked for a manager, Michael Schumacher came into the office. He was very cold & asked the service rep what model car I had. When the rep told him it was a C Class, he abruptly said NO & walked out. As if I was a second class citizen because I had a low end model at the time. I walked out of the office towards my car. I asked another rep if they had loaner cars available & he said they did. \nI come to find out that the reason my car was disabled was because the lug nuts from my regular tire were too long for the spare tire and impeded the driving of the car. \nI then proceeded to change the lug nuts to the proper length in the middle of their lot. Dozens of employees RAN out asking to assist me. It looked terrible for a woman in a skirt on the ground changing lug nuts. I ended up driving away saving myself the $700 they quoted me for repairs that were not even needed & I NEVER went back to their dealership. \nWe now own E63 AMG & G55 - WHICH WE DID NOT BUY FROM SCHUMACHER!
