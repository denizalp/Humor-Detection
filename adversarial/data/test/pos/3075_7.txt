ok, it may be lame to review your dentist's office.  but i don't care.  i'm lame.  \n\ni've been going to dr. henry since i grew teeth.  no, that wasn't yesterday, bucky.  \n\ntrue sign that a dentist is a great dentist?\nyou know those stories about nightmares from a dentist's office you heard as a child?  \nwhen i was a kid (and now too) i never understood why anyone would feel that way about going to the dentist.\n\nand if an eight year old thinks that, well, i think you're a pretty awesome dentist.\n\nthat and the fact that if you come in after awhile for your check up, they always know who it is who's calling for the appointment and ask you how your life is.\n\nthey're personable, professional, and i was never scared of going to the dentist as a kid.  or now.  \n\nthe end.
