We went here during a family vacation. We wanted to take our dad out for his b-day and thought this would be a fun place to grab some beer and eats while still able to take my young nephews.  \n\nWe made reservations cause there was 8 of us. We were seated right away. Our table actually had a reserved sign on it when we were seated. Makes ya feel kind of special. :) \n\nWhat I got to drink:\n\nRock Bottom White Ale - Brewed with two-row malted barley and wheat, with a hint of orange peel and coriander. The beer was quite refreshing especially being in the hot Arizona sun all day long. \n\nWhat I got to eat:\n\nTillamook Bacon Burger - Steakburger topped with Tillamook cheddar cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato and finished with BBQ jalape√±o ranch dressing. This burger was so juicy. They use a brioche bun that soaked up all the yummy juices. Got to go on the list of the some of the best burgers I've had. \n\nI whispered to the waiter that it was my dads bday and he brought out a decent sized chocolate cupcake with an gooey frosting that everyone at the table gobbled up pretty quickly. \n\nMe and my brother split the bill. With 6 adults and two kids we got out of there for a 118 bucks including a decent tip from the both of us. It was a great experience. I'll have to see if there is a local RBB in my area.
