Does that bad case of taco-butt have you rethinking your entire wiping strategy as you feverishly pick at your ass?\nWell hold on. \nBefore changing your wiping habits, I'm going to share a little secret with you. \nWhite Cloud toilet paper. The only sure-fire cure for taco-butt that I know of, short of carrying a pouch of wet wipes, or a torn piece of wet flannel around with you.\n\nYes, White Cloud is the answer to your dirty-starfish prayers. It even has you covered on those hungover Saturday mornings when mud-butt rules the day.\nOne small problem however. \nYou won't find White Cloud at your local grocer any longer.\nNot at Basha's.\nOr Fry's. \nOr Albertson's. \nNot even Walgreens or CVS...none of them.\nKnow why?\nWhite Cloud sold the entire product line to WalMart. \nHow genius a move was that? Or not. \n\nMaybe it was some savvy management exec at Walmart who reckoned that if White Cloud was the only cure (sans wet-wipes) for taco-butt, and WalMart owned the rights to White Cloud, then it's highly probable Walmart would capture the entire U.S taco-butt demographic. Fucking genius!\n\nWell hey WalMart, you'll be happy to know it worked. \nI now shop at WalMart for my White Cloud among other things. \n\nI have no idea how much it costs. I can only recommend it's cleaning power and how the term taco-butt will soon be exiting your lexicon for good.
