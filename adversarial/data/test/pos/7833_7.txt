I'm totally not a tourist when I go to Las Vegas, but I wanted to make a stop at the Welcome to Las Vegas Sign because I've never been before! Honestly, I never knew that you could stop in this area, let alone park and take a picture....\n\nThe bf and I stopped by after lunch, there were plenty of parking spots and there was a person offering to take pictures for a tip. I was forewarned by Michelle T., so we had a tip ready. \n\nMy local friends told me that sometimes there's a person with a camera and portable printer! Way to make some pocket change!
