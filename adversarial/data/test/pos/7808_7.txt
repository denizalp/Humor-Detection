Wow, what can you say about this place that has not been said.\nIt is awesome in every area. There is so much going on here that I will just review for today the Restaurant of Tanzy itself.\nThe beautiful setting is amazing. Plus free parking in the covered Garages.\nThe staff is lovely and all the Managers really care about this place and your dining experience.  Which makes all the difference.\nWe had a lovely table and the wine here is so nice, spectacular actually.\nThe food is really good , The Braised Beef Short Rib is simply the best to me.\nI am not really a huge fan of Red meat either but, this is awesome. \nThe Gnocchi they serve with it is unreal. \nEven though I know I am packing on the pounds I cannot stop eating it.\nNext time I think I will try the Muscovy Duck Breast and candied Fig.  It too looked wonderful.\n The Risotto is very good as well , and my boyfriend had the Mediterranean Chicken Penne.\nThere is something here for everyone's taste. Plus the chef will totally make something in your direction if you are a vegetarian. \nA flour less Chocolate cake is my absolute to die for. \nSecond time I have had it, and I love it.  I could come in again just for that.\n\nThe restrooms are beautiful and clean.\nHigh end price but, good for a fancy night out. \nDress up, because, you just feel better when you do.\nHAPPY NEW YEAR!
