Weirdest Target in Arizona.  \nIt's adorable.  \nI'd call it a Target seed.  \nTiny,  and nothing at all like any other Target anywhere.  \n\nBut they have one aisle of everything.  \n\nIt looks like a renovated JCPenny's.\nIt actually looks really high end,  with Target price tags.  Honestly it was a tad confusing,  but the staff was very nice,  and the store was immaculate!!!
