There's no doubt that Bacchanal is the best buffet in Vegas, but it is nowhere near my top ten when it comes to buffet ranking.  Took us 90 minutes to get in, but oh well, expected of the top buffets in Vegas.\n\nIt was really the seafood drew us to Bacchanal, thus it was only natural that we hit it first.  Given their fame, voluminous advertisements, and reviews, I started my journey with high expectations, but boy was I wrong...  The snow crabs were over salted, dry, and empty.  The oysters were covered with broken shells and stacked on top of one another.  On the other hand, shrimp and stone crab claws were fresh, meaty, and lightly seasoned with salt.\n\nAs for the carving station, I got really excited when I saw that giant slab of what they call \"American wagyu\".  Do NOT be fooled by this!  Just a regular piece of beef wrongfully crowned with the title of wagyu.  Lacked that signature wagyu marbling and was tough as hell.\n\nThen came the dessert lineup...  Options ranged from Asian pastries like egg tarts, ube ice cream, and almond custards to classics like lava cakes and creme brûlée.  Extensive selection? Yes, but a big no no for quality.  Egg tarts had soggy shells, ube tasted artificial, and creme brûlée had that unnatural taste and texture as if corn starch was used to solidify the dessert.\n\nWas it worth waiting for?  Not for me personally.  If it's your first time in Vegas, I'd certainly recommend visiting either the Wicked Spoon or Bacchanal.  But if you're already a seasoned buffet goer that has experienced buffets like Colony or Edge in Singapore or even CafeToo in Hong Kong, Bacchanal certain pales in comparison to them (both in terms of price and options).
