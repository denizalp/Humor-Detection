If I was able to put zero stars I would.\n\nWe used them for a Christmas function.  The food was OK, but just OK. Some of the servings didn't even arrive, but all told food was average.\n\nThe big nasty happened later when we got the bill. It was thousands of dollars more that agreed upon. When we broke down the bill, it turns out the people drank and average of 18 drinks each. Many of the drinks were handed out at the door with the impression they were complimentary, but they were actually 12 dollar drinks on the bill.  Maybe a couple of people could have gotten to the 18 drink mark, but about 10% of our staff are non-drinkers, and most couples had a designated driver, so it's very unlikely.\n\nService was not very good. Servers and management alike were often rude.
