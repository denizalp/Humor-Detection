As a disclaimer, I am a vegetarian.  So, I can't tell you anything about the meat dishes.  What I can tell you is that the Tacu Tacu ($7) is unbelievable.   It is a rice and bean cake covered in a delicious sauce and fresh avocado slices.   Several of us in my office are hooked on the stuff.  If you get the opportunity, this stand is WELL worth your time.  \n\nIf you have a taste for spicy, make sure that you try the hot sauces by the window.  \n\nThe food is rich, hearty, spicy, and unique!
