Oh, Montreal!  You're making it harder and harder for me to name my favourite café here in town!  This is now my faaaaavvvveeee café ever!  Come alone, or come with a gf, or even bring a date!  Just walking to the door will put a smile on your face.  During warmer months, there are pillows on the steps for you to sit and just people watch.  Grab a seat inside instead and just bask in the glories of this place.  There is a balcony, or mezzanine like, floor as well, and that's where the washrooms are. \n\nSo funky, so fresh, just simply welcoming.\n\nNo filtered iced coffee, but have tried their iced americano, and a donut topped with nutella.  The americana was on point and refreshing.  I shared the donut, but should have gotten 1 each ;).\n\nThere is wifi, and when I came here on St Jean Baptist holiday (June 24, 2017), there was an English sign that said \"All you can drink mimosas for $25\"!\n\nEach seat throughout the place really gives you a good vantage point of all the details that makes this place so unique.  There really is so much character. \n\nIf posting pics is what you like to do with your hot beverage, then grab a pen or Sharpie and fill in the blank on your stamped cup - sometimes there's a box for you to write in it ;).
