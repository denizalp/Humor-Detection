Let me preface this review by mentioning that I'm not vegan or vegetarian. \nThe food here was so so good! I had the Forbidden Rice and it was incredibly tasty. I live that all the items on the menu are clearly marked Gluten free, vegan or vegetarian but you still have the option to add grass fed steak, chicken or farm raised salmon. I chose the grass fed steak. It was perfect. Will definitely be back and next time I might bring my vegan son along lol
