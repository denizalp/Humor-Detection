My son was saying to me that he can't really see and that he needs glasses and I don't have eye vision insurance, so I shopped around a bit to see who had the better deal.  \n\nI found Americas Best home of the 2 pairs for 69.99 with a free eye exam, to me that sounded too good to be true, but I went online and scheduled him an appointment.\n\nDate of the appointment. arrived and off we went, had to fill out some paper work, sat in a waiting room, got pulled into a lil office where a tech tested his eyes, got ambushed into also having his eyes tested for glaucoma for an extra 15 bucks, I said yes to this test because I know it's important, but when I called Americas Best, I basically asked them if there was any hidden fees that I should be aware of, and they oh no, the eye exam is free & you can get 2 pairs for 69.99, so now I know they are not very truthful and I should start getting prepared for more shady stuff. Then we went into the eye dr office, he got his eyes officially tested, and yes he does need glasses, he is very near sighted.  \n\nWas told to go out to the front and wait to be called to get your glasses, and so while we were out in the front lobby I told my son to go ahead and pick out 2 of the frames that are for 69.99, now I have to say they did have a nice selection of frames for that price, he did find 2 completely different looking frames. \n\nWas called up to a table and greeted by an eye tech she started to tell my son and I that the dr noted that since you are athletic that you are going to need poly blah blah blah lenses and that will be $387, my son, who is 6ft 4ft and skinnier than a light pole told her that her info is incorrect and that he is not athletic so no need for those lenses, then she said oh ok then you will need the none scratch transiting blah blah blah lenses for $259 and then I said no, we will not be doing any of that either, we will take what comes with the 2 pairs for $69.99, she got lil upset with me and made me sign a paper stating that I didn't want any of the upsell items or warranty , which really to me were not an item of choice but an item they push on to people.  I think she would have done better with me if she said ok for 69.99 you get this, but we also have blah blah blah, but no she tried to force me into other situations I didn't want part of.   I wonder how many other customers' they do that to.\n\nWe ordered his glasses, he was happy he will be able to see the leafs on the tree soon and we should be picking them up shortly!
