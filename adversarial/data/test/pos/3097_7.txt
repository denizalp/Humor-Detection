Solidly good ramen spot in Vegas. It's small so expect a wait. My boyfriend and I waited for around 20 minutes for a table. We ordered two bowls of ramen and a small bowl of pork belly with rice to share. Pork belly rice was pretty underwhelming - I thought there was too much ginger. The ramen was definitely better - I wish the noodles had been a little chewier, but the flavor of the soup was very nice. Splurge for some corn and the egg! Prices are pretty good though - definitely cheaper than Chicago ramen.
