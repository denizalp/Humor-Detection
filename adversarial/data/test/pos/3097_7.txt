Amazing food.  For sure.  My husband had swordfish, I had one of the best Chilean Sea Bass dishes on the planet.  The sides were too good.  Our waiter was good.  The place was too loud but ok.  Super trendy atmosphere.\n\nBUT the front desk and reservations were the WORST!  Two young twenty year olds couldn't be bothered to stop talking to each other long enough to check us in for our 9:15 dinner reservation.  We were 30 minutes early and prepared to go the bar.  They said they would come and get us and gave us no warning they were behind.  At 9:30, I went and found them, they told me there were at least 8 couples ahead of us and it would be another 45 minutes.  To make matters worse it was our anniversary and my firefighter husband needs to eat to keep up with his work outs.  I told them that and they couldn't have cared less.  In fact, they started to talk to me like it was my big night out at the prom.  In my business, I have taken client groups to dinner there over a dozen times.\n\nIn the end, they treated us so badly my husband refused to let me use a $500 gift card a friend had given me as a gift because he wanted to make sure they knew he could pay on his own.  How dare anyone treat us that poorly.  Their loss.  My business, and our COMBINED income and business will go else where.  And being a fire fighter is a brave contribution, not something to be looked down on.
