Came at around 11:45 where they just open and noticed that quite a few tables were already filled with people.\n\nThe moment we stepped in we were greeted super enthusiastically and the atmosphere was very lively!\n\nThe service was great because all the staff were smiley and happy (not the fake kinds lol) and they were quick and efficient. They were having fun and enjoying their jobs which makes dining here so much more comfortable! :D\n\nThe food was quite yummy but we didn't get to try a lot because they only served things from their lunch menu. Baked oysters, I will come back for u next time  ;-;\n\nOverall, a wonderful place to go to with your friends, but come for dinner if you want to try a lot of different foods!
