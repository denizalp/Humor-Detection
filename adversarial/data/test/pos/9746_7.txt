At the time of this review this is a newly opened restaurant and it seems that they are still tinkering with things.\n\nThis Steakhouse is located in Downtown Glendale. They offer a private parking lot, outdoor dining, a cigar shop and a nearby gastro pub. \n\nWe were greeted by a friendly hostess and she gave us our choice of table or BIG COMFY Booth. The restaurant is sort of open and airy with a typical masculine feel and does have an open kitchen.\n\nI ordered the salmon sandwich. It was a really delicious sandwich and I would have given a solid four stars if my review was only for my lunch. The bread was fresh and delicious. The generous portion of salmon was seasoned nicely and was moist and flaky. The salad was big fresh and crisp. \n\nUnfortunately I noticed my husband's meal was done and sitting under a heat lamp for at least ten minutes before my sandwich was made. To say the least the bread, meat and cheese in the sandwich didn't arrive in good condition. Also the fries were similar to what budget steak houses serve. \n\nWe waited a while for our waiter to check on us so we could inform him about the French Dip Sandwich and he got a run on tables and wasn't able to stop by for a while. So we started to eat anyway. We did wind up telling the server and we spoke to the manager (maybe owner) in detail about what was wrong with the sandwich and she was very understanding. She also took the sandwich off our bill.\n\nThis restaurant is newly opened and they might have some growing pains.\n\nThis can be such a great addition to Glendale. The manager seemed keen on working things out I am sure they will be quick to improve.\n\n3 stars is still a positive review and means A-OK according to Yelp.
