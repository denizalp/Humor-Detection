If you order from the Chinese Menu and not the American Chinese Menu items your food might be TONGUE Thrilling Spicy and your mouth might get numb.\n\nWe got started with the Sauteed Spicy Cucumbers. They were so crispy spicy and refreshing and were a nice start. I had the water boiled chicken and it WAS THE SPICIEST FOOD I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. It was SO SPICY I felt High and my head was flooded with Euphoria. My mouth went numb. I had this dish twice here before once with chicken and once with fish and neither time before was it this kind of spicy. It really was too spicy for me this time so I took home my leftovers and will thin it down for latter. The chicken in this dish was tender like no other place makes chicken. This really was an experience.\n\nOur waiter highly recommended the hot spicy beef with pickled vegetables. The beef was very good and very tender like the chicken was and it also was a spicy dish but at a more comfortable level.\n\nPortions were large and generous.\n\nService was pleasant (this time) but you only drink water unless you order a beer.\n\nThey don't clear your plates when you are done either.\n\nIt's an experience!
