Belmont's Newest Park\n\nFound this last week while out exploring.  This park opened last Summer and is the most recent addition to Park and Recreation for Belmont.\n\nLocate on the upper reaches of Lake Wylie on NC 7 just South of US 74 or Wilkinson Blvd.\n\nNot a huge park but well designed with a fenced in Play Area for Kids with lots of swings and slides, Very secure and safe. Multiple picnic tables, some shelter and a nice path down to an Observatory Platform overlooking the Lake. When I was there not much to see of the Lake because of the drought.  A Lot of mud flats and little water leading over to an Island. Also has clean restroom facilities.\n\nWhen the Lake is full, will be beautiful.\n\nIf you have small Kids, a great place to take them, take a  Picnic Lunch, walk around and enjoy
