As I was sitting down to eat dinner in my condo, my building erupted into flames. A friend passing by on the street phoned me to say that my fire alarm was legitimate and so I promptly evacuated the building. Thirsty from my 42 story descent, my friend kindly offered to buy me a beer at Hoops next door. I happily accepted and we took a seat at the bar. Later I was joined by two other displaced neighbours and we ordered a second round of beers.\n\nHaving missed my dinner due to the conflagration, I grew hungry and asked for a food menu. Realizing wings were on special I reviewed the sauces available and was intrigued by the last sauce \"teriyaki and jerk.\" In a classic case of confusion brought on by the lack of an Oxford comma, the waitress informed me that those were two separate sauces and not a unique Japanese-Jamaican fusion. Saddened, I ordered wings with a different sauce.\n\nSitting with my fellow evacuees we drank our beers and I waited for my wings. We hypothesized how long until we would regain entry to our homes and I waited for my wings. We finished our beers and I waited for my wings. A half hour later we saw the fire trucks leave, residents start returning to our building, and I waited for my wings.\n\nSeeing we could return home, my neighbours and I asked for our bills and I asked for my wings to go.\n\n\"Specials are dine in only,\" said the waitress.\n\n\"Well, I'm only here because my building was on fire,\" I replied, hoping for an exception.\n\n\"Most people are,\" she retorted.\n\n\"Well, I don't really want the wings if I can't have them to go,\" I said truthfully, just wanting to return home.\n\nThe waitress left with a vague, noncommittal promise \"to check\" with someone.\n\nAwhile later the waitress returned with the bills, giving them first to my neighbours, and then throwing my bill on the bar without apology or explanation simply stating, \"Specials are dine in only.\"\n\nI looked at my bill, happy enough that they only charged me for my beer, and I paid what was owed.\n\nMy neighbours and I headed home, parting ways at the elevators. I returned to my condo and saw my now stale dinner sitting on the table--in my rush to leave I had forgotten to put it in the fridge. I reheated my dinner in the microwave, consoling myself that it likely still tasted better than Hoops wings, and I vowed that the next time my building erupts into flames I will walk a little farther to a nicer bar.
