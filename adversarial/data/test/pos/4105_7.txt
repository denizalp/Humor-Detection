I've had gourmet  hotdogs from a few places over the years.  They all fall short after having Short Leash.  \n\nI had the Devil Dog with some added bacon, Becca had the Bear and my friends had some build your own types.  The table was completely quiet after our food arrived.  All of us focused on our meals.  \n\nOne of my friends that joined us spent the rest of his weekend telling everyone he could about the most amazing hotdog he'd ever had in his life.
