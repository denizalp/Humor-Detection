Terrible service! they tell you its a 5 minute wait and you end up waiting 30 minutes ( thats when I walked out). The waxing girl is the most miserable woman I have ever encountered. I have been here a few times and kept thinking she was just having a bad day, but no, she is always miserable. She does not even sanitize her hands before touching your face! I also had a pedicure there and when the lady beside me was finished, they didn't even wash out the basin for the next girl they motioned over for her pedicure. I was absolutely disgusted and started to wonder about the state of my own basin... . The also use the same nail files on EVERYONE! Gross! I think I public health should be informed. The place is always busy, so I dont even want to think about the germ turnover.
