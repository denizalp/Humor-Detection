Wow! This restaurant is exactly right. Beautifully decorated, low lighting, nice music suited to this elegant Italian setting. Our waiter Vido was excellent and the food was wonderful, perfectly cooked, nice and hot. The appetizer and the entre was so delicious I didn't have room for desert. I will be back to my new favorite restaurant and it's close to home too!
