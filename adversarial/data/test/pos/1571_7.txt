What can I say about this classy and sophisticated little secret? Oh! I know! I can tell you that it is so perfect and amazing for a pre-dinner meet up as their happy hour is completely worth the stop. \nHas an old Hollywood vibe to its interior but more on the eclectic side. \nPick Your Sour and the Blood and Sand were my favs! Hubby surprisingly went for boulevardier and he loved it! \nWe enjoyed a few bites and they were also delicious. Braden, our server was a mixologist extraordinaire with a keen sense of flava! He described in detail the fronts and backs of the bourbons and made us some killer classics!\nEarning the Beverly a 5 star \" this was such a perfect HH\" review!
