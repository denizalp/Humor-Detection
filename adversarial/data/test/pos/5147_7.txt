A great example of why at least a couple of visits to a GOOD Restaurant are needed before making a final judgment.\n\nRemembering that \"I Go For The Pho,\" so on my first visit in late June I ranked it to myself as PHABULOUS PHO at half price no less ($3.50 for big bowl!)! I found the Broth was scrumptious but it lacked enough meat to challenge my favorites, but otherwise EXCELLENT! Unfortunately, I found the Spring Rolls to be gummy and NOT very tasty at all. \n\nUnfortunately, on two subsequent visits, I found the Pho to be less than Phabulous, as it had become quite diluted and NOT nearly worthy of my previous lofty ranking. Could it be the dreaded New Chef In The Kitchen Syndrome, or maybe just a de-emphasis on Pho because of their new half price Pho policy? I believe it might be the former, as I retried the Springrolls and they were different and better than before. Regardless, NOT worth another visit by me, unfortunately!
