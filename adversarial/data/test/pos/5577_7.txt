Free admission and free parking made this an event not to miss for fans of vegan food. It was an outdoor festival and weather got in the way for about 30 minutes. Fortunately, attendees were able to take shelter inside the government building while the clouds broke open and dropped rain on the vegan pizza and bombarded the chia smoothies with hailstones.\n\nViolette's Vegan restaurant was the main sponsor of Veg Fest. Instead of selling food, they generously provided samples of seitan wings, chocolate cake, and other signature dishes. I'm definitely planning to visit Violette's for lunch sometime soon. VegeNation and GFY Burgers & Fries had the longest lines. I ordered a cheese platter to sample different varieties of Virgin Cheese, a plate of Panevino's ravioli, and a piece of Simply Pure's key lime cheesecake. The ravioli was gluten-free and the pasta had an unusual mushy texture, making this my least favorite item. I saved the cheesecake to eat later and enjoyed it the most.\n\nI hope this event will return in the future! Musical entertainment would be a great addition to the lineup and I wouldn't hesitate to pay an entrance fee for a bigger and better Veg Fest.
