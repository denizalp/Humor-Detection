A funny thing happened when I went to go see the traveling Thunder from Down Under show at the Cache Creek Casino in Northern California. The more I drank, the more fun it was. \n\nAnd although I didn't expect to, I had a good time. \n\nIt played out like this...\n\nScene: Four female, profession coworkers -- a 20-something-faux-married lady, a 20-something-single lady, a 30-something-recently-divorced lady, and a 50-something-in-a-30-year-relationship lady - are at a dark, medium-sized club in a smokey casino on a Friday night after work seated close to the bar.\n\nOne vodka soda in: This is going to be super cheesy. I hate dudes with better hair than me. And I especially hate dudes that grease up with saffola applied with a paint roller.\n\nTwo vodka sodas in: They aren't completely out of sync with eachother's lame Jazzercise-like dance moves. And their outfits aren't bad. Wow! Velcroed on pants. That's clever. \n\nThree vodka sodas: Woooooohoooooo! Wooooooooooohooooo!!! Shake it!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nYes, Thunder Down Under is cheesy. Yes, they have sort of silly dance routines done to sort of silly music wearing sort of silly costumes that they rip off to reveal thong underwear. Yes, there is an orgasm contest that unsuspecting women get cajoled into volunteering for. Yes, it is a good time. \n\nThere is a long montage intro of all the Thunder's TV appearances and although the Thunder dude playing Ryan Seacrest gets annoying with his intros and lame jokes, he does make up for it by getting mostly nekked later in the show.\n\nWould I go again? Probably not. Did I get my money's worth? You bet.
