Finally returned with my mom in tow and got the Coconut Cream Pie everyone raved about (and it is now near me in my office).  Also got a big \"refill\" of Southwest Jalepeno.  My mom ordered 2 tins for shipment to my uncle and grandma.  The delivery costs were low to other states.  They pack the popcorn on the requested shipment date so it isn't stale upon arrival.\n\nCoolest side note - they have Cucumber soda here.  I know that sounds weird, but it tasted great!!  Now I want to drive to the west side just for that! :)
