International Mkt Place is one of those stores I could spend hours in and never see everything.  They have food from all over the World.  I have had the pleasure of going to several different countries and have some serious affinities for certain foods.  This place has many of my favorite items and I always leave with a basket full of goodies.  \n   They have pretty good prices and do compare if not beat the local Asian stores on same items.  That makes shopping mush easier knowing I can get the Asian items and the other countries items all in one place and not have to run all over town to get things.  They have a huge selection of Asian food items and we always find the things we need here.  Their UK selection is one of my favorite areas and I have tried many of the meat pies which are delicious.\n   It is a membership place with a small yearly fee or you pay a premium on the cost of items.  For us the membership was the way to go as we frequent them at least monthly.  In addition to food they have all of items for the home mainly from Asia.  We bought a 4 foot tall Vase from them years ago and still have it proudly displayed in our home.  \n   If you are looking for those hard to find international treats them give them a try as I am betting they will have it in stock.  Great place and great service!
