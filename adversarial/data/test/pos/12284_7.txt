we know .. we know... who doesn't love Pawn Stars. I like Chumlee & the old man.. but rick leaves a lot to be desired as does his son. blah. Ive been here 2x. the 1st time on a Sat. morning with no wait in line. It was great. But of course know that the \"talent\" is only there from M-F 8-5... if that.\n On my 2nd visit here they were filming - which meant Rick was filming and there were no photos allowed however as soon as they \"cut!\" SO DID RICK!. he was outta there.. no pics w\/ him or anything. I thought he'd stick around and \"work\" but I guess that's only when cameras are actually rolling on him. Kinda disappointed b\/c Chumlee was out of town in Alabama or Mississippi some place like that (2nd wk of Nov) oh well. What can you do? my out of town guests bought lots of t-shirts and cups and things I left with nothing b\/c most stuff (non souvenir stuff) is kinda pricey. I did see a ring I liked for my mom but maybe after browsing online I'll make my final decision.  \n\nBe warned! this place is much smaller than it looks on TV, its opened 24\/7 so dont feel the need to stand in line forever to see this small space. \nLike I said though they were filming when we walked through so maybe we'll appear on an epidsode, you never know !
