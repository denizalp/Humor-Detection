Well like the stars say \"meh\"\n\nI went by this morning and got in the drive through line, 3 cars in front of me and it took EIGHTEEN minutes before I was driving off. That is just ridiculous. Plus when I got up there, the lady seemed pretty unfriendly, no \"sorry for the wait\" which I would get at Starbucks, with a much shorter wait time. \n\nI got a white mocha which just tasted off to me, maybe a little bitter, so I am not sure if it was the espresso or what, but it did not taste good and it was lukewarm, not hot, which is not a fun way to drink your \"hot\" coffee. I also got a cinnamon scone, which was tasty but very tiny.\n\nI felt like they were overpriced for what I was getting, considering the mocha tasted bad and the scone was toddler sized. \n\nI would love to love this place, because I always want the small, locally owned places to do well, but I was just not impressed with my experience at all.
