I had to find movers on short notice and was extremely flustered as no one would return my calls or emails and if they did they wouldn't quote me a set price. However when I contacted Portland Student Movers, Ed responded within minutes and answered my questions with concise information and a set quote. The price he quoted was fantastic (better than ANY other moving company) and he worked with my time schedule. \nOn moving day, Larry and Brad showed up early and instantly started. They listened to all of my OCD request and were on the road in less than an hour. It was over 90 degrees and they moved all of our stuff into our new second story apt without any complaints and kept asking where I wanted my stuff instead of just assuming. \nI would recommend this company to anyone moving!
