Is it a nightclub - is it a restaurant - what is this place! \n\nSexy- trendy- in house dj - vibey. \n\nReservations recommended. \n\nFull bar available to enjoy a cocktail at while waiting for your table. \n\nIf you are looking for cozy and quiet with intimate dinner discussion perhaps not the place for you.\n\nI was intrigued by how many hammered tourists rolled in and out of this place making out at the bar and dancing at their dinner tables. People watching for days while I chowed down on my steak. Entertaining to say the least. Classy restaurant Yes - clientele - not soo much :-\/ \n\nAll I know is my bone in ribeye steak from the specials was mouth watering tasty. \n\nCreamed corn on point. Cream of spinach perfect.\nGrilled asparagus a little too charred for my personal liking.\n\nShoutout to our waiter who was AMAZING- I think his name was Chris. He needs to be a stand up comedian on the side he had us cracking up the whole night and was very hospitable. If I return I will definitely ask for him.
