One extra star awarded for the sweet seat that I ended up with due to an egregious error by the airline. I wrote this review before I tried to change my return flight and learned that it would cost more ($748) than my entire round-trip ticket ($610) to do so. I'm almost tempted to take away that second star...\n\nI checked in the night before without any trouble. I had already hand-selected my seat (using http:\/\/www.seatguru.com) over a month ago when I booked the flight and kept my preference when I checked in online. Because of the new travel restrictions, I had to check my suitcase. For some reason Air Canada does not allow you to print your own luggage tag for U.S.-bound flights the way all other airlines do. So instead of proceeding directly to customs and security, I had to wait in line with the rest of the plebes who were checking in manually. There was no separate line for \"baggage dropoff\" (I use quotes because the word dropoff implies speed and convenience, neither of which I experienced). It was the equivalent of depositing a cheque at the ATM and then having to go wait in line at the teller to withdraw the same money. Not impressed.\n\nNo fewer than 200 people ahead of me in line - with over two hours to spare before my flight's departure you'd think it'd be plenty of time, but no. There was a lot of panic in this lineup. A few people crying, some others yelling, and many utterances of \"this is mind-boggling.\" There were many angry passengers being consoled by AC personnel for either missing their flights or being told they'd have to leave their baggage behind. Also, you have to pay for additional checked bags in excess of one, and the pay pad was broken, causing further delays. At this point I had been waiting an hour. \n\nAn AC attendant did a callout for passengers on flights departing within an hour because there was a risk we wouldn't make our flights at this point. Excitement ensued! A few of us stepped forward and went to the front of the line. I put my bag on the scale and told the check-in attendant  that I just had to drop the bag of - I had already checked in. She furrowed her brow and walked away without saying anything. Came back ten minutes later and did a bit more typing, and asked one of her colleagues some questions. I heard mumblings of \"was that person authorized to do that? I can't find her passenger info.\" I stood there out of the loop.\n\nME: Is there a problem? I checked in last night and just printed my boarding pass. I'm literally just dropping off this bag. \nAIR CANADA ATTENDANT: It appears you're not on the flight. Someone has undone your check-in. \nME: Uhhh...OK. Well, check me back in I guess? I dunno. I need to get through security and customs.  \nAIR CANADA ATTENDANT: You've lost your seat, so you can no longer sit at the window. I'm putting you in the centre seat, row 38 (ie: by the shitter).\nME: But I chose my seat for a reason, and I did it a month ago.\nAIR CANADA ATTENDANT: Someone else is in that seat now. \nME: .....\nAIR CANADA ATTENDANT: OK, I'll put you in the exit row at the window. \n\nI scored a sweet seat with tons of leg room (not that I really needed it). There was no seat in front of me, and the guy in the next row (who I imagine had requested an extra leg room seat and was hoping I wouldn't make it onto the flight so he could take it) glared at me for the first 30 minutes of the flight. \n\nThe flight was on time and the staff was pleasant, although I'd make the following recommendations:\n- the francophone flight attendant reading the emergency procedures script had a limited grasp of the English language. For flights heading to the U.S., should FAs not be fluent in English?\n- please throw me a free sandwich or other meal. Tack on an extra $30 to my flight, I don't care. After paying $600 for a six hour flight I should not have to pull out my wallet to pay for food just because I'm not crossing an ocean.
