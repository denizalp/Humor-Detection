Where the spirit of Viva Las Vegas and New Orleans meet in a themed resort called The Orleans, there is a 24 hour cafe called Copper Whisk Cafe. It is the second incarnation of the Orlean's cafe. At the beginning of 2017, the Orlean's spent approximately $2 million dollars transforming the Courtyard Cafe into the more contemporary Copper Whisk Cafe. \n\nThis past October when we stayed at the Orlean's for a week, we had a dinner and a few breakfasts here. Right off the bat, I noticed significant differences from the former Courtyard Cafe that we had been to a few times in the past. The ambiance has improved at the same time that the selection and value has taken a dip. \n\nOn the first night of the vacation, when my dad had spent a day travelling from New York, we decided to hang out in the Orlean's and have dinner in their cafe. I decided on a dinner special. However, there were far fewer here that in the former cafe. I decided on Chicken Alfredo Primavera. It went for $14.99 and included a soup or salad. I ordered a soup. Despite the price increases, I appreciated the cafe tradition of including soup or salad with the entree. Likewise, I appreciated the large serving of Rigatoni pasta, Julienne sliced grilled chicken, creamy Alfredo sauce, and fresh vegetables. It tasted 3 stars as in A-ok. I added slightly more flavor by pouring a small bowl of grated cheese on it. I'd pass over the Garlic Ciabatta bread on the top and right portions of the plate.\n\nDuring our stay in this faux New Orleans in Vegas, this was our breakfast of choice. The Orlean's Friday's is closed for breakfast and for the price of the Java Detour coffee, we'd be paying 45% towards a breakfast in this sit down restaurant. Disparate from the Java place the lines to the cafe were relatively short. I did observe that there were empty tables and a failure to get people off the line in a timely manner to them. The majority of the time I ordered the American Breakfast either with or without bacon. Being that the days of value are gone, it is $7.99 without bacon and $9.99 with bacon or sausage. That is before the bottomless coffee that is around $3.50. My attitude on the noticeable price increases was that I  live once and I was on vacation. With that said, my American Breakfast included two scrambled eggs, breakfast potatoes, an English muffin, a slice of cantelope, and sometimes bacon. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite American Breakfast item. There was one morning that I ordered the pancakes with scrambled eggs and bacon. At $10.99 this included 2 stacks of pancakes from the following flavors: buttermilk, blueberry, banana, and chocolate chip. Much to my disappointment that I rate 3 stars, they did not blanket the 2  pancakes with blueberry flavored topping and syrup that a restaurant like IHOP would have. The pancakes themselves were blueberry. I'd have no choice but to cover them up with Maple syrup. With every breakfast,the $3.50 cup of coffee was on the par of the Starbuck's served in Java Detour.\n\n   What I really appreciate about this place is that they improved upon the New Orlean's theme. I enjoyed the sights of a more contemporary New Orleans theme. The highlight of the upscale interior are the trumpet lights hanging from the white dome in the center of the room. This drew me into the theme. Adding to the interior  that drew me into a contemporary New Orleans were the brick walls holding iron rails and copper pans. From my observation, the Copper Whisk is more closed in than the Courtyard Cafe was. In this closed in restaurant we'd always sit in the one of two rooms closer to the entrance just a toss away from the sports book. I also observed that the red seats were very comfortable. \n\nThe service was satisfactory. Whether it was dinner or breakfast, we never encountered rude employees, \n\nRegardless that the former Courtyard Cafe was a star better, I appreciate that the Orlean's has retained their 24 hour cafe unlike some casinos including Bally's, the Rio, and Mirage. As a local, I would not go out of my way to dine here. However, as a local that became a tourist for a week staying at the Orlean's, the Copper Whisk Cafe was our choice for breakfasts and the first vacation dinner.
