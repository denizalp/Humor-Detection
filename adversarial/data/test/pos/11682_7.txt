I have read mixed reviews for Miega Korean. I am in that area several times a week and knew sooner or later while shopping downstairs I would climb those stairs. Yesterday's experience at Miega was not particularly impressive. I got there a few minutes before three and waited in an empty restaurant till a woman who was eating at a table near the kitchen came to my table. Waiting the 10 minutes gave me ample time to cover the menu and make my selection. \n\nSince by the time the woman got to my table it was after three I could not get the lunch special I wanted unless I paid dinner prices. Oh well, not as if the menu did not have enough other offerings. I remembered a few references to the seafood pancake and placed my order. Shortly the server brought the banchan. Even tho I was dining alone the four tiny plates with a tablespoon or less of kimchi, etc. was not worth bringing. \n\nI had a Kellerman book with me so the rather long wait did not phase me. Besides the tea was quite good. The pancake was pitiful. It was charred on the bottom, nicely crisped on the top and gummy in the middle. The seafood was chewy squid slices, tiny canned cocktail shrimp, surimi and long thick slices of green onion tops. I had far better Korean pancakes on the street in Pittsburgh's Strip District for 75 cents. This cost me 13 dollars.  \n\nThe server sat at that table eating out of a bowl with her back to me. Did not bother me a bit. In an empty restaurant I could just yell \"Hey Ms.\" anytime I needed something. She did not seem to mind leaving her bowl much. \n\nWhen I was getting ready to leave I could not find a bookmark someone had handmade for me. The server found it for me redeeming herself and ending my fear that I ate it. It would have been as good as the pancake. \n\nMy review is based on one pancake. I intend to get there again but before 3:00 and try one of the lunch specials. The room is nice, the menu expansive and I grew to like the server.
