I came to this place twice. Kicked out on the second time because they had reserved to for CES. Ironically my friends came from there as well. A sign outside would've been nice. Anyway I didn't give them 3 stars because of that. The prices are high and I really didn't notice the increase in quality that much.  Then again I am not Korean. If the meat doesn't have gristle, not brown from age, and tasty then it's considered great Korean BBQ. I've eaten at all the popular Korean BBQs on Spring Mtn. I was surprised when Lee's also bought this place. That firewater makes a ton of cash from getting people drunk apparently. This is one of those places that if you have a Korean friend, you'd want them to come with you so that you will get the best service, kind of deal. Luckily we did and she is one bossy lady too. But I don't think I would come by myself. Is it really worth the trouble to have to, like grovel, to pay more and get less? I was never one of those guys so I only come when I get dragged here. As far as it being superior to others, I really can't tell. Then again, my palate leans toward Average Joe and not \"look at me\" Kimye.\n\nI really don't think the food is worth the premium here, kinda like Mothers down the road. What's the big deal about them too???? I ate there and I didn't see what the fuss was about. Okay, so the decor is nice.... To me, Sura, Honey Pig, Tofu Hut all are good in their own way and I don't feel like I was unfulfilled when I leave those places. The prices and food fit although that dang Sura has cut down quite a bit on food. Raise the prices by a few bucks but keep the old food and quality( and it will still be cheaper than here)
