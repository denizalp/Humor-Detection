Go with a friend. Split the veggie pulled pork sandwich (VPP) and the halloumi sandwich, so you can try both and throw in a side of potatoes. \n\nAll their baked goods on display at the counter are delicious. I wouldn't know - I've never eaten them. Just saw \"someone else\" eat a lemon square one time and then a chocolate chip cookie another time, and look super happy with life. I am pretty sure it was \"someone else\".\n\nConsistently delicious. Casual vibe (it's part of a dep) and off the beaten path - full of local Montrealers. It has a small seating area (maybe 3 tables) and the bar inside, and in the summer there are picnic benches outside.\nClose to the Jean Talon market if you're in the hood.\n\nThis is one of those places I hope never changes.
