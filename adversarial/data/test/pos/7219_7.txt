First, I must say, everything that has been posted here is 100% true! As a current resident, the proximity to UNLV is the only reason why I stayed in this hell hole for so many years. At first, it was the price and the closeness to campus that kept me here. However, when I told the idiot manager that I needed a month-to-month because I am trying to close on a home and did not want to sign another lease, he raised my rent $125.00. \n\nThis was one a great place for students and\/or young professionals. Now, they let anyone move in as long as you can pay rent. I don't even think they do background checks on some of the people I have had to call neighbors. And don't let me get started on the management or lack thereof. As of today, they have a new management team, which I thought might be more organized and professional,but those women are just as braindead and useless as the others managers. \n\nGood luck to anyone who still resides here (I'm leaving at the end of the month), and for those still thinking about moving here: PLEASE DON'T!!!! \n\nTrust the reviews on this one and run, not walk, as far away as you can from this dump!
