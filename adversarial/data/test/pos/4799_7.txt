Stopped in for the first time today and I'm bummed that I didn't find this place sooner! It would've been perfect spot to get a refreshing drink, hangout and study\/work in throughout the summer. \nWe got the acai bowl and the tropical green smoothie. Both were great! The acai bowl in particular was perfect, topped off with a coconut vegan whipped cream. \n\nThe two employees there were super friendly and patient, they even helped us decide what to order with their suggestions!\n\nBoth the interior and exterior of the store were very charming and welcoming. I love the design of the logo, menu, and the layout of tables, chairs etc. Reminds me of San Francisco. They even have a table with iPads on them that you can use!\n\nOverall, great place and a must try. So happy that there's a great juice bar in this area. Perfect for a brunch, a refresher and\/or dessert and you don't have to feel guilty about it  Can't wait to go back!
