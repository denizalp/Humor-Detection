Only one word: yeeeeehaaaw! Finally real southern BBQ cooked slow and low in Montreal. Word traveller, humble pit master, Blackstrap owner Dylan Kier is a young alchemist constantly looking for ways to perfect his culinary craft. The result is simply divine! Extremely friendly, the staff makes ordering lunch or dinner such a pleasure.\n\nLast week, I ordered the pulled pork platter (very juicy) with a side baked beans (not too overdone like other places) and tangy cole slaw. Had to come back a week later for the dry rub smoked half-rack of ribs since they ran out. The trip back was worthwhile... also added an extra side of tasty beef brisket and hand cut fries. Don't forget to try both the sweet bbq sauce as well as the hot sauce (not that hot btw).\n\nWill certainly return to try the \"burnt ends\" Poutine since it contains a good mix of lean and less lean brisket odds ends. For those working downtown, it's less than 15 minutes away by car - worth the detour!
