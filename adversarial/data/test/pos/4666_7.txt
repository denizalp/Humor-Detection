I am officially a big fan of Chengdu Taste. I have eaten there in about five or six occasions in the last few months and am always pleased by my experience. \n\nThe restaurant is small but they do take reservations which makes me so happy. They get very busy on weekends so if you plan accordingly you won't have a long wait for a table at all. \n\nAll the dishes I've tried have been great and I'm slowly getting through the entire menu. Slowly because I end up ordering a few key dishes on each visit that are musts. The cumin lamb, guess guess shrimp, tan tan noodles, Chongqing chicken and garlic pork. Everything else is great and come in varying degrees of spice level so be forewarned. I've discovered a new favorite dish that I'll be ordering regularly as well. The stir fried intestines are delicious and have a great crunchiness that adds an interesting texture.\n\nI'm not usually a big fan of super spicy food but the flavors here are sometimes subtle and the spice is more of a heat than an all out taste bud attack of fire. \n\nDefinitely one of my favorite restaurants in town, I am a regular at this point.
