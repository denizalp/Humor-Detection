Felice came soooo close to earning a 5-star rating from me, and I'm not sure what's holding me back! Maybe after my next visit I'll be able to bump it up  :)  but until then..\n\nI came here for happy hour mid-week  and loved the cozy feeling inside. We sat at the bar and I had a moscow mule which was great - one of the better versions I've had! We had a few of their happy hour appetizers - the goat cheese was INCREDIBLE, and I thought that the crispy chick peas were just okay.. until I realized that I couldn't stop eating them. They're addictive! We also got the mussels which were fantastic (the broth was delicious) and a pizza with zucchini and olives - also great. And their discounted happy hour prices are phenomenal - really great deals!\n\nOverall, I can't wait for my next visit to Felice. My goal is to sample everything on their amazing happy hour menu.. and even though it's a pretty large menu, I'm sure it won't take me too long to make my way through it.
