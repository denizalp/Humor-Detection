Ambiance: 3 - Your average looking dim sum place. It looks like any other dim sum place! \n\nService: 2 - Service was kind of slow and too many of the same dishes were carted around. It took a little too long to get some water with my tea. I've seen a lot of other places with more variety!\n\nFood: 3 - Taste was okay but not amazing. There was only one dish that I really liked and that was the shrimp noodle with sauce poured over it. Otherwise, the rest of the food was pretty average and nothing special! \n\nI did order a dish that was not on the dim sum menu, but it took way to long to come out! Not really a place I would want to come back to, but it definitely satisfies the craving!
