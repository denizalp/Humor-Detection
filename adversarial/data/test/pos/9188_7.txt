Next to Last place on my list of BBQ places in Las Vegas & some pretty mixed reviews BUT ..... \n\nI immediately liked the place the chopper w\/smoker sidecar by Orange County Choppers\/American Chopper & I liked the modern design with flat screens easily viewable from every seat and large comfy booths along the wall. \n\nThere were a few large groups already eating and the BBQ looked great BUT... \n\nI decided to try a couple sandwiches this time & skip the bbq-the table right next to me ordered a 3 meat sampler with brisket,ribs & pulled pork & it looked fantastic. \n\nI ordered the B.L.G.F.T. or Bacon Lettuce Green Fried Tomato and a side of mac & cheese, the wife ordered a pastrami with mayo coleslaw. \n\nI tried all 3 of their trademark sauces and I thought they were all good, each had it's own distinct variation. \n\nWe both ordered sweet tea which was pretty damn good but a little warm. \n\nThe place was only 1\/2 full so service was pretty fast & the waitress was very informative. \n\nThe only complaint is it is way overpriced.$14 sandwiches...BUT.... \n\nMonday-Friday 5-9 they have all-you-can-eat BBQ for $30. I will have to go back & give it a go.
