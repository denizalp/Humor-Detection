I read the reviews and phoned at 8:00 pm last night ( Sunday)\nJeff has already been, replaced the springs for heavier duty springs, with warranty.\nHe charged me $185, exactly what I was told, and all is fixed, clean and tidy and it is only 11:30 Monday! Oh and his 8 year old helper was very good and respectful!\nWow!
