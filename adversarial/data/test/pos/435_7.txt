For a supposedly a good restaurant,  this place has absolutely no idea what service is.\n\nWaited 45 minutes to get seated. But we were late for our reservation so we thought that was ok, since it was kind of our fault. Then we realized that everyone was waiting that long because they are extremely overbooked. Didn't actually matter what time your reservation was for, it was first-come-first-served. And to get a table you had to stand on top of the hostess and constantly remind her that you were waiting. Otherwise you would never get a table, like we saw some people who chose to go for a walk or wait on the benches down the street.\n\nOnce seated, we kept waiting for service. After about 15 minutes a waiter came around and took and order from the table next to us, who were seated at the same time as us. He didn't say hi to us, or acknowledged our presence in any way. He poured water for the other table, so we figured he ran out of water, and he was coming back to take our order once he put theirs in. After another 10 minutes of waiting, he came back to verify the order he just took from the other table, turned around and walked away without saying as much as hi to us.\n\nWe got up, told him that we were leaving because we got no service after 25 minutes. He didn't even apologize. He just said: \"Oh, i didn't see you there\". How could you not after taking an order from the table next to us? And as a waiter, how can you not know your tables and who has been served or not? And how is it possible that no other waiter covered for him?\n\nAfter all that we were so happy to walk out and not leave any money at this place at all. We went to one of our favourite places down the road and had a better meal and one of the best service in Toronto for less money than this place.\n\nCorner House has absolutely the worst service we've ever experienced anywhere in the world, including Malta, where you have to wait forever to get service and food. But at least there they are constantly coming up to you and apologizing for the wait.
