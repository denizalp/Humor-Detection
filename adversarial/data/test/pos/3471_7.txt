Bought the $65 punch card worth 10 visits before my kids even entered. \nThis place is awesome. My kids loved it. I loved it. \nThe 3 of us arrived and were asked to take off our shoes. My daughter and I didn't have socks, the owner handed us two pairs as soon as I said I needed them. We took our shoes off, socked up, and I filled out the waiver. Bought 10 visits for $65 and the kids went running for the next hour and a half. \nThere's coffee, water, and hot tea. \nAn AMAZING massage chair that rubs ya head to toe, literally get your arms in the rests, it's AWESOME. \n\nAs for the kids, the play area is super entertaining and they just ran and ran. The slide was fast(for adults who are heavier), there are 2 trampoline areas for just kids(no adults), a swing, a driving track, an infant area, and an art\/book corner. \n\nLet's not forget the reasonably priced snacks. There are numerous waters, juices, and snacks that won't cost your first born for deposit. They have San Pellegrino!!!!! \n\nI hate letting everyone know about this great place, I hope they keep up the cleanliness with the growth. When you are this awesome, wear and tear will kill ya!!!
