Our fearless CM's review inspired me to check out Ravi.  Gosh dang it, I sure am glad I did!!  Shoop, shoop!!\n\nI had the soup and wrap combo.  Red pepper bisque (one of my fav types of soups) with a flank steak wrap.  Perfect portions.  Its like the best of both worlds - a little soup with a little wrap.  Great lunch size.\n\nThe bisque had shrimp in it and was perfect in texture and flavour.  The wrap was so good and I did share that bit of news when I first pti into it (I believe with my mouth open) to Avitania B, Danielle P and Chris P.  It was OMG worthy.\n\nThis place is open till 10 pm on Friday nights and does take debit.\nIs the soup as good as Soup Nutsy....not quite - but Soup Nutsy isn't open at night so a gal's gotta do what a girls gotta do.\n\nI got mine to go, but the large communal table inside is pretty snazzy and the odd horse at the front of the shop...odd....but I'll roll with it.\n\nHighly recommend.  Whether you have the sniffles or just fancy a bit o soup.
