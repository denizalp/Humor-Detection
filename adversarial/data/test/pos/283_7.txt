All of me loves all of Flower Child! \n\nLast night, I really wanted to eat somewhere healthy and that my mom would love (she is pretty picky) so I hoped that Flower Child was the answer and it was!!\n\nWe came last night and the restaurant is pretty open, big and similar to the Sauce concept - you wait in line to order at the counter, get a number while you get your drinks, sit and they bring your order to you.\n\nWe ordered the Avocado Hummus, the Rebel Wrap, and the Forbidden Rice bowl with shaved chicken = less than $40. We received the hummus first which included pita bread. I wasn't a big fan of it because the pita bread was thin and flimsy and the hummus was alright. I don't think it was worth $7. However, the forbidden rice and rebel wrap were delicious! I think that the portions weren't bad - two entrees and one appetizer filled three people. \n\nI noticed their iced teas and lemonades after we ordered and was considering going back in line to just get a drink. However, after eating our food, I just knew I would be a regular here so I decided to hold off and get an iced tea the next time I dine in. My mom and hubby loved the food too. \n\nThe next morning, we placed a to-go breakfast order for the Late Riser and the Green Garden bowls  = a little over $20. It was so filling and appetizing! My favorite was the Green Garden - scrambled eggs, spinach, roasted brussels sprouts, broccoli, charred onion, tuscan kale pesto,\ngreek yogurt, prairie breeze cheddar! I was quite impressed that all those greens can be included in a bowl and be so good!
