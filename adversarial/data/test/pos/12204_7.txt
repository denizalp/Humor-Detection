Came for lunch today to this 1-week-old addition to one of Yonge's most eyesore-iest stretches. Really 2-ish stars but I'll round up for looks, just like in life.\n\nContrary to a previous review, there is definitely bibimbap, but the dinner menu might be different. We ordered seafood dolsot ($11) and a traditional bibimbap minus the meat ($8), making the terrible mistake of thinking it would also be in a hot stone bowl. Now, I wouldn't kick a regular bibimbap out of bed for eating crackers, but let's be real: dolsot or go home.\n\nThere was a bit of a language barrier while we were ordering, so maybe not conducive to ordering for dietary restrictions, but we eventually managed.\n\nPROS:\n+ Clean and nicely decorated\n+ Refreshingly short menu\n+ Delightfully unpredictable playlist consisting of Shania Twain, Backstreet Boys, Bon Jovi and \"That's Amore\" (you know, \"When the moon hits your eye\/Like a plate of japchae...\")\n\nCONS:\n- Hot stone pot did not stay very hot (an excerpt from the unpublished Dr. Seuss book \"Horton Visits a Korean Restaurant\"). My dining partner notes that the \"crispy rice factor was maybe operating at around 60%\".\n- Fried egg on my bibimbap must have been of the Cadbury Mini variety because it was tragicomically tiny. I wish a took a picture but you still would have had to squint to make it out.\n- No banchan. A pinch of kimchi and tiny cup of [delicious] seaweed soup was the extent of sides. No potatoes? No tofu? No bean sprouts? :(\n- Poor seating. I happen to have a spine condition that makes supporting my own upright position throughout a meal quite difficult, but regardless, let's leave backless stools to bars, please?\n\nPrice-wise, I can't find a reason for the extra $1-3 on some dishes (in comparison with K-town spots) especially in light of the lack of appetizers. Maybe I'll come back when they've settled in more and see if I can find one then.
