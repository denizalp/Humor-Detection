Let me preface this by saying I have a new found respect for girls who can dance on poles, and I now know that I can never be a stripper. I thought just the taking the clothes part off would be bothersome, but now I know I lack the athletic strength to be a stripper as well.. bummer. \n\nI went to a private class here for my friend's bachelorette party and really enjoyed it. For $40 each, it was a reasonable, fun, bachelorette party activity you can do during the day. It costs less than 3 cocktails by the pool and is an actual work out ! \n\nFor our class we did half pole dancing and half lap dancing. Many of my girlfriends walked away wtih some serious bruising from the pole, but we were all still in good spirits. The class was challenging, but still very fun. The instructor adjusts to your level, so she even taught a few of the girls in my group to climb up the pole ! \n\nI'd recommend it as something fun to do during a girl's weekend that doesn't have to involve drinking ! There is only so much clubbing and pool parties one can handle !
