I used to LOVE this show, I had a HORRIBLE experience at the Mack King Show, on October 11!  We waited in line forever and some guy got hurt and bled all over the place.  Some biker looking employee named James was asking medical questions and I asked if he was certified and he said no...WTF Harrahs?? Then this other guy got ticked off and some drunk employee Bobby yelled at him and kicked him out of line to get a refund, my kids could smell the alcohol when he was yelling at the poor guy.  WTF Harrahs?  Then the other idiot employee tells another person in line that the guy died while my kids stand there.  Then I complain to this kid manager who tells me if I don't like it I can get my cash back, who runs this place?  In the end a GREAT show but never going back!!!!
