My hubby and I truly like the sandwiches at EOS as they are always fresh with flavorful ingredients and the bread is just fantastic!\n\nMy favorite is the tuna melt as it is made with white albacore tuna and Swiss that is oozing melted goodness with every bite!\n\nMy sweetheart likes The Full Montagu which has Roasted beef, turkey, Swiss, sharp cheddar, lettuce, tomato & mustard sauce.\n\nHe is also a fan of sandwiches and with their bread and filling combinations you just can't go wrong!\n\nThis location is convenient for us as they are located inside of the Palms hotel and casino food court in which we pass on our way to the movies!
