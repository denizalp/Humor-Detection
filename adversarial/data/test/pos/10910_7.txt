I really wanted to like this place. Based on the write up in The Phoenix New Times, we were really looking forward to eating and hanging out here.\n\nThe restaurant and grounds are beautiful. It's a new business, I think they may have opened to early, before working all the kinks out of their service. And please understand, I expected that to some degree but what I can't tolerate is negligent or rude service. \n\n\n- The hostesses were rude and distracted and one was chomping on chewing gum while she was talking to us. \n- there were several employees standing around the hostess stand in a frenzied state of confusion \n- we were told it would be between 45 mins and 2 hours for a wait. Had a table not come avail while we were waiting on our friends, we would have left. The wait was about 45 mins which is acceptable \n- while waiting we sat outside in the cocktail area to wait get drinks and apps. The server was very slow and rude. Based on this alone I would have left \n- server inside was pleasant but after we sat and ordered we never saw him again. No one came by to check on us, to see how the food was or to refill drinks or for us to order cocktails. \n\nGood idea on the concept and I hope you do well. Pizza was good, burger and fries were just okay. But average food and poor service make it hard to want to come back when there are so many good restaurants in Phoenix now.
