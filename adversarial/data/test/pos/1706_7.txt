I really don't think I need to explain further as to why I love The Venetian so much. If you truly know me, I lived in Italy for most of my adulthood life, so The Venetian is just the perfect replica of where I grew up and what I'm familiar with. There are evenings when the hotel employees would dress as Venetians in full gowns, masks, and outfits and dress up to play, just like the Carnevale of Venezia that occurs during February-March. This is an on going festival that lasts about a week, so I would think (and hope) that The Venetian follows the tradition as well. From some evenings in April, I understand they participate in the Redentore Festivale, a large fireworks festival at the heart of Piazza di San Marco.\n\nJust like the real Venezia, you will see a cute replicated Grande Canale that serves gondola rides along with gondoliers crooning classical romantic Italian tunes to you. I'm very fond of this hotel for all its beauty and the perfect replicated ceilings of fine paintings by old masters. I swear I felt like I was in heaven just looking up at the ceilings. Just beyond the bend of the canal is their replicated and most iconic Rialto Bridge. It's cute and painted to its once original colour, and quite crowded, just like the real thing. Even in the outskirts of The Venetian is the infamous replicated Piazza di San Marco!! I just loved everything about it!\n\nIf you do not have time to visit the real Venezia in Italy, The Venetian is a small portion of what the real Venezia has to offer. I loved it even though it was completely replicated x
