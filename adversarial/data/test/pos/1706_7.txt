Not so \"secret\" pizza! This place kept popping up on Yelp and after our friends were gambling in the Cosmo I suggested this joint for a quick bite. It's funny the workers mess with you and act like they really can't tell you where it is. \n\nI got a slice of the white pizza. Folded it in half. Sat by the pool tables outside. Ate a bite. Had a sip of beer. Transported to heaven. \n\nVegas baby
