The good news is that while you're sitting in their waiting room for over an hour, you have plenty of time to write a review. My appointments have been cancelled twice, after I was sitting in the waiting room for 20 minutes they told me that the doctor had to run to a delivery and nobody else was available to do my annual exam. Twice. This has happened. I'm current still waiting... Going on 58 minutes, but hopefully third time is the charm.  I won't be back ever again.
