I was walking with my friend checking out the new Palazzo when was stumbled on crowd. Out of curiousity we took a peek and saw 3 women moving to harp music dressed as garden statues. I didn't know what the show was about and what it's trying to show us. \n\nI'm thinking an enchanted forest or garden with plants blossoming into beautiful women.
