As someone who spent 5 years living in Japan this restaurant offends me to the core. I don't know where to even begin with this train wreck of a restaurant. I guess I'll start by saying that this restaurant does not serve Japanese food.  I know that when most people think of Japanese food they think of Sushi, Hibachi and instant ramen noodles. Well they definitely have Sushi in Japan but it is nothing like what you find in America, it is infinitely better and they most definitely invented instant ramen noodles(which can't shine a light on how awesome real ramen is). Hibachi restaurants are an unholy American creation and this place falls into that category and it is a bottom barrel Hibachi restaurant at best. Now on to the meal. I ordered chicken yakisoba; A delicious yet humble dish in Japan, yet the disgusting mess that I was prepared tonight was not yakisoba. As part of my order I was brought a salad made up of iceberg lettuce that was drowned in thousand island dressing. I would estimate that there was at least a half a cup of dressing on this poor little salad, next was a bowl of soup which was in reality just a bowl of beef broth with a few onions and mushrooms tossed in which was completely disgusting. Next in the course was \"Hibachi\" stir fried vegetables which consisted of onions, mushrooms and zucchini drowned in vegetable oil and copious amounts of butter, stir fried. Another complete failure and the last course was the yakisoba, which again consisted of cabbage and other unidentifiable vegetables drowned in oil, butter, soy sauce and some kind of butter with soba noodles tossed on top. This entire meal was utterly devoid of flavor other than that of the oil that everything was swimming in. I almost forgot to mention that they used the same knife for the fish, chicken, shrimp and vegetables on the grill. I am not a chef  nor a professional cook but I know that you should never ever do this to avoid cross contamination especially with raw chicken and seafood. Please stay away from this restaurant and do yourself a favor by finding an authentic Japanese restaurant. This was quite possibly one of the worst meals I have ever had in my life.
