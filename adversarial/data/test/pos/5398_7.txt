They should rename this place to Lame Tuesday or Douche Tuesday.\n\nThey serve foo foo slushy drinks that are mediocre at best.\nThe place blasts the most annoying music so loud, that the coffee plantation shakes at night.\n\nI usually get \"want to fight eyes\" from the steroid club that's hanging out on the patio every time I walk by.\n\nI want to reopen this place as \"The Home Depot\", cause it has the most tools you have seen under one roof.\n\nTo add insult to injury they charge a cover on  weekends, like paying 8 bucks for a 24 ounce cup of ice and shit isn't bad enough.  \n\nThe only redeeming deal they have is $1 for a shot of 151 rum in your cup... of course it isn't Bacardi 151, but some grain alcohol off brand.  \n\nIf you are here spend like $10 on those extra shots, because it will help keep you from slashing your wrists in the bathroom.\n\nAnother upside to this place is that after a night here, if you vomit on a a really big piece of a paper and leave it out all night, you might be able to slang it at an art gallery as modern art.\n\n\"This place is good... for me to poop on.\"
