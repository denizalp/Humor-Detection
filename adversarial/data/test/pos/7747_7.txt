My Dad won a slot jackpot here twenty years ago so this place has a lot of nostalgic value for us.. We booked six rooms for my siblings, nephews, etc., to the tune of about $1400.00. \n\nWhen you book you think you're getting a four star hotel, then guess what? When you get there the fee you paid was for the old, Carson Tower.. (our room has crumbling popcorn ceilings (asbestos? I hope not) and without even a desk or fridge.. Decidedly two star. ) If you want the better four-star room, you have to pay an additional $19\/ night. The old Bait and Switch.. very frustrating.. Good beds, though!\n\nIn our bathroom alone, the sink was cracked almost in half, the door levers are tarnished, toilet old and broken (a real chug-a-lug) and towels stained brown and threadbare. Unbelievable. When I called Roxanne, she was sorry about the sink but staunchly defended the hotel's four-star rating, saying three times it was rated by AAA, etc.. I guess a customer in a room's opinion doesn't matter.\n\nHousekeeping: 5 pm and when we got back to our room. no housekeeping service had been done, wet towels were still on floor.. I called Sharon in housekeeping and she had no reason for this and said she thought we had checked out. No, we're here two more days!! Then early one morning they're pounding at out door at the strike of 9 am. Isn't this a casino hotel where guests sleep in? Then they left no coffee cups.. The Keurig coffee cartridges cost $2.50 each (39 cents at Costco) so bring your own.\n\nPOOL: In the morning my friend and I wanted to sit at the pool and have a drink before exploring.. At 9:25 a.m. there was only about 30 people at the pool, but guess what? People have reserved for themselves every single chaise lounge (Approx. 200 or so of them)  by putting a book, hat, or towel from their room on them.. What about the morning guests? I found out later that they do this so they can try to sell day beds by the upper pool for $200 each. (You can stay three nights at the hotel for that amount!) Well it's a busy Sunday and they've only rented one (out of about twelve!) leaving lots of these huge beds wide open, while just one level below, dozens of people stand around chaise-less.. It's very sad, indeed..At 5 pm they let everyone and anyone into the pool area.. four gang members (and a baby) entered, who said they were from NW Vegas and took the four chaises next to us.. pants sagging low, throwing gang signs, we got a little nervous and left..\n\nWIFI:  the wifi in your room costs $12.99 per room\/ per day\/ PER DEVICE!! I am a normal, connected person with an iphone, ipad, macbook.. Those three devices (and my roommate's two) would have cost us $64.95 a day just for wifi! Does this seem fair?? (Roxanne the manager did help me out a bit on this issue, thanks so much!)\n\nIn the parking garage, the closest, premium parking spots are all empty and reserved for the managers, directors, etc.. making the paying customers park up a few levels. This is so they don't  have to use the garage elevators, one broken, the other slow and on it's last leg..We waited six minutes for the elevator (there's only six levels!!) It's not even check out time..\n\nBUFFET: The entrees, although salty, are actually quite tasty. But the desserts, which look great, are awful. The apple cobbler is way too sweet and like wallpaper paste. Everyone at my table was spitting out their desserts, not a pretty picture. If you have a larger group, there is a forced 18% gratuity that you have to pay in advance. I like to tip from my heart at the end of the meal.. those buffet workers really deserve it, though!\nFOOD: The Carson St. Cafe is decent, good breakfast.. great bread! My over-medium eggs had the white still raw, but the nice waiter replaced them along with some really nice fruit. Avoid the Asian Cuisine restaurant, my cashew chicken was something like $16.95 and was bland, tasted straight out of the Chun King can..\n\nThere are many nice employees here, but I was disappointed with our stay..
