Mediocre.\n\nI know there are better Italian joints in Vegas and beyond, but a good friend of mine really wanted to go and since it was his birthday wish, so be it.\n\nFirst, this woman is a brand.  I'm not a big fan of her cooking show (mostly about the boob) and I'm not a big fan of the cooking show either.  That being said, her establishment has a fantastic location that makes use of the glitter and neon lights of Vegas and I must admit, I had my share of fun that included the photo booth in the reception area.  \n\nThe lunch menu here is limited and uninventive.  Since I was not in the mood for pizza, I opted for the Muffuletta sandwich, which was not even a full sandwich.  It was half a sandwich and served with deep fried zucchini strings.  While the sandwich was good, the bread was dense and overly hard, which made me question the freshness of it.  Second, while the zucchini shoestrings were good, the chef may want to rethink the concept since every time I went to pinch a few, it snapped a lot of the strings.  By the time I was finished, most of the zucchini shoestrings had been reduced to a series of broken matchsticks.  Pretty on the plate, not practical to consume.  Perhaps larger shavings?\n\nMy other friend ordered a pizza and she did say that the dough was very good, but the price did not reflect the single layer of prosciutto on top. \n\nWhile the experience was a pleasant one due to the simple and pretty interiors as well as the waitstaff (trained, no doubt, to tell us that Giada's family prefers to eat the pizza in one manner or Giada prefers you to take a bite of this etc etc), I will not return for a second visit.  Thank you, however, for making my friend's birthday a good one.  The two cookie presentation was nice too and the Lemon Ricotta cookie was very good.
