I have driven past this tennis facility many times.  I really wanted to like it and consider joining. They seem to always have clinics going on as well as a pool and exercise facility. It seems like a pretty happening place to be. \nThe courts are very nice and the ladies we played against were courteous and very good for our level.  During our match however, 2 pros and another male player stood at the on court bench talking loudly while our match was going on. It was rude and not very courteous, especially for pros. They should know better. \nThough the facility was nice, I am sad to say that the staff was not very courteous. If I play there again, I hope I have a different experience. From the other reviews, it seems that I should give it another chance.
