Great prices on everything, especially Birks -- I'll return when it's time for my next pair.  \n\nInstead, today I walked out with a comfy and cute pair of New Balance runners ($70). I was actually looking to replace my blundstone-esque boots on my feet but they didn't have anything like them and I was convinced that something like that would be too hot for spring anyhow (true).  And I actually did need new running shoes.\n\nMy feet and my wallet are happy.
