This is one SEXY resort. Nestled at the foot of Camelback Mountain, this hotel has class and a very romantic ambience. What I love about this resort, is that it stays true to it's beautiful desert surroundings, instead of trying too hard to be something its not. It's not over-modern, or over-retro, like other nearby hotels. Montelucia boasts a great pool area with lots of events throughout the year(especially summertime)\nIt's not the most affordable option, but a nice quality resort in a relaxing area while still being close to nightlife, shopping and hiking trails. Great place to stay for out-of-towners and locals alike.
