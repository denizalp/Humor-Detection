Swingers Bar???Okay I pass by this bar everyday on my way to work and convinced my husband to take me there. I knew as soon as I walked in it was a mistake but I figured it was a little late and to just stay and give it a chance... There were 4 of us and we sat down finally 8 minutes later a waitress comes over and asks us what did you guys have again? I was like we just got here. Ordered our drinks and  I started to look around and noticed there were alot of people making out with many different people in the same groups... Could this be a swingers bar?..ewww we drank our beer down asked for our tab to be closed out and the waitress gave us some other guys credit card..didn't even ask us our name..had to yell wait to get her back to get our credit card back.. Never ever going there again...
