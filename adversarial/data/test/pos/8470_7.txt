They close at 2am, we went there at 11pm with the empty stomach.  Walked in the establishment and stood there for 5 mins as we are transparent.\n\nThe guy who works there walked past us 4 times in which gave us no eye contact, no smile, and no acknowledgement.  He look like he has been working 12 hrs straight with no breaks.\n\nTheir food may be good, but we probably wont be back again.  Took my money elsewhere.
