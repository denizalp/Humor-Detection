An absolutely pathetic excuse for a paintballing facility.\n\nWhen they have deals, the prices are reasonable. They usually don't have deals though, so the prices tend to be ridiculous.\n\nDuring our (myself and seven other friends) match, I tagged numerous people on the other team. However, dishonesty is rampant here, as is the case in many games of paintball. That's what the refs are for though, right? Wrong. The referees here are complete idiots. I tagged one guy six times, right in front of the ref, before I had to yell at the ref to get him out of the game for cheating. One time I was tagged, and I raised my arms to signal that I was out. I turned my back to go back to my side of the field, and was hit like 10 more times in the back. I looked at the ref, who would not say shit, as I was still being tagged while my hands were up. I had to walk over to the other team, and yell at them because they had no idea what it means when somebody's hands are up. When somebody's hands are up, they are hit, and you do not hit them; this is common knowledge. An opposing team of fucktards and a retarded referee that would not do shit, not a good combination. \n\nThe arena was absolutely pitch black and grimy. It didn't feel like a paintball arena, it felt like quicksand. My friends and I could not see for the life of us. \n\nFind someplace better, do not waste your money here.
