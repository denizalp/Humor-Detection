Sconetastic. Sconerific. Sconemania. Ermegerd, the scones. Great Scott, have you tried the scones??? If you haven't, I feel so sorry for you that I might buy and personally deliver some. No one should live a life in Madison without sampling them at least once. If you lined up all the great things about Willy St. food, they would lead the parade.\n\nIf the scones aren't enough, or somehow aren't your thing, come anyway for the eclectic, grandma's house meets yard sale vibe. Even in a room full of strangers, you feel like you're at a sleepover at a best friend's house where their parents are slightly off kilter. Those were always the best parties. You kind of expect the adults to be playing euchre, drinking beer and smoking in another room somewhere, and laughing really loud.\n\nBut I digress. Try the BLT with roasted red pepper on sourdough, and ask to add avocado. Sometimes they'll have it, sometimes not, but it's really good either way. Walk out smiling and fulfilled.
