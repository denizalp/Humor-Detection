This place has been around for about as long as I have. Everybody's driven by it. Everybody knows what it is. This is the kind of place you went to when you turned 18 (or you tried to sneak in when you were still underage) so you could giggle with your friends. This is that place that usually has a random creepy abduction\/rape van parked out front.\n\nIt gives off a dirty vibe. The dirty porn store. Driving by, you'll think it's just a cesspool of filth. Actually though, inside it's one of the nicer porn stores in the valley. I've been in here three times in my life... once when I was 18 or 19 with some friends, once in my early 20s with a girlfriend, and tonight with a friend. They always seem to keep this place pretty clean, and the staff has always been friendly. \n\nTheir selection of stuff seems pretty average. It's a small store, so don't expect to find some rare item. Just your standard assortment of porn and toys and lube and stuff. They do make good use of the space they have though. This place also has jerk rooms where I guess you can go watch porn and masturbate... I can't imagine using one of these rooms, but to each his own. \n\nBy the way, I don't know how I ended up writing so many reviews about porn stores and strip clubs... the amount of reviews is disproportionate to the amount of my patronage. Maybe one of these days I'll actually buy something.
