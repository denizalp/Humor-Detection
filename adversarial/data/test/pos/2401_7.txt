This was terrible!!! We walked up & there were at least thirty people in line & ONE person \"working\/leaning\" at the counter. We walked up & immediately got out of line & on our phones & decided the money we were saving was just not worth the wait. We went to Hertz were we are gold members & paid the same level of car but got upgraded for free for $60\/day instead of $25. Considering we were only staying three days that was a no brainer! I bet we were in our car before he was finished with his current customer & I'm not exaggerating!
