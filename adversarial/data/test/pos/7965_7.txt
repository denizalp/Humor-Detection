Came here since we heard good things about their other location.\n\nWe tried their West Coast Waffle and the Elvis one...the filling in the west coast one was good, as was the Elvis, but the one  thing I didn't care for was both of the waffles...spongy texture with barely any crispness. I like waffles with a  crispy exterior and a sft interior and this was like eating a pancake in waffle form.\n\nThe Snickers coffee drink we ordered didn't taste that great either. Very artificial tasting...The Churro waffle was okay too. Service was another issue...wrong things were sent to our table,  and when our food arrived,  there was no silverware down which took a while to get as well.\n\nSo-so first visit with a possible chance of returning.  ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter: \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  3
