I know.  Three stars for Thomas Keller?!  I wish it wasn't so, but this brunch was a bust. (Sad face).\n \nWe ordered:\nFrench Toast- Bread pudding style with brioche, custard & apples. My teeth hurt right now just thinking about how sweet it was. It was gorgeous, but the portion was tiny.  It made me feel like a giant.\n \nBeignets- worst decision of day. They were burnt, hard, and tasted terrible. \n \nCroque Madame- Ham & cheese on brioche with a fried egg, mornay sauce & fries. Done right.\n \nEggs and bacon- well, they were eggs and bacon.  No complaints here.\n \nThe service was ok. There were moments our server was MIA, but at the times she was there, she was pleasant and very helpful.  The saving grace for me was their pastries, namely, their croissants.  If I would have only had coffee and a basket of croissants (all to myself), this would have had 5 stars written all over it.  Maybe we should have gone the chicken waffle route.  I won't give up on Bouchon and if I make it out to the Beverly Hills location, hopefully they will redeem their sacred name.
