This review is for the lunch I had here...are you ready...craft beer & burgers. Yep. This place is awesome!!! I wish the Whole Foods where I live had this. Got a NoDa Jam Session, very nice!!! and some homemade chips from Barrel Burgers...oh they were so good, not greasy, the portion is huge but yes I did manage to eat all of them :) you know I love my fried potatos!!! You can sit at the counter and the store has tables you can use. I didnt actually shop there but I love Whole Foods anyway. Just awesome!
