4.5 Stars. We came here for the soup dumplings and were not disappointed. Generally, at other restaurants, we prefer the regular soup dumplings w\/ pork only. I must say, however, that the soup dumplings with crab & pork are one of the most memorable ones that I've had, so those are the ones we re-ordered. Additionally, we had the snow pea tips and beef noodle soup which were nicely done. Will definitely come back when I'm in town. Service was at times slow, but it is about what you would expect.
