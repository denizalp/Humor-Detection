This is a fabulous park with, yes, majestic views of the valley.  I discovered it recently by accident after cycling in the neighborhood, trying to avoid the traffic going downhill Cheyenne after I rode it uphill to get some carbs at my favorite doughnut shop.  The park is located at Alexander and Hualapai Way, but basically takes up the block from Alexander to Gowan.  There are several baseball fields as well as playgrounds and a walking\/running trail. \n\n*Training tip for cyclists\/runners\/walkers who want some hills:  Start as far east as you want, e.g. Cimarron, Buffalo, Durango, and go west, my friends. Gowan Rd. has well-marked bike lanes for you to travel on and the park's views when you get to the top are worth it.
