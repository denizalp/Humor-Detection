Reviewing a university is difficult; one must consider academic ranking, location, professors, curriculum, everything. I attended Carnegie Mellon for my undergraduate studies and graduated with a B.S. in ECE, and honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nThis was definitely the best and worst four years of my life. In the end, all was worth it. I am now very happy in the DC area, and I can only thank CMU for allowing me to get here. I not only grew up and matured here, but I was forced to adjust my study habits and grow stronger academically. The challenges I faced in my major far surpassed any of struggles I had thought were oh so important back in high school. I met some of the best people I have ever met here at Carnegie Mellon, and I can safely say that these people will be my best friends for life.\n\nI had very mixed feelings initially about going to Pittsburgh. I am a Jersey boy at heart, and Pittsburgh was not only far, but just different. At the end of the day, I am very happy to have experienced a different location, a different culture, a completely different lifestyle. Pittsburgh taught me to face certain social challenges and to learn to be the better man (being an Asian American from a heavy Asian population in New Jersey, racism was not as prevalent as it was in Pittsburgh). \n\nI can simply say, attend Carnegie Mellon because the academic studies here are top tier. However, Yelp should not be the first place to look. In fact, I would never imagine to look to Yelp for reviews. Yelp does provide a very casual atmosphere, though, one that won't change the game, but simply allow you to have that small nod of approval. \n\nCarnegie Mellon gets five stars from me. I would give it more if I could. It changed my life.
