Woo Che is one of the many choices you have in town when it comes to all-you-can-eat gluttony.\n\nThey have a pretty killer spread here of Items you can choose to bring back and grill at your table, but if you're the type that just likes to scarf down food and not have to wait for it to cook, then they have a variety of cooked items here as well.\n\nAs other reviews mention, service here can be spotty at times, and do not come in here all dressed up for a night on the town because the food smells will permeate your clothes (and hair) its not even funny...ALOHA!!!\n\nYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(311\/365) \"Smell-o-vision....See, taste, and SMELL!!!\"
