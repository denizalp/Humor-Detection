Absolutely amazing.  This was a recommendation by two friends as I headed into Montreal for weekend getaway. We didn't realize the reservations were a must but were very lucky that the hostess was able to seat us for a table for 3 on a Saturday night. Total fluke. Great atmosphere and a gorgeous summer night in April. The resaurant's front was completely opened which allowed light breeze and created a lovely backdrop for dinner. It's a quality restaurant that could easily be pretentious but doesn't carry itself to be that way at all. \n\nAs recommended by bloggers and yelp reviews, foie gras poutine and duck in a can were a must. Sometimes you wonder if it's hype or buzz  but truly this is so worth it. Foie gras poutine - thick cut fries, foie gras, cheese curds and gravy. Best poutine EVER! The flavour of each of these ingredients stands out on it's own but compliment each other well. I've been trying to go dairy free; it's moments like this where I realize how much I love cheese and where I kick myself for giving it up. It's an appetizer, so a smaller portion; great for sharing. Makes sense though given the generosity of the entree portions. My two girlfriends' ordered starter salads and were dismayed at how big they were.\n\nDUCK-IN-A-CAN gets a paragraph for itself. Duck is my favourite and cooking it in a can was the best thing that could have happened to it. Picture a generous portion of duck breast with its fatty skin in a can. It keeps all of its flavour and fatty juices contained, also soaking up the flavours from cabbage, foie gras, thyme and sauces. They bring it out and open the can at your table, pouring it over toasted bread and mashed potatoes. It sounds simple, but it's anything but. I don't even think I participated in conversation for about 10-15 minutes. My friends were talking to me and I was in hazy bliss.\n\nI cannot express how much I enjoyed this meal and how devasted I was when something so yummy had to end. As I stated that night, I could have gone for a second round of duck in a can.\n\nNext time I go to Montreal, I will be making a reservation immediately after I book my plane ticket.
