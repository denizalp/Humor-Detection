worst thrift store experience ever.\n\nThis place has almost nothing for men, it had a a rack of good suits, except you have to buy 2, or 3 piece suits, they wont let you buy single parts. They have one rack for mens shirts one rack for mens sweaters and one rack for mens pants. There are absolutely no mens jeans to be found in the store though. \n\nThe clothing racks I mentioned above all there is in the way of mens clothing, the womens clothing wasn't much better either. This store has absolutely nothing to offer for men, slightly more for women. it would be much more worth it to go to the value village on bloor west, or on queen street - they may be farther but they are far, far better than this terrible goodwill.\n\nApart from the awful selection was the abysmal service, every single one of the employees there was an asshole. If I asked a question I got a condescending stare and a smart ass answer relayed to me in broken English, it felt more like I was in detention than shopping. \n\nIn addition to this, most of the employees stood around not in uniform talking to each other blocking the way for the customers, when my friend asked one of them to move she got an eye-roll and a \"MHHHHMMHHH\" response,\n\nI have gotten better service from bored, ungrateful lazy teenagers doing community service, most of the people working at this goodwill were at least 40 years old. I guess no one else would hire them, I certainly wouldn't.\n\nto conclude this store has probably the worst service I have ever experienced combined with a pathetic inventory (I know they constantly get good stuff but there was only 3-4 racks of mens clothing, pathetic).\n\nI may go back there if I ever need a good suit (about the only thing they did right) but for everything else, I will be going to value village instead.\n\nthis particular location should go die in a fire
