Dumbest place ever - I ordered a coffee to go, because I don't like their mugs.  The girl behind the counter said she can't give me the wifi password because I am not buying a drink for here.\n\nDUMBEST LOGIC EVER - If I am going to drinking my coffee else where, WHY WOULD I NEED THE WIFI PASSWORD.  She kept saying it's a rule.  Um...why don't you just come by every 5 mins to see if I am still here.  \n\nThe coffee also is terrible.  JUST TERRIBLE for the it's price.
