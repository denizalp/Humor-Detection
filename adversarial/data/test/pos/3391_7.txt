Oh, Big Lots, you're an interesting character. \n\nOk, I won't hate, I love Big Lots. I never been to this one before but checked it out today in an effort to mix it up and pay cheaper sales tax. They had a great selection of foods---lots of Kashi items for under $3, Paula Deen baking mixes and almond milk--who knew they had that kind of stuff at Big Lots? Be sure to check the expiration date on everything when you go to Big Lots as a lot of the items can be near expiration though! \n\nThis was a pretty clean Big Lots for the most part with a plethora of people of all walks of life. They have tons of Valentine's Day and St Patricks Day stuff out and if you need to buy your lady something spicy, they have Valentine's Day lingerie there-who knew? However, I feel like a $5 bra or $2 pair of panties won't keep too long but there is an option if you're looking for last minute saucy V-Day gifts. I had a wonderful experience today where a random man stopped to ask me my bra size because I looked like his wife \"up there\" Good times. \n\nBig Lots also now has a rewards program that allows you to get 20% off of future purchases after making 10 consecutive $20 or more purchases. All in all, just another Big Lots but I don't think I will be going here at night.
