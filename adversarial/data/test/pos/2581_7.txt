I thought after moving away from my much beloved Cow Canyon trail in Reno that I would never find love again when it came to a place for my tires to make sweet, sweet land love to the ground as my able yet corpulent body pushed the pedals in a perpetual parade of circles intending to thrust me further along Mother Earth's toasty flesh.\n\nAnd then I found the McDowell Mountain loops.\n\n\"You unlock this door with the key of imagination. Beyond it is another dimension - a dimension of sound, a dimension of sight, a dimension of mind. You're moving into a land of both shadow and substance, of things and ideas. You've just crossed over into the Twilight Zone....\" \n\nWell, to paraphrase, you've just crossed over into the technical and sport loops at McDowell Mountain Park.\n\nUndulating ribbons of tasty desert single track, each folding seamlessly into the next, as if some sort of madman or mad genius came out with his shovel and designed a desert Twilight Zone for people like me to play with our bikes on. The trail starts with \"not a walking trail, this is a high speed loop\" to keep dog walkers, puttering senior citizens, idiots of the Birkenstock walking ilk, and families with quad wide strollers off of the trail and out of the unrelenting path of a man on his Yeti hell bent on a dirt roller coaster ride, damn the consequences or the victims!\n\nYea, its that good. Finger licking, make you wanna slap your momma and your grandmomma good. Good enough to name your first child after the trail, and then to leave the delivery room immediately after his\/her birth because you remembered you promised your one true love, your bike, some quality Terra toboggan time. Damn family, professional, personal or any other interests and their needs, your bike needs to come first, and it needs to come first out at McDowell Mountain.\n\nIts $6 to get in, and its worth every penny. There are dirt jumps and a pump track courtesy of GROAZ (http:\/\/groaz.org\/) and a lot of their hard work out there. Bring your DJ and your XC bikes, you can use them all out here.\n\nThis place makes even the toast image of Baby Jesus wanna go for a bike ride, deep in my stomach, with some eggs and hot sauce. He died as breakfast for our sins so we could ride somewhere as great as McDowell.
