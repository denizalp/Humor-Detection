I am a second generation Garcia's Las Avenidas patron, as my folks frequented the little taco stand down the street that started the whole thing. I swear instead of a pacifier, my mom put a Garcia's shredded beef taco in my mouth, and its been love ever since.\n\nThis is hands down one of my favorite places to get Mexican food and I love that the family has stuck to their roots even as the neighborhood has changed drastically over the years. The staff is friendly and consistent (in other words - go often - and you get treated like family).\n\nI would offer up suggestions for the best menu items, but truthfully I LOVE IT ALL.  Everything is made fresh on-site so quality has never been a question. One thing I would add to Kristin's review is that if you are looking for a deal, the prices at the Take Out center are about 1$ cheaper per item. The only down side is that you can't order Margaritas to go, so if you want one, drink it down while you are waiting for your order to come up.\n\nSince I live about 10 minutes from the location, I usually hop in my car, hit my speed dial to order, and depending on whether or not there are a lot of cars in the drive thru line, cruise right on in to grab my food and go.  \n\nPortions are pretty large, so if you are ordering a two item combo or one of their dinners, plan on leftovers. But where else can you get two meals with chips & salsa for around 10 to 12 bucks??\n\nOh and did I mention the Fried Ice Cream? Messy as all get out, but OMG is it good!!!
