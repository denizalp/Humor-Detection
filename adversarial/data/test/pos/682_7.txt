The worst customer service for billing issues I have ever encountered. I apparently spoke to the manager of financial services \/ billing about a insurance co-pay problem and she was extremely disrespectful and condescending. As a healthcare professional in Las Vegas who works in the Sunrise Emergency Department, I have never encountered a more short tempered person over the phone! Decent human respect and customer care is a must in health care even when dealing with financial logistics. They seriously need to reconsider their staff and more importantly their leadership. \n\nPlease do yourself a favor and reconsider this location as your primary care!!
