Prime example of a restaurant\/bar whose management doesn't understand its customers.  From slow service to overcharging, I've been there twice now and both times had what I consider ridiculously bad experiences.   \n\nThe management's answer to everything is to cancel out the bill, but they wont fix any service problems.  When I ask to speak the the GM, I get handed a handwritten note with his email on it.  \n\nProviding good service isn't rocket science.  I'm dumbfounded that they still can't get it together.  \n\nSave your money..give it to another place that values you as a customer.
