I love coffee.\n\nI myself have been waiting for this place to open for a while now. I work less than a mile away. So it is very very convenient. \n\nAs I walked in I was hesitant because everyone looked so occupied doing a specific task that didn't really look like it needed to be done. I walked up to the register unsure of what I wanted, so I asked for suggestions. I love when and employee can suggest something that actually fits my needs. (because I am very picky)\n\nThey serve: wrap, salad, and Panini's \n\nI have never had a wrap because to me its just a burrito with a bunch of stuff that I don't like. \n\nI don't like salads at all.... (sad I know)\n\nI have never tried a Panini so I was kind of excited that it was actually something that I would eat. I ordered the aged cheddar Panini with no mustard. It took approximately 10 minutes served with a pickle and some pepper chips. It was so freaking good I wanted another but, was full by the time I finished half. \n\nI also ordered a vanilla iced latte with lite ice. I have to say that this as well was pretty good. I don't know if I was charged extra for the syrup or not. Hence I didn't get a detailed receipt. \n\nOverall the d√©cor is pretty modern, with like a mountain American type theme. I liked the trunk pieces above the bar, it looks pretty neat. \n\nThere was no Wi-Fi when I went. \nThere was some sort of discrepancy in the lighting. It randomly kept shutting of and on\n\nThey have a gaming area, lounge area, eating, and bar. Plus the outside seating.\nI love it. I will back for more Panini's.
