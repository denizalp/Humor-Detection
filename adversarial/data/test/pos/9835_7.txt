Went back. . Sadly i think. . *sniff fn sniff* fo tha last time!  Wanted birthday nails and had *tha man* Vince, he did good. As in basically. .. if i was a basic chick that could have slid.  But, i was shocked when every design i asked for he told me they didn't do.  I couldn't even get cheetah ding dong prints that someone pictured in their review. Not even a zig zangy zag! I like my nails saucey n i literally got the driest plainest suckest nails. Ive never been to a shop where i left to another shop for a paint job.  On the strength of that they lost me and my homies! Ill be back when im ready to take the spice out my life -_-. Ain't nobody got time fo that!
