My friend and I both got the BBQ pork ramen and let me tell you.... it was by far the best ramen we both experienced in Montreal. Broth was to perfection and not overly salty and heavy like others. The pork was thick and tender without all that unnecessary fat stuck to it. Finished it to the last drop, literally.
