Pizza By Napoli how I love thee.\n\nThis is how I would picture a little mom and pop shop in the big city back east.  Everyone speaking in thick italian accents and the type of people you would love to have as friends.\n\nI always order the large meatball pie and my friends, it fuggin rules.  Thin slices of what you know are a great italian grandmas recipe passed on for generations.  Great mild sauce and thin and crispy crust.  This is in my top 5 pizza joints in AZ falling only to Nellos.\n\nThe dine in experience is a must, old school booths, old school arcade games, sports on the TV.  It reminds me of a time before the 30 minutes or its free delivery craze.  When people would sit down and enjoy a pie right out of the oven.  Even the high chairs are old school and full of metal.\n\nIf you call in take out, remember your assigned number given on the phone.  They'll love you for it.\n\nIn closing, Napoli kicks arse frenz....................
