I really wanted to like this place and the new breed of downtown restaurants like EAT and  Le Thai had me feeling sure that I would.  I liked the look of the place and the idea of resurrecting the the old El Cortez laundry space.  Unfortunately after eating at La Comida I feel like this place was born of a corporate calculation to take quick advantage of the good feelings created by the other more thoughtful efforts to bring good food to downtown.  Our experience wasn't all bad.  The staff was friendly, helpful and were doing their best.  The food, however, was very disappointing.  As several previous posters have mentioned the prices were high but the real problem is what you get for your hard earned money.  I don't mind paying the price for good ingredients and skillful preparations but this food was mediocre at best.  The shrimp ceviche was rubbery and dry, the pork shoulder was tough and lacked flavor, and the Mole was too sweet and covered dry bland chicken enchiladas.   There is also something cynical about places that work hard to give off a cool hole in the wall vibe but charge top dollar.  My rear still hurts from sitting in a recovered folding metal chair and I don't find cheap paper napkins charming when wiping my $7 dollar salsa off my fingers.  Yes the salsa trio was $7 and  surprisingly bland.  Although the restaurant was half full they kept seating the two top that was pretty much touching our table in that always uncomfortable attempt to foster the communal experience that I guess they hope will distract from the food.\n\nI may be a sucker but I am still hopeful that the owners of this place can experience it as their customers do and realize changes must be made.  I really do want to like it.
