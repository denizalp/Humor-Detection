I tried out Mr. Mama's the other day while I was waiting for my car to get tinted.  I was stuck for a few hours in a neighborhood that I wasn't familiar with, so I Yelped for a good lunch place to head to in the neighborhood.  I found Mr. Mama's and was quite pleased!\n\nMy hubby came to pick me up for lunch and we headed over to Mr. Mama's.  We walked in and stood at the front for a few minutes before we were greeted.  We were then told to sit anywhere we wanted too.  We grabbed a table and were greeted by our server pretty quickly.  We ordered and our food came out fast.  My hubby got a Reuben and it was delicious!  I had the chili cheese burger and it was ok.  The burger was awesome but the chili was weird.  I am a chili con carne style chili girl and the chili here was more of the Midwest style of a more tomato-y style.  If I had just gotten a regular cheese burger I think I would have been much happier.  Oh well.  It wasn't bad, just not the style I really like.  Don't get me wrong, I still chowed down on the burger though.\n\nWe finished up our meal with a cinnamon roll that our server recommended.  It was one of the best cinnamon rolls I have ever eaten.  It was a big one and we decided to split it.  Once we started eating it though, I think we both wished we had ordered two so we wouldn't have had to share.  Ha ha!\n\nOverall Mr. Mama's was a good place to eat.  Good solid food, ok service, and a pretty decent menu.  Yum.
