The food was great I order off the chicken enchilada off the lunch menu which included one enchilada refried beans and rice. You can actually see the amount of chicken in the enchilada which was just the right amount.  my sister ordered the super  burrito and it had so much chicken she had to take some of it out. Or about an hour she said she took it out because it was dry (see the picture )
