Lately I've been having a lot of cravings for Caribbean food and this place definitely satisfied them! I got to try some roti, jerk chicken and a plethora of appetizers. Everything here was tasty and cheap. Somebody recommended the dumplings so I tried them and I must say I was very disappointed. I'm not sure if this is common knowledge, but apparently Caribbean dumplings are nothing but fried dough...definitely tasty but not what I was expecting when recommended dumplings!\n\nThe staff is super laid back and friendly, maybe even a little too friendly. While here our food was waiting on the counter to be brought out for nearly 10 minutes while the waitress was chatting up some clear regulars. I enjoy chatty staff but not at the cost of cold food. If you're in Leslieville, give it a shot!
