I don't get Kohl's.\n\nIt reminds me of a really rundown K-Mart. \n\n\nThere's wrinkled clothes everywhere, they are all piled on one another, then there's like 500 things on one sales rack so things are falling off of it. When you try to pull one thing off the rack it's like an avalanche of wrinkled clothes falling on your head.\n\nThey never have decent sizes for me, most people use like a million coupons and I'm always stuck behind them in line, to buy the 1 thing I actually found.  They have high celebrity names that have fashion lines, but every time I go and look it's like the most atrocious things I've ever seen. Should be something you find in RAVE.
