After a wild night at encore beach club with my girls I woke up the next morning with the worse hangover in my entire life, my head was pounding as if there was a little construction worker jack hammering my brain into oblivion I was so nauseous I needed to throw up but couldn't because I was so dehydrated and my body hurt everywhere i decided to call hangover heaven, i heard about them from a few friends so I figured it would be worth it to try, the lady on the phone was really nice and told me they would be there in 15 minutes to pick me up uh...hell yes and sure enough they were , when  I arrived at the clinic the staff were so nice and comforting they told me which package I needed and everything which is good because after the night before I clearly can't be trusted to make my own decisions, my treatment went smooth and everyone was sweet and accommodating I felt really relaxed and comfortable the entire time. I still can't get over how good I felt after my treatment, my body felt a thousand times better than when I arrived ...the staff are actually baby cherubs blessing you with their holiness and taking away all your pain. Best 200 dollars I ever spent this place is AMAZING and really a hangover heaven !!! Thank You!!xoxo
