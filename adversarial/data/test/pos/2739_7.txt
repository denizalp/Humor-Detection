This place disappointed me. I've had my fair share of yogurts, gelato, and  ice cream and this place was really sub par. When you first walk in the place it is nicely decorated and clean. They have a TV and plenty of places to sit both indoor and outdoor. What I'm most disappointed about was their selection of yogurt, or should I say lack there of. The selections they did have just weren't that good. I didn't think there was such a thing as bad frozen yogurt but I guess there is. Yogurt was very bland with no flavor. They do have an assortment of toppings which would have been great on a bowl of good yogurt. Unfortunately, I won't get to try those topping. Definitely won't be coming back. \n\nOnly giving 2 stars. One for the cleanliness and decor of the store and one for the assortment of toppings.
