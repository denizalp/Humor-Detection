Yum, yum, yummy, yum, yum!\n\nYeah, that about sums it up when it comes to Kathy's Southern Cooking.  \n\nI was hanging out at my mom's and we wanted something different for lunch.  Enter Yelp and it's awesome suggestions, which is how we found out about Kathy's Southern Cooking.  After seeing the pictures of the food, I knew we had to get there right away!\n\nWe went for a lunch on a Saturday and were the only ones in the place.  At first I was a little worried because I was hoping we didn't make a mistake in going to Kathy's.  Then I got my glass of sweet tea and I knew we had made the right choice.  A great southern cooking place has to have great sweet tea, otherwise what's the point?  It turned out to be a treat to have the place to ourselves because 1. my toddler daughter wouldn't bother anyone, and 2. the lady working the counter (sadly, I can't remember her name) was a doll and we had so much fun chit-chatting with her through our time there.  She really made our experience great from her lovely personality and excellent service.\n\nNow to the important part.....The food!  We are a southern family and wanted some of our go-to comfort foods, fried chicken and fried catfish.    The fried chicken was just like the chicken we used to get in Tennessee at my grandma's dinner table.  The catfish tasted like the catfish from Mississippi and my childhood.  My mom swears that the catfish is the best she has eaten outside of the South.  I can't argue with that statement because it was YUMMY.  \n\nWe also ordered the mashed potatoes, mac n' cheese, red beans & rice, and fries as side items.  Everything was amazing! The highlights had to be the real mashed potatoes with gravy made to order and the gooey mac n' cheese.  Everything was good, but those were both REALLY good.\n\nWe finished our meal with Banana Pudding.  It was delicious!  My mom decided she is never making banana pudding again and will just order it from Kathy's from here on out.  I'm ok with that.  I just want my banana pudding please!
