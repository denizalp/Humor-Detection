Wow, is all I can say (very positively). From the above and beyond customer service, to the awesome food and extremely welcoming atmosphere (as well as a dog friendly patio)  this place is a serious force to be reckoned with. A bar it is, a restaurant, damn, they have that down too, service...stellar. \n\nI came here with my work buddy for a late lunch, we walked in and were greeted immediately by a very friendly hostess. She was getting ready to seat us when two barstools at the bar opened up. We asked for those instead, she was kind and said \"go right ahead\". We were greeeted at the bar by a very nice, pretty bartender. She got us drinks immediately and handed us menus. We ordered food, my co-worker got boneless wings and fries, the amount of food he got was insane! The boneless wings were giant, not dry inside, crispy out and an abundenet amount of sauce. The fries were equally excellent. He ordered hot for the wings, they could have been hotter but they were still basically perfect. Unfortunately my food didn't come out, lol. The super sweet bartender came over and apologized and stated they made my salad...with no chicken. I said \"no worries\" :) she ran to the back.... I just kept drinking my drink and chatting. \n\nHere is where shit gets real, an attractive tattooed gentleman brings out my salad after my co-worker is done eating and apologizes that my salad was not made, they messed up and this guy was owning it. I like that. I didn't want, nor ask for anything for free....he just offered since they made a mistake. He comped our drinks, comped my cajun chicken Caesar salad and that was how it was handled, professional. My salad by the way was awesome. The chicken was cooked perfectly, super moist and the cajun flavoring was excellent. I know all I got was a damn caeser salad but it was damn good. I want a lot more of their food, this place is so cool and such awesomely staffed employees definitely added to an impacting experience. I am moving about a block away I now know where I can enjoy a cold one and a great meal with awesome staff after work. Thank you!!!
