I visited The Mirage for a business thing in June of 2017. I stayed in a resort tower king on the 24th floor. \n\nFirst of all. The upgrade was worth it. I had a great view of the strip and the pool. The bathroom with dual sinks was nice, as was the private elevator, that saved a lot of time. \n\nThe more I travel, the more I appreciate a clean hotel room. Housekeeping did a great job during my stay. I would like more towels though. They provide you with three fresh bath towels when they clean the room, but between business meetings, trips to the pool, and going out at night I burn though some towels. \n\nLike all hotels, the toilet paper is disappointing. There's a Walgreens and a CVS nearby. Get some Gatorade while you're at it. It's dry in Vegas.\n\nRoom service was great! They bring your food all packaged up in a big carryout bag and they don't add a gratuity, so be sure to tip your delivery person. I like the rolling cart\/table thing that you get when you order room service in nice hotels, but the carryout bag setup makes a lot of sense and I liked it. The regular American breakfast was enough food for my companion and me. I thought the breakfast potatoes and the hot wings were especially good. This room service kitchen knows their audience. \n\nI got carryout from the California Pizza Kitchen a couple times and the crew there is terrific. They make great salads. I always try to get my veggies when I'm out west because they're so fresh and delicious.\n\nI don't gamble so I can't comment on the casino, but I did ask a blackjack dealer directions one time and she was very friendly and helpful.\n\nThe convention facilities were very convenient to the guest elevators with a coffee shop in between. The Mirage knows their audience.\n\nThey allow smoking in the casino which taints everything it touches and prevents me from giving five stars.\n\nI wouldn't travel to Vegas on my own money, but The Mirage was a lovely stay. Four stars.
