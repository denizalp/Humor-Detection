LV Steak House with bad L.A. Attitude!\n\nI would have given this place a higher rating if it weren't for the AWFUL service  and SNOBBISH attitude we received from the blonde hostess when we walked in!  If I wanted to be treated terribly, I would have stayed home and dined at \"Mastro's\" in Beverly Hills.  Take my advice guys, dine else where!  There are plenty of better steak houses in LV that will treat you like a human being!  \n\nI have always wanted to try this steak house but always dine across the street at Binion's Ranch.  But this trip I had a party of 5 that I needed to entertain and they have all been to Binion's, so we decided to try a new place and Vic & Anthony's was the choice.  I booked the dinner reservation about a month in advance for a WEDNESDAY night when I knew they would NOT be busy, however when I arrived EARLY for our reservation, I was immediately greeted by a RUDE, OBNOXIOUS, SNOBBISH, L.A. wanna be little blonde starlet who treated me awful and refused to give me any service or grant me the option to seat us at a comfortable round table!  Her response?.....oh, sorry sir, the round tables are RESERVED!  We can only seat you where we can seat you!  (This was coming out of her mouth at 7:30pm on a Wednesday night with a total of 2 parties dining in the entire restaurant and probably only 5 reservations for that night!  What a joke) and by the way, the round tables were available the ENTIRE NIGHT we were there!  4 hours and $860.00 later, I left Vic & Anthony's with a bitter taste in my mouth but not from the meal, it was from the blonde hostess who's unwelcoming attitude will assure that I never return to this restaurant and discourage others from dining here as well.  \n\nThe Bottom Line:\nAwful rude service from the front, an extra salty steak that isn't great (but good), but surprisingly; probably one of the best Veal cuts one could ever taste! \n\"Try the Veal, it's one of the best in the city\" - Godfather\n\nEnjoy!
