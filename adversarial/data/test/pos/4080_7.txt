We came came for a schmoozing from a corporate client. It worked. \n\nWe had the Mediterranean Calamari for apps. They were really good, I like the deep fried artichoke. \n\nI had lobster bisque, it was really creamy and had great flavor. \n\nThe lunch was a halibut fillet sandwich and dirty rice. The rice was perfectly seasoned and fluffy. The halibut was cooked perfectly and was a very nice size. It was flaky and not dry at all. \n\nThe building was really neat, I think a nice outside happy hour would be great in mid to late October. \n\nThe service was perfect, not over pretentious or up on you the whole time.
