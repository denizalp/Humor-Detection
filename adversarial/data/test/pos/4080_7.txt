A great church community. Especially for kids, young adult and families. LWA have so many services from young adult ministry, kids ministry, bible studies to marriage counseling. They have cafe that has a really great ambiance and special breakfast every sunday only $5. The child service is awesome. They have a great volunteers that will take care your kids during the service. I love this church so much. Definitely a place to grow.
