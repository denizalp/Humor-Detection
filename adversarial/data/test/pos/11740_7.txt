Money talks. And where I spend my money, I talk about it on Yelp. Even if it is for a $1.50 Tuesday fish taco special. \n\n  This Rubios is located in the Pebble Marketplace, which is the Smith's-anchored shopping center off Green Valley Parkway immediately north of the I-215 exit. It sits in the far northwest corner of the shopping center where it shares a patio with Starbuck's. With the corner facing windows and outdoor seating, it is an appropriate restaurant to experience the Vegas sunshine. \n\n  Between a hard days work and a cup of coffee before shopping in Smith's, the $1.50 Tuesday fish Taco special is a rewarding weekday treat. When I walk in the door, friendly employees including Vivian will greet me before taking my order. They will give me a water cup (immediately after I will be drinking a Starbuck's beverage) when I order the fish taco, a few minutes later deliver the taco to my table, then check up on me. Whenever they deliver a fish taco to my table, it has been tasty and filling. The toppings station is advantageous to the fish taco experience. There are all kinds of sauces including pacante plus peppers that you could place in a small cup or directly to the taco.\n\n   After many Tuesdays spending  only $1.50 on a quality fish taco with a water cup served by friendly people, I talk good about Rubio's on Yelp. This is a  special that will brighten up a Tuesday.
