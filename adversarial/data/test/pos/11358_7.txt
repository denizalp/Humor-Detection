TGP is perfect for those evenings when nothing sounds good and I don't want to cook. I like the  buffalo-garlic parm and spicy barbecue wings (or strips!) with bleu cheese or an Italian cheese steak, add mushrooms.\n\nStaff is friendly, shop is messy and lacks ambiance but the cook throws his heart and soul into the food. The chicken strips are good sized, long and skinny and crispy- but all the sauces are off the chain! Buffalo garlic parm is the favorite, but spicy barbeque is tasty as well. Bleu cheese dressing is fresh made in-house with chunks of actual cheese.\n\nThat Italian Cheese Steak has plentiful rib eye, peppers, and onions, topped with high quality melted provolone and a good amount of mushrooms (for a minor surcharge). Bread is good and though a bit soggy, held up without falling apart.\n\nThis a regular pick-up stop during football season. The pizza is pretty solid, but as detailed above, I actually prefer their other menu offerings.
