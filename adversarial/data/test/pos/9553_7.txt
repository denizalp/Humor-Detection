My niece had her birthday party here and honestly the idea was great but overall it was not worth the amount of money that was spent. \n\nWe were taken to the party room pretty quickly which was great. We only have limited Time to spend in the room and also to have fun with the games and rides, our time was from 8-11pm. Once we leave the party room and start up our game cards we can not re-enter the party room which is a bummer. The 3 girls that were helping us had no clue what they were doing. They did not even know how to work the radio which took time from playing the \"games\" that were chosen for the kids to play.\n\nOnce we got out to the arcade area and the kids received their game cards. They went crazy and of course, as kids that they are, couple of them lost their card. Their game card system should be reevaluated because.. Once we told a worker it was lost, they blindly deactivated a card that \"might have\" been the one that was lost but not 100% sure. He just deactivated the one that was used on the last ride it was used on BUT a few of the kids were also on that ride too! The one that got deactivated was actually the BIRTHDAY GIRL'S! So a suggestion, have the cards be specifically named for the person not just card 1, 2 or 3. \n\nThe buffet portion of the restaurant is pretty awesome. They have different types of pizza, pasta, salads, lots of desserts. Also they have Icee for the kids which is pretty cool. They also have alcohol for the big kids lol. That gets a star for sure.\n\nI still can't believe where this place is located is where Dillard's used to be!
