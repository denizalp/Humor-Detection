Ordinarily I have good service from National and even great in some locations, especially given that I'm executive aisle and can also choose from emerald aisle cars.  However, not only did they not have any cars for executive and emerald aisle, they had several people waiting in line for cars.  So, I had to go to the counter and then get directed to the regular cars, which I had a few to choose from but nothing too special.
