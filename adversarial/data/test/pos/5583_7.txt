Stayed at the Encore and absolutelly loved it!!!  Went to Vegas 8 weeks later and decided to stay at Wynn because thought  it was a step above Encore.  NO. !!!\n\nWhen i checked in receptionist acted like i was buying a car or a house.  Was there for 30 minutes while she was doing her computer work.  Than had to charge 300 to my card temporarly for the room. WTF?  Ive never had to go thru this with any hotel ive ever checked in.  Very stressfull experience.  Hello- welcome to the Wynn.\n\nThe room was not anything big at all.  Check out day they made us leave the room right a noon. Came knocking at the door.  I have never had to leave a room right a noon.  \n\nWill never stay at the Wynn again!!!
