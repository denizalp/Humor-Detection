This place has gone way downhill. Went opening week and it was descent enough to return. Long story short... we won't be returning for their bland, tasteless food that has been sitting out for hours or the filthy booths. Best to be avoided IMHO.\n\n* The owner also has chosen illegal blocking of a handicapped parking place with a orange cone in front of their business and should be reported to the City of Las Vegas.\n\nAny questions regarding the enforcement of handicap accessible parking spaces or the proper posting of spaces may be directed to the Parking Enforcement Unit at (702) 229-643
