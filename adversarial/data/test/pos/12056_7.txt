Terrible!! Why do these half assed clinics even bother existing. \n\nFirst impression: weird entrance, as you have to go down a set of stairs, that go directly into a dead wall, full of condoms. They tried to build floor to ceiling shelves, that ended up looking like a grade 8 wood working project. It also doesn't help that they have basically no inventory, so there are literally just a few strategically spaced items on each shelf, that are already gathering dust. The inventory of this 'pharmacy' is beyond poor. You could find more pharmaceutical drugs on the homeless dudes hanging out outside the door. \n\nWalk-in clinic? Whaaaaat?! \nYou're greeting by a computer monitor. And about 6 different posters, all saying different things:\n'CHECK IN HERE'\n\"CHECK IN WITH PHARMACIST\"\n\"2 HOUR WAIT\" .. \n\"MUST HAVE VALID HEALTH CARD WITH MATCHING TELEPHONE #' ... \n\nIt was just a table with a monitor and a clusterfuck of posters taped all over the table, monitor and walls. \nI didn't even SEE a physical doctor in this place. No one walking around with a clip board. Nothing. \n\nSelf check in would be awesome if the computer worked. Need assistance? Hahahaha sorry! You're shit outta luck. \nThe only help is with the \"pharmacist\" and he's busy chatting on his cell phone, with his back facing the cash.  \n\nWhat the hell is this!?!\nMaaaaan, this place made me angry.\n\nNever again.  Don't make the mistake by even walking in. I ended up walking out, and going down to the nasty clinic at Spadina \/Queen (and waited 20 min to be seen). Should have done that from the beginning!
