I've been a @HiltonHHonors member for years and in my opinion they are one of the better loyalty programs.\n\nIf you want to have a grand vacation in Vegas, the Grand Vacations Suites may be your place.  If you prefer not to be in a casino, where you have to wander through crowds of smoky, smelly humanity to get to the strip, I recommend this hotel.\n\nIt is a bit removed from the heart of the strip so grab a cab or spring for the double-decker bus deal and ride where you wanna go.\n\nSolid, comfy, nice.  When you want a nice place to stay, not just a place to crash after you stagger in from your Vegas bender.
