The place is cute.  I came here to enjoy a stiff drink after dealing with all the nut jobs at True Foods Kitchen.  The place is dark and sexy and a great place if you want to continue a date and get all sorts of romantical.  The bartender makes a pretty good gimlet and an amazing dirty martini.  Where's the Stoli though?  A little sad about that.\n\nI know this is a weird thing to comment on, but I love their water.  It's a huge turnoff for me when restaurants serve water that tastes like metal, but this place had water that tasted like SmartWater.  I really enjoyed that.\n\nThis isn't a five star joint because of the redic reserved tables on a Wednesday night.  And it was reserved for a gaggle of \"Woo!\" girls who would not stop taking blinding pictures!
