Place that repairs games..? yeah, i guess.\n\nMore like a place where you can sell new and used games. A place where you can play a couple really old school arcade games. A shop that delivers when it comes to trying to find the old game consoles or the brand new ones too.\n\nFantastic over the top service. I know nothing about games and he talked to me as if i was a genius. He explained everything and what the differences were. I could tell he was one of those geeky guys. Hell, better for me. I was there to buy my hubby the original game console. Shoot i already forgot what it was called. . but doesnt matter the guy new :) Everything is well maintained and looks brand new, whether it is or not. I was surprised about how small the shop is but in the end it really does have everything you need. \n\nWas goingt o buy the single player but he told me it was only a 5 dollar difference to upgrade to the twin so i did. It came to 50 bucks. Cheap! i had looked online and couldnt find it cheaper than 75 for a single. He also made sure to put the warranty in my husbands name so that if he came back it would be easier. The consoles warranty was for a year. \n\nI've been to many other game repair shops and always seemed like they were ghetto and unsuccessful at getting my hubby excited. When we passed this shop a couple months ago my husband was jumping for joy. This place is amazing and i cant wait to come back and buy some more \"guy\" game stuff from him.
