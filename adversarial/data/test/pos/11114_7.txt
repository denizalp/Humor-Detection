Tom Yum Goong is my favorite Thai soup. The ones I have tried at the last few Thai restaurants were not satisfying or just disappointing. When I saw that they have Tom Yum seafood noodle, I was intrigued since I haven't had it with noodles and seafood other than shrimp before. \n\nThey have an option of four different noodles. I chose the flat, wide rice noodles. The broth was so satisfying and flavorful. I went with spice level 5 which turned out to be just the right spice level. I loved it with the noodles, fish cakes, squid, etc. After I finished my soup, I already knew I would be back for this delicious, hearty, satisfying soup.
