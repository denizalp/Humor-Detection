Nice solid arena! \n\nFrom memory I have seen a concert which was called \"Old School Freestyle Explosion\" which is basically all 80's and 90's pop R n B bands. Ok, I grew up in the 80's. Judge me all you want. I have also seen a Mythbusters interactive show special with my kids along with a Sesame Street Dance Show just recently which was the most boring thing ever. At least my kids had fun. Thats what it was for right? The kids.\n\nPlenty of parking and making your way to the arena is a breeze as well leaving is just as easy. Maybe its because it is not located directly on the strip. Compared to other arenas in the Vegas area I would say this ranks #1 with the Mandalay Events Center a close second. Worst ever would be the MGM Grand Arena. Refer to my review.\n\nSound and lighting has been on point from all the times I have gone here. Just about anywhere you sit is a good view. Love the stadium style seating. Even the bathrooms are easy access.\n\nOf course the only negative things if there were such a thing would be the overpriced concessions but if you ask me that is normal at any stadium or arena. Just eat a good meal before coming here and you are set.\n\nOverall, any time I find out there is a show that interests me and it just happens to be at the Orleans Arena makes my decision to buy those tickets even sweeter.\n\nYelp 2015 #41\n540 overall
