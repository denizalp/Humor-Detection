I take into account that this is McDonalds, I really do, but this one might be one of the worst I've ever been to. This is right near my house and since I get off work pretty late, there isn't many places open for me to grab food quickly. I've gone through the drive thru on a few separate occasions thinking to myself, \"This HAD to be a fluke! They must be having a bad day, maybe next time!\" No. EVERY TIME. \n\nOn tonight's particular trip I ordered a regular two cheese burger meal and two orders of apple pie, but first asking to make sure they had apple pie ready to go (I've made that mistake once before). They stated that they had it, I drove up to the first window and paid. Second window, a manager pops his head out stating they don't have apple pies (even though they stated they did) and asks me to pick something else. Unfortunately, I don't want anything else and although the refund for two apple pies, give or take, is $1.38, I ask for a refund. He again asks me to order something else instead. No thank you, I wanted Apple pies, I don't wish to order anything else in their place. He comes back with my refund and says goodbye. Wait?!? My food!! He says he cancelled it because I didn't want anything else!! WHAT?!?! \n\nNever. Ever. Again. This is why I don't eat fast food!! Ugh!!
