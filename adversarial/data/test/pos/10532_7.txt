OMG - now this is what comfort food should be!\n\nComing from out of town, I heard about Beckett's opening a few weeks ago and was thrilled to get to try it on this trip... it did not disappoint!  (Wish I could export you to Vancouver so you can help out our resto who attempted the gourmet comfort menu but without the skill of this!)\n\nService is excellent!\n\nEverything on the menu we had was divine... the bread service is excellent.  You must get the cheese and sundried tomato bread.  So good!  For appies, the grilled cheesewith pancetta and fire roasted pepper soup is fabulous.  I had the salad which is incredibly fresh and well-done, but I would definitely get the more unique items.\n\nThe mains are equally fabulous.  I LOVED my short ribs - they were flavorful, fork-tender and the sides were amazing.  Hubby's stew was a bit spicy for me but very tasty.\n\nThe only minor downside to the place is that they need a bit of work on guestimating the food quantities... we were getting to dessert around  8pm and had our hearts set on the Death By Chocolate, but were told it had run out for the evening... who runs out of dessert?  Anyway, that's really the only con and I suppose it's saved me some calories for the next time I'm back :)
