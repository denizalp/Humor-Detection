Can't really write much of a review....I arrived 5 minutes late so they wouldn't see me!\n\nI had booked an appointment a few weeks in advance for niggling foot pain.   The earliest appointment was 2 weeks after I emailed but my problem wasn't urgent so that didn't bother me.  The pleasant woman I emailed said the appointment would last 15-30mins and was covered by OHIP.  Sounded good!\n\nThe appointment was a work day. It was \"one of those days\" and I left work later than expected for the appointment.  Got there as quickly as possible (after swirling around wildly in 11 King West and being directed downstairs) and apologised at the desk.  The receptionist said she'd ask the doctor if he'd still see me.  She came back a moment later and said no.  He had appointments every 10mins so I'd have to be rescheduled.  Next appointment another 3 weeks away.  I didn't bother.\n\nI understand that I was late.  That's my fault.  I'd hate somebody else to be delayed because of that.  I also understand that the healthcare system is overloaded.  However, I think 10 minutes for a first appointment is inappropriate.  I simply don't think it's enough time to take a full history and perform a detailed examination.  Great sports physicians will want to know history, hear about activites and get some idea of your biomechanics as well as just looking at the sore spot.  Review appointment?  10 mins is plenty.  But new patients deserve longer.\n\nThere are physiotherapists etc in the clinic too, so maybe you'd have better luck just heading to them.  Or arrive early and know what's wrong with you already.
