The driver 4230 is a dangerous driver. He cut me off and almost side swipe me too. Just because he didn't want to be behind a slow driver. He didn't use his turning signal either. I would never use this company since their drivers are so rude and dangerous to other drivers on the road. What right does he have to cut off other drivers? Never use Desert Cab driver 4230. Cab drivers do not own the roads, we all have to share the road so it safe to drive.
