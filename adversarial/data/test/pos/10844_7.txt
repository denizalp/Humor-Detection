Ahhh. Well. \nMy boyfriend and I went in with big expectations. We saw the beer list and menu and it seemed great. \nWell, the beer ended up being the only redeeming quality. \nAfter ordering drinks we asked for a few minutes to look over the menu... No one returned for around 20 minutes. \nWe ordered fried pickles for an app but were told a few minutes later they were out of them... Forgivable. We ordered Mac and cheese bites instead-- incredibly bland... Not very cheesy and 0 flavor. For my meal, I ordered the wedge salad... Listed as being served with pork belly and pickled red onions. Well... It came out (45 minutes after we ordered...on a slowish Sunday night) with what appeared to be crumbled bacon bits.\nI asked the server and she said \"oh. Sorry. It's bacon today and not pork belly\" and immediately walked away. Would have been nice to know before ordering. Also, the pickled red onion was just fried onion straw things. Salad had no substance. My boyfriend ordered the fun guy burger and even though they didn't ask how he wanted the burger done it came scorched a charred. From what he said it was also very dry and very flavorless. There was supposed to be some crazy kind of mushroom on it too but it really only had about 6 what looked\nLike regular old saut√©ed mushrooms. The service was horrendous. We ended up having to walk over to the bar to even get someone to give us the check. No bueno.  Despite the good beer we won't be back. The menu seems to be regular old food disguised as if it's part of this new \"gastro pub\" movement. Not worth the money.
