It's the New Year and my Father saw a promo ad in the Korean newspaper about this new place. We haven't dined out in a long time due to my Father's health condition and for him to even mention wanting to try a new place.. gave me something to look forward to. \n\nTheir promo consist of 20% off every order with your choice of FREE lb. of Mussels or Clams or a $5 Food Credit. Sounds like a great deal, but ended up dealing with a lot of bullshit.\n\nI made reservations thinking it would be packed and all, but when we walked in, nobody was dining there except for the owner's friends and family doing hot pot with 15+ people.\n\nI told our server, Ting that we had reservations, but she didn't care to listen. We ordered 1 lb. of Sausage, Mussels, Shrimp, Clam, and Crawfish in Garlic Butter. Also a side of Sweet Potato Fries, Corn, and Potato. \n\nEVERYTHING we ordered was beyond salty, except for the Shrimp. We did mention this to the server, Ting, but again, she didn't care for it and just said oh. It was also lacking flavor and to add being way too salty. It ruined our appetites. We asked for steamed rice to perhaps help with this overflow of salt. That didn't help. We finished the rice, sweet potato fries, and even the potato, because that salt taste was unbearable to even enjoy one bite! I had to order for some Raspberry Iced Tea to help me through all this. That was gone in a few gulps. We couldn't take it anymore and had to stop. Even mentioning how salty it was to the server, Ting she gave a \"oh well\" face.\n\nI asked for the check and the promo wasn't included. I explained to Ting that we saw a promo in the Korean newspaper for 20% off that was good until February, The server, Ting didn't seem to eager to correct this and asked us if we had the gift card. I said that promo never mentioned anything that we had to have a gift card to receive this promo special. Ting said they only do that if you have the gift card. I told her that's the reason why we came here to try this place out, because of the ad you placed in the newspaper. After much arguing back and forth, she told us to wait and went back to the cashier to talk to the manager. Before the server, Ting walked away I mentioned on the check it states free refill for the Raspberry Iced Tea. She said yea? I told her I had my drink cup empty seconds after I received it and you walked by maybe once and didn't even bother offering refills. The server, Ting then asked, so you want a refill? I'm like YEAAAAAaaa?!!?!!!! I get free refills riight??? Ting said, okay. \n\nThroughout this whole experience, it has been pulling teeth to get her attention to our table, AKA the ONLY table that was there besides the owner's hot pot table of 15+ people. How could you possibly get shitty service without the place being even busy?! Well folks, it can and it did. I even asked what happened to the Sausage order? The server, Ting said oh you want to order that? I said no I already ordered that and I'm asked you what happened to my order? Ting said, I didn't know you ordered that? You want to order it? I told her to make sure to take that out of the check and cancel the order. We were already done, why would I want to order that again when I'm thinking it's going to come out anytime soon?! Nope, I fooled myself silly thinking she put that order in and then tell me I didn't order that?! Even my Family said that's the first thing you ordered!!!!?!?!! *sigh This place sucks balls. \n\nThe server came back and told us she was able to take off 20% this time, but next time we have to have the gift card that says 20% off. And again, I explained to her, that the ad in the newspaper only stated that this place has a promo grand opening special for the whole month of January and states it ends in February with no indication of having to have a gift card to get this special promo deal. All the server, Ting said was.. yeah well you have to have the gift card.\n\nWe left this place with all the salty bags of seafood and not so happy tummies. First and last time trying this place. After coming home and reading the ad again, we weren't even honored with a Free lb. of Mussels or Clams, which we ordered both! If you're going to advertise to bring people in, make sure you honor what you're offering in your ad. That isn't the proper way to do business giving some guests this promo special without even mentioning any ad or having a gift card while other guests that told you about your ad in the newspaper, but don't even honor the full promo special that was mentioned! Now that's some bullshit.\n\nThe only thing \"Spicy\" that got me steaming is the upset of false advertisement from this place!!! \n\nI'll stick to Hot N Juicy Crawfish, even though their service wasn't so great the last time I went. At least their food makes up for it!!!
