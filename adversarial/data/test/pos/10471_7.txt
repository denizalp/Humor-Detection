I feel like me and my son are being personally targeted and retaliated against because I attempted to hold my son's daycare accountable. Because I refused to accept subpar care for my child. Because I held his daycare to a standard level of care that is outlined in the AZDHS rules and in their own policies. Because I feel like he deserves to be in a SAFE environment. Because I expect to get what I am paying for. Because THEY don't feel I DESERVE to get what I paid for. Because they thought they were doing me a favor by watching my son. Because I am a young, black, (EDUCATED) single mother. \nI enrolled my son at Elite Preschool and Learning Center in Tolleson, AZ and I have never experienced such discriminant, negligent, and -considering it is also a church- unChristian-like behavior. I moved from the East Valley to the Westside in October, and after checking the daycare out I thought it would be a great place to put my son so I placed my name on the waiting list. It was at church so my son could receive a Christian-based foundation, it was close to home, it had a seemingly loving, family atmosphere and it was a decent price. Little did I know I was sadly mistaken.\nOn his first day at the daycare, one of the classroom teachers gave my son milk, to which he is extremely allergic. IT COULD HAVE KILLED HIM. Not only did she give it to him but the teacher NEVER EVEN KNEW HE WAS ALLERGIC. I outlined this in ALL of his paperwork and told the Director, Karon Smith directly. There is no excuse for the incompetence of the staff other than the fact that the director did not do her job of making sure everyone was educated and aware to ensure my son's safety. This is CHILD ENDANGERMENT. Additionally, when Karon called me she completely minimized the incident. She mentioned that it was unacceptable but said my son only had a little bit and they had responded to it quickly by giving him Benadryl and his emergency inhaler immediately and that he was fine. She did not sound urgent or make it seem as if he was doing or responding badly to his treatment. \nWhen I arrived at the daycare I spoke to the director, Karon. She informed me she didn't know that his allergies were really so severe (even though I wrote it down and spoke with her about it. Apparently she needed my son to almost die to believe me or understand the true meaning of the terms severe and life-threatening). \nWhen I went to the classroom my son was sitting on the classroom floor at the feet of a teacher crying. She tells me he has been \"crying all day.\" What?! At what point is it okay for a child to be crying all day? Why wouldn't you call me? That is not normal or okay. And, if that is the case, why wouldn't you be attempting to soothe him? We make it to the car and I realize that he's not crying because he missed me, he's crying because HE CAN'T BREATHE. No one cared enough to notice and to tend to this issue by giving his rescue inhaler or contacting me. I felt as a parent I was not given all of the facts or accurate information to make the best decision possible for the health and safety of my son. It is obvious that he was not just given \"a little bit\" and if he had already broken out in hives it meant that it was not immediately treated and if his breathing was that arrested it meant that the milk had been in his system long enough for his respiratory system to be compromised. Additionally, they did not provide me an incident report, which is required by law, that outlined the actual event and they still to this day claim not to really know what exactly happened. And when they did provide the report 3 days later it had no details about the event and Karon attempted to backdate it as if it had been completed the day of the incident. All night I was up giving him breathing treatments and comforting him due to the negligent act of the daycare. By the next morning I had finally gotten him to a stable condition for school. And the next day I still had to leave work early because his breathing had worsened again.\nI completed my enrollment packet, filled it out with all the required information, included multiple documents detailing my sons life-threatening asthma, food allergies to milk\/dairy and peanuts, and medications he needs. I paid my tuition. Provided a change of clothes as outlined. AND I went over all of these things with the daycare director when I submitted my documentation. They accepted it, stating that his allergies and asthma would not be a problem. As a mother I did everything to ensure the daycare was in the best position to take care of my son. BUT STILL ON THE FIRST DAY ONE OF THE STAFF ALMOST KILLED MY SON. Then when I asked for some sort of compensation for the events that occurred throughout the week (this wasn't my only concern) the director had the audacity to tell me that they watched my son for 7 hours that day and she didn't feel like I warranted a refund. As if my son being there for 7 hours makes up for the fact that he almost died.
