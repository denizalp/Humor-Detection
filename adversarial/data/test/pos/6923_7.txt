Hadn't been here since they changed from Fado's, but I stopped in at happy hour for a friend's birthday. The appetizers were very good but here's the kicker...\n\n$9.73 for a tall Guinness... at happy hour? Who am I, Donald Trump?\n\nI'm sure I'll go here again, possibly for dinner... but I dont know who named it Happy Hour.
