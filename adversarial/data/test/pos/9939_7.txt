I Love the energy of this place!  It is inviting, colorful and always has friendly, fast service.  There are many delicious and refreshing choices accompanied by upbeat music that make Tea Snow a great place to hang out and visit.  The smoothies are refreshing, the Boba is distinct in its flavors and the snow offerings are cool, refreshing and fun to share.\n\nI find myself going here more often than other Boba places because of the consistent service, friendly atmosphere and close proximity to many other great places in Mekong Plaza.  The prices here are reasonable and the large menu of hot and cold teas, smoothies, slushies, coffee and shaved snow ensures that you are never left wanting.  Plus, there are daily specials created by staff that is often unique enough to sway me away from my usual go-to faves.\n\nA few of my go-to favorites: Thai Dessert, Vietnamese Coffee, Taro Smoothie, Matcha Green Tea or, of course, the Daily Special.  Special requests are honored here.  Have a flavor profile in mind?  Just tell the staff and they will happily offer suggestions and even recommend one of their favorites, making you feel like a true insider.  The good thing about Tea, Snow & Coffee is that they do each thing well; so most anything you choose will be tasty, full of flavors, chewy (Boba), gummy (jelly), creamy (pudding) and of course, refreshing.  \n\nEven though there are tons of different flavor combinations, you do not feel overwhelmed or confused by the menu because it is large, well laid out and colorful.  The menu has close to 70 offerings; and with add-ins, the choices swell to over a hundred.  Don't fret though, because there are lots of photos on the walls and windows giving even the uninitiated an idea of what a pennywort smoothie or avocado slushie looks like.  Really, I have yet to have anything here that was not just delicious; that is something I cannot say about other Milk Tea Boba places.\n\nOverall: 4 Stars\nQuality: 4.5 Stars\nService: 4.5 Stars\nCleanliness: 3 Stars\nValue: 4 Stars\nAtmosphere: 4 Stars
