We made a last minute travel to Las Vegas, and I spent my whole car ride looking for a super good deal on a hotel room for one night during my car ride.\n\nI was able to snag a deal for $78, when most places were $200+ on the day of booking.\n\nI mean I definitely wasn't looking for something fancy, so staying at this hotel was a lot better than staying at some random motel. \n\nIt is easy to find and its fairly close the strip. Right next to hooters and down the street from MGM.\n\nWe got a two queen bed room.\nIt was clean and fresh. \nThe beds were very comfortable.\nThere were four pillows on each bed which were also comfortable.\nWe had a semi-large refrigerator, microwave, large flatscreen tv, hair drier, etc.\n\nI liked that they gave complimentary make up wipes! The good kind too, I've never seen any other hotel that offered that. But not enough complimentary shampoo and conditioner. Usually I have my own, but I didn't this time.\n\nAnd only other complaint was that the sink and mirror was very small. Only enough for one person to get ready at and limited space to put your toiletries. And the sink didn't have any drawers to put your stuff either.\n\nAnd we had the room that was right next to the lobby, so it was very loud with lots of people hanging out at the tables or checking in\/checking out. But luckily we were out most the day and night anyways, but thought I'd mention it just in case you don't want a loud room.\n\nOverall, it was a fast, easy and comfortable one night stay.
