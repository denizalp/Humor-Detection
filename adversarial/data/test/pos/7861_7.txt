Hot dogs worth the hype and a drive down to Toronto. Service is slow and apathetic, but that didn't matter to us when the hot dogs knocked our socks off!\n\nLocated just south of the southwest corner of College and Spadina, this place isn't luxurious by any means and looks like a popular spot for students. It looks like it was converted from a garage to a restaurant (the front wall is a closed garage door). It definitely needs a sweep (the floors were marked with dirt that looked like it hadn't been cleaned in ages), and our server was very curt, abrupt, and not very welcoming.\n\nAll that aside, the food is absolutely and fabulously excellent. First, note that when you 'check in' on Yelp, you get some sort of promotion. We received a large basket of fries to go with our hot dogs (super crispy and perfect). \n\nSecond, the actual hot dogs. You can order them regular sized or slider sized (mini versions). We opted for the slider sized since we only  intended to drop by for a snack. We ordered a slider Corn Dog ($3.49), Korean BBQ dog ($3.99), and the Mac Daddy (Mac & Cheese dog with bacon bits)($4.49). WOW. So blown away by how delicious it was - it felt and tasted SO fresh (none of that frozen stuff), carefully and intricately prepared, super crispy and full of authentic flavour. The food wait was long (around 35 minutes) but we loved all of it - once you have a taste, you'll realize you can't have just one. \n\nTheir menu is also pretty extensive, so you won't have problems picking something that appeals to you.\n\nFor two people, with tax, and tip, we paid around $15.00. I definitely wouldn't mind coming back here for more!
