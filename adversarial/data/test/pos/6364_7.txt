Believe the hype. \n\nWe waited in line for about half an hour....paid and got seated before too long. Then came the feasting that began at the Asian section and ended with the seafood section.  I can't remember it all, it was a blur from buffet line to table and back to line. Dear reader, please appreciate that my wife and her sister cannot stop talking, but for the duration of the meal they were too busy conversing with their plates to talk with each other. Silent it was, yet the waiter was afraid to put his hands near  our table, lest he get caught up in the carnage and devoured before anyone noticed. \n\nYeah. It was like that. \n\nI was amused by the carving station. I was in line when they brought out a piece of pork loin, and watched it fall apart tenderly when it was paid on the carving table. An audible murmur went through the line like they were watching some kind of magic show. \n\nNow that you've had your fill...make your way over to the desert station! Deep dish chocolate chip cookies? How about apple cobbler?  How about watermelon mint ice cream on a hazelnut coated cone? \n\nIts pricey. There is a possibility you'll be made to wait a while. So what, its worth it to me.
