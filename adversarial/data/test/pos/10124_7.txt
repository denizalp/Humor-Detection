Being born and raised in Hawaii, I have had the pleasure of having great authentic Asian food. Of course the mainland is often a hit and miss and I have toned down my expectations. My husband and I thought this would be a great place to try. I love the name, one cannot help but smile when saying it \"CHINA FUN!\". \n\nI placed the order via phone so that it would be hot and ready when I arrived. Decided on the pepper steak, crispy won tun, and sesame chicken. Each meal was accompanied by fried rice and an egg roll. When I entered, I noticed that it was a rather small restaurant and unremarkable in appearance. I walked up to the cash register to where a woman was standing. I did not receive any greeting at all, not even a smile. I advised that I placed a phone order for steak and chicken. The food was brought out promptly. Still not one word from her. I yielded my credit card, she swiped it and returned it with a receipt for me to sign. Still not a word. As I picked up my food, I decided to give a cheerful \"thank you\" and received a mumbled \"you're welcome\" in return. Ok, not a deal breaker, but we all know service can go a long way. \n\nGot home and quickly served up some Chinese goodness or so I thought. Although the food was hot, the won tuns were not so crispy, the egg rolls were chewy and fried rice was standard. The chicken probably was the best out of our food fare. Apparently, their version of pepper steak is adding a TON of green peppers and onions with some steak (meat pieces). And you cannot go wrong with fortune cookies.\n\nOverall, the food is a 2, service a 1 and location a 3. The best thing about this place is the name, in my opinion, I still love saying it...... CHINA FUN!
