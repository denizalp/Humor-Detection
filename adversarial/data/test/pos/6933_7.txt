I'll start with something positive and say we went during happy hour (5-7pm daily) and I really enjoyed those $5 cocktails. The Lemon Drop and Wicked Margarita were both yummy. Thankfully, those got me buzzed enough to help numb the pain of my disappointment in the food. Almost everything was mediocre\/borderline bad that when we tried a bite of something that was actually decent, it was a nice surprise. The fried chicken was way too greasy. The pasta was dry and lacked flavor. Didn't enjoy the crab legs, they were pretty dry. The only dessert that  I actually liked was the bread pudding, and we tried a lot of desserts!\n\nThis buffet is supposed to be one of the best, so I was thinking maybe the whole Vegas buffet scene is like this. We almost cancelled our plans to eat at the Bacchanal Buffet inside Caesar's Palace the next night. Thankful we didn't though, because Bacchanal was phenomenal! You'll find way more food items and a nicer environment. If you're into seafood, Bacchanal actually has oysters, unlike Wicked Spoon. Bacchanal also offers steamed crab legs, while Wicked Spoon only has them chilled. Seems like brunch might be good at Wicked Spoon, but our dinner there definitely wasn't.
