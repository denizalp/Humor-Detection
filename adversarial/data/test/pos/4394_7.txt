As of now I'm not sold on the Container Park.  My biggest problem is that it feels too enclosed and private.  It wants to make Downtown Las Vegas seem cool and cultured; but only if you're inside the Container Park!  Only one entrance & exit?  I get carded to walk into here?  No outside food or drink?  Kids are allowed, but have to leave by 9:00pm?  It's great that they've tried to create a family friendly environment, but once you leave you're quickly reminded that you're still on the corner of Fremont and 7th.\n\nMy favorite aspect of the Container Park is that it focuses on showcasing local businesses.  There seems to be a decent mix of retail, food, and drink spots, along with spaces reserved for art galleries.  Be sure to stop by JoJo's Jerky.  Later at night a curfew goes into effect, which allows adults to have fun on the playground.  Neat, but not really something I feel needs a repeat visit.  First time visitors, though, be sure to check out the ninja game and three story slide!\n\nIt's a neat concept to be able to walk into a conex and be greeted by sales staff and retail goods instead of construction materials and boxes, but I can't say that the Container Park is a must-see.
