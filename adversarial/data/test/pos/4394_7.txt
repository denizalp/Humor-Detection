My boyfriend & I adopted a kitten & she unfortunately turned out to be really sick & had ringworm (scary, I know)! Dr. Wallace made everything better, he accommodated our busy schedules, walked us through step by step through our kittens healing process & went out of his way to help us. Our kitten is now 100% healthy & we honestly couldn't have done it w\/out Dr.Wallace. Thank you so much.
