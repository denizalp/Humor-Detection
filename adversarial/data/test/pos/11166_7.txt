Zoo is under investigation by USDA for cruelty to Elephants\n\nThe Pittsburgh Zoo insists on using barbaric ways to herd elephants with the use of dogs despite public uproar. The USDA ordered the Zoo to stop using the dogs, but the zoo refuses. This puts employees, dogs, and elephants at risk. Please urge the Pittsburgh Zoo to switch to safe and modern elephant-management methods.\n\nAccording an inspection report in January, the zoo was ordered to immediately stop using the dogs in ways that upset the elephants. The USDA report says the zoo must control the elephants without causing them \"behavioral stress\" and ordered the change \"from this point forward.\" In one USDA report, a caretaker told officials that in earlier instances the dogs had bitten the elephants. He also verified a news video of elephants showing distress when they were charged at by the dogs.\n\nA USDA report states: \"The dog showed aggressive behavior, growling and lunging at one elephant and entering its enclosure before being called back by the manager.\"\n\nAre we to believe the zoo cares about elephants' welfare while keeping them in constant stress and fear of these dogs?\n\nThe Pittsburgh Zoo has a history of irresponsible handling of elephants. In 1989 a zoo keeper suffered injuries after an elephant kicked him, and in 2002 a keeper was killed by a mother elephant who held her head against his chest after he fell to the ground. The zoo has been cited for the barbaric practice of using dogs to herd due to the cruelty and undue stress it causes, but it continues to ignore common sense!\n\nLearn more at www.Change.org
