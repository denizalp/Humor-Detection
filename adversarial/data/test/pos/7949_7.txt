I don't understand how anyone could complain about a rate increase here. You can directly interact with the owners and see where the money is going. They are always super cool and nice. Really only come here to be \"social\" while I talk to no one and play video games alone but the equipment is always good aside from an occasional chair swap that's needed. It's a really enjoyable business model being attached to the restaurant and having both interact as closely as the do.
