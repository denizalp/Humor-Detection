DO NOT STAY HERE!\n\nF*ck this place!!!\n\nSo after signing up for a players card a while back they sent me a free stay in the mail- any weekday up to 3 nights. So i decided to take them up on thier offer and see if it was really worth the $400 night room rate during spring break with 3 girlfriends\nWhat a HUGE dissapointment!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nSo first off i call 2 weeks in advance and book my room through thier hotel reservations dept. When i asked if i would need anything upon check in the lady on the phone tells me- only an i.d. miss. okay awsome. I requested a smoking room and told her we would be checking in very late- and she confirmed this back to me over the phone.\n\nSo we get there about 1am monday night\/tues morning and are asked for a deposit. No problem - i used to work as a hotel manager for 2 years and i know this is standard policy- BUT they want $150 a night on a card [ that will be heald\/ frozen in your account until after check out ] $300 a night in cash for our 3 night stay- EXCUSE ME??! WTF?? WHY DIDNT YOU TELL ME THIS OVER THE PHONE?!?!?!\n\ni dont like to bring my high limit c.c's with me on vacay cuz if it gets stolen i'd rather someone spend $200 bux then $2000. I explain to the guy at the front desk the situation and tell him i don't have enough on my card for all three nights. Lemme get my mngr he tells me...10min later Mngr comes out.\n\n\"no one in your group has enough on a card?\" he rudly asked me- no we don't so now what? i reply. OH WELL he tells me- oh well? i drove her from LA and you tell me oh well?!?! i thought the whole point of free stays was to convince you to come back and pay for rooms.......hmmmmmmm.....so after I come up with a plan-me not the front desk or the mngr ME MYSELF come up with a plan- i will put tonights on my card and then have my bf fax over a copy of my other credit card (that i left at home) that they can use for the other 2 nights-okay so now finally the agree to let us stay. I ask them is there anythign you need besides a copy of the frotn and back of the credit card? No they reply- that will suffice perfectly.OKAY FINE. no biggie.then he checks our reservation and says for our trouble they will upgrade us to a tower suite. HELL YEA- now were excited!\n\nSo we get up to our room on the 52nd floor and are taken aback by the absolutly BEAUTIFUL VIEW. One whole wall was a HUGE window- we were overklooking the golf course and had a great view of the whole city and the mountains and overlooked the pools. We have some drinks, and head out on the town for a bit. We get back around 5am.\n\nTHE VERY NEXT MORNING- i wake up early on purpose to chk if my credit card has been faxed yet [ my boyfriend was going to be working in court all day so it was now or never to fax the copies] i explained this to the front desk. When i call down they say theyve recieved it but only recieved a copy of the card. DUH i think - thats what ya'll wanted. THEN they tell me i need to have him fill out and fax back an authorization form. WHAT!?!?! I AM THE ONE STAYING HERE_ THE CARD HE FAXED OVER HAS MY F**KING NAME ON IT!!!!- do you not have  my name on file? i can come down and sign for it anytime it's my card not his whose authorization do you need?!?! lemme chk with my mngr they say.\n\nmngr gets on the phone- sorry miss we have all we need you are the holder of the credit card correct? yes i tell her it is my card. okay come down AT YOUR convienence all you need to do is sign- she also said she would fax it to the \"tower suites\" front desk so i wouldnt have to walk thru the casino. Awsome thank you.\n\nwe get ready for the pool and head down stairs- i get to tower suites front desk. Hi im in room 52__ im here to sign. \"all weve recieved was a copy of your credit card\" yea i know thats all you guys need......no we need an authorization form. ARE YOU STUPID??!? its MY CARD i am HERE to AUTHORIZE it. Uggggggggghhhhhhhhh.\n\nlemme chk with my mnger. -OMG!!!!!\nmngr comes out- we can accept just the copy for you but the copy we recieved is black and illegable. we need your bf to re-fax.\nEXCUSE ME?!?!??I CALLED DOWN EARLIER TO MAKE SURE you people got excatly what you needed because i knew he would be unavailable the rest of the freaking day!!!!!! and now your telling me you cant accept it?!?! are you people kidding me??!? now what?? i ask.\n\nwell im sorry we need an authorization theres nothing we can do.........NOTHING YOU CAN DO?!?!What freaking morons. I would think for such an expensive hotel they would be more professional and have a btter educated staff. SOOO ridiculous- same reply- nothing we can do.\n\ni tell them to call the front desk and have THEM refax it considering i SPOKE WITH THEM THIS MORNING nd they said everything WAS FINE maybe its just the tower suite printer. They refax- still blk. Then they email it. Still illegible. \nt this point im pissed off. I did EVRYTHIGN RIGHT.We spent a good hour arguing with them - needs to be continued.........
