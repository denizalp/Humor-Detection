British Drinking Establishment otherwise known commonly as a Pub.\nBevvies priced acceptably.  Service not too shabby if I do say so.\nDecor has a level of grandiose situated in a Historical TD Bank Building.\nIt was surprisingly not as packed as nearby Jack Astor or Milestones.\n2.0 - 2.5'd\n\nCountry Fried Chicken(Fridays Special $15)\n\nCrisp outer batter envelopes overcooked underseasoned Chicken Breast.\nGravy was used to compensate but that left none for the Mashed Potatoes.\nNo Cream Soup left and we didn't want Salad.  Waiter took $2.00 off tab.
