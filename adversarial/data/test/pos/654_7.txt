When it comes to chain pet stores, I prefer Petco.\n\n I would not eat junk food and processed foods everyday, why would I give it to the animals? Natural, quality foods are important to me and they carry brands like Solid Gold,Halo, Natural Balance, etc which Petsmart hasn't smartened up to carry.  PetSmart have a limited natural food selection with Blue Buffalo, Avoderm and Castor&Pollux which Petco also carries. I grab Blue Buffalo and Natural Balance kibble for the cat here and get my dogs food at a specialty store.  It makes a difference- my one senior pug (now passed on) came with issues, arthritis, etc....she gained strength, ran around and limped less by just giving her real foods. I rarely went to the vet with our last dogs.  A lot will be surprised with whats actually in those big convention brand name pet foods....it's scary actually. \n\nI won't get preachy, but I'll get humorous about pet nutrition. This SNL spoof is really not far from the truth of whats in \"by products\" \n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=za9_9N8MNuE \n\nShedding issues- brushing with a Furminator is a noticeable difference in shedding....adding Missing Link makes shedding significantly less and the supplements make sure to round out their diet with raw unprocessed nutrients. I wouldn't neglect rounding out my health so why shouldn't they get every nutrient too? \n\nI wouldn't put artificial, allergy causing beauty products on myself, so why should it touch the animals? Select Petco carry Earthbath which is my favorite natural dog shampoos and grooming product line.... unfortunately not carried at this one but on Craig a few miles down. This one carries Avoderm which is also pretty good. I also love Natures Miracle Pet Wipes to wipe off surface dirt between washes if I can't find the Earthbath ones. \n\nI want them to be happy too. They also have treats that my dogs and cat will fight for- Dogswell dehydrated meat treats. It's normal to see dogs grasp big chicken chews and chew on it, but it's pretty hilarious that the cat is into it too and finish a whole tender. The dogs love natural bullysticks and it keeps their teeth nice. The kittytap loves treats (which I find odd for a cat)...hes such a pigface from growing up with dogs. Greenies Dental Treats, Wellness Jerky, Halo Liv-a-Littles, etc. are all great kitty treats.  If you want the dogs to leave you alone- stuff some Kong toys with peanut butter or put yogurt in it and freeze it! \n\nIt's the effing desert- give that animal a drink! Petmate and Drinkwell fountains are pretty awesome to get them to drink and provide fresh flowing water (important for cats specially!)  instead of \"bowl still\" water. Add the little cat grass\/wheat grass planter into the water and they have indoor, healthy wheatgrass for the cats want to bite vegetation. \n\nThey carry a well rounded amount of good, quality items so I'm happy with them. There's some items I can't get from them, but I like supporting the mom and pop Holistic pet food shop, Scraps 4 Pets, to round out the best possible food variety for the animals. \n\nThey are after all family so gotta care for them. I have to give props to anyplace that makes it easier to be the kind of nurturing pug and cat parent I want to be.\n\nUPDATE 8\/15=  Crazy steals in their clearance baskets. I got harnesses for $4 and $2 for the pugs....we're having custom handmade ones made, but need something for the time being. With most harnesses at $20 and we just need them for the next few months, it almost seemed stupid to buy so that they can go out while their handsewn ones come in.  We also got a bath non slip mat for $4.
