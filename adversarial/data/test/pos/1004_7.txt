So.....my wife saw this place on \"Shark Tank\" and she wanted to try it.  She is a picky eater and usually will not eat sushi or anything like that (she is pretty much anti fish stuff).  She read that they will make a roll with chicken in it so we decided to come here after my burger.  I was pretty full from my burger but I asked myself, \"Tim...when are you ever going to eat sushi in Phoenix again\"?  I answered myself, \"Probably never\".  Might as well order a roll. This place is like an assembly line of sushi ordering.  You tell them what you want in it, they put it in, roll it, cut it up and serve it to you.  Very fast and efficient.   So here is what I got................\n\nI went with a seaweed wrapper with white rice.  To that I added avocado, green onion, jalapeno and shrimp.  They will usually drizzle a sauce on top but I decided to get mine on the side in a cup.  I went with the sweet chili sauce.  My wife got seaweed wrapper, white rice, cucumber, avocado and chicken.  She got hers drizzled with teriyaki sauce.  Total for 2 rolls was just over $13.00.\n\nMy roll was very good!  I'm not a big sushi fan and if I eat it, I will usually puss out and get California rolls and stuff like that.  My combo of shrimp, avocado, green onion and jalapeno was a winner though.  The avocado made it creamy, the green onion made it fresh, the jalapeno made it spicy, the shrimp made it cool and the sweet chili sauce made it hot.  I don't know if I could have picked a better combo for my things.  My wife absolutely loved hers.  It was exactly what she expected and she says it was a 5 star joint in her book.\n\nService was friendly and efficient!  I would definitely go back again if they ever made one in San Diego.
