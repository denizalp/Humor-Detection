I can't say too much about my experience here, but it was not pleasant. \n\nThese guys have a bunch of rip-off charges. They have a policy where you have to pay for an ENTIRE tank of gas if you return it not full. You may as well just return the car with no gas in tank, as it cheaper that way. \n\nEven worse, I was told I could just leave the car at my hotel instead of having to drive it back. However, when trying to change the date of my reservation, the car rental people had the wrong hotel on file. They weren't flexible at all about changing the location of the drop off. I ended up having to drop the car off at their station. \n\nThe customer service for this car rental place is brutal. The people on the phone speak so fast and just end up transferring you. I had to call three different times. Once I was just hung up on. \n\nAs you can tell, I won't use this service again.
