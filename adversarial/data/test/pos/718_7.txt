Zen is one of those highly mediocre places that I leave wondering \"Why do I keep coming back here? That was really unsatisfying.\" The last straw was when I got a bento box for lunch (which is a really great deal if the food was more satisfying) and the dessert that came with it was old leftover tres leches cake that was spit-out awful.  (Note: I have had fresh tres leches cake there once that was the only highlight of dinner).\n\nThe family who runs it is friendly and they used to own Sole Spanish which was great and I miss the ability to go there now, especially since there's now no Spanish places north of 485 that I know of. But they integrated some of their Sole stuff on the Zen menu, so it's a melange of asian and spanish. That's just bananas. I guess I'm more of a purist - call me a fuddy duddy. If the sign says asian fusion, I want you to do it really really well.  Instead you get either weird or mediocre takes on dishes. \n\nI do like their drink menu and location but I can cook so much better at home, so I'm quitting you, Zen.
