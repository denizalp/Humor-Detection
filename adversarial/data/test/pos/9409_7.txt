Disappointment, never had a letdown as unexpected as this place. Their Food Cart in uptown is so good I figured the brick & mortar location has to be phenomenal, man I was wrong.\n\nWalk in at 11:30 1\/2 an hour into lunch service and tell the girls I'd like the chicken\/lamb combo over rice, they said it wasn't ready and I'd have to wait 10 minutes. I thought, sure no problem, I really wanted the combo and I needed to stop by the Asian Supermarket across the street real quick anyway so left and came back 15 minutes later.\n\n11:45 \"Still not ready, just take a seat and we'll be with you soon.\" At this point I'm still the only one in the restaurant minus the two girls behind the counter. I've already invested 15 minutes, what's a couple more? \n\n12:00 I'm asking how long because I've got to be in Monroe very soon. They had served 3 other customers ahead of me because they were ordering rotisserie or jerk chicken, they told me to come up and choose my rice. They then gave me my drink and said the meat would be ready in just a second. I also decided on a side of plantains for $1.99 since I had been staring at them for while now. They rang me up and I sat back down. \n\n12:10 finally walking out the door... I feel like they only had me come up and choose my rice and pay so that I wouldn't leave. I wish I had. But I received the food so finally, time to see if it was worth the wait.\n\nMeat was good, a little dry, not as moist as the cart in Uptown. Lettuce and Tomato were fresh, tomatoes were great. The rice was notably bland, I don't understand how the rice at the cart has a mellow, complex spice and aroma to it and at the restaurant it literally has nothing to offer. The plantains were simply burnt, not blackened with spices, burnt. Trust me, I know plantains.\n\nIt was also more expensive than Uptown. It 'appears' that you're getting more food than the cart but it's just more bland rice and less meat. Not a great trade off.\n\nService was nothing to speak of. No apology for the wait, and no interaction at all the entire time I waited, even though for most of the time I was the only patron at the place. They have zero customer service awareness.\n\nTake my advice, go to the cart at Trade and Tryon. They can handle 5 times the amount of customers in a third of the time with better food. Chris and his team up there are just so much better, if the food wasn't great and his team so friendly, this visit would probably be the end. 2 Stars because apparently the food is the same, but what a bummer today's visit was...
