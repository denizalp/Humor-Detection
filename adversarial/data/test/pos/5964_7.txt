My party was extremely disappointed and upset about our experience at dinner. \n\nWe made reservations days before at 7:30, noted that it was my fathers birthday & arrived on time. Before we ordered we told the server in advance that we had a 9pm show. The server said that was fine and it wouldn't take that long. We put our orders in and talked amongst ourselves and snapped pictures while we waited. After waiting 1 hour and 20 mins my party and I were getting nervous about being late for our show. During this wait time we did not even get checked up on!\n\n My boyfriend finally got up and tried to cancel our order with the host, but she told him that she couldn't do that and we had to wait while she paged our waiter. So we waited another 10 mins. Our waiter never showed and a manager came over to charge us and say the beef Wellington took a long time to cook (waiter told us he had it in the oven with 5 others and was coming our fast) tsk tsk. By that point we didn't even want to argue and just wanted to catch our show. Everyone in our party then left and said they would meet us down by the casino.\n\nThen a waiters comes with 1 out of the five entrees I'm guessing in hopes to keep us, but I told him we already canceled our order and he didn't care and went away. Seriously can't you see we have an empty table (bf and I stayed back to pay for drinks) and that we are not at all happy, and again how is one entree out of five suppose to be ok??\n\nWhile leaving we noticed a few other couples tables canceling their orders and leaving also. We thought this was so weird because they had a lot of tables empty... But whatever. We were looking forward to this dinner for weeks and it is so disappointing that it ended this way especially since we went out of the way and told them that we had a show and asked if the dishes we ordered were ok with our time frame. \n\nSo sad I won't ever be returning, but this horrible service was the worst!
