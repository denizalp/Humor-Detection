We went to the Flying Monkey pub on a Thursday night to have some glasses of wine. We liked their Pinot Noir...we drank like 8 glasses of it so we should have just bought a bottle. Lesson learned. We are indeed winos. Flying Monkey is a chill place to meet friends without having to be distracted by a sporting event, especially on a quiet weeknight. Park on the street. They do not have a kitchen, so it is a spot for drinks only.
