Dropped by here last night with some rowdy Yelpers on a Kensington Pub Krawl. (Holla!) There were meant to be 2 stops after this joint, but the guys at Handlebar were treating us right. So a unanimous drunken decision was made to remain at Handlebar and continue to get drunk on whiskey, bourbon and great craft beer. \n\nThis was a dive-bar crawl, but once inside Handlebar I realized it's anything but divey. They have taken great care in decorating the inside with one-of-kind narrow wooden tables and bicycles.\n\nThey had a sandwich special which some people enjoyed, but I was on a strictly liquid diet. Bullet whiskey is delicious. You know what's not? Keith's cider. Keith's cider tastes like the two litre ciders they sell at the Wine Rack. It's really sweet and undwerwhelming. Avoid it.*\n\nPEPPER POINTS: For their large front patio. Great for people watching.\n\nPEPPER'S PISSED: About the AC. Turn it down, boys. I know you're big guys but I was faaareeeezzzing. Going pee was akin to peeing in an outhouse. While winter camping. \n\n*I'm from Nova Scotia and it pains me to diss a Keith's product.
