Let me start this out by saying I'm a huge Ink Master fan. I literally binge watch like its my job.\n\nSo when I saw that two of the Ink masters opened up a shop here in Vegas I knew I wanted to get my next tattoo from this shop.\n\nMy friend called me up spur of the moment saying he wanted to get a piece done so I recommended we try this place out.\n\nI called in the girl at the reception desk was super sweet and helpful letting us know we could walk in around five and get taken care of.\n\nSo we went in and the space is amazing! Really set the tone of the whole experience! \n\nWe both worked with Clayton and nether one of us were disappointed. He drew up an amazing tattoo concept for my friend and mine was much much simpler but he was able to capture exactly what I was looking for.\n\nHe made me feel so comfortable and he was fun to work with! As a matter of fact everyone we met there was great! If I didn't love my job I would totally want to work here! \n\nThere is a $100.00 minimum so even though my piece was tiny and took five minutes it still cost me that but the experience was worth it plus I love the tattoo. \n\nI'm actually planning on going back and adding to it and I can't wait to see it after he's done!\n\nThanks for the awesome experience Clayton!
