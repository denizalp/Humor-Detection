I wanted to love Les Suites Labelle in the same way when The Mystery Machine \"conveniently\" breaks down in front of ominous places. Should we split up? Naw, man. The area lacked curb appeal, the parking situation was not intuitive and super awkward, plus there were some sketch folks mulling about. One literally pounced on our car window with a dirty windshield squeegee (even after when my dad furiously honked and told him to back the F-off). In the end, our two nights weren't half bad. Mainly because of the location, location, location. Just around the corner on St Catherine, there's a pedestrian-only road with shops and cafes (grocery store for essentials), a small park, the metro station, plus a row of dining options along St Denis. For the value, our room was surprisingly spacious with a kitchenette. No issues with egregious odors. Free wifi. The continental breakfast had some nice chocolate filled pastries. The front desk supplied us with a map and detailed recommendations. The guy was probably quadrilingual and was even able to communicate to my parents in mandarin. Amazing. \n\nIt took a couple of Scooby snacks, but once you look past the initially sketchiness, staying on Labelle wasn't as spooky as I thought.
