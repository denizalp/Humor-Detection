Got in my room last nite and noticed there were no sheets on the bed, woke up this morning called the front desk asked for sheets to be placed on my bed,  went to breakfast when I came back housekeeping had made the bed without sheets but had placed the sheets in the room but not on the bed wow, So at SLS I guess you have to make your own bed.
