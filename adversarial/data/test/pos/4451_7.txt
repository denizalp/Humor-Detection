This review has been a long time coming, but I am finally just DONE DONE DONE with them, so I wanted to warn others so they don't have to go through what I went through. If you don't want to read the LONG review, just know that you will most likely regret getting a car and certainly having a car serviced here. \n\nI purchased my Kia Soul here in 2010 brand new. Traded in a car at the same time. Dealers were very shady, but really, that is pretty standard for Vegas. I looked over the paperwork questioning everything and they moaned and groaned and made this huge show out of making NO money off this sale, such utter and complete crap, considering in the end even though I traded in a car, AND put down 5k, that car cost me nearly 17k! Yea, I was an idiot but after 3 hours in the salesroom it was either take the car, or throw myself in front of one.\n\nEven after I thought we had a price and payment worked out,  we went in and they wanted to add a package where I got all my maintenance stuff included for two years. Now I know these things are never good deals but I have bad luck with cars, so the thought of things being covered was too tempting. Fast forward 2 years and after I sat and did the math, I ended up paying over $120 dollars for every oil change if you compare cost of that package vs. paying for them myself, even if you add in that the first big service was covered in that time (normal cost $400). Now, had something gone wrong I would have hoped it would have been covered, but nothing ever did, so I really overpaid. \n\nAfter those two years were over, I them embarked on the lovely 'screw the lady every time she comes in\" plan. I brought my car into them because I have heard horror stories of factory warranties not covering things if you haven't had everything done through the dealer, so I faithfully brought my car in every 3000k miles. \n\nDid you know that every hose, filter, screw, fluid, etc. etc. needs to be replaced every 3000k miles?? Yeah, sarcasm there, but seriously, that is what they want you to believe AND of course pay for. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. there was something other than the oil change that HAD to be done (always managing to be around $100) or else \"IT MAY VOID THE FACTORY WARRANTY\" Seriously, they try and scare you into paying for BS things like that. Some things I fell for, others I knew were total crap, but overall I know I was screwed repeatedly and it got to the point where I would get physically sick to my stomach when I knew an oil change was coming up. One of the guys actually tried to tell me that I needed new tires TWO WEEKS after I had put new tires on the car from Discount (the only thing I did not have done at the dealership)\n\nNow lets fast forward to this year. I pay for the 60k service ($1,100!) which they assures me covers every single solitary thing in that car, every thing that needs to be checked, tuned up, replaced, taken care of in any way, is supposed to be done. I have that done in February, in May-ish the car starts (very rarely) stalling or idling rough. Not enough to freak me out, but enough to make me wonder what in the world it could be when I supposedly (3 months earlier) had everything under the sun done on this car. \n\nI decide it can wait until the next oil change and bring it up when I bring it in. Cue the \n\n\"Oh is could be this fluid which we can replace for $$$$\" \n\nMe- Wasn't that replaced during the 60k service? \n\n\"Oh yea, well then it could be this part that we can replace for $$$ \n\nMe- Wasn't that checked in the 60k mile service?\n\n\"Oh yes, well it could be this thing which we can replace for $$$ \n\nMe- Wasn't that do....\n\n'Look, it could be a ton of things, and I wasn't there watching them while they did the service so who knows what was done (ARE YOU COMPLETELY F'in kidding me??) but it sounds like a VERY SERIOUS issue and you definitely need to leave it for a few days to let us drive it around and see what is going on. It will be a few hundred dollars but that will be put towards whatever we need to do to fix it. \n\nAt this point I ask if my warranty covers any of this\n\n\"All the warranty really covers is if the engine decides to blow up \"\n\nYes, that was what he told me. This fabulous bumper to bumper, 100k mile warranty through Kia, apparently will only cover the engine blowing up. While I know that is also utter BS, this was the absolute last straw with this place.\nI would rather shove hot tire rods up my bum than ever ever ever step foot into or give one more penny, to Findlay Kia again.
