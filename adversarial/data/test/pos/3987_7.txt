I can't see this place staying open much longer. It was dead at lunch and for $60 plus tip was so not worth it. I had a greet tea margarita ($14) and it was small and forgettable. My friend had dan dan Mein noodles while I had the shrimp crispy noodles. The service was great however nothing else was. My shrimp dish tasted ok... Definitely not worth $25 but after I got home I was immediately sick and have been for 5 hours now. Save yourself and stay away from this place.
