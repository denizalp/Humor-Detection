\"Daniel, you should try the New Mexico burrito at Felipitos. They are huge,\" my coworker said. \"Where is this Felipitos place?, I asked my friend. If you drive east on Sunset Road past the curve (intersection of Mountain Vista Street) it will be down the hill to the left inside a 7-Eleven.\" \"At Arroyo Grande,? \"I asked.\" I know where it is. It used to be the Jack In the Box attached to the 7-Eleven. I'll check it out soon.\"\n\n  Not only did I check it out once. I'd check it out two times with the first time on Sunday, February 5 to try the New Mexico burrito and two days later on Tuesday, February 7 for Taco Tuesday. Based on my New Mexico burrito experience, my coworker's recommendation will snowball from her telling one person to me telling the Yelp universe about this place where you can get mutant burritos that squash many of the competitor's burritos. \n\n   The Felipitos restaurant itself could be best described as a hole in the wall. As I started off the review using my conversation with my friend as an introduction, Felipitos is carved inside an out of business Jack In the Box that is connected to 7-Eleven. A carryover from the Jack In the Box days is that there is an active Drive Thru window. Inside the restaurant you order at a counter where a few years ago people ordered Jumbo Jacks. Today people could order a superfluous of Mexican food from menus above the counter, posters of combinations that hang on the walls, and off specials that are posted on the door. There are 25 combination plates available. They range from $6.95 to $9.95. The vast menu also includes seven breakfast plates that cost $7.75. This menu puts Jack In the Box's to shame. There is more including burritos, chimichangas, quesadillas, tacos, enchiladas, and more. However, my bypassed the overwhelming choices with my mind set on following my friend's recommendation of the New Mexico burrito. Surprisingly it is not one of the 20 tacos listed on the menu. \n\n   At the counter, I ordered the New Mexico burrito. The lady who worked there took a break from mopping the floor to take my order. After handing over $9 and change for the burrito and regular Pepsi, the man in the kitchen created the mutant burrito. On Taco Tuesday, I would see the same two employees (or owners). \n\n   Even my friend's description of the mutant burrito couldn't prepare me for it. It was huge. Like a foot long sub huge. I should of brought a supermarket burrito and photographed the two side by side because there would be no comparison. It was full of the ingredients that make up a New Mexico burrito include salsa verde and rice. From the salsa bar near the 7-Eleven door I added red salsa. The mutant burrito was so humongous that I left some over. My only complaint is that the temperature could of been a little warmer. \n\n  On Taco Tuesday I had 3 crunchy tacos at $1 each. 2 included beef and 1chicken. With a fountain Pepsi it came to a little over $5. The tacos were good. I felt they could of used more meet. My impression is that Felipitos excells at burritos and is ordinary at tacos. That makes sense because it was the burrito that brought me to the northwest corner of Sunset and Arroyo Grande. \n\n  Felipitos has created a new life for an out of business Jack In The Box with burritos that are fit for a king. After my friend encouraged me to try their burrito and trying it for myself, I encourage you the reader to try the Felipitos burritos. If you live in the west valley, they have a location at 5095 S. Decatur Boulevard.
