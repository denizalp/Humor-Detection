What is a winesky? \n\nI'm so very glad that you asked. A winesky is a cocktail containing the happy marriage between Coach House's finest cabernet and whisky from the deepest well in all of  Scottsdale. Conceived from the mind of my favorite genius bartender, Drew, a winesky is an all out assault on your senses, and if you have one too many of them, you will surely be ass-over-tea-kettle in no time flat.\n\nCoach house is the best bar in Scottsdale. Hands down. (DJs was a close second) I generally come here with Rabbi Andrew Michael Doohan III. If it is a proper night, we will stroll in sideways at 12:00 am on the dot, and our standard order is two shots of whisky and a pitcher of Bud Light. Often, if Drew is working, he will line our order up as soon as the Rabbi and I walk in the door. He knows us a little too well, perhaps. \n\n$13 for the first round. Well shots(including wineskys) are generally $3.50. Full pitchers are $6 or $6.50(domestic, of course).\n\nI love the other bartenders too, although some of them overcharge on occasion, and they don't necessarily get my jokes.....\n\nChristmas lights from November-February. Free Barbecue every Giants home game during Spring Training, and almost every Sunday for the rest of the year.
