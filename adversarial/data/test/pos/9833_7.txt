What a dump in the hood, but darn it they have the best donuts in Las Vegas.  Staff is friendly.  I'm afraid to go there at night, but for these donuts I am willing to risk it.  I just shop fast and remember to lock the car.   Don't loiter around outside or you'll probably get offered something illegal.  Which might be your thing, but I'm just here for the donuts.  Moist.  Fresh.   A big selection.
