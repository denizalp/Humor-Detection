This place reminds me of the new Predator movie. Previews are loaded in action sequences and explosions and gun fire and sick ass stuff. Then you watch the movie and 80% of the stuff in the previews never happens or is edited to be rated G...\n\nAlmaza is possibly the worse place i've ever been to. They're under new management so no booze while paperwork is being pushed for a liquor license. \n\nStaff are complete morons or high school drop outs or their parents didnt socialize them properly when they were young so they grew up complete frakking idiots.\n\nMy party came early and requested a specific seat and he told us he'd get it cleaned up and it's ours. Then his friends walked in and he told us to hold while he devoted all his attention to them. Remember that seat we were promised? another group had that spot but he didnt know because he learned his customer service skills from a friggin potato...\n\nAfter getting place to another area we waited a good 15-20 minutes for someone to bring us a menu. after we got the menus it took 20-30 minutes someone to come back and take our order. \n\nThe hookah (midnight rose flavor) was nice and lasted the few hours we were chilling there, completely ignored by the staff, with empty cups, and one mouth piece...seriously there's 5 people at the table sharing a hookah and you only give one mouth piece...Note to who ever manages the staff: PLEASE DO NOT OPEN A TATTOO PARLOR!!\n\nFood:\nThe pita wrap was the best thing on the table and i wasn't the one that ordered it. \nThe lamb chops were...lets put it this way they were cooked earlier in the day then thrown in the fridge. When someone, like us, ordered it they threw it on the grill to get warm. What does this do? IT OVER COOKS THE MEAT. I cant believe i paid 20 bucks for rubber on bone.\n\nthe WORSE part about this place is they KNOW their service is garbage and they dont do a gorram thing about it. How do i know this? Where do i draw this conclusion from? THE TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT MANDATORY GRATUITY ON THE RECEIPT.\n\nT.I.P.S. = To Insure Proper Service\n\nTips are earned for being a good server, paying attention to your tables and going above and beyond in the realm of customer service. As a consumer i have a right to withhold a tip if the service is garbage. This place is GARBAGE
