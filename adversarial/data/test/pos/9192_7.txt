Upon entering 4 host\/hostesses greated us with sour faces. One took us to a seat on the patio. Sat at the table for fifteen minutes and no one ever came over to the table. There were only a few people in the place so being busy was no excuse. After looking at the menu and the high prices ($8.95 for hummus... Really?) We got up and left with the same four standing at the entrance not doing a thing. Good luck getting this place off the ground with this kind of service.
