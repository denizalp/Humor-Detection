My friend's friend ( brothers sister's cousin) came down for the weekend and he is vegan.This looked like the perfect spot.  As my sister is vegetarian\/vegan, I knew that I wouldn't like this place.  I am the polar opposite of a vegan.  It would be like bringing a vegan to a bbq.  The smoothies were delicious and I didn't enjoy my food even though it looked very good.  So why four stars?  My friends absolutely loved this place.  The smiles of joy on their face on every bite made me realize how good this place was for them.  The waitress was attentive and put up with all my crap. She was a saint. So if you are like me and your diet consists of meat\/fish\/poultry and french fries are the only vegetable you eat, then this place won't work for you.  If you like veggies I am pretty sure this place will be right up your alley.
