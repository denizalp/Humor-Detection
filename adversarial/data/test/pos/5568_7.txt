The stairway entry was cool.  Drinks are way overpriced, bartender with the tightest push-up bra I've ever seen was totally unprofessional.  I put my drink down, turned to put my camera back in my purse and by the time I went to grab my drink again, one of the people had already cleared the bar.  This lady bartender essentially called me a liar - said she didn't have time for \"this\" and that they hear that excuse all the time.   Maybe they get that all the time because they are throwing out people's drinks!  \nShe threatened to call security on me with her little flashlight.  What a power trip.  Stupid.  It ticks me off that the guy I KNOW to have thrown out the drink denied it completely.  How does one deny that they took a glass off the bar in the last 30 seconds?  Really? Really. The only reason I didn't make a bigger fuss was because I was with friends and didn't want to ruin their night.  \n\nI started giving this place three stars but changed it to two after getting peeved again about what happened.  Additionally, the DJ was terrible - heard the SAME song 3 times within the 2 hours we were there.  And the cheesy blue-lit bottle service Ã  la Cleopatra-carried- on-a-litter was really dumb, because the guys carrying the bottles were the same security guys aggressively flashing their little lights as they pushed through the crowd at other times.   Go if you get in free with no line, otherwise bounce.
