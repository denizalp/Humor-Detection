I was here...  you guessed it.. Saturday night. I have been drooling\/dreaming about\/over the pictures of their cheese plates and bruschetta since frequenting yelp. Every weekend I would put off going swearing I would get there next time. I finally made it and was absolutely not disappointed.\n\nI tend to stay away from super trendy places as my cheat meals generally include at least two places and a small time window. The wait is usually really long and although the service is usually good the food wait time is usually up there.\n\nI came fully prepared to wait for a while and for mediocre to bad service based on the reviews I've read. I was pleasantly surprised on both topics. We were instantly greeted at the door by a very nice\/enthusiastic hostess. She apologized that they couldn't seat us right away and helped us find a comfortable place to stand and wait for a table. The wait was about 15-20 minutes. Fearing the service I had read about I was keeping an eye for open tables. One opened and the hostess quickly cleared it and was showing us to our seat within a few moments of the table freeing up.\n\nOur waitress was at our table asking about drinks within 2 minutes of sitting down. We ordered and drinks and appetizers right away. One of the apps hit the table within 5 minutes. The only complaint I have is that it was another 5 before the rest came out. Better to serve it all at once.\n\nIn summary the service was GREAT. Total opposite of what I prepared myself for.\n\nOnto the Food:\n\n\"The Plate\":\nAn assortment of artisan meats and cheeses served with tuscan beans, olives, nuts and crostini. Absolutely delicious. There was a huge variety of olives. The goat cheese was a little ripe for my liking but that's just a personal thing. The dish needs to be served with a little more bread then was provided.\n\nBruschetta:\nBrie & Apples with Fig Spread\nProsciutto with Figs & Mascarpone\nWarm Artichoke Spread\nRicotta with Dates & Pistachios\nRoasted Peppers with Goat Cheese\nSalami with Pesto\n\nI'll spare you all super details. Just know that its all worthwhile. There were two in particular that the whole table loved. I'm not even sure \"loved\" is a strong enough word. You absolutely must try \"Brie & Apples with Fig Spread\" and \"Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone.\" Freaking delicious!\n\nThey are running a special now for an order of Bruschetta and a bottle of house wine for $20 mon-tue. This is one heck of a deal and a great way to get a little drunk and try the food on the cheap. Go and thank me later :)
