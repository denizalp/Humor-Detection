Things I like about Bouillon Bilk:\n\nA) Everything \n\nI had dinner here a few years ago and was impressed, I can't believe it's taken so long to come back.  If it's your first time here, don't be put off by the location, on a rather gritty part of lower St. Laurent.  Yes, you are in the right place and will be ushered into a serene modern space where a friendly host will whisk away your coat and seat you.  \n\nI was there for a work dinner so had to talk politely about lung disease instead of taking dozens of pictures of my food.  Please take my word for it, it's very very pretty. Absolutely gorgeous plate presentation.  \n\nWe took the five course tasting menu, consisting of sashimi, beef tartare, a pasta dish, quail and dessert.  Each course was superb.  The meal was nicely paced, taking about 2 hours to finish.  We were pleasantly full by the end. \n\nThe sommelier recommended a very nice Italian red that was moderately priced and paired well with the tasting menu. \n\nService was excellent, friendly and attentive without being intrusive.  \n\nBonus: love that this place is open on Mondays and is walking distance to Place des Arts.  Great spot for pre or post show dinner.  \n\nI definitely won't wait so long to come back again!
