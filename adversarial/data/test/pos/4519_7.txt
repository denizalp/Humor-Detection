I might just be critical because I'm indian but this food is BLAND. Service is great but the food is terrible. I won't be returning. The idea of a fast food restaurant for indian food is nice but they don't know how to cook it. Sucks to know that people are eating this and thinking this is what Indian food tastes like.
