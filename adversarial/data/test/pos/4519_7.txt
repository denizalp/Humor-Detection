Excellent Napolitan style pizza, best I've had in Charlotte by far . \n\nLocated behind the former Fiesta Jalisco restaurant on E.John by the post office, I actually ate at the Mexican 4 or 5 times before I noticed the sign and decided to include it in my search.\n\nFirst off the sauce is made with whole peeled Italian tomatoes as it should be. People who grew up with ketchup and catsup are usually not aware of this but concentrate of tomato sauce is an abomination. It has NONE of the goodness of tomatoes, instead it offers acidy evil of it's own -I can't even stand the smell of that purple-black crap.\n\nThe crust was soft and light, mildly salty (good!) and not one bit soggy in spite of being baked *just enough,* perfect. The cheese is cheesy and the pizza maker sprinkles spices to give it what the locals here hate so much: flavor!  \n\nExcellent flavor in fact, no wonder they have to hide out if sight in Matthews, while the masses line up on main street to eat crap. \n\nTo label the pizzas as \"small\" is misleading, 8 good sized slices each, more than my wife and I can eat. We also tried the Four Seasons which was very, very good but I personally always prefer Napolitan (plain) unless it's a thin crust. I absolutely pigged out and here I am, hours later with a sweet aftertaste and nary a sign of protest from my belly. \n\nNo miracles, the owner\/chef is a middle aged Italiano (not American- Eyetalian).\n\nnote: There's no eating on the premises, strictly take-out.\nTue-Thu 11- 8pm\nFri- Sat 11 - 9pm \nclosed Sun-Mon
