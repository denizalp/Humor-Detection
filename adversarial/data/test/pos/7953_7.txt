Let me start off by saying this review is long overdue!  I'm just trying to play catch up here. :-P\n\nA lot of Yelpers have ragged on das Hofbrauhaus mainly for the service, but I love this place!  I've been here a few times and I've never had a bad experience, even when it was super packed, which is very often!  There's a line to get in on the weekends, so be prepared.\n\nI know this is a national chain and like most Yelpers, I prefer to stick to the local places, but I really enjoy the food (and drink) and ambiance here.  \nThe schnitzel is lightly seasoned, pounded out thin, and fried to a tender golden brown.  The sides they offer are good, but nothing special.  The pierogies were very good and filling, but I think I prefer the ones at Sokolowski's over HBH's. My brother in law raved about how good the sauerkraut balls were before this place even opened. I've had them on two separate occasions, and I must say I agree...they are fantastic!  They're filled with a mixture of corned beef and sauerkraut and fried up til firm and oh so scrumptious!  Put these golf ball-sized bundles of joy into your mouth and you'll see what I'm talking about!  Nomnomnom! The honey mustard dipping sauce pairs well with these balls.  The giant pretzels with beer cheese are great too!  After seeing all the pics of the ginormous bier battered onion rings, I'll be sure to try them next time!  \n\nThe beer (bier) hall here is really fun! There's always live bands playing polka or your favorite German tunes and it makes for a hip, family-friendly atmosphere.  Singing along and dancing on the benches is definitely encouraged.  I love me some Chicken Dance!  I'm not a beer connoisseur  by any means, but the beer (brewed in-house) is really good.  Dunkel is favorite!  Oh, and if you come with a group, you have to try the shot skis!\n\nThe wait staff is attentive and friendly. The ladies where these little ensembles that bare a lot of cleavage and the men wear traditional German Lederhosen! Love it!  Like I mentioned, Yelpers have complained about poor service, but I guess I've been lucky and have had pretty good service each time I've gone, although it takes a bit longer to receive your food when it's a madhouse. (Duh)\n\nI'm looking forward to my next visit to Hofbrauhaus!  Prost!
