DIM SUM suckas! DIM SUM.\n\nDim Sum is the greatest thing to hit food since teeth.\n\nI have been holding off on writing this Yelp for months now.  I just could not figure out a way to wrap my head around the awesomeness that is Dim Sum.  I have been eating here pretty much every weekend since I was first introduced to it by fellow Yelpers Jenn H. and  Scott S.  Joe Crack played a role in the introduction as well.  Joe Crack is not a Yelper (He should be though.) but he is a wizard.  So you should be willing to take the suggestion of someone so wise in the ways of the world. He also coined the phrase \"No Goddamn BBQ pork bun!\" Which turns out to be a useful phrase when having Dim Sum, cause they try to shove that down your throat from every cart that comes strolling by.\n\nThe absolute greatest thing about Dim Sum is the ability to be eating awesome food within seconds of sitting down.  From the moment you sit down they are coming by with carts of amazing, trying to get you to try everything from BBQ pork bun to Chicken feet.  You could, if you were so inclined, be in and out of the place in 15 minutes and have a belly full of really tasty Chinese food bits. \n\nSome of my favorite things are:\nThe Chinese Broccoli\nThe Spring rolls\nThe Curry meat Triangles\nThe pot stickers\nAnd...\n\nMy absolute favorite is the Sticky rice. If you go to Dim Sum you have to get the sticky rice.  It is a ball of rice wrapped in a lotus leaf.  Then Jesus and Buddha get together and cry tears of joy over the amazing creation. Then Luke Skywalker and Captain Kirk bless it with a light saber and Tricorder. Then Kurt Cobain plays a misunderstood song over it. Then right before it gets to your table the entire restaurant does a rendition of \"Be our Guest\" from Beauty and the Beast as Pamela Anderson and Jenna Jameson deliver it while talking in tongues.  \nIt is that good people.
