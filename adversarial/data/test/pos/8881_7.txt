I came here because I was in desperate need of an alcoholic beverage. I was actually trying to find 4 peaks, and ran into this place instead.  I pulled up and noticed that its not like the other places out there.  Colorful, eclectic, with an island kind of feel.  Very open and airy.  There seemed to be a college kid aurora, but I did notice a few adults there drinking as well.\n\nPlace is colorfully decorated, with great drink prices.  I guess they serve food too, but I didnt eat here.  Great alternative to your typical place.
