I wasn't impressed with the quality of their furniture.  A lot of pieces looked nice...but after a closer inspection, I discovered it was crap. I'm sorry.  I really wanted to like this place. The prices are good. This crap is great for a young couple starting out. I was hoping to find some furniture with quality construction that will last forever. This is just a step above IKEA.
