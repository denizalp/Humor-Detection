Had a late breakfast today for my first trip to this cafe. The interior is reminiscent of an IHOP, but the service, menu and food are top notch! Gina was our server, and she is ON it. Our coffee cups were never under half full. She's prompt on ordering, and our meals came out quickly. Portion sizes are large! My coworker ordered the power wrap with egg whites, spinach and peppers. She said it's delicious; served with a side of fruit. I made my own omelet with avocado, turkey bacon and turkey sausage... it was exactly what I was craving! It is served with two sides- I opted for fruit only, but there are about 7-8 options! The menu is full of really creative options I would love to come back to try out! Thank you Gina for a fantastic experience.
