Many points of this crap hole to write about. Walking in it took a moment for the counter girl to greet my party, she was very busy texting. We didn't get to watch the safety video, mainly because safety is not a concern at this place. Walking in we were pointed to the very abused helmet selection. I asked if they could clean my helmet visor and was handed a head sock and Windex. I used the bathroom which looked as though heroin addicts lived in there, fucking disgusting. The carts are so abused and gutless, very little power. The employee said that i had to use the cart i was told to use. Mean while he drove the one cart with a new engine. I watched him drive head on into traffic to adjust the safety barriers, seriously is that their protocol? After driving for a moment I spun out and waited what seemed to be eternity for some help, it never came. I pushed myself back into the \"race\". Finishing this shitty experience we walked out so disappointed. Once again the counter girl was outside smoking and texting, should have expected that. date of disappointment was 05\/13\/17 about noon. SAVE YOUR MONEY GO TO POLE POSITION!!!!!!!
