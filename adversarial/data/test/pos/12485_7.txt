This ain't no secret, Convive was a surprise. Surrounded by the Old Navys and Massage Envys of a [mostly] chain shopping district, a CUSTOM SLAYER can be found executing perfectly pulled espressi. That's impressive anywhere, but especially so in this case, since this is the first Slayer in Pittsburgh, and it's even custom and it's barely even in Pittsburgh. But that's not all. You will also find a dude named Ryland roasting wonderfully sourced coffees on a nice little Deidrich. Yes, they roast. And they roast because they actually know how to roast, not because of lack of better knowledge. \n\nThe pour-over I chose was of the Congo variety. It was appropriately sweet with a great complexity. I enjoyed it enough to emit audible words of praise to my buddies. I can't complain about such. Plus Ryland was cool and let us sample other coffees after we talked to him long enough for him to realize that we were coffee peoples. \n\nI wasn't looking for specialty coffee in McCandless Crossing but I was delighted with what I found. \n\n(Also, Convive, Commonplace and Klvn. Is this a cult? They all sound vaguely similar. And can I join?)
