I am so glad that they give you a date for delivery. The only thing more disappointing than Canpar's reliability is their customer service, and the Oilers. Don't bother calling for help because you will know more than anyone on the phone. If you are a business that ships I highly recommend using Canpar if you don't care about your customers. I did, at least, get a lot of cleaning done while waiting. Oh, I'm still waiting and man is my house cleaning. Did I mention that I fear using the washroom incase the delivery finally arrives.
