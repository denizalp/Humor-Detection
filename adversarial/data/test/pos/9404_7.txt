Skyloft in MGM... apart from the regular rooms in MGM.... it is very modern and chic.  We've stayed in the 1 bedroom and 2 bedroom suites before.  The rooms has plenty of space and the service is very attentive.  The rooms are huge could fit 3-4 people at least in a 1 bedroom and more than 10 in 2 bedroom if you really wanted to.  \n\nCons:  you would want to stay in the room 24\/7.. which leaves not  enough time for gambling!
