Seriously, if you like every single thing you eat to be cooked on a griddle with pig juice go here.  As a vegetarian and having ordered and partially eaten the greasy home-fries and `vegetable` omelet I was then horrified to see how it was made when I went up to pay.  Right next to the bacon with the juices used to cook my meat-free lunch.  I feel sick writing this.\n\nThe waitress and cook, who were very friendly by the way, acted as if I was talking a foreign language when I asked if anything they served did not come off the grill plate.  Not healthy and not clean.  The year is 2010 and they should know better.
