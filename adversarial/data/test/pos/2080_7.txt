NO STARS!!!! I came here to return a phone. And\nWhen it was finally my turn waiting just to hand the phone to someone. I was told that someone else was now next instead of me because they had an appointment. But whatever. I don't like AT&T they are rude they think their apple or something and then they try to rape you and take your money. Sorry. Just a review. This store is mucho mucho LAME.
