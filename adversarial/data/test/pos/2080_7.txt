Not all Danny's Car Washes are the same that is for sure. I like going to this particular location because they really do a good job on my car. I find it that if you go early, like when the first open, they are EXTRA attentive to your car. There have been other locations that no matter when you go, they just don't seem to do as good of a job as this location. Sad but true.\n\nSo if you are able to visit this particular location, my suggestion to you is go early. :)
