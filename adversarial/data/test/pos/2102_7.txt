Pretty good brunch place in the downtown area. My wife and I split the poached egg panini, the mac and cheese, and an almond croissant. The almond croissant was a little doughy and felt more like a sourdough than anything else. The mac and cheese was really good, I'm glad that it contained real mushrooms to add an earthy touch. The panini was solid, just a little plain. We got a chocolate brioche to go and oh man it had so much chocolatey goodness it was so goddam delicious. Would recommend for brunch.
