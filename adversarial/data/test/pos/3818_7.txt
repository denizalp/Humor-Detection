Woman vs. food....literally.\n\nAs far as Vegas buffets go, Wicked is definitely at the top of its game. I came on a weekday and price was $38 a person for dinner, but here's a secret trick: come on a weekend around 2pm to get brunch, and at 3pm they change the food to dinner items. You get the brunch price which is cheaper, and you get the best of both worlds (prime rib esp!)\n\nI've been to many vegas buffets including Bacchanal, Bellagio, and Planet Hollywood, but Wicked Spoon totally shits on all of them. Wicked has pretty much all the same food selections as other buffets, but quality and selection is kicked up a notch.\n\nWhat I love most about Wicked is its trendy atmosphere and ambience. The seating is very open and it's quite spacious, but there really aren't any tables that are too far from the food.\n\nOn top of that, the food is phenemonal. My favorite meats are the prime rib cuts, pork shoulder, satayed clams, and the crab legs (they aren't too salty which is great because you can eat more lol). Beverages are also included. I tried the grapefruit juice but it wasn't my favorite since it tasted really bitter..but I guess that only means it really is fresh squeezed! I usually stick to the tomato juice which is kinda like a thicker smoothie version of V8.\n\nThe dessert bar did not disappoint. A wide range of desserts available including cupcakes, mousses, cookies, chocolate covered strawberries, and a lot of other unique things. The gelato bar is impressive...over 10 different flavors and I tested out 5 kinds and they didn't just taste like plain milk, each one had it's own distinct flavor!!! The flavors were so bold and unique and pretty sure I would probably be able to name each flavor if I was blindefolded. Amazinnnn. \n\nWhen it comes to Vegas buffets, this is the only buffet you need. Clean and well-organized establishment. Well worth the money!
