HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND STORE POLICIES. \n\nSally sends me email blast daily to inform of sales and promotions. They currently emailed me about a bogo offer on a particular shampoo & conditioner I use. \n\nI shopped online and was going to make my purchase for the current bogo promotion. I realized that shipping was $5.99 so I cancelled the process of my online order. I live very close to this Rainbow\/Spring Mountain location so I decided to pick up and save on unnecessary shipping cost.  \n\nWell, this is where my nightmare began once I brought my items to the counter. The cashier Maggie rang up my items and gave me a full price total. I informed her they are currently buy 1 get 1, she was clueless to the current Sally sale. There were signs up posted in front of the product stating bogo offer.  She told me there was nothing she could do and that I needed a \"code\". I pulled up the sale on my phone from their direct website. I educated her that there is no code. \n\nShe then called her co-worker Christina over to add insult to injury. She claims they don't match prices or honor their website pricing or email sales blast. I reminded her that they have sale stickers in store on their own shelves in front of the product.\n\nShe then went to the back of the store to call her Manager Biby where I waited awhile as Christina claimed she could not reach Biby at the time.\nI asked why they are putting me through this, I have been a loyal customer for the last 8 years. Their Sally Beauty website would let me order and get the bogo price however I did not place my order do to shipping. I just live down the street so why not just pick up?\n\nAnyhow, Christina finally got in touch with her Manager Biby and told me that she said NO. She refuses to honor the pricing on the website and on the email I received.  \n\nThe employees Maggie and Christina even told me and agreed that the system is wrong and that Sally's\/MGR should honor the price advertised online and email.\n\nSally Beauty pulled the bait & switch on me. Instead of help me and make things right to keep a loyal customer of 8 yrs. They argue with me and blame their Manager Biby and stupid store policies etc.\n\n Christina then gave me the number to Corporate (866) 234-9442 to call and complain even though this location is a franchise. \n\nThis store location is bad in every way and even though I remained calm and composed. I feel that Maggie and Christina just don't care and are clueless on all levels. This store needs some serious help as I have had other past issues with them making mistakes and refusing to help.
