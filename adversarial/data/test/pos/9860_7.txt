Moneyline? Pass! Give me a lifeline!\n\nOh, Moneyline. I didn't want to review you but you floored me for three days with food poisoning and you have made my life hell. Have you ever endured a 4.5 hour drive while having your stomach try to expel all fluids from your body? It's not fun. I don't think I ever meditated so hard in my life.\n\nI was next door at Juniper having a fun time and wanted some noms to soak up the booze. Moneyline was the only place open at the time so enter the Truffle Quesadilla. Sounds marvelous for a sports book place, right? WRONG! It was greasy and it was bland. I had two meager slices before pushing it away. Four hours later, I was puking into the hotel trashcan for three straight hours before weakly climbing into the car to head home. No bueno.\n\nI will say that Moneyline looks fun as heck. Bowling, pool tables, et cetera... One of the more interesting sports book on The Strip for sure!
