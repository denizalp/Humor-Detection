I order the Chicken Marsala and it was pretty good. Let me tell you what wasn't good. The fact that I had to fight several flies for my food and that the waitress was on a different planet. It was so distracting and disgusting. I wasn't even sitting outside so there's no excuse. I can't imagine what the flies were doing in the kitchen and right now I'm about to gag. Again, the food was fine. I just couldn't enjoy because I felt like I was in a third world country being served by a space cadet.
