Best FOOT Spa......that's about it....when it came time for the body massage,that's when things got outta control.\n\nElaine(Eileen?) was my masseuse and boy did she try her hardest to untangle my knots. I asked her to ease off on the presssure and it was cool, and I was starting to fall asleep but was surprisingly awakened after a few minutes when she squeezed the Charmin.....TWICE! I was like WTH?!?!?!\n\nAnd the phone calls kept coming, which messed up the zen moment....\nOverall, it was aight....ALOHA!!!
