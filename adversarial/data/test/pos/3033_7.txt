Absolutely horrible service twice. The first time they told my mother to come right down and they could take her right back. I raced home from work and met her there where they said we will take you back in a few minutes. One and a half hours later they took her. It would have been fine had they said that from the beginning but you don't tell people \"right back\" and then have it be 1.5 hours. Second time we had an appointment and got there and after waiting 30 minutes past the appointment time someone came out and said it would be another 45 minutes. So what exactly was the point of the appointment I am wondering? No one ever apologized either time and said they were running behind or anything. In the future when we need x-rays\/MRI's, we will be looking for a new place to go. Service here is just unacceptable.
