Dude.  We NEED something like this in Chicago.\n\nBeing a gal from the big, bad city of Chicago, I was unaware of how many local farms are located in the Madison area.  Well, lemme tell you, I sure found out on Saturday morning at the Farmers Market.  I was blown away at how much fabulous, fresh, locally grown and organic produce, meats, cheeses, ciders, baked goods and well, pretty much anything else you can imagine, are right at your fingertips in Madison.\n\nI would advise getting there as early as possible.  Folks definitely have their favorite farms and some of the popular produce can be picked over.  But you KNOW that I woke up at the crack of dawn to get down to the market, so I pretty much had my pick of the litter.\n\nI came away with a veritable bounty of great stuff that is not only good for you because it's as fresh as possible and mostly grown without any chemicals, but its cheap!\n* An overflowing pint of raspberries that I may or may not have already finished.\n* Huge, gorgeous leeks\n* Multicolored bell peppers.  Purple peppers?  Why not!\n* The biggest, freshest bunch of dill I've seen.  What can I make with dill???\n* Organic honeycrisp apples that will be quite excellent this week for lunch that were sold by the hottest farmer ever.\n* A full pound of locally grown green beans.  Crisp.  Delicious.\n* Head of fuzzy garlic.  I'm told it's a bit sweeter than regular garlic.  We shall see!\n\nMy head was spinning with excitement at the awesomeness of this Farmers Market.  Its such a treat to have access to such wonderful, healthy food.  I can't wait to go back!!
