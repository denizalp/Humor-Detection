The Gun Store is ten minutes east of the MGM Grand on Tropicana and allows you to shoot many of the guns you've seen in popular action movies.  Shooting a gun is just fun, who doesn't want to be the action hero.  Four great guns you can shoot there:\n\n1. The Glock 9mm.  It's small, evenly weighted and simple to use, with a very effective sight.  Best handgun ever?  They also carry the subcompact \"baby Glock\" 26.\n\n2. The big .45 magnum revolvers like Clint Eastwood sports in the Dirty Hairy movies.  It looks fab, but it's like shooting a pirate cannon, odds are you won't get close to the bullseye, and it sort of hurts.  \n\n3. The 9mm Beretta that James Bond was so fond of, before the Walther PPK.  \n\n4. Just about any machine gun, tommy gun, or automatic weapon you can think of.  \n\nIn my opinion the handguns offer the best value.  You can take your time, aim, and work on your accuracy.  The machine guns are mostly like operating a jackhammer, or holding onto a rollercoaster restraining bar.  They're loud as hell, hard to control, and at $1 a bullet it's possible to go through $100 in 30 seconds.  So I'd go with the handguns.\n\nThis place is well run with friendly, professional employees who get you in and out with minimal drama.  They're very inclusive - the last time I was there, the person in line in front of me was a 60 something grandma with an M4 Carbine automatic rifle.  Bitchin Granny!
