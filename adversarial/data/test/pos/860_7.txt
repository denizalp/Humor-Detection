My neighbor was getting his palm trees trimmed and I needed the same so I walked next door and saw a logo'd truck and multiple workers with matching uniforms.  I thought \"whoops... Looks pricier than usual\" but, I decided to inquire anyway.  The owner (Howard) who also climbs the trees is a professional, college educated, businessman who not only had himself and crew do the best job I have experienced, he also provided tips on tree care.  The clean-up after the job was great.  GUESS WHAT?  It was also less expensive.  I highly recommend Treewise and will become a repeat customer.  Also, it's fun to watch Howard swing from tree to tree like Tarzan.
