I'M WRITING THIS OUT OF GUILT\n\nI just made a purchase from Cartier Los Angeles (which branch is unimportant), and while the sales associate there was polite, the interaction was as perfunctory as with a bank teller wearing a practiced smile.  I couldn't help but compare her to a certain SA I met at this Cartier Vegas inside Crystals.  It was a while back, his name I forgot, but he wore glasses and sported a Cartier Love Bracelet...a bit flamboyant, but it would later make sense.\n\nDressed in trash couture, my sweetie and I explained to him we were out-of-towners just passing through.  Clearly, zero commission to be made.  Still, he initiated a warm conversation and encouraged my sweetie to try on various pieces in their collection.  She happily obliged.  He spent a great amount of time passionately describing how the natural wear of metals adds character, the nuances of platinum and white gold, and the history behind various Cartier lines.  With no intent to buy, I felt bad my sweetie kept trying on jewelry, so I began to send him signals like staring at the exit and gasping aloud at the prices.  However, dude just would not stop, and I began to realized what I was witnessing was not a sales pitch, but a crazy f@ck -- a guy obsessed about fine jewelry and the Cartier legacy.  He proudly pulled back his jacket sleeve to show-off his own Love Bracelet, then went on to explain how the gold screws are meant for this iconic piece to be worn without ever being taken off -- symbolic of a promise.  He brought out a shiny Love Bracelet from the back and giddily placed it on my sweetie's wrist with his gloved hands. \n\nWe didn't buy anything, but thanked him and left the store. I noticed my sweetie had this crazy glazed look.  I knew I was screwed...the new MV Agusta would have to wait.\n\nFast forward to today, I'm glad I eventually bought what my sweetie wanted, but feel slightly guilty it wasn't through this particular guy during our subsequent trips to Vegas.  With all the time he spent with us, helping me accept that jewelry shopping -- like love -- is not a thing of logic, I at least owe him this 5 star review.  Hopefully, Cartier headquarters realizes Mr. Love Bracelet is worth more to their company than three completely sane SA's.
