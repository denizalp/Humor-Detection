Waited an hour for a damn sandwich.  No complimentary anything for the ridiculously long wait, not even an apology. They didn't even know what food went to what guests and had to ask the dining room as a whole who ordered what. On top of all that when we got to the house and unpacked the food we discovered we were missing food.\n\nThey should do less bs-ing in the back and behind the counter, drop the attitude, and get on their jobs. The food itself wasn't bad but not worth going through all that for.
