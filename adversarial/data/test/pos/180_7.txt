I heard about this little gallery and decided today would be a great time to visit since had some free time. There is a Tim Burton showing as well for the next couple of weeks. I love all things Jack from the Nightmare Before Christmas. This little gallery although small is so well played out. I was talking with the curator and she was explaining to us that artists can list their art for as little as $5.00; depending on the show. \n\nI am very psyched to see an establishment in Vegas that is a small studio where little known artists can go to showcase their art to the public. A lot of the pieces here have prices located on the individual pieces so one already knows how much it costs ahead of time. Such a rare place in Vegas to support local artists and the gallery is even free to come check out their local talent.
