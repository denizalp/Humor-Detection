This is my first time to get pizza from Little Caesars.  My husband wanted to their pizza.  I think he wanted to re-live so childhood or something.  LOL!!\n\nI ordered a large supreme and 3 meats pizza.  Then I ordered 2 orders of garlic and parm chicken wings and 1 order of the lemon pepper wings.  So the cashier rung me up and $34+.  I handed him the debt card and he said, oh we can only take cash our machines are not working.  Really, he could have told me before I ordered.  I had to walk next door to Fresh & Easy to buy something so I can get cash back.  =(  \n\nThe pizza and chicken wings were ok.  I wouldn't get them again.
