I stopped in here on a \"Welcome back to Phoenix, time to try new bars\" tour. . . and was instantly a fan. \n\nFirst impression ~ Great vibe. Dimly lit, white pleather booths, trippy artwork, great indie music, funky light fixtures, excellent drink menu & CARTOONS on the tv's.. Seriously, any bar with cartoons will immediately win my heart. The exposed brick and hardwood floors were a nice touch giving it a more upscale feel. We sat at the bar, which is where my only complaint will come in.. the bar \"stools\" were extremely awkward and uncomfortable.. I ended up standing most of the time because my ass was not fitting in the oddly shaped groove. Whatever, its just a bar stool. My friends and I had to try the Absinthe, which, when prepared correctly (which it was) is always a good time. They also carry bubblegum vodka, which is possibly the most delicious thing I have ever put in my mouth! I was told there was a smoking patio, but instead it was more of a smokers staircase.. but I cant really complain about it because it had a decent view and nobody caters to nicotine feens anymore. There weren't too many people there so our bartender was super attentive which was rad. This place is great for groups, and dates alike.. very intimate feel in those dark little corners :o)
