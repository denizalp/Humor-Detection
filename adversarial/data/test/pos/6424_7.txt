Very cool place! A variety of locally sourced food can be found here. We came here on a Saturday morning and parking was a breeze - the parking deck provides ample parking. But take note - DO NOT LOSE your parking ticket  - hard lesson for me, as I lost it and had to pay the $16 lost ticket fee. OUCH.  For folks who hold onto their tickets - there is validated parking for up to 90 minutes.\n\nThere is a nice mix of vendors - all of them are friendly, knowledgeable, and very passionate about their products! You have everything from pizza to sushi, to cupcakes to chocolates, to gourmet cheeses to interesting salts! We were impressed all the vendors - can't wait to go back!
