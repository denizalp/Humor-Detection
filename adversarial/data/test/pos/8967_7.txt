I'm sure this little tid-bit of info is included in the membership agreement we all sign....but I didn't know this until last week!\n\nPrices are guaranteed for 30 days...so if you buy a $1k tv and it goes on sale, or has a discount in their coupon book, just bring your receipt and they will give you the difference back in cash, no questions asked!  This is for EVERYTHING!  \n\nAmazing doubled factory warranties on items, 90 day return policy on electronics, and friendly staff.  SUCK IT, SAM'S!
