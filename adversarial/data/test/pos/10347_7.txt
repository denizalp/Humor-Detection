I really wanted to believe the food lived up to the name. The photos here on Yelp looked amazing, and I do think their plating is lovely. The service is great, and that's why I didn't just give it one star. The restaurant is clean, sparse, but inviting. There, the goodness stops.\n\nThe food was below par, lacking in the subtle layers of flavor Thai food is so well known for, and every dish was swimming in grease. Noodles were stuck together, and even the fried rice had no taste. The portions were generous. My husband's Larb had a strange sweetness to it, and not enough vinegar. Nothing eaten here could compare with Chai Tips, just a few miles away. \n\nNothing eaten here could compare to Thai Basil, just across Simmons. Amazing Thai is much pricier than Chai Tips, but the food quality is below par. We won't be going back, even though the staff could not be nicer, nor the place cleaner. It's just in need of a chef who can bring out the unique notes of Thai food. Hopefully, it will improve in time, and with a new chef. \n\nUntil then, Chai Tips and Thai Basil will continue to be our \"Go TO\" Asian restaurants in our area.
