I had upper eyelid surgery and went home with one eye still stitched closed. When I went back he just said \"oops I forgot to take them out\" I went back and said I didn't notice much difference. He got agetated, went in the other room to get pictures. I waited over 1 hour in the waiting room before and rushed off to work late! I ask for partial money back and he said he would still charge for certain surgery costs. I could not spend more. Later, I received an email that sounded so personal I felt violated that I even let him do my surgery. Creeped out considering how friendly He was before surgery. He emailed me a long angry email saying that I am the kind of person that will go to a restaurant get a meal take a bite and send it back which I have never done in my life. That's so unprofessional and scary that I let him do my operation. I also now have a very large scar on my eyelid because it wasn't cut in the crease. I feel he rushes through surgeries one after the other and even their reception just admitted it. FOR MONEY in my observations. I see there are a lot of good reviews for him and that scares me that some people did not see this other side.I can't even go back and look at the email, it was so personal!
