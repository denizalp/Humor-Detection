What's a Canada visit without immersing yourself into its traditional institutions?\n\nI'm talking about first name Timmy, last name Horton's. (Drake reference for those who didn't catch that).\n\nI didn't go all out, but what McD's is for everyone in MURICA. Canadians give thanks and realize there's no escaping Tim Horton's.\n\nSo what did I get?\n\nCroissant and a Latte. The Latte although from the machine wasn't bad, just standard fast food coffee. The Croissant isn't as buttery and flaky than what I'm used to, it had a deeper and more savory taste (maybe it's the Canadian dairy)? Either way, after an 8hr flight with only Canada Dry in my system, I needed something in my stomach.\n\nThis isn't Canada's standard of gastronomy but after all the episodes of HIMYM and the many Canadian homies who share of their experiences of this place. I just had to join in on the fun and see what it's all about.\n\nCheers!
