I was actually really taken aback by all the positive reviews this place has received.  Maybe I went in on a bad day?  \n\nBecause I was unfamiliar with the menu, my boyfriend and the barista assured me I wasn't obligated to order from the menu and I could have anything I wanted.  So I ordered \"a shot in the dark,\" which, anywhere else I've ordered it, it's been a cup of coffee with a shot of espresso.\n\nWhen I told the barista that's what I wanted, she replied (somewhat haughtily): \"We don't really do that, because that compromises the flavor profile of the coffee.  I can get you a cup of coffee and an espresso.\"\n\nEXCUSE ME?!??  I don't have to order from the menu and I can have anything I want and then you're going to ARGUE with me about my order??\n\nI tensely agreed to have my order the way SHE TOLD ME TO and even left a dollar in the tip jar (I can't help myself, I used to work in the service industry and know how hard it is and am just unable to resist dropping a dollar into an open tip jar despite being treated poorly).\n\nWhen my order (totaling about $8, mind you) was placed on the counter, I dumped the shot of espresso into the coffee in front of both baristas and walked out without saying a word. \n\nUnless for some reason goods and services are provided to me without charge, I will NEVER set foot in this establishment again.  The coffee wasn't that good (and yes, I'm willing to admit that perhaps I \"don't know\" good coffee) but I would rather go to a lousy national chain than ever give this company one more cent of my money the next time I need a caffeine fix. \n\n I am glad more people in this thread have had a more positive experience, because, honestly, this was one of the worst coffee\/customer experiences of my life.  I was unable to calm down for a few hours afterward.  If this establishment burns to the ground (without anyone getting hurt), I'd be thrilled.
