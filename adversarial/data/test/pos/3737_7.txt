I would stay far away from Mad City Sales. After purchasing a car from them last year, I learned that the CD player was broken, a fuel cap was missing, and (when I had a flat) that the spare tire was damaged and unusable. Unfortunately, I didn't realize these things until after the 3 month deal that would have still ensured that I would have had to pay half for the repairs.\n\nIt's probably obvious from the television commercials that this isn't a quality business. Nonetheless, I'm writing to spare anyone the experience I had.
