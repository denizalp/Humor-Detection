Yes, its add to my donk, junky fast food, but it makes me the happiest girl in the world... until after I've finished eating it.\n\nWhen I wan't to zonk out and not by means of alcohol, I go here, and order a Whopper or Whopper Jr. w\/ cheese no pickles and no onions. On comes the beef induced 4-6 hour coma...yes, I don't process meat (intolerant to pork, so we don't eat bacon or sausage!) too well, and I'm not a fan of chicken in general, and their fish sandwich, its not bad, but I'm into the fresh out of the water type fishes. BK fries aren't really all that bad, but if I'm just getting fries, you'll find me at the McD down the street.\n\nHaven't dined-in at this location in many many years, so I have no clue what the interior even looks like anymore. Drive thru is simplest. That way, I can take my artery clogging meal home to eat, where I'm close to my comfy bed.
