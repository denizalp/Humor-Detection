Called Beck 2 hours ahead to have a cab pick me up at 1pm.  At 1:10 I called again and the operator said \"I'll tell them to hurry up.\"  Huh?  Finally a cab showed at 1:15 and the driver said he only got the call 5 minutes earlier.  So what happened to my first request?\n\nIf you cannot get a cab when you need one by calling ahead, what good is this company?  I was only on time for my flight because it too was delayed.  Ah, Toronto.
