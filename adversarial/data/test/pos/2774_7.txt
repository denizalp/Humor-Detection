So after living here three years we finally made it over to Earl's which I had heard so much about for Brunch on Sunday. So if you didn't get it from the name it is a grocery store that has a pretty decent line up of food.\n\nIf you are looking for a low key weekend brunch place this is it! Order at the counter in the back but don't forget to decide on what you want to drink from the barista (at the front register) so you can order your food and beverages together in one order.\n\nI got their breakfast tacos which come one per order and you can get them with flour or corn tortillas which I was super happy about since I think flour tortillas are just wrong! I got one taco and one of their amazing cinnamon rolls. Get a cinnamon roll if they have them you will not regret it.\n\nWe would have totally made it out of the place having one of the cheapest brunches ever if we had not been lured into the grocery side of it. They had Jenni's ice cream which is a pretty big deal and very hard to find along with a few other exciting items that ended up coming home with us.\n\nI wish we had tried this place sooner:)
