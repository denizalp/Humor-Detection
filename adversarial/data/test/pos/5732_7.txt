I seen this company's truck driving down the street today and decided to give them a call and get an estimate on cleaning a couple of my BBQ grills and when the gentleman answer the phone he was asking me a couple of questions and I did not know the answers to the questions he was asking me so he got frustrated and laughed at me on the phone and would not give me a straight answer as far as what they would charge me to clean my grills! If you can't even be professional over the phone how can you please be professional in the business you're working in! I explained to him that I am a homeowner who just purchased a home and the barbecue that is there was there when I purchased a home so I do not know how many burners are on the grill never even thought to look so for him to get upset is pretty unprofessional! And I will also add a screenshot of the text message this gentleman just sent me! Buyers beware stay away from this company very unprofessional
