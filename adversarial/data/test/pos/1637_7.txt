My BFF got a room here with her timeshare points so this is my 2nd time at the Grand Chateau. This time we stayed as \"hotel guests\" rather than \"timeshare guests\". The room was smaller, like a hotel room and not an apartment setting. We still got a small refrigerator, microwave, toaster and a very small sink. \n\nThe sofa bed was so much better than the one in the room from my previous visit..... this one had a memory foam mattress which was SUPER comfortable!\n\nThe bathroom was basic, and different from the one in the unit we had before. Still, it sufficed for the duration of our stay.\n\nReally good location within walking distance to Planet Hollywood, Aria, The Cosmopolitan.
