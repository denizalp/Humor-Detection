It was after a Yelp event nearby, I was led here by my new friend Elaine K, and some less newer friends.  I originally had my heart set on something more hardy, like dim sum, but I recently got onto this thing where I have to take other people's feelings into consideration, so I didn't say anything.\n\nObviously I was here with a bunch of Yelpers, which meant ordering took forever.  We finally decided on approximately seven dishes, maybe there was more.  This was the problem, the food wasn't bad, but it certainly did not impress me.  It says gourmet, gourmet tends to sticks to the cerebellum by impressing the palate.  \nMaybe I should have ordered the roast duck, or tried the more extravagant seafood.  \nI might come back just to do that and give House of Gourmet another chance.\n\nThere was no decor, the space looked like most Chinese restaurants, round tables with white linen.  It was a lot more bigger than I expected a restaurant on Dundas would be.  Four two five tables across, and it went in pretty deep.  This was a good feeling.  The clientele was mostly Mainland Cantonese people, with a dash of French speaking tourists.  So I guess, it's as diverse as Chinatown.\n\nThe service was efficient, prompt, and without bullshit.  It's not friendly, or unfriendly.\nThe waitress was clearly just here to do here job, and nothing else.  I can appreciate that.  \n\nThere was seven or us, or eight, or six.  We didn't know each other too well yet, so nobody took a risk by engaging in any in-depth topics of conversation involving sensitive topics.  Or maybe I did...damn I can't remember anything.  This restaurant really was very forgettable.  \n\nThere was a vegetarian at our table, who was considering going vegan...so naturally I (very politely) bullied him all night.
