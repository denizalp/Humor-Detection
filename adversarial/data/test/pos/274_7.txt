Background\/disclaimer: pretty big Guy Fieri fan, came with some other Yelpers (thanks to Michael U. for the invite and Norm K. as well) to try some breakfast items.\n\nThis is my 420th review, in case that has any special significance. I'm sure it does but I just can't think of it right now...\n\nI was a little late to the occasion, but I still got to try a variety of items from the new breakfast menu. The maple bacon french toast was pretty good. I would have liked the brioche to have more of a crunch, but it was pretty fluffy. The candied bacon was a little more toward crunchy then chewy and if you like a sugar coating on your bacon, you're in for a treat. The brulee banana didn't really add that much contrasting texture or flavor for me, but maybe I've just been eating too much banana lately.\n\nShortbread pancake and berry \"pot pie\" didn't do it for me. Thought that the pancakes were too soft and fell apart a little bit too much (could be personal preference) and didn't have too much flavor. The berry compote and accompanying syrup are far from overly sweet and are actually a little sour, so at least you know they're not hiding the actual flavor of the berries.\n\nEach of the dishes apparently came with a shot of a vegetable juice. Hopefully Michael or Norm have the full ingredient list down. I did like the juice, which didn't have any hints of foulness or additives. Nice of them to give you something healthy.\n\nSince we stayed past breakfast (8-11am), we were able to split a dessert from the regular menu. It was the S'mores monte cristo. This was my favorite part of the meal, with the deep fry treatment crisping up the brioche from the french toast being and melting a bunch of marshmallow and chocolate (plus graham cracker butter, apparently). Chocolate and raspberry syrups upped the indulgence factor a ton, and I enjoyed every bite.\n\nAmbiance: not too loud, classic American music like The Doors and The Beatles, apparently uses old tables and intentionally dinged menu covers (for the breakfast menu) to try to capture the been-around-a-while feel. Can't complain. \n\nService: good as far as I saw, as they relocated our party to a larger table, brought out plates and utensils as needed, and never were absent for too long. I think they really emphasize service and want to show that they're trying hard by having a manager walk around to ask if everything's fine and by letting you review the experience through an app on the iPod\/iPhone placed inside the checkbook.\n\nI was hovering around a 3.5 rating, but since I generally look at 4 star places as ones that I would prefer to eat at again, I can't give that rating to this restaurant. It's Strip-priced and, based only on what I ate, I've been to better breakfast places around town in that price range or a slightly lower range. I did find it cool to see the open kitchen and to snap a picture of Guy's white jacket from his UNLV culinary school days, so Fieri fanatics may enjoy this place solely for the Guy branding.
