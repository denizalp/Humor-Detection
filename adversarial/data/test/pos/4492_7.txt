We stan Postino's! Sorry, my inner fan girl is coming out. This is a happening spot on College Ave, on ASU's campus. I've been to the Central, Highland and Kierland locations and now here. Thankfully my brother got here early and snagged us a reservation because by the time I arrived around 530, the wait was decent due to the heat and no one wanting to sit on their patio. Come \"winter\", that'll be a great spot to enjoy the cooler weather.\n\nWe had a nice, spacious booth at the entrance. Always seem to order a bruschetta board here and am never disappointed. This time, I got their sweet pepper jam with goat cheese, almond hummus with tomatoes, ricotta date pistachio (duh), and smoked salmon with pesto. Thinking I need to wean myself off the salmon as my stomach doesn't always approve, but the rest of my choices were solid. Probably should expand on what I order next time too. Our server was wonderful and super attentive, thanks Mike!
