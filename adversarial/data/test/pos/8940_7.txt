This place is for sure a 5 Star experience so you all need to get down to the Strip to try this place out for sure.\n\nThe Ambiance - While you are waiting in line, you will get to speak to so many people from the Mid or East Coast where they all grew up having White Castle Sliders.  I mean these peeps have lived on them and this is the comfort food of their generation.  It is so cool, that I, being a West Coaster, was able to learn about how WC was part of people's lives!!!\n\nThe Wait - Not so bad. We went at 9:30 on Sunday right after Church..... We prayed for a short line and our total wait to be in line, order and then get the food was only 30 minutes.  When we left at 10:20, there was actually no one in line in the street and only about 25 people waiting inside.\n\nThe Food Experience - It is certainly interesting that you are paying about a $1.10 to $1.20 for a slider. It is very expensive overall.  However, that being said, that little itty bitty piece of meat, that is razor thin and about 2\"x2\", with the two pickles and a quarter piece of processed cheese and chopped grilled onions is not bad. The bread is very soft and the perfect taste. Not too tasty and not bland. Just right. This little slider will not win any taste awards, but it is very edible and certainly evokes memories for so many.  This falls in line with grilled cheese and chicken noodle soup or even Mac and Cheese as go to comfort foods that is just right.\n\nThe Food rating - Nevertheless, lets face it, man cannot live on fond memories alone and so, the quality taste of the food has to be key and in this case, the Sliders themselves do not taste very good at all. They are pretty basic actually.  The crinkle fries are absolutely horrible and I would suggest naming them droopy fries, because they lack any crispiness at all. These are the most floppy and soggy fries ever. The amount you pay for the quantity you get is absolutely laughable.  We ordered loaded fries as well and these were looking like some 10 year old whipped it up and put it together.  There is not an ounce of artistic gourmet quality in this little burgers.\n\nThe Service - Not bad. The security that helps the line flow are very good quality. the cashiers are a bit new and this is taking a bit of time. They are not totally connected with the entire process and ordering and etc.  \n\nBuy why? - I wonder why put this  small restaurant in such a location? Horrible location, small, no easy way to get here if you are local.\n\nI will be coming back, with friends or guest, but not for the burgers, for the experience. Out of context and just taken alone, the burgers are just as good as twinkies and hoho's are to desserts. In the context of the whole experience, very good place to go.\n\nGK says, check it out.
