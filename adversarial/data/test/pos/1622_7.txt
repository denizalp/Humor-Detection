We were doing some remodelling and had to be out of the house for a few days so we checked in here. \n\nFirst of all, if you are staying in the building that houses the lobby, if you don't want to go through the lobby you must enter a hallway and then run a gauntlet through large luggage trolleys. I can't help but think that there is a fire code violation somehow involved. \n\nIf you like king sized beds then you will be disappointed as they only offer up queens. The bed itself was comfortable enough and they handled our request for a feather free room perfectly. \n\nThere were a couple of room oddities which detracted from the enjoyability factor. The location of the tv on a little end table in the middle of the room made for awkward viewing from almost every vantage point.  Also,  even if you have a tiny little butt, when you sit on the toilet you will have a toilet roll holder and a roll of toilet paper sticking into your hip. Why they chose to put the tp holder there is truly perplexing. \n\nThe rooms were clean and the breakfast better than we expected. The employees that we had contact with were all pleasant and competant. Although I can't see much more need for staying here again, I would not hesitate to recommend it to our friends and family who want to stay close to us without staying with us.
