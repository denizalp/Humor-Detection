FORGET ABOUT IT!!! wow this place was so good. I recommend this to anyone that is looking for amazing authentic homemade Mexican food. I'm pretty sure the majority of Las Vegas already knows this because the place was packed full of people in Business attire. The service was amazing, the restaurant was clean, the waitress was knowledgeable about the ingredients in the food and understood what I was looking for in my meal.\nI came with a couple of friends of mine on a lunch date. We were on a limited amount of time, but didn't even have to worry about it. Our food came out super fast super hot and the people are super friendly.\nI will come back here any chance I get. I can't wait to try something else on the menu!!!!
