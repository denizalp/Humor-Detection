Of the various design\/furniture\/antique stores in the Junction, Metropolis Living is probably the most atmospheric. It's a small, dark gallery with dusty old floors and exposed brick walls. Lots of neat furniture and industrial pieces. You can snag a unique restored piece of furniture or browse from their wide variety of decorative items. There are phrenology busts, lots of ceramic hands, steel lettering, etc. I feel like Maynard James Keenan would come here to furnish his loft. (When he's not too busy making wine, of course.)\n\nCreepy touches abound too. There were TWO ventiloquist dummies. The clerk behind the counter was fairly confident that Mr. Pepper (the name I have spontanously assigned to him) would come alive at night. There was even a tiny carnival motorcycle for him to ride around on. For Junctionites who think that they may have heard the pitter-patter of tiny wooden legs in their apartment at night: I think we found the culprit.\n\nAll in all, a great store to find some unique items for your place, or some interesting gifts for your time-travelling steam-punk friends. \n\nObligatory Title Pun: I LANG to visit again.\n\nMenu Readability: Their signage is a bit deceptive. So modern.\n\nNeed to mention: Found a great pair of old-timey motorcycle sunglasses here.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: What's the opposite of steam punk? Ice punk? Can I invent that?
