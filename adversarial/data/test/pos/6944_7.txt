I have owned nothing but Toyota Corolla's since I was 16, and all of them from Don Valley North Toyota.\n\nI have always found the service advisors professional and upfront about costs and what is mandatory and what is optional.\n\nI find that if you book for multiple things like snow tires and maintenance and drive clean your wait will be longer than quoted.\n\nIt's also a big and busy dealership - so it's more challenging for every car repair to be fast but there is shuttle service, free wifi, free coffee and even J-Town next door to spend some time while waiting.\n\nThe one thing I will say, is that I bring my car in for service as recommended and I have never had a major breakdown - only flat tires or battery failure, while friends with cars from other automakers and\/or those who don't take their car to a dealership for service seem to have endless and costly car repairs.\n\nLastly, Don Valley is special because they bring mechanics from Japan where the cars are designed to train mechanics here in Canada, I think it makes them more knowledgeable and that's why I don't go to Downtown Toyota, even if it's closer.  Also, my one dealing with Downtown Toyota felt like endless upsell from service advisors that were nothing like those at Don Valley.
