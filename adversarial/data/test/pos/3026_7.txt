Anytime I am able to have sushi, I go for it! I ran into Ah Hai by accident. Once I entered, I found out I was right on time for happy hour. The location and environment are average, the service is fast, the food is good and the happy hour prices are very affordable. Next time I am in the area, I will gladly go in for more sushi
