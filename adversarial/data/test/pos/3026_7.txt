I come to Market Square weekly during free yoga season.  This yoga class is family-friendly, and it gets packed.  The location is a bit odd because people hang out and watch 200 people do yoga on Sunday mornings, but I love the free yoga initiative!\n\nIn the winter, there is a really cute Holiday area that is fun to hang out in on the weekends.  There are crafts, holiday-themed food, and fun!\n\nIf you are just hanging out in Market Square with no set purpose, there are plenty of places to eat and grab a drink.
