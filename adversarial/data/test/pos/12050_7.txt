My fav go to Dim Sum place, you better go early or late, anything in between 12-2pm and you'll be waiting on the weekends. \n\nIn general everything is fresh and delicious. I would suggest especially the egg tarts and the steamed pork bun. Egg tarts always sell out extra quick. \n\nTip: If you're making a trip out here I would suggest calling in advance, in some cases they shut down dim sum early or do not serve it all due to weddings. As well watch where you park, if you park in other business spots, the owners will literally come out and yell at you. If you can't find spot you can park at the lower level pit area.
