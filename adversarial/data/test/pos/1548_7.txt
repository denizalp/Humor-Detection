I have a love\/hate relationship with Food Lion. After several bad experiences at this store and vowing never to return at one point, I find I do come back for some things.\n\nIn the past the customer service was just terrible here and the self checkouts never worked but apparently they've improved in recent months. \n\nNow the worst things here are anything fresh. Seriously, unless you are buying produce, dairy, meat or anything perishable to consume the same day, you shouldn't buy it here because it will go bad within a day.\n\nThe good things to buy here are anything non-perishable and junk food. I usually tend for the latter around here.\n\nOne other good thing is the parking lot is never busy and you can get in and out of here within a few minutes. Of course, that's partly because you are frustrated that Food Lion doesn't carry your item and you are shooting yourself in the foot for not going to Harris Teeter or Publix to begin with.
