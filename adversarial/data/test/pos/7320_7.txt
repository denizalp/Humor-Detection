There are few times I'd call a meal panty dropper material. Or even praise every course and wish it never end.\n\nThis is one of those meals. \n\nEverything that Hiroyuki and our chef did today was over the top and amazing. I was head over heels.\n\nAmbiance: quiet and refined, decor was a chic and quiet jazz music played in the background. The place is very intimate and also had a koi pond with profiles on each fish, if you're in between courses you get to see the stars and feed them!\n\nWe had the omakase meal #2 which was a 7 course meal.. Last minute addition of another course and some ingredients switched up but it was WELL WORTH IT. Note this isn't your typical Japanese fare. This is a fusion place with soft touches of Italy and France in these meals. \n\n1. 4 layer tartare: caviar, tomato purée, shrimp tartar , citrus creme with rice croutons\n\n2. Miso peanut butter fondue with egg, black sesame with garden veggies \n\n3. Roasted oysters with foie gras and sea urchin \n\n4. Soup: Chinese broccoli, clam, grilled cod, fish balls in a daikon broth and olive oil\n\n5. Sashimi imported from the Tokyo market: red snapper, squid, salmon, salmon roe, abalone, needle fish and fresh wasabi paste (grated on shark skin)\n\n6. Lobster risotto \n\n7. Wag yu beef imported from a province in Japan with a truffled mashed potatoes- green onion wasabi and a key lime to a palate cleanser \n\n8. Chocolate soufflé with truffle butter and ginger ice cream\n\n9. Marscappone ice cream over red bean, chestnuts and rice crackers with a green tea sauce\n\n\nEach course was light and flavorful, the use of truffles really mirrored what I seek for in dishes (and I even ate shaved truffles on my dishes in a diff meal last night)\n\nThe thanks I have for sharing such an amazing experience cannot be forgotten. Every course was amazing and I will be back. \n\nThank you, so much for this experience. I wish you were in Seattle. (Very very badly)
