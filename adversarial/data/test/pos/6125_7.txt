As I sit here watching Andrew Zimmern eat snails in France, all I can think about is Mon Ami Gabi.\n\nIt has become a birthday tradition; every year, I go to Mon Ami Gabi.  Twice.  Once with my brother, who, if possible, is even more of a Foodie than I am.  Then one more time with whomever I am in Vegas with (ex-husband, friend, friends......random stranger I met at Peppermill). \n\nI've tried almost everything on their menu (including things that they don't have any more and need to bring back, like the arugula and goat cheese crepes), and it is all phenomenal.   In order of how much of a food-orgasm they give me:\n\n1.) Escargot.  I've had a surprising amount of escargot in my life, and this is the ish.  Buttery, garlic-y, AMAZING texture; one order is often not enough.  Because my baby bro and I love them so much we sometimes get two orders.\n\n2.) Crepes.  Ohhh...the crepes.  One birthday, I did the double trip twice in one day; brunch the first time, late dinner the second.  The best crepe of my life was here, the aforementioned arugula and goat cheese crepe.  I had never had arugula cooked before, and its peppery flavor was perfectly complimented by the very mild and creamy goat cheese.  I have never seen it on the menu again, and every time I go I ask for it and everyone claims to have never heard of it.\n\n3.) French martini (vodka, chambord, pineapple, up).  No brainer.  They do it better than anyone.\n\n4.) Frites.  Ohhhhhhhhh the frites.  Crispy.  In large quantity. \n\nTheir steaks are great, try one at least once, and I recommend the Dijon or Bordelaise.  I'm not saying it is the best steak I've ever had (Morton's tied with a random place in Kansas get that award) but it is REALLY good, and their sauces are incredible. \n\nYou can make reservations online which is very helpful for weekends and busy evenings.\n\nMake sure you ask for a spot on the patio so you can have the perfect view of the Bellagio fountain. The covered part of the patio is well air conditioned during the summer and well heated in the winter.  The uncovered part has heat lamps in winter and is near nice little spray misters in summer (they don't spray on you, but somehow help keep the air cool near you).\n\nThe servers don't wear nametags....just numbers.  Why? \"We at Mon Ami Gabi think the experience should totally be about you....our names don't matter\".  I do find this a little silly, because, by drawing attention to the fact that you don't wear nametags by wearing numbertags, didn't you just make it about you?  But having a server tell me about the jokes they make in the kitchen for certain servers (#69 gets quite abused), I find it fun and hilarious. \n\nI wish they had ranch.  Dipping my frites in mayo is not appetizing.\n\nIf you haven't tried it yet, go.  And go hungry.  Ask for an extra baguette to take home with you.  Eat as much of those carrots that they serve with the bread (on good days) as you can.   Have a martini.  Pretend you're in Ocean's Eleven.   And eat some extra escargot for me.
