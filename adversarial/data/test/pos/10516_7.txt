Only in vegas where you could find slots machines at the airport. I was like REALLY?? when I walked out of the terminal and there were people crowded around the slots machine\/gambling area. I guess WELCOME TO LAS VEGAS! ATMs are not short in Vegas. If you have trouble finding one then there is something wrong with you. Yay if you bank with Wells Fargo because they got ATMs all over this airport. As for the airport itself, it needs remodeling and reorganizing. Maybe create more room and get rid of some slots machines? it was a hot mess. The layout was terrible! did not take much planning at all I can tell.
