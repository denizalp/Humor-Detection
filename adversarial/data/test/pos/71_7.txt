The food here is average. I came here on a weekday afternoon and it was empty inside. I noticed that my water had a black speck in it, but decided not to say anything. The golden bags appetizer is flavorful, crunchy and pairs well with the sauce it comes with. However, the portion is small for the price. The pad see eau is decent, but I got tired of eating it after a few bites. There was nothing about the dish that stood out. \n\nAs for the service, I have no complaints. The food cane out in a reasonable amount of time and the waitress did come to check up on us. Still, there are better Thai restaurants in town and I probably won't be returning to this one anytime soon.
