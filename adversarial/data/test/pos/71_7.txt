Food is not the best Kusina Ni Loraine blows this joint away. If you order from Tina and you cancel and get your money back......she'll give you a straight up attitude. She was super nice when we ate there and ordered catering, in which I still had plenty of time to cancel. When I came for my money she was super cold and was a straight up \"B\". Not cool Tina.
