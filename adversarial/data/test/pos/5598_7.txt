Come here because you're stone, drunk or both....come here for the novetly and not for the taste; and if you're like me, dont come here to watch communist parade videos NOT COOL....and as an american business in LAS VEGAS one would think you can show some appropriate videos that reflect the opportunity that was given to you to conduct business in the USA. Otherwise, just another over priced restaurant with very little thought for taste and to showcase originality. The upside, open late, pretty skinny Chinese Hostess, nice gold fish tanks....other than that, 1 star.
