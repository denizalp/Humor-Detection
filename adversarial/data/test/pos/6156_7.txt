Taking into consideration that I am actually one of the twelve people left that are from Charlotte and I still live here, I am officially ashamed that I never tried Zack's before yesterday... \n\nThe Zack's special was stupendous, guys... I ordered mine without mayo because that's how I get down, but there was still a great amount of toppings mixed all in with the two beef patties and cheese: tomatoes, pickles, onion, lettuce and secret sauce (which tastes quite a bit like thousand island dressing, so I think the secret is out)... I was really glad there wasn't any extra sauce because that sucker was already falling apart toward the end... In a good way, though... The bun was nice and toasty and wasn't bland, but didn't work too hard to prove itself by overpowering the other flavors...\n\nThe onion rings were pretty good... I'd liken them to Mr. K's down the block... Not too thick, not too thin... Decent batter, but not the cajun kind that comes on most onion straws... A basic, but tasty fried coating... \n\nI even took this to go because I was heading home and everything traveled quite well... The food must have been practically on fire when they brought it out because it was still nice and hot by the time I arrived and got settled to eat... I didn't even have to do a quick microwave refresh!  \n\nI'm kind of afraid to take the boyfriend here... I doubt he'll want to go anywhere else for a while... But I just have to be the one to introduce this to someone new and I think he's the only one left that hasn't tried it...
