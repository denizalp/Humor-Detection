This place is a freakin joke!!! I waited in line for 20min and because of where the line leads I was stopped in front of another store where the 10 cars previous me where stopped. A freakin employee came out and told me I had to move and go to the other line even though I was 7 cars from being served!! The other line had at least 20 cars in line. Fuck this place!!! You'll never get my money!!!\n\nStarbucks forever!!!!
