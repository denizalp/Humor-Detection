Happened across this not so little spot whilst in search of a coffee before an early morning meeting and not wanting to go to yet another Starbucks (plus I also had a sweet craving) I entered this place with cautious optimism. \n\nPOW! The interior of this place hits you in the face like when your little sister smacks you in the face with her Barbie Corvette. Shiny pearl white fixtures and display cases show off row upon row of delectable sweet pastries and baked goods and are accented only by the splashes of pink across this space. It looks like a place where \"the girls\" could get together for some sinful sweets and a fancy Italian coffee. Which is why I found it hilarious that the only patrons on this particular day were 4-5 burly-stocky manly men, hovering around a table gossiping like a group of teenagers about the latest sports and celebrity need to knows.\n\nBeing in a hurry I did a quick scan and the quiches also looked fantastic so I feel as if a future visit will be needed to experience. However I did have enough time to order a double shot cafe latte with a chocolate croissant. The latte was fiery hot and was still on super hot when I accidentally left it in my car and came back for 30 minutes later. That being said once I sluffed off the skin from the roof of my mouth a took a bite of the Croissant and it was so flaky it near exploded in my face. Delish!! (but messy). \n\nThe guy behind the counter said that the best thing about the croissants here is that your can never eat just one, and seeing how yummy they were and how tiny they were I can see where he was coming from. Thank goodness I only bought one and ran out.\n\nI'm looking forward to trying this spot again when I am in Woodbridge (on Weston just north of Hwy 7).
