Used to be my favorite restaurant in Charlotte until tonight.\nDon't get me wrong, food is still great, service is wonderful, can even beat some of the Michelin 3 star restaurants I have been to around the world.\nWhat's wrong? The hostess was wrong.\nI was sitting on patio and then I entered the house to use the bathroom.\nShe didnot see me as I was sitting outside. So she told me I was NOT allowed to use the bathroom upstairs unless I was having dinner here.\nIf this has always been your bathroom policy, then I suggest u change it to welcome potential guests, after all, it is not likely for someone who is not a local to find a bathroom in this neighborhood.\nIf your bathroom policy has not always been guests only, then I suggest you fire the racist hostess because she apparently told me (after I repeatedly ask her if she was serious) such policy only because I am Asian.
