The store is old looking and even with numerous conversions, it still looks like you are shopping in the ghetto.\n\nThey former owners split the store to have a Save-A-Lot within the same complex; as soon as they managed to close down all of the other grocery stores and small food stores they shuttered Save-A-Lot and changed it back to a stand-alone.  That means higher prices, no competition and staff that paid \/ treated poorly.\n\nDeli: The meats are overpriced and if they are on sale they are packed with sodium; the cheeses are all nasty and not freshly sliced.\n\nProduce: Check the bottoms of the berry containers before you buy them because there's a good chance they will be moldy.  Check the price on everything when you are checking out because 50% of the time you aren't getting the sale price.\n\nDairy: Eggs are always broken, everything is spread along the back dairy aisle so plan on doing a lot of walking.\n\nThe carts suck, the carrier baskets are no longer offered and cashiers are usually about as welcoming as a frog on a log. The bathrooms are almost always smelly an hot and good luck finding toilet paper when you have to go.
