Uh...no.  This place needs to get better stores 'cause right now, I'll only go for the following reasons:\n-  Winners (ok selection, can get messy!)\n-  Bulk Barn (standard)\n-  Levi's Outlet (if you're lucky, you can get jeans for $34.99)\n\nThat's IT.  Seriously, this mall is not worth driving out of the way for, so I'd suggest you look up the directory of stores before you head over there!\n\nThis mall is more for immigrants\/old\/cheap-ish bargain hunters who like stores like Costa Blanca\/Sirens 'n crap like that.  Not my cup of tea at all!
