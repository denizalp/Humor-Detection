Happy hour. Live music.  Really enjoy the singer Ive seen here the last couple times.  This is the place I like to go when I want to hang out and stay a while.  And they have an attractive staff ;). \n\nMeat and cheese plate to enjoy my bottle of wine. They keep it simple. Two cheeses and two meats. The calamari, love when it is on the thick side firm but tender.  Rotisserie chicken with mashed potatoes really filled me up.  \n\nI have to say I do need to be careful.  Everytime my bill adds up higher than I anticipate.  I do spend more here over other places.
