Run Forrest Run!!!!\n\nI have been a member to several gyms and this one is just my speed.   I have driven by it many times and thought to myself - what is the appeal?  It is in a small strip mall.  I am sure it will be here today and gone tomorrow.  I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nFirst - Security\n\nIt is a 24 hour workout facility.   There are cameras everywhere and if anyone tries to enter after you walking in - it buzzes and alerts security for tailgaters.\n\nSecond - Cleanliness \/ Equipment\n\nThe facility (this particular one) is extremely clean (with restrooms and showers.   All the equipment is new with a mix of machines and free weights.   There is a steady stream of folks that go in and do their thing and get out.   That is definitely my speed.\n\nThe equipment is leased and they have 24 hour maintenance.   If anyone has gone to the big gyms - you will see equipment broken for long periods of time.  \n\nThird - Dues\n\nIt is similar to LA Fitness ($40 per month) and do offer personal training.  The personal training is more of a value.   At LA Fitness or Urban Active you will pay anywhere from $35 - 45 per half hour.   The rate at Anytime Fitness is similar but for an hour.  This is good if you want to kick-start your fitness.\n\nFinally - Extras\n\nI know - you are saying \"What?\" - They actually have a website (anytimehealth.com) and a phone app where you can join for free (pay if a non-member - so you can use it at any gym).   You can create a schedule, workout, and use your phone app for more information..\n\n\nThey have classes as well for those interested in the evenings.\n\nThis is a pretty well-thought gym with 1800 locations across the US (all franchise).\n\nThe big gyms are great because they offer more amentities (steam rooms, pool, classes throughout the day, cycling classes, daycare. etc...)  \n\nOverall:\n\nPrice - Comparable to the big gyms.   Great on personal traiing.\nFacilities \/ Cleanliness - Great - better than many of the big gyms I have joined\nService - 24 hour facility.\n\nA strong recommend if this is your speed.  Now it is time to put the stretchy pants away.
