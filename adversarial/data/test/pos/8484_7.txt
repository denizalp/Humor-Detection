Do you like not being able to hear yourself think?  Do you enjoy shoulder to shoulder crowds in small places with low strip-club'esque lighting? Do you love seeing drunk 20-somethings hooking up right before your eyes? What about bartenders that are far too busy to pay attention to the 30-something husky guy in the plaid shirt?  Boy have I got the place for you!!\n\nI can see the value in this place, but not at my age or tolerance level for douche-baggery.  I suppose, this place embodies most of why I avoid certain places in old town Scottsdale OR Mill ave.  Yeah, I enjoy letting loose and having a good time, but this just wasn't my scene.  Sure there were plenty of people who were easy on the eyes, it was just my brain that wanted to vomit.  \n\nI do not fault the establishment for this - but did not enjoy my time there in any way shape or form.  Even just asking for an ice-water (it was that time) was a complete hassle and incredible inconvenience despite my generous tip.
