I guess the word is... Charming?\n\nThe male bartender was a bit gruff, but the woman bartender was much friendlier and patient.\n\nRead: this is a cash only bar.\n\nWalk past the pool table and there's a back lounge area with a couple of tables, shuffleboard, and booths.\n\nA Vodka press, pint, and Captain & Coke came out to be $13 before tip.\n\nThere's a dart board too.\n\nI guess that's all I have... Umm yup.
