BEST JUICES IN TOWN!\n\nNo seriously.  The best locally made juices in town.  They have 100s of flavors, and the mixologist, Dee, is VERY good at what she does.  I got a few soda flavors and they were so spot on that I laughed when I tried them.  They're amazing clean and ploom-ey juices that taste great and are cheap for what you get.  You can get up to 60 mils, which is huge!!  Mike told me that they only use the finest FDA approved ingredients, all made in America.  They're not selling cheap foreign knock off crap.  You can sit and watch it being made, and you can take a tour of their lab as well.  Its a little room in the back, but you can tell when you see it that they care about quality control and cleanliness.\n\nThe store is small, but its always packed with vets and new vapers.  When I've been there I've always had great conversations with other vapers and learned new things.  There are couches and chairs\/tables to sit and practice your craft.\n\nMichael is the owner, and he's really helpful.  If you want something, he'll get it for you.  The pricing is pretty decent, and since you're not waiting on shipping totally acceptable.  They're one of the only places in town who stocks EVOD heads, which are among my favorite attys.\n\nIf you need help picking a new mod, there is a guy there named Dustin who knows a lot and is very happy to help you find the best mod for YOU.  He personalizes his advice, instead of just selling the most expensive thing to you.  I assume that the other employees will do that for you too.\n\nIf you like Mountain Dew Baja Blast from Taco Bell, they make that flavor.  Its the only place I've ever known to do it, and its right on the money in terms of flavor.
