I really enjoyed this show. Being a 20 year resident of Vegas I've seen pretty much every show on the strip and I thought this show deserved a good rating. The story line was clever and comical, I felt like I was in the book Water for Elephants, except with a lot more adult content :) the different acts were impressive and all were talented. \n\nYes this show does have a lot of dirty language but it's pretty funny, and for all the nay sayers, go back to Nebraska. For the money, you really can't beat this show, $50 for locals, I spend that on dinner, you know what I mean? I would totally come back and see this again. \n\nFew tips, don't get there too early, you're just going to stand in line, and there aren't bad seats, so no need to be first in line. \n\nBuy your ticket at the small ticket office outside the entrance of the show\n\nHave a couple drinks at the outside bar. Enjoy!
