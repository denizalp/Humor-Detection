The building is an old church. It's beautiful - inside and out. It is still kind of shaped like a church... with the bar as the alter\/shrine area and the kitchen behind it. The bar is decorated nicely. They have a big chandelier in the center. The top of the walls by the ceiling have painted murals. The whole, entire place just has a great atmosphere. The place itself is in a little corner with a Starbucks and a Buffalo Exchange. My co-worker and I sat at the bar. The bartender, Eric, was friendly and provided outstanding service. We never had to wait long for anything, and our drinks and chips and salsa never went dry. I ordered the chicken enchiladas with rice - no beans. It was a very generous portion. They were delicious! Seriously. I ate what I could, but I couldn't finish it all. I took what was left of it back to my hotel, and I actually ate leftovers! I never eat leftovers! Lol.
