So I am visiting wit friends from out of town and we came here. I asked the girl abt some stuff and ordered our food. I guess they forgot to write down my sandwich and without any apology they said they would make me one. After bringing it over, my other friends finished, they decide to charge me, after they made a mistake. The food was alright but the service was terrible. Chill out with your bad attitude and learn customer service, this is las Vegas. Never coming back.
