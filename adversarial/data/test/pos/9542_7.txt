Everyone loves LGO. Well, almost everyone. I see a few one and two star nuts in the mix.  It's one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix too, but I have to say, the pizza is more like 3 stars. It is good, but not great. Just not a big fan of their crust. Now, the burgers, decor, service and people watching are all awesome. Plus it is attached to the LGO grocery store which is great.\n\nLast night I had their green chili burger for the first time and thought it was great. The beef was delicious and cooked to order, the roasted green chili tasted great, and even though it is borderline sacrilege, when at LGO, you gotta go with one of their massive English Muffins instead of a bun. I think it could be even better with melted American cheese, but the shredded cheddar is a nice alternative to the slice. The side of fries were awesome and they give you more than enough.\n\nAfter dinner I suggest you go over to the grocery store area and try one of the delectable desserts. I'm a fan of the Tammie Coe Ooey Gooey cupcakes myself. Parking's a bitch, but you can understand why. It's a great place. Check 'em out. You'll probably like it a lot.
