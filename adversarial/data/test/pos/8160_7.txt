Thanks to fellow yelpers who have really spread the word about this event, I finally made it out! (Thanks to Katherine and Abby for their encouragement, I think I missed you guys! And thanks to Terri for her advice prior to attending) \n\nOff Rainbow and 215, the monastery is not seen from major roads. It's is aptly located on \"Virtue Drive\". There's plentiful parking both within the monastery and just outside the gates. I heard rumblings of the infamous chicken pad thai line, and thought I had gotten really lucky when I saw no humungous line present over the stall. In my rookie ignorance, I didn't realize the wait was so long, you actually put your name on a list (which was already 2 pages long by the time I got there), and you get your food when your name is called. If you are not around when they call your name, they'll give your order to the next person in line who is around. We waited 40 minutes for our pad thai, which was fine since we could walk around the other stalls and see what others had to offer. Some of my favorite offerings were the chicken curry puffs, this sweetened pork in rice flour and their roti (which wasn't crispy, but had a lot of flavor). There's so many more things we could have dined out, but I think we did good for our first go around. Everyone seems to use very fresh ingredients and the quality of items rival that of busy Thai restaurants in SF and Vegas. There's plenty of covered carport seating if you'd like to eat there or they can wrap up everything for you to go. I very much appreciated the friendly community vibe of the folks attending and it was a great way to spend a Sunday morning.
