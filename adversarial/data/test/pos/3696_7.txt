This place reminds me of one of those crackhead hotels that sell their rooms at \"conveniently\" discounted rates while maintaining the allure of a wannabe family-friendly Holiday Inn kind of atmosphere.\n\nIt's where, while mom and dad are having their cheapo anniversary beneath the moonlight next to a pool polluted with urine (there is no such as a blue dye that marks piss as a cloud, it's a movie joke derives from a myth spread by little kids, like \"cooties\"), and while the kids are either sleeping or watching late night shows, the room NEXT DOOR has four tweakers working out a drug deal from a vicious looking motherfucker with tattoos all over his face, and a handgun with lines of meth laid out before a table.\n\nThat's what you are bringing your kids too. Tell them to cover their ears and keep their heads down when a gunshot goes off.\n\nThe entrance is very difficult to make a left turn into if you are heading south on Las Vegas Blvd. The locals floor it on the gas without reading the speed limit signs and cut each other off as you are, in sheer terror, trying to get your family of 6 into the valet area. Which brings me to another part of the review.\n\nThere is ABSOLUTELY no customer service at the valet. I had my car siting there for TEN minutes. No uniformed guys came running up to take my key and my car. There were THREE other cars in front of me also waiting for some fucking CUSTOMER SERVICE.\n\nThe sprinklers on the north side of the hotel are BROKEN, gushing wasted money towards the asphalt instead of into the bushes. It sort of reminds me of those movie scenes in the ghetto, where a bunch of poor kids are playing around a broken fire hydrant in the projects
