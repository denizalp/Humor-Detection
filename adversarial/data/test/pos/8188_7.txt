I had read about this place and had it on my bookmark list for quite some time.  I don't know how I never made it down here until the other day!\n\nIt was my 38th Birthday on Saturday (June 11th) and I was hanging out with a buddy from work and my brother in law.  I wanted to head down to Scottsdale and grab a sandwich here and then go smoke a cigar (see previous review).  We made our way down here around noon, walked in, got in line and ordered our sandwiches.  I went with a Large \"Maximus\".  My brother in law bought my lunch for me so I didn't pay squat ;-).  Regular price for that sandwich was around $10.00.  Here is how it was............\n\nThe Maximus-  This is a premium Italian sub!  Whenever I am new to a deli, I always tend to get their version of an Italian sub.  Happy to report, the Maximus is fantastic!  This sandwich came layered with Prosciutto, Capocollo, Genoa Salami, Mortadella and Provolone Cheese.  I got it topped with lettuce, tomato, onion and Italian dressing.  I chose the seeded sub roll as my bread.  This thing was set down in front of me and I was instantly happy!   This sub is huge!  A solid 12 inches or so.  The seeded bread they use was fantastic!  It had seeds on all sides of the bread, just not the top halves.  It was nice and soft and made an excellent base for the toppings.  Next time, I might ask for it slightly toasted\/crisped up, because I think it would make it even better than it already was!  The meats were top notch quality and the produce was fresh.  The sandwich was just a tad dry and could have used more oil and vinegar, but besides that, it was damn near a perfect sub!  Definitely the best Italian sub I have had in Phoenix!  \n\nI will definitely be back to try out their other sandwiches.  I was highly impressed with the Maximus and if their other subs can come close to being as good as that one, I will be super satisfied.  Too bad its across the Valley, or I would be here way too often!  It was a great little store, and a fantastic birthday sandwich!  Good times!
