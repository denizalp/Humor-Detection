I'm sitting here right now. I have time to write a review while at dinner because I've been here for an hour and haven't even ordered yet. \n\nLets see if my ratings change when the food gets here.\n\nFood came.  Not good.  Not sure why people like this place.  Maybe Madison doesn't know what good Thai food is.
