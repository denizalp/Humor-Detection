I've been in here twice and enjoy Buck & Rider.  Sitting at the bar I've always had fast and friendly service.  I wasn't crazy about my crab or shrimp rolls but they were 1\/2 off on Sunday so what the heck.  They also have a nice craft beer selection in addition to their wine list.\n\nThis is the new place to be and be seen in Arcadia.  It has a great vibe and energy.\n\nMake sure to grab a cookie on your way out!
