Previously located on the other side of Las Vegas Boulevard, KISS by Monster Mini Golf moved to The Rio in 2016 and now featuring 18-holes of Golf, Arcade Games and even a KISS Wedding Chapel the idea is just as insane as it sounds, though perhaps not QUITE as over-the-top as one might expect from a band known for Pyrotechnics, spitting blood and loud Rock n' Roll.\n\nNot particularly a fan of KISS, yet having seen them and the equally amusing Mini-KISS in concert in the past, devotees of the band will undoubtedly enjoy the neon lit decor and various quotes, plus a timeline of the Band's successes, but for those just their to Golf the course has far too many areas where the ball can get lodged up in props such as Speaker Stacks or corners while the course is fairly compact, a situation that can lead to back-ups for groups larger than four, or those playing with kids who can occasionally get distracted.\n\nOverall a good time, and a better value by way of a Groupon that knocks about 50% off 4-rounds of Golf, at the very least KISS by Monster Mini Golf is a good way for tourists and locals to pass an hour of fun with family.
