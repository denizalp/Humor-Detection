I've been here many a time for Browns game but I feel compelled to share my experience from this past Sunday.  The game was okay and the weather sucked because it was raining.  HOWEVER, the highlight of the game was the squirrel on the field who for the rest of this review shall be referred to as \"Squirrelly\".  Squirelly ran from the west end zone all the way down to the Dawg Pound AND STAYED IN BOUNDS THE ENTIRE TIME!  That was the highlight of my visit to the stadium.  The Browns need to sign him as a WR or RB before Chomps catches him.  GO SQUIRRELLY...I MEAN BROWNS!
