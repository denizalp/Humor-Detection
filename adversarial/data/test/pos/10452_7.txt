For what they claim as the \"Hangout featuring 500+ global beers, lots of craft drafts & tavern food in pub digs with TVs\" I really thought the place would be bigger.\n\nWe met a group of friends here on a Friday night around 8 pm. I know this is Wisconsin, but the place was buzzing with kids running around the tables, bar area, up and down on the stage with no end in sight.\n\nIt was hard to get situated with a party bigger than 6. There are no private rooms or table reservations so everything is just first come first serve. You are out of luck if you are caught in between what apparently is a kiddie rush and bar time.\n\nTrying to flag down staff was a chore. Bartenders had to check with servers, who had to check with bussers to pinpoint a question about which tables were up for grabs. A few member of our group ordered from a bartender\/server going around, while the other couldn't get serviced and just ordered at the bar.\n\nAs soon as a refill finally came, someone else in our party was dry. It became a vicious cycle.\n\nThey do have a relatively large beer selection, but the numbers are inflated a bit because they do list Lawnmower beers like Miller Lite and the likes on the tap list. The other 450+ selections? Bottles. They are bottled beers.\n\nSo if you are a true beer fanatic and a draught beer purist, try HopCat where they actually have over 100 craft beers on tap.\n\nTL;DR: They had CitruSinensis on tap, kids running rampant, didn't get the food.
