Let me paint the picture. We are obsessed with our Chihuahua. When I say obsessed- I mean we have had a painting commissioned after him. A typical Saturday is centered around him. HE WALKED DOWN THE AISLE AT OUR WEDDING. We are obsessed. \n\nWe decided to change our vet due to their prices steadily increasing to the point that we could no longer justify going there. \n\nOur amazing, perfect Chihuahua ended up having a series of problems. We also brought in our other Chihuahua who can be a demon dog and attack.\n\n1. Oona was INCREDIBLE with the demon dog. Not one problem. This dog is known for being evil. He loves Oona.  You have to be confident and firm with him. \n\n2. The amazing Chihuahua is deaf and difficult to calm. I felt horrible. Oona knows our obsession with this dog and saw some possible problems. She wasn't able to help him- but referred him to another clinic. I LOVE THAT OONA DID THAT. She was able to say \"I can't help with this- try these people, I trust them and they have the right equipment for this...\" instead of pretending to be able to fix it. That made me trust her a lot more. She also repeatedly called and checked in with us while he was getting worked on.\n\n3. The environment is excellent. Kelli and Pamela also work there and they are incredibly friendly. Everyone in the office genuinely loves animals. They don't want to screw you over. The want to fix the animal.\n\n4. It is so inexpensive. Incredible prices in comparison to all of the other places we looked into. It is inexpensive AND excellent service. \n\nI highly recommend this vet. My amazing Chihuahua is healthy and happy. I would only give him the very best.
