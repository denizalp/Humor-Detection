OK so I am gonna go to bat for Dr. Rubenstein. He was my dogs doctor at west charleston animal hospital. I was suprised when I called up one day to chat with him about Coco,to find he had moved on to Aliante. Me and Coco are very sad to see him go. I liked him so much I even considered traveling the 10 miles to see him there. And if i dont feel as comfortable with my new vet. thats exactly what i will do. The reason I am writing this is to tell everyone that I am not easy to please..that is to say i will ask a lot of questions and make sure Coco gets the best care. Dr. Rubenstein is an excellent veterinarian. I liked him from the first time i met him,he is very low key and patient with questions,he will take the time to make sure all of your questions are answered,he will not try and pad the bill with unnecessary charges. I would give him a 10\/10. He helped me tremendously with Coco who had problems from day 1 and I am grateful for his expertise and professionalism. What else can I say except,I wish you well Dr. Rubenstein...Coco says hello :)
