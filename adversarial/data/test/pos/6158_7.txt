I have mixed feelings of this place. I was excited to come here to see Calvin Harris spin. However, my excited turned into frustration as the evening went on. We got the general admission tickets so there was a bit of wait to get in. It moved fairly quickly, so that was not the issue. \n\nWhen we got in, we went to the nearest bar and got four beers and asked for four waters. Well guess what? They wont give you tap water... you need to pay for the Fiji water at $11 a pop.... yes, same price as the beer. Way to rob you!!!\n\nThe place has two floor and three bars. There is also a outdoor terrace, which I did not go, but I assume there is a bar there as well. The lighting and the chandelier on top of the dance floor is amazing. It is a show in itself!\n\nWhat was awful about this place was how packed it was. I am pretty sure there is a fire code in this building and most likely have exceeded its capacity. EVERYWHERE YOU GO IS PACKED. The dance floor was the WORST! You pack in like sardines and basically dance with whoever is right up next to you, guys, girls, drunks, weirdos, etc. I think I hit new records of number of people I danced with in just that one night. The floor is disgusting as it is sticky and people just throw their cups, and empty drinks there. However, you either drop it or hold it... so can't blame them. \n\nOnce we got to the dance floor, we decided to stay put even though it was a bit uncomfortable, but we wanted to be closer to Calvin Harris when he came out. To come back would have been a pain, because there is a line to enter and you have to walk around....\n\nNot a fan and suffocating! and expensive!
