Knowing some behind the scenes stories this place really turned out to be a marvelous place of creative craftsmanship. \n\nBesides the famous praying mantis out front , it really makes a great photo op shot especially when the sun is setting. The glow of the sign, the angles of the buildings...very nice.\n\nI could elaborate on on the shops but I will save each for there respected reviews. \n\nUncle Tony was there shopping when we ran into him. We said hi and immediately made sure to lead us directly to the slide. Hubby, our friend and I were then led to the entrance. He explained that we HAD to go down the slide immediately so we did :) the slide did not let us down. Well technically it did. Climbing to the top...getting excited...having the green light and the sound.......ok you just have to go down the slide yourself.  \n\nContainer Park is a wonderful, family friendly, safe, fun, environment of positive Downtown vibe. \n\nThe amazing shops, the children's area, good food, stage area, nice bars, flowing layout, are all impressive, and best of all DIFFERENT. \n\nCP is a playground for all.
