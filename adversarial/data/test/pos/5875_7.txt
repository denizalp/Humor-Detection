Good food. However I am not a fan of the fish. It looks and tastes like 4 fish sticks stuck together. I'm sure that is not the case, however it's my perception. Personally I would go for the chicken tenders, I'm sure they may be frozen but they come out juicy and look normal.\nIt is cash only but fortunately for you and them there is a bank within walking distance(500ft). Just be ready for a wait as that is the usual there, but it's never very long. Fun place to try out.
