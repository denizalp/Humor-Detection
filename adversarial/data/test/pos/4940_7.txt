Incredible evening !\n\nCame with a group of four for our friends birthday it was her first time and she loved it. \nWe started off with calamari the mushrooms and the spinach and yogurt dip with pita. Very good and flavourful.\n\nHad a fantastic plate meat was very tender I would recommend the stews. The salad dressing is to die for it's very unique u can't miss it comes with most the plates.\n\nOne of the best Byow in verdun :)
