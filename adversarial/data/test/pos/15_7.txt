The word \"petit\" in French means \"small or little\"... man is that a misnomer or what in that this was a Taiwanese joint that served big ass portions of brick toast desserts!\n\nThe family wanted to have some dessert so we decided to try the brick toasts that everyone has been talking about for a while.  These massive creations are piled up high and each order can easily feed 3-4 for dessert but if you are hungry then 1-2 people without any diabetes or pre-diabetes can do the job!\n\nThe restaurant was busy but we had no problems ordering.  The brick toast took 20 mins to come out so not too bad compared to what some people have said.  Funny to watch when they put the toasts on the table people start taking out the phone fighting each other to get the best Instagram worthy shot on their phone:)\n\nTaste wise, the brick toasts were pretty good!  We ordered a strawberry and a mango flavored one.   The only thing I would have liked was if they used  better ice cream as I'm not if the ice cream was real dairy or the coconut oil based one.\n\nOne item that I would really recommend is the Matcha Shaved Ice with Red Bean and Popping Boba.  The matcha flavour was actually more richer then the one served at Cha Me Cha and the popping boba gave a great contrast in texture to the dessert.\n\nDespite it being busy we found it easy to flag down servers as they were quite attentive.  There was also a huge food menu which we will definitely come back to try the next time we are in the area.  \"Petit Potato\"??  Should be renamed \"Big Ass Potato\" if you ask me!!
