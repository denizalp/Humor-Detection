Shawarma House is a much needed addition to this part of town! There are a few options around the area for Mediterranean, but Shawarma House is doing it right as far as the customer service and taste of the food offered. Inside is clean and they have tables and chairs with napkins and salt and shakers at each table. Sodas come in a can ($0.99 cents each) and they have bottled options (from $1.49 to $1.99) as well. From 2 pm until 4 pm (Monday - Friday) they have a Happy Hour that is worth checking out. The employees are very friendly and will offer you a sample if you aren't sure about something on the menu. I have placed to-go orders on my visits and the wait wasn't very long. \n\nLentil Soup, House Salad and Pita ($5.99 during Happy Hour) - The HH price was very reasonable. The lentil soup had great flavor and worth trying out if you like that type of soup. The salad was a smaller version of their Armenian Salad and was good, but lacking the feta cheese that was offered for an additional $2. I thought it was silly to pay that much for the smaller version and declined politely. The pita was good and I liked the amount they gave and that it was warmed. \n\nArmenian Salad with Feta ($7.99 for full order) - This was a mixture of Armenian cumbers, tomatoes, red onion, feta cheese and oil and vinegar. The full salad is only $5.99 if you don't want feta cheese, but I recommend it. The salad had a fresh taste and they put a good amount of feta. The only bummer about this salad is that it doesn't come with any pita, which I am used to at other restaurants. It's an additional $0.49 cents for each pita. I also like tzatziki which comes in a half ($3.99) or full order ($5.99) sizes, but I didn't want that big of a portion, I just wanted a side of it. The girl who took my order gladly rang me up for a small side of tzatziki at $0.49 cents and it tasted really good. Definitely try the tzatziki if you like that sort of thing. \n\nChicken Shawarma Slider ($1.99 each) - I was curious about how their chicken tasted and this was the perfect way to do just that. The pita was made in-house and the little pita pocket had chicken, tomato, lettuce and garlic sauce. The chicken had great flavor! I really love that they do not use pre-made frozen meat like some other places use. They actually season the meat themselves and layer it on the spit. The garlic sauce was good and the pita fell apart a bit, but was good also. \n\nThis place is worth checking out and they do offer delivery aside from the option of dining inside or taking your order to-go.
