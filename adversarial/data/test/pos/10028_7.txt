I went here this past Thursday, April 29th with my boyfriend because I have been craaaving chicago style, DEEP DiSH pizza. Right off the bat, I'm letting you know that this 3 star rating will change soon enough :P Long story short, my bf did NOT specify that we wanted deep dish & we ended up getting a thin crust pepperoni pizza & 12 mild chicken wings.\n\nI was very disappointed because I've been wanting a fresh, deep dish pizza & on the way home I was already thinking this pizza was not going to be as good as I'd like it to be. The 16 inch pizza was sliced into squares, which was fine & the pepperoni looked like it was barely there because it was covered with cheese :) The pizza was really a THiN crust & it wasn't hard\/crunchy or burnt. The mild chicken wings were perfect! The sauce had just enough \"mildness\" & the wings had some extra sauce in the container that I would use for some of my pizza ;) fatty, I know.\n\nI will be back to try your deep dish & you will eventually earn my stars!! Even though it was our fault we didn't specify the deep dish pizza :( haha
