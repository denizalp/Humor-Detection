I guess that old saying is true: BUYER BEWARE!\n\nI came in here not 30 minutes ago just to browse. The store is fairly well kept and is clean, and items are easy to find with placards denoting each type of item in each isle.  The furniture area seemed pretty well laid out, as well as the home furnishings in the back. \n\nI found a couple of cute pants and decided to try them on for S&G's, if you know what I mean. First I tried on a pair of mustard jeans that weren't too bad actually, but when I went to go to try on a pair of black and white polka dot leggings I had to stop myself.  First I double checked the size in the back, like I always would.  I noticed that there was a small brown stain and I thought, \"Oh, could be coffee\" but upon further inspection I noticed that the whole inside was BROWN, WITH POOP STAINS!!!!  \n\nHere's the deal.  I understand that this is a thrift shop and you might have an occasional stain on shirts and pants; but an explosive poop stain inside a pair of pants is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!! No one wants to wear anyone else's poop in their pants! My first reaction was, \"Eww gross, someone gave these to a store\" but then I was struck with the thought \"THIS STORE IS SELLING SOMEONE'S POOP STAIN!\" I can't believe this chain of stores doesn't check the inside of pants, especially pants that usually aren't meant for women to wear underwear in!\n\nAfter all that's said and done I left the store and went to another store in the plaza. A few minutes later I began to itch something terrible, so much so that I had to cut my visit short and rush home for a shower.  \n\nI won't be returning to this store and I suggest you shouldn't either. I realize that I should have spoken to a customer service rep at the store, but honestly, would they have taken it off the rack? Not if they put it there in the first place, is my guess..\n\nSo in short. BUYER. BEWARE.
