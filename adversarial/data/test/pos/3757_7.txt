Eeeeesh. I think I've been spoiled with San Diego & San Jose. \n\nThe bathrooms here are nasty! There was this brown rust\/goop trail from the hole in the sinks. Not enough seating. It looks so groddy!!!\n\nYou'd think they'd give the place an upgrade with it being so busy. Wouldn't the monies from the slot machines help?! I KNOW I LOST 14 BUCKS ON THE STAR WARS SLOTS :(
