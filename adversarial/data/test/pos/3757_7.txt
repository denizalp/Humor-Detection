I come here to get B12 and B6 shots. They make me feel amazing! I only get them every 2 weeks, cause that is what I can afford. It is $25 for just the B12 and then an extra $5 for the B6. Sometimes they are out of the B6, but usually they will have it. The B6 does burn a little going in, but its worth it. I took a friend here recently to try as well, and she enjoyed it. The shot gives you a pick me up when you are down. You have to fill out some paperwork on your initial visit, but then follow ups you can just walk in and out. They are super quick about things which is great cause I go on my lunch break. They do other things such as wraps, botox and HCG injections as well if that is what you are into. Overall, great place.
