Food: Kind of like Cold Stone, but with crepes and waffles instead. I had the waffle with nutella, marshmallows and graham crackers (yeah, it's a s'more). The waffle was big, crunchy on the outside, and warm and soft on the inside. The heat from the waffle melted the marshmallows a bit :)\n\nService: Counter service; but they actually walked over to my table to bring me my food. Bonus points for that.\n\nAmbience: Nice and spacious.
