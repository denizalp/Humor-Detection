The term \"best\" is thrown around too much. Everyone's guilty of using it too liberally, myself included. Typically, something one person thinks is the \"best\", another person might not. When it comes down to it, the term is usually debatable and not a fact.\n\nWith that said, from this day forward, I will be more careful when I use the word in the future, for I had a life changing experience today.....\n\nI just had THE BEST corned beef ever. I can see how other past claims can be debated, but there is NO debate this time. This is a fact. For lunch, I had the BEST Reuben Sandwich ever at Slymans on St. Clair!\n\nSadly, every corned beef I have from here on out will be a disappointment of mass proportions as I really don't think anyone can top this. Tender, tasty, moist, lean, succulent. It was a heavenly experience.
