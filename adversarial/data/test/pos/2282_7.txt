One of the few places that none of us had ever been to... the perfect recipe for success. At least this time it was. \n\nI hate deviled eggs. I like theirs. Deep fry anything I think I could at least try it... anything. I took one bite I was like this is yummy, and then I tasted the hard boiled egg, it's the texture really, but I highly recommend it to the deviled egg inclined.\n\nBeer cheese and pretzels. It is hard to screw up a pretzel so, they nailed that. The beer cheese I had low expectations for. Just the perfect amount of beer flavor. Too many times I have had beer cheese that tastes like... just beer, not cheese at all. It was delightful.\n\nPork belly sandwich. I wish we would have got so much more of this. Delicious, tender belly. Tasty sauce and overall just a stellar experience without much expectation. \n\nTHE VERDICT:\nGo and get yourself some pork belly. The perfect amount of food for three people who weren't very hungry when they went, and it still tickled our stomach to the maximum. No leftovers and nothing was overly expensive. I don't know what the number 595 stands for... but you need it. Believe me. Okay... maybe not need.
