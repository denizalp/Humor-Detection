DCS is in a small plaza off Abbe Road, not far from work, so I go here for lunch with coworkers on occasion.  Parking is plentiful and the workers are super friendly.\n\nDave's has great sammiches and they whip 'em up pretty fast! Not as fast as Jimmy John's down the road, but it's still great! I've never been disappointed by the food.  I've tried about 5 kinds of subs or so and I still can't decide on a favorite!  The Sloppy Dave, Super Dave and The Original Dave's Cosmic Sub are really good though.  Bread is crusty and fresh and toppings are plentiful. You gotta try Dave's Cosmic Sauce on your sub! Great stuff.  Unlike most sammich shops, DCS only offers shredded cheese, so eating can be a bit messy sometimes. They have a nice variety of kettle chips and cookies to pick from and they have fountain pop and bottled beer for drinks.\n\nThe classic rock hippie decor and groovy music is a nice touch.  The dining room is on the small side, you can still usually find a table at lunch time. Groovy!
