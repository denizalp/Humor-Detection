smack dab on the NE corner of Maryland and 7th Street, this is the grocery store under the Shell sign.\n\nyummy sandwiches. nothing you can't live without. but i think they are the best sandwiches you will get from a gas station. place also stocks a thousand different types of 50ml shooters. larger bottles too. but i'm not talkin bout that right now.\n\n\nso lets see, fill your car with gas, fill your belly with a sandwich and wash it down with 3 shots of Jim Beam. you rock. don't get caught with a DUI now.
