Oh good, there's actually a business listing already for this. I didn't know how I'd caution people away otherwise.\n\nI seem to be starting an unfortunate pattern of having not-so-great experiences when I go off friends' ideas. I love my friends still, but I was expecting something better from Rolling Fusion today. After all, they were at the Great American Foodie Fest, and they showed up to Sunset Park'd today with a similar if not identical menu.\n\nTheir menu items almost all come in the form of three tacos, and that made sharing within the trio of my friends and I convenient. My choice was the Skirt Steak Tacos ($9), and one of my friends went for the Thai Fried Chicken Tacos ($9).\n\nThe Skirt Steak Tacos looked promising with chimichurri, roasted corn spread, and fried plantain, lettuce, and queso fresco listed as ingredients. The flavors just seemed muted overall. The meat was not flavorful on its own, and the sauce elements and whatnot did not bestow enough flavor to make it taste like much. I was really disappointed in the lack of corn flavor in particular. The tortilla was seemed most prominent to my taste buds, and unfortunately, they didn't really oil\/grill up those starchy suckers. It's a shame.\n\nThe Thai Fried Chicken Tacos were better. I got more mileage out of the coconut milk, lemongrass, honey wasabi, and green papaya slaw. The chicken breading was nice and crunchy too. Still, it's not comparable to any good Thai dishes in the various restaurants of that sort available in town, and I wouldn't get it again or recommend it.\n\nThis is more of a 2.5 rating, but I'm giving Rolling Fusion some sympathy since they look like a family-run business. I hope they work on improving their recipes, and I do wish them success because of the promise of their concepts, but they probably won't find much support on my dime.
