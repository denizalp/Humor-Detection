I usually go to this Circle K after a glorious meal at El Pollo Supremo across the street. This is the shadiest looking Circle K that I have ever been to. There's a lot of random people and homeless loitering outside and they stare and give out weird vibes as they watch you park your car up front and stare at you walking into the store. Definitely doesn't give me a great or comfortable feeling when all eyes are on you. As I step foot inside this, the floors and the counters are super dirty like they haven't cleaned or mopped in a week which is gross. It really makes me think how clean their cups and lids are. 2 stars because they have friendly cashiers. Stopping at this Circle K has always been a quick one. I definitely don't want to be hanging around for more than 10 minutes.
