I had read some of the reviews before I went to the Pierogi Cafe but I went stupid when I got there to place my order.  I got 6 potato and cheese but I got them boiled--evidently the default--instead of fried.  I added the caramelized onion for a topping.  Since I also got two of the paczki to take home, the woman who waited on my gave me a cup for some free coffee from the counter near the entrance.  I enjoyed the coffee while I waited for the pierogis.\n\nMentally, I did a double take when I got the dumplings because of my forgetfulness.  I took a taste of one and it was rather bland.  A little salt helped the situation.  I am also not used to having pierogi made with farmers cheese instead of a more flavorful cheese.  Frying them might have made the cheese taste more, but the potato\/cheese pierogi were just OK.  The dough was OK.  I appreciated the thinness of it instead of the clunky thickness of some frozen varieties.\n\nPerhaps they had too high a standard to meet because my mother-in-law used to make the pierogis for the family.  It was her homemade pierogi that I had in mind and to that comparison, these were disappointing.  I think I get pretty much the same quality pierogi buying frozen ones available in a specialty grocery and baking them with onions and butter.\n\nOn the other hand, the two paczki were flavorful.  They are only gotten in for a short period of time before Lent--specifically some Polish friends refer to Fat Tuesday as Paczki Day.\n\nI know pierogi are available with a number of fillings but I am more a traditionalist and go for just the potato and cheese although my mother-in-law also made sauerkraut filled pierogi which I tried once and then ignored from then on.
