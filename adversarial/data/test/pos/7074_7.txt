I'm giving them 2 stars, why? Well, I subtract one star for each tip jar on the counter. While I really like Cold Stone, there ice cream is always top notch, I am so done with tip jars all over the place. Do we really need 3 jars? How about just continue to do a good job and be rewarded by collecting a paycheck? One tip jar okay, but that's it.
