It's always iffy trying an unfamiliar sushi place for the first time, especially when you invite coworkers out for lunch and feel the responsibility of selecting a good restaurant. Thankfully, Akita did me proud. \n\nThe service was quick, the price was great ($12.99 All-You-Can-Eat), and the rolls were fresh and delicious. \n\nBeing a vegetarian I know I don't get the full sushi experience, but the avocado roll was great and the tofu sushi was as good as everywhere else. I just wish they had a tofu roll (so few places do!). My coworkers  seemed to enjoy their fishier selections, along with their teppanyaki and teriyaki. \n\nWe plan on making lunch at Akita a monthly tradition!
