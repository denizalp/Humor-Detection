I've had Bonchon up in Northern VA when visiting my cousins over the holidays. Naturally I was excited to see a branch open in Charlotte. My brother and I went for a Sunday dinner during my last visit one month ago. It wasn't busy so we were seated immediately. Our server was nice, but didn't really check up on us during our meal. I really did want more water.\n\nAnyway, we came for their signature chicken. After trying the Shrimp Schuman (Fried) to tide us over, I was awaiting the crispy, saucy goodness. The shumai was blah and the honey Dijon sauce was too sweet. We ordered the medium Signature Fried Chicken in Soy Garlic drums (8 pieces) that came with two sides of the pickled radish. The chicken was as crispy and juicy as I remembered. The sauce was flavorful. The fries were also good, thick, nice and crispy, and an evenly seasoned batter.\n\nGlad to hear Bonchon will be opening in a Chicago soon. It'll have some stiff competition with local standards, but always nice to have another option to get my fried chicken fix.
