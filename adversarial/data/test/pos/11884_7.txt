This is a tough one, I am in love with the atmosphere, their ahi tuna appetizer and their huge selection of beers and mixed drinks. However, if it wasn't for this last visit, this would have been a solid five, now, it's a two. Our bartender (we always sit the bar wherever we go) didn't think nor care we existed as warm bodies on this round planet. She ignored us, ignored us more and when she finally came over, she just dropped menus and walked away. The proper thing to do would have been to ask what we would like to drink and maybe a hello, that would have been nice. We had to ask to order drinks...AT A BAR, and had to ask to order our food. We ordered, no food for 27 minutes. Literally timed it. All we ordered was the pretzel app, ahi tuna app and the feature Irish menu potato cake things (that were awesome). When they finally came out, the pretzels were different than every other time we have came and the dips changed, or should I say cheese water and some sweet and sour plum sauce. So off. I asked about our cheese water as my boyfriend hated it since he wanted cheese, not watery stuff that was not cheesy, she said \"that's all we have\" and walked away. My boyfriend ordered another Makers and diet...never got it. Waters were empty and we asked to close out, she brought our bill back ten minutes later...he just handed her his card as we were done. She then goes \"oh I forgot your drink\" he said, \"don't worry about it, we are already done\" (twenty minutes wait time wise) she then said she needed to adjust our bill because she charged us for it but never made nor served it , but managed to charge us for it. This was not a busy time as the Cubs game was going but not near over. Bummer, severely disappointing for a place we love :(
