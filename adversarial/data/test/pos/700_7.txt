I love everything about this place! It is probably one of the cutest restaurant's in Phoenix! The service is so warm and friendly and very accommodating to your every need.  Their hummus is SO flavorful, and you get a big portion. I personally think they have one of the best Veggie burgers in town, it 's homemade. They always have great daily specials ranging from soups, sandwiches, coffee, tea, and pizzas. There cactus blossom white tea is to die for! I love the two little piggies they have out back! They are really cute but beware they do bite. If your downtown and looking for a cool relaxing place to go to with great food, then the Paisley Violin is for you!
