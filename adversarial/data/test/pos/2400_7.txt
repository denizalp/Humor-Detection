I will never ever buy another gun from these people, the manager Dave at Az Guns in Chandler Az has no customer service skills what so ever! He was very unprofessional and nasty when talking to me! I have previously bought several guns from the owner, who is also a firefighter like myself! Not only was Dave the manager unprofessional and nasty with me, he didn't even want to work out the mistake that his employee made with me! Definitely gonna tell all the firemen that I know, not to buy a gun from AZ GUNS
