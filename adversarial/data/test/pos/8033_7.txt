I've given it 3, but really I wanted to give it a 2.5\n\nThis place is okay. That's all I really feel about it. It's definitely different from it's predecessor, Woo. \n\nThree of my friends and I came here yesterday to catch up over some AYCE. That's what regular people do now right??\n\nWe opted to sit on the patio, which got a little chilly, but that's not their fault. \n\nThough, the chairs weren't that comfy and my big bum barely fit into it..so be cautious if you're plus sized (like moi)\n\nWe ordered alot of things, and here's a few of the memorable items (be it good or bad)\n\n1. Kalbi (beef ribs) - Mediocre. I was saddened.\n\n2. The Shrimp Temps - Too much batter. \n\n3. The Beef Tataki - Too much dressing. I couldn't even enjoy the texture. I was saddened because it's my new love.\n\n4. The Maki - good amounts of fish. I found some of them too be rice heavy, while others were not.\n\n5. The beef enoki - awesome. \n\n6. The Chicken Teriyaki - the chicken was.. sticky when I chewed it.\n\n7. The pad thai - a little too... ketchup-y. \n\n8. The Dessert was standard ice cream fare...but they had Tiramisu too! That was awesome. Loved it. \n\n\n\nI had really high hopes for this place, but they just didn't meet them.\n\nThe Ipad system is cool, and you'll end up playing with it for like 20 - 30 mins, just don't forget your company. Or go alone, if you want to play. \n\nI dunno if i'll come back..it's sister restaurant, Sushi 168 at Dufferin\/ Steeles is better.
