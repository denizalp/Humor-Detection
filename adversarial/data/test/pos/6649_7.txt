My family and I went here after watching a movie...not my idea.  I ordered garlic parmesan fries and the meatball slider sampler: classic meatball with classic sauce, chicken meatball with Parmesan cream and beef meatball with spicy meat sauce. The classic sauce and spicy meat sauce tasted identical so I didn't taste variety at all.  The Parmesan sauce tasted like pesto so I was left feeling confused as to what I just ate. I mean, the meatballs were quite juicy and sizeable so they weren't that bad.  The fries didn't taste like garlic or Parmesan at all...it was salty but that was it.  \n\nThe servers reminded us of \"Jersey Shore\"...Ronnie, Mike \"The Situation\", Pauly D. And the meatballs reminded me of...well, Snookie!  It wasn't the best service I've had.  Our server was already giving us the check without even asking us if we wanted dessert or anything else.  He probably had some fist pumpin' to do and was in a hurry.\n\nFor dessert, I got a scoop of Nutella gelato. It was ok...not the best Nutella gelato I've had. It tasted like dark chocolate with lots of sugar and bits of hazelnuts.  Somebody in our group got a Black and White milkshake and loved it.  It took about 20 minutes before we got our desserts.  How hard is it to scoop ice cream and put it in a cup?  Does it take 20 minutes?  I was watching the lady behind the gelato station - I hope she doesn't have any plans of working for anywhere that requires speed and alertness.
