One of my favorite coffee shops in Arizona ... Maverick Coffee is located in a very unassuming plaza and is a great escape from big crowds at other \"popular\" cafes.\n\nI always do an iced latte, because well ... it's hot out and always found their lattes to be on point and simple. My favorite food item to get here has got to be their Vegetarian Panini! I'm by no means a vegetarian, but this sandwich is goooooood. A sandwich filled with chevre, avocado, grilled zucchini and seasoned on foccacia bread. \n\nService here is always great, cashiers and baristas are friendly and fast. Music isn't too loud. There's a variety of seating from table, bar or couch for your working or lounging pleasure. Some outlets are available for you laptop workers. Also, do yourself a favor and sit at the couches ... not if you're working though, they are incredibly comfortable you might end up falling asleep.
