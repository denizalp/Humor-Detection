I booked TWO rooms for my and my friends to have a good time in Las Vegas! We love Vegas but will definitely stay at  a different hotel at our next visit.\n\nFirst, we checked into our first room at 1:30! Yay, one room was ready! and our 2nd room was suppose to be the connecting room next door, but.. that didn't end up happening. :( our 2nd room was not ready until 6:15pm and wasn't even the connecting room! \n\nAnd in our 2nd room we didn't have shampoo or conditioner!! So I had to call for them to bring it up but it took them 1 hour to do so because the runner was all backed up! Aye mi. That was just the beginning... Then we called to go to Marque and the concierge put us down, but later we found out from a promoter the club wasn't even open that night! (Thursday on 4th of July!) only one of the rooms (Boombox, which isn't the main one) was open! The concierge failed to tell us that! \n\nAnyways, I don't want to keep complaining BUT I will say for a luxury hotel, their staff from the receptionist desk to the concierge, to the security that didn't know where things was or how much the buffet cost all need some training. On the job training is NOT enough! I think for this price, the room and staff definitely could have been better. I would stay at an older but more experienced hotel.\n\nHope this helps!
