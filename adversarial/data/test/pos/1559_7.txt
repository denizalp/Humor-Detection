We would have loved to experience this first annual Chandler BBQ event... however due to some piss poor planning we and hundreds of other people were left out in the cold (or should I say hot). \n\nSee... this event was supposed to go from 10am-9pm on Saturday, but by 1:30pm when we arrived they announced via megaphone that no more tickets were being sold and they were apparently \"out of meat\". Please tell me how an event which is supposed to go all day until 9pm blows it load just three hours into the festivities? \n\nTo make matters worse, when we were turned away they explained that they'd be re-opening ticket sales at 4pm and more food would be available. So we planned our whole afternoon around this, and wasted time until 4. When we arrived for our second attempt of the day, to our shigrin they changed their minds yet again and reneged on what they had said earlier. Now... tickets were on sale for five bucks... but there was no BBQ!!!! No BBQ at a BBQ Fest... ex-fucking-scuse me? Basically five bucks to walk around and stare at a bunch of empty BBQ reminants... it just didn't make much sense.\n\nSo many people drove across town to come here (including us) and I really hope next time they put some more time into the planning of this event... it has promise. Hopefully we'll be able to return next year and actually be able to review the food... and not the ill planned event itself. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
