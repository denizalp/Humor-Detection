Summer has begun! Which means it's time to break out the bathing suits and sunglasses. In search of a lazy river on the cheap, I found McDowell Mountain Ranch Aquatic Center. At only $6 per Scottsdale resident, it was just what the doctor ordered. We packed up a cooler full of water and snacks and hit the pool. Since it's early May, there were still plenty of lounge chairs available around the big U-shaped pool, so we snagged a couple. On one side of the U, there's a nice, shallow kids area with lots of splashing water, an area for some basketball at the bottom of the U, and then at the other side, a deeper, more quiet area. All around are lifeguards. Lifeguards galore! If I were to forget how to swim, I'd have absolutely no concern here. I did see some boys get schooled by one of the lifeguards about playing rough with the basketball. You tell 'em, boss!\n\nWe didn't go on the big, swirly slide, but after we had gotten our fill of relaxing pool time, we finally hit up the lazy river. All they need are some tunes! It's fun to lay back and watch the kids try to rush through on their tubes (so be prepared for some benign side swipes). \n\nClean bathrooms, pleasant employees, sunny weather. Bring on the 115 degree temps because I know where I'll be!
