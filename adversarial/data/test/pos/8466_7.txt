This place has changed hands so much but it is the same car wash I've been going to in Bethel Park for some time now. Outside there are vacuums for self cleaning the inside of your car. As usual you go to a machine, select the type of wash you want and wait for the gate to open.\n\nI had a man help me since the gate wasn't working. I basically wanted an undercarriage wash to get that salt off my car so he selected the one I needed at the lowest cost.\n\nThe routine is familiar. You drive in and someone helps you align your car so that it gets on the track, put your car in neutral and chill out while you ride through. This car wash does use brushes so heads up if any of you are scratch concerned.\n\nThe car wash does leave your car with some drips of water on your windshield and I'm sure other places so I would advise you carry a rag or chamois cloth if you want to dry off the excess itself.\n\nAs always it is best to get there early on a nice warm day because you'll end up waiting for a long time otherwise. I've been pleased with their results and will continue to use them as needed.
