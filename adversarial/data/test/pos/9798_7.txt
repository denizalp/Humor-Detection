After a night of partying till the sun came out, the only thing we wanted was a hot bowl of porridge (or jook) to ease our grumbly tummies. After a quick Yelp search, we were on the way to Big Wong. Unfortunately, we found out that they were out of jook when we got there. What a bummer!\n\nWe ended up still ordering wonton noodles, Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce and Hainanese chicken. Everything was good, though nothing was spectacular. The noodles in the wonton noodles were a bit rough and they do not serve the ginger sauce that traditionally comes with the Hainanese chicken. \n\nBig Wong Restaurant is an OK option if you're looking for quick, cheap and no frills Chinese food.
