Friendly service and jerky made on-site in about 20 flavors! JB's teriyaki is my favorite, but the teriyaki with black pepper is also pretty good, they're not too sweet like I usually find teriyaki jerky. They also offer some more unique flavors like green chile and \"better than steak\" (which actually wasn't, to me). Service is really sweet and they're happy to have you sample plenty of flavors to figure out what you like. \n\nNote that the space is small and hours are a bit limited. They have a progressive discount, so the more you purchase, the lower you pay per bag: $10\/ea, or 2\/$18, 3\/$27, etc.
