I absolutely love the use of an old garage--just genius! Plus, what's not to love--a lot of beer on draft AND real coffee equals the best of all worlds or for all members of your party.\n\nI'll admit to having to look up what a Kevlar coffee was and then phoning a friend for additional help, which resulted in more Google searches after this text from Mark H. \"Supposed to get good shit through the blood brain barrier or some shit\" and \"is that the one with butter?\" from Nicole H. Plus \"it's tasty.\" \n\nI wish now that I would have tried it, but that gives me at least one to come back. \n\nI did have a cappuccino and will definitely order a Kevlar next time.
