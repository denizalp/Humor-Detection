I am fortunate to live close to Vinnie's Pizza.  If you want to take step back to the early years of Pittsburgh and have a fun history lesson at the same time you should come here!  The pizza is delicious and loaded with fresh ingredients.  The pepperoni pizza has fresh sliced sticks of pepperoni covering the pie.  If you get it to go they put the pizza on a cardboard sheet, put paper over-top of it and then staple the paper to the bag!  \n  Health wise, this may take several years off of your life!  But then again, those extra years might not be the same without Vincent's Pizza!
