Mingo has been on my list since it opened.  With its close proximity to the Art Square Theatre, I had always planned to go there before a play.  That's what I did last night.\n\nI got there a little after 6 PM and I found out that Happy Hour was until 7 PM.  I ordered the Notorious P.I.G. which is a hot dog with bacon, pickled jalapeño rounds, and horseradish macaroni and cheese all on a hot dog bun.  It was quite good.  The hot dog was grilled and the bacon and jalapeño slices added to the flavor.  I didn't taste much horseradish in the mac and cheese.  I was hoping for a kick, but it just wasn't there.  Along with Notorious P.I.G., I ordered a side of fries.  These were great!  Nicely seasoned with just the right amount of salt.  Very flavorful.\n\nOf course, I couldn't leave without dessert so I ordered their chocolate crunch which is about a 2 inch by 1 1\/2 inch round of chocolate mousse that has been covered with melted chocolate and then hardened.  You crack through the chocolate exterior--the crunch--to get to the mousse inside.  It was very good.  There was some mango syrup on the plate and a few slices of fresh strawberry.  A great ending to the meal.\n\nService was good.  My server, Eddie, was around to refill my iced tea several times and was very helpful.  The place is relatively small.  When I come back, I'll opt for a high top table.  Where I sat was very comfortable until you eat.  You sit low and have to lean forward and up to reach the table.
