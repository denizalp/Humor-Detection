After reading the review on Charlotte.com I was anxious to try the new, and updated Dynasty.  Unfortunately my experience was very disappointing.  From the wait staff to the food, I was not pleased.  The staff ignored my table, and attended others, that arrived after us.  There was no explanation of the \"traveling carts\" and once we requested a cart to come by, the food was cold, over processed, and very bland.  We tried a variety of steamed and pan\/fried dishes, and they were all disappointing.  I will not return.\nOn a side note, I look to Charlotte.com to see what restaurants\/dives\/etc. are in Charlotte to try and this did not live up to what I read.
