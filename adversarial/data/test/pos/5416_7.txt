Stopped by tonight for their free open house! It's located in an empty warehouse. Haven't been to their other locations so I'm not sure if that's the norm. If you go after dark, it's kind of hard to find. The warehouse area is very dark and you enter in through a side door that is marked by their sign outside. I'm guessing they are still in the middle of setting up the place so it's pretty empty inside except for 4 wooden bullseye targets. Event page says we would get a lesson but we came close to closing time, so some other guests there gave us some pointers and we just worked at it. They were so nice to stay open an extra 15 minutes just so we could get a chance to throw a bit. \n\nThere's a giant spray-painted picture on one wall in the warehouse and it is Care Bears-themed so super adorable! Pretty cool place. Would like to come back when the place has completed its setup!
