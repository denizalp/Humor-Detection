I want to start off saying my review is not for this location.  My review is for Credit One Bank in general.  Do yourself a favor and DO NOT SIGN UP WITH THESE PEOPLE!!!      Just last week, I activated my card.  The same week I got a billing for $81.95 right off the bat!!! I've never even used it!!!  If they are going to bill you for \"annual fees\", they should tell you it will be on your VERY FIRST billing.  But however, it hasn't been even 1 full month!!  Also, I requested a US based rep to call me back but they said it would take 24-48 hours for someone to call me.  No one ever did!  I ended up cancelling my account.  I'm so much better off!  The supervisor in India  (Nick) who \"helped\" me said they couldn't send me an email saying my account was closed!  Wow! I mean if a small company that you can buy local things from can send a customer an email, why couldn't a global company like COB do the same??!!!  He asked me for my address.  But I said it should be on your screen in front of you.  You can read it back to me and I'll tell you if it's correct. He said he couldn't read it back to me!  REALY??!!!   OMG!  very bad customer service!  I warn EVERYBODY, do yourself a favor and DO NOT SIGN UP WITH THESE PEOPLE!!!!
