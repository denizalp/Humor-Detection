Wow, I tried, I really did.  But the Double beat me.  This place, like all things in life, are gonna be as fun as you make it.  People who can eat more than the doubles are from another planet.  The double was good and the chili rocked.  My cousin ordered the same with but with bacon and killed it!  Me on the other hand, I gave it my all but came up short and had to suffer the spanks from the Naughty Nurse.  Did I really lose?
