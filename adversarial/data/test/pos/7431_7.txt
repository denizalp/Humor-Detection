We have always enjoyed the Oregano's chain and this one is not much different than the others. My last visit was during the record breaking rain from hurricane Norbert. It was decided to close the shop and have a fun Ferris Bueller's Day off.\n\nThis location seems a little smaller the some of the others and can get very busy. They usually have some pretty cool jazz music playing or something that will make you want to tap your foot while you wait.\n\nUsually get one of the the Real Big Salads or a tasty and delicious Thin Crust Pizza. Could not resist ordering the Numero One-O Stuffed Pizza on my last visit. Decided to get it TO GO and it must of weighed ten or twenty pounds.\n\nFood is always pretty tasty and the service is friendly and attentive. Really like their homemade sausage and the Rib Eye Salad. Looking forward to trying out the famous Original Pizza Cookie with Ice Cream for the topper on our next visit.\n\nLocated in the PV Mall parking lot in the SE corner next to the candy store. The restaurants in this parking lot are always changing but this one is definitely a keeper. PIZZA ME BABY!\n\n3.75 STARS
