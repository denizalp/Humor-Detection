The bartender, Jason, was a prick. He wouldn't take our drink order b\/c we were sitting on the backside if the bar. When we told him we only wanted to order shots, he said a server would be right with us. The front wasn't full, it's just everyone with their extra carry-ons + leaving 1 seat in between each other, there weren't two seats in a row for us on the front side. The server we eventually got tried to make the excuse that the bartender is busy, but you could tell that he was just an ass. When we only ended up ordering drinks from the bar, it was evident that even the server was perplexed why the bartender didn't jst take our order. Anyway, our server ended up being very friendly and understanding. He saved this experience for us ... other wise this review would have been a 1 Star.
