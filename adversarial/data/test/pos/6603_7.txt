Kan Zaman, according to the website, means \"Once upon a time\"\n\nKan zaman, there was a couple, starving and looking for good Middle Eastern food\n\nThey had heard from co-workers that this was a good place to go\n\nSo, they came here one chilly Saturday, looking for the lunch buffet advertised on their website\n\nBut, unfortunately, it seems like the buffet is only on weekdays.\n\nThe food regardless, was very good.  They did the next best thing, which was order the sampler platter, which was a combination of both their cold and hot foods.  It included baba ganoush, hummos, grape leaves, tabouli, falafel, kibbee, and several skewers of lamb and chicken.  The real standouts were the baba ganoush and the kibbee, some of the best to be had in Cleveland.\n\nAlso, the Turkish coffee was perfect, very smooth and not bitter at all.\n\nSo, after the end of their meal, they decided this was a good place to go, and some day they would like to try the lunch buffet to sample even more Middle Eastern food.
