This is painful. We've been coming here since shortly after the folks running TC's Rib Crib escaped hurricane Katrina. We bragged about them and sent our friends. \nI can no longer recommend this place. We spent $30 on beef ribs that were way too fatty, probably boiled first, the greens were bitter and stringy. \nThese people used to win awards. I don't know what happened but, they lost their touch.
