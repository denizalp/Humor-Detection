Gross probably about one of the worst AYCE sushi places I've tried in the city. \n\nNothing fresh, nothing made right, portions are so large, it's unreal. I had a single order of chicken terriyaki and I get a bowl of oversauced gummy chicken the size of Texas?\n\nThe restaurant's mission is clear.. to stuff you with rice or whatever you order til you're sick of it. \n\nPrice for dinner wasn't cheap either and service was cold as a cucumber. \n\nNever again!
