BACKGROUND\n\nI'm a HUGE fan of the \"DINNING EXPERIENCE\" and Mastro's delivered!\n\nMASTRO'S\n\nMastro's collection of sophisticated, classic Steakhouses and Ocean Club seafood locations are recognized for their combination of world-class service, highly acclaimed cuisine, and live entertainment in an elegant yet energetic atmosphere. A truly unparalleled dining experience.\n\nMastro's Restaurants is owned by Landry's, Inc. and is led by a team of highly motivated and detail oriented management who strive for excellence in guest service, finest quality food and distinct ambiance - elements that set Mastro's apart from other restaurant groups.\n\nAlthough each restaurant possesses unique design elements, all exhibit commonality in their goals: to provide every guest with a truly memorable experience. Mastro's in Scottsdale combines casual elegance with an edgy southwest feel, including impressive Chihuly Glass accent chandeliers. \n\nTHE STORY\n\nI had a business colleague in town who wanted a mix between fancy and fun, that would be guaranteed to be excellent. We decided Mastro's would fit those requirements.\n\nUpon arriving, there was a gentleman who assisted me out of the car and into the restaurant, which I greatly appreciate. \n\nThe entrance is impressive and sets the stage for a lovely evening.\n\nThere is a gorgeous bar area and inviting dining room section. We were seated at a lovely table overlooking the North Scottsdale desert, where we could watch the beautiful sunset.\n\nWe started with Mastro's Lemon Drop Martini's. They are served with dry ice, that gives a theatrical vibe to the drink, which is SUPER FUN! Not to mention DELICIOUS!\n\nOne of our appetizers was the daily catch fresh oysters on the half shell, served with all of the accoutrements. SUPERB!\n\nI had the fresh lobster entr√©e which was a complete home run.\n\nThe wine list was impressive, of which we partook, and finished the evening at the bar, listening to live music.\n\nSERVICE EXPERIENCE\n\nThe service was excellent, albeit a tad too obtrusive and too quick to want to remove everything. We had to tell the waiter a couple times to simmer down. But too much attention is not a horrible problem to have :)\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nYou know the saying, \"You get what you pay for?\" Well in this case, that saying is 100% accurate. Nothing but FIRST CLASS all the way!!\n\nI can't wait to go back!!\n\n5\/5 RECOMMEND\n\nOF NOTE\n\n*Locations: Mastro's Restaurants can be found in prominent cities across the U.S., including the original Mastro's Steakhouse in North Scottsdale.
