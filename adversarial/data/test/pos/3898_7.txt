Have had several different carpet cleaning services to our home and they have done an ok job but the high traffic areas never seemed to get clean enough. I explained this to the people at Servpro and they explained they had a 2 step cleaning process they would use for those areas.  Tyler came and worked very hard on those areas and they came out great. I most definitely will be using them again and recommend them highly.
