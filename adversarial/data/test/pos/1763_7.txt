Astonishing Gym \/ Fitness facilities.\nCan't comment on the spa as didn't use it, but the gym was as good as I've used, not just in a hotel, full stop - never felt busy due to it's sheer size and all the staff were really friendly above and beyond the usual required levels.\nIf you're staying in the Encore, take a scoot down and use these facilities as they're excellent.
