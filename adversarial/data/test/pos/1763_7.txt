Rosa Blanca is a great place to go if you care more about the looks of a restaurant than the food. We heard there was a place in Gilbert that served the Mexico City style tortas and tacos that we usually only get in Phoenix. So we entered with great anticipation, and yes it is a nice restaurant. Modern look, art on the walls, exhibition style kitchen. It went seriously downhill from there. The owner\/manager sat us, an obviously inexperienced waitress took our order and returned with drinks for another table. We tried the chicharron de queso, which is a cheese crisp without the tortilla. I'm guessing the cheese is fried in a small skillet, allowed to cool until it can be wrapped around a rolling pin and the slid off and served as a cylinder with a smidgin of guac and a taste of their two salsas. $7.89! Wait! That's the cost of an entree at any other taco and torta place I've been to. Then after waiting way too long, my wife's two tacos(2.99 each) came out (small eater), and my torta(8.29). The \"La Culeca\" is advertised as a butterflied chicken breast with light panko breading...ya da, ya da.  What I got was 2-3 oz of pounded thin breaded chicken breast  fried to a dry crisp served on an oversized torta bun that I kept breaking off pieces just to find some chicken and a semblance of a torta. I looked over at my wife and she was in disbelief. Her two tacos, one chicken and one beef had just a morsel of meat in the middle of each taco. The chicken had no taste(overcooked, sat holding too long?) and the beef was ok. Served with no salsa, so we had to flag down the owner\/manager who was running between the kitchen, front, and trying to assist the rookie waitress who now had 7 tables.  Which is why we never saw her. As a former restaurant mgr, only a pro with years of experience would get 5. But this is tacos and tortas presumably. My wife left hungry and we both felt ripped off. \nMy take on Rosa Blanca is that they advertise artisinal (their spelling, not mine) Mexico City cuisine, one would conjure up something like Barrio Cafe. But it's tacos and tortas!! That conjures up Los Reyes de Tortas that serves a platter of 3 Mexico City style tacos for 4.99 and the entire taco is covered with your meat choice along with garnish of cucumber slices, radish, lettuce, a grilled jalapeno. A ceviche tostada is piled with shrimp\/fish ceviche  and topped with half an avocado in slices on top. And it costs a whole 2.99! Tortas with meat spilling out of the sides are in the 6.29 range and only a very hungry person with finish one. The flavors in the food are wonderful, the staff anxious to please. And yes, it is a casual place, not as fancy a Rosa Blance but the food is sooo much better.  I'll make the trip there any day. That's my benchmark for Mexico City food ( aka estilio D.F.) \nGilbert: you deserve better than Rosa Blanca!!
