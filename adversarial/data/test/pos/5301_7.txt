I'm glad something was built on the old landfill, but seriously, THIS is what we got?! (If it was like San Tan Village I would be thrilled.) Instead, we get an abomination of a strip mall, with a parking lot that I'm convinced was designed by a drunk 6 year old, and some of the worst big box stores in history. (Who, besides my grandmother, shops at JCPennys and Ross?)\nThere are simply not enough good reasons\/stores to go here. It's the worst of suburbia plopped down in a prominent location off the 202 and 101.\nI don't like being only negative, so I will say that sometimes they have live music in \"The district\" and I've seen some good local bands.
