Love this hotel, no casino and it is smoke-free!  Suite was spacious and very nice.  I love the interior - the decors and layout of room.  Very comfortable, beautiful view.  The only thing i didn't like were the white towels.  They didn't look so white and had stains on them (even the new ones I requested). Kitchen doesn't come with pots, pans, utensils but you can request for them (no charge). I was on the 52nd floor, room 52003.....city view. Try requesting a room with an even #, i think those rooms have way better view (fountain).  I asked to see if they had any complimentary upgrade but they were booked for the weekend. Overall, great experience!
