We came in around 2 am and were seated immediately. Rebecca was our server and she was great! Great with checking up on us, refills, and even fun to talk to! She grabbed our drinks immediately and gave us a few minutes to look at the menu.\n\nI got the country fried steak breakfast. It comes with hash browns and eggs! The steak was a little smaller than usual but it's not that dramatic to me. My boyfriend got the salted caramel and banana cream breakfast. It's off their winter menu so it's only for a limited time! Probably some of the best pancakes we've both ever had. The shortbread pieces make it to me. It brought such a nice crunch element to it!!! It comes with eggs, hash browns, and either bacon or sausage! I regret not getting it. The portion was big and it was so delicious! I highly recommend getting it if you're going to a Denny's soon. \n\nFrom what I know, every Denny's is 24 hours! Dennys has never failed to make some really good food!
