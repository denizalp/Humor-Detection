I am super disappointed at our experience last night! We went for my sister in law's 40th last night and it was awful.\n\nThe main problem in this restaurant is the value. Each entree averages around 30, but many are in the 40s. I had the filet newburgh and ordered it medium rare. First, it came out almost completely well done. I sent it back. When it came out the second time, it was blue rare (only seared and nothing more). The manager came over and was appropriately horrified, and offered another meal, but by that point everyone was already done withy their meal so I declined. The seafood on top of the steak was over salted to the point where I could not even eat almost anything on the plate. They did make another and then wrapped it up for me... However, 3 diff tries at one dish is insane. \n\nMy husband got the Neptune pasta. The noodles were overcooked and the sauce was mediocre. If this was Applebee's it would be fine...\n\nThe service was terrible. I understand our waitress was new. However, even when you are new, they should not let you have a table on your own until you can answer questions knowledgeably (what the size of desserts are, what types of wine pair with things, etc.). While this is not required of a restaurant where entrees are in the teens, for sure it is if you pay 30-50 dollars for an entree!!\n\nThe water glasses were always empty. They didn't bring out any bread until the main course. They immediately brought out packed up food and placed them in the middle of the table before we even got dessert. They forgot to acknowledge my sis in law's Bday with a candle\/cake. They brought out one dessert and then we all waited 10 min for the remaining desserts. A huge tray fell right behind the Bday girls chair where the inexperienced wait staff dropped everything on the floor from another table. Then they forgot to take my meal (which was incorrect twice) off the bill and we had to wait again for our waitress to fix it.\n\nThis all happened while music alternated between Elton John and margaritaville, which is more appropriate at a beach bar...\n\nOne or two of these things are understandable. All of these things together are insane and not appropriate for a meal that cost almost $500 for 6 people. If it weren't for her Bday, I would have totally made a bigger deal of all of this at the restaurant. However, it was her special day and I didn't want to further ruin it.\n\nThis place needs to make major changes to the service and the food.\n\n1 star for a great view.
