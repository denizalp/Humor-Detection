My favorite is still the jambalaya but the only time I ever eat at Shucks is night or late night and the atmosphere is just not there for me at this location.  My favorite dishes have always been the jambalaya, lamb chops, big mother shucker, oysters!, and crab legs.  \n\nThe food is still good and the oysters are still one of the best in Las Vegas but it's just awkward sitting at the bar when drunk and stinky people are around you, a bartender isn't quite friendly and not even around as often, but I'll still come back.  Late night eats here is okay but it's one of the few that are open so I have to deal with it.
