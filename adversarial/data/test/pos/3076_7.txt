My neighborhood Walgreens. Normally, I have a good experience. Today Assistant Store Manager Juliana was preoccupied with leaving the store at noon rather than providing excellent customer service. I had a simple return and asked if I can receive $2 off on the Advil I purchased a day ago. The Advil was advertised in the paper today for $2 off.  Although the Advil was on the same receipt as the item I was returning, she replied no! She said I made the purchase before the sale. I asked if I had return the Advil I had purchased and then buy it back again, she said yes. REALLY?\n\nThis is what my customer experience was like with Assistant Store Manager Juliana:\n-Juliana did not greet me.\n-she did not look at me during the entire transaction.\n-she did not thank me for shopping at Walgreens nor did she tell me to have a nice day.\n-when I said I had a question, she replied \"what?\"\n\nJuliana needs more training in customer service. Maybe someone who appreciates having a job can replace her. \n\nWalgreens...do a better job at training your managers. Maybe she was just having a bad day. Take the day off!\n\nKyle was the gentleman who rang up my items. Juliana did have time for that a really didn't give a damn. He had eye contact, was extremely nice, personable and kind. He greeted all customers, thanked them and bid them a good day. I hope to have Kyle assist me in the future. Kyle is more qualified to be assistant manager than Juliana.\n\nRemember Juliana, if it were not for us customers, you would not have a job at Walgreens.
