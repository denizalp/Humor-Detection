Worst place ever!! Had 15 little jerk kids come in one after another once their brothers and whole extended family got their haircuts one by one, so I sat there for over an hour thinking I was next the whole time! I was second on the list when I got there and think maybe someone should have told me the Partridge family was there in front of me! Then \"Paul\" walks in and the idiot woman said \"hey Paul I called your name a LONG time ago.\" Well Paul got taken right back when his name was called 45 minutes prior. As far as I am concerned Paul should have been placed at the back of the line. Sounds like Paul is a little tardy and should lose his position!! Needless to say I had to go to work and never got my haircut. I will never ever go back here and look forward to telling every single person I meet for the rest of my life how terrible this place is. Oh and in the past, my haircuts have sucked every time I have been here. Totally inconsistent. At least you know that you are the best at something...the best at being the worst haircut place in the world!!!
