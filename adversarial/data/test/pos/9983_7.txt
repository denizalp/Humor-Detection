I tried this restaurant with my husband and another couple after watching Gordon Ramsey's show... Expecting the worst we went there mostly for entertainment and not great food. We were pleasantly surprised! The herbed flat bread was delicious and only $5 - a great value. All of our meals were delicious. Sammy was super attentive and welcoming. Amy came out once to a table by us to fix an issue with their food... Both were nice and our server was very nice too. We would go back!
