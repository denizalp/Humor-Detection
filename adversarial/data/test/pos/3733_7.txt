You will not see anyone from the show. You are allowed to take pictures but not in the direction of their offices. \nDon't waste your time trying to get in, it is better to take your picture outside, also you will have more chances to see them parking or leaving the place.\n\nIf there is too many people waiting, get in only if you want to pawn or buy Chumlee memorabilia. Otherwise, arrive before noon.
