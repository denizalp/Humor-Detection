My parents signed contracts with America West to build a house. They started the process because the realtor Kevin and the loan officer David Y. said they were approved for a VA loan through the company iMortgage for an amount and were able to get the house they dreamed of and wanted through this loan that was over $300,000. Based upon their approval they signed all contracts in good faith to move forward and build. This included choosing flooring with the carpet company ($9,500)  and also met with Progressive to choose electrical and cable upgrades($10,000). This was after the $15,000 cash already given them. They were instructed to pay for these upgrades up front with our own money for the house prior to completion and before we could walk through the house.The day we were supposed get the keys and do the walk through we came to the house and no representative was there. Later when we finally got a hold of them, this is when they told us we were NOT approved for the initial loan. They modified the contract and asked for more money stating that when we gave them more money it would in turn give us the approval for the loan. After this, they asked for an additional $70,000 which we did not have. So I called the VA office myself and the representative told me that I NEVER qualified for this loan. Basically the realtor and the loan officer had been lying to us. So, we refused to give any more money because WE DID NOT HAVE IT ...About a month passed and I went to the model homes and the realtor who was handling our contract was not there and I was told he was fired. We tried to speak with the new realtor and she let us know that we could use the money for another house. But we would not get the money back that we had paid for the upgrades. At this point is when they gave us the letter of denial for the loan.  . Then we sought legal help which was very expensive and we could not afford after investing so much money into the house we wanted. PLEASE DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!!!!
