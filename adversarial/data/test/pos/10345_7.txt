Rarely do I write a review right after my experience. Mostly because I need some time to process negatives and positives. But this case is simple, so...\nI ordered the top sirloin, medium rare. On the side I wanted mashed potatoes, saut√©ed mushrooms, raw bell peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes, and raw onion circles. Got mashed potatoes with green onions inside it, cooked green peas and sweet peppers. And a plate of roasted onions. Order customization failed. The steak was well done (may be I should've gone for rare?) so I didn't enjoy it either. Wait time is above normal, I'd say. They don't have Pumpernickel, they don't know what it is. The interior is ... okay. Comparing to the finest Chicago steak houses I've been to this place is 2.5 stars, but not 3. So it's 2.
