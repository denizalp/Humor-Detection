I have not been to this location but other ones with great service and great food for over ten years and this particular location is not on par with the other ones I've experienced. It could be due to poor leadership and commitment to service. I say that because other locations honor veterans with a military discount up to 25% while this location does not. Also I have only seen teenagers and staff under 25 visible, working here. Ok, now to my grievance. I placed my order at 12:14pm and it took till 12:43pm to arrive with a 30% filled facility. I'm very disappointed and no one seems to truly care.
