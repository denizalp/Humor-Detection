Ok...now I am and will remain, out of my comfort zone.  We had the most fantastic, knowledgeable (and major hottie) server, David, who just took us there. The driver on the journey to food utopia.\n\nEvery single thing he recommended, we went with and OMG. Just wonderful flavors, excellent drinks...aaaah!\n\nWe started with the Pig Face dumplings...sweet baby Jesus! Sooo amazing. \n\nFollowed by the Shrimp and Chive dumpling...speechless. We just sat there, floored. \n\nThen was the Pork Belly steamed bun...Man oh man...not one thing wrong with it. Just perfect.\n \nThe one mediocre choice was the one that I came up with and, well, we won't talk about it.  \n\nMoving on, we topped it off the with Kimchi Fried Rice...with shrimp and...(wait for it).....pork belly! My date was being so fancy with his chop sticks. He all but threw those things on the floor and grabbed the fork for more efficient rice shoving...heh heh heh. Very, very necessary.  Probably the best fried rice EVER.\n\nPlease see David (he has a man-bun) as your driver to paradise. This guy knows his stuff.\n\nGo here. Eat here. Get uncomfortable. It will be the best thing you do all year.
