Well how fickle we all are...This is yesterday's flavour....This is no longer a cool store. It is just passe. They have already had a bankruptcy in the late 80's or early 90's and the other one can't be far around the corner.\n\nThe city is 'over stored', with too many merchants selling the same stuff. I guess the A & F crowd will be swamping Hollister for awhile. Then elsewhere......\n\nThat is how it goes...
