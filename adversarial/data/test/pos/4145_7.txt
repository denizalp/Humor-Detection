I came in alone a few weeks and saw a business man at the counter. He was irritated. \n\n\"No soy sauce??\" \n\nHe just didn't seem to understand that this place is geared towards Thai cuisine vs. standard asian foods. If you're looking for chicken chow mein, this is not the zone for you. If you want interesting Thai dishes with a small american twist, then give this place a shot. You will be glad you did.\n\nI'm in it for the Pad Thai. I have to say, their Tofu Pad Thai is the absolute best in Cleveland. Beats Banana Blossom, beats Phenom Penh, beats that new joint up by 130th etc. It's all about tofu preparation and they nail it. Noodles are a little different then you expect, but try it three or four times and you'll realize you're hooked.\nHuge portions and when you tell them to bring the heat, they make it real spicy! If you order carry out, I think the portions are even larger and it will be ready in 15 minutes every time! $8.00 for a huge portion of Pad Thai seems fair to me. \nThe samosa appetizers are also pretty darn good if I say so myself.\n\nPark across the street and take a small walk, it's good for you! No parking 4:00-6:30 monday - friday. You will dine in a comfortable and modest interior, which is usually quiet. The atmosphere is extremely laid back. If you're the type that needs to be served and pampered excessively, you might not be happy with the service. It's not bad service, it's just casual. Many yelpers act a bit pretentious, even when they're out of their element. Afterall, it's easy to get behind a computer and pretend to be an expert.\n\nLet me clarify, as a new member of yelp: I am a casual person and do not claim to be a connoisseur in any department of life. If I'm going out to eat I consider it to be a luxury and I'm very easy to please. Many yelpers will take a star off because they live far away from their destination, or for something trivial like being stuck in traffic on the way. Many complain of children and take a star off, etc. These situations are out of the business' hands completely! I try to remove these circumstances from a business which I am rating because it's out of their hands. \n\nMy favorite place for Pad Thai in Cleveland, hands down!
