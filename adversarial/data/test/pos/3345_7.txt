This is the most horrible place to get ice cream. I walk in with my little daughter and she is so excited to get ice cream so I order two meals and some ice cream. I pull out a $50 dollar bill and they say they can except it. Mind you my order is $18 dollars so I have  the cashier Victor contact his General Manager because in Nevada it's illegal for businesses to not accept American currency. Also illegal for franchises to have a policy to deny service from accepting legal tender. The General Manager \"Josh Bollakner\" said he can't do anything for me, was very defensive on the phone with me and told me that it's not the franchise or the owners policy but his own policy that he made up himself and it was because he received fake bills in the past. I responded by stating that it's his responsibility as a General Manager to provide his employee's with the proper black currency marker or bill reader in the State of Nevada if he wants to confirm that the currency the business is accepting is real. Too top it off the cashier's attitude just sucked ass and he had a huge Tip jar soliciting for tips and just lacked any type of customer service or training. In my honest opinion the owner's should select better professional individuals who knows how to run their establishment correctly in Nevada, so the people, customers and community that wants to spend money for ice cream can do so in our community and enjoy it so we return.  I'll never give this place my hard earn money and suggest no one else does. Save your children the rude atmosphere and hit up different ice cream shop.
