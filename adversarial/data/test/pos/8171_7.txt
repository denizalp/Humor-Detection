I'm actually angry at myself for stepping back into a Tuckers Marketplace.  I remember frequenting Tuckers on a few occasions as a cash strapped student during my days in Ottawa, and I can state with certainty that nothing has changed and this is unfortunate for both my finances and the quality of Tuckers. \n\nI always perk up a bit when the prospect of an all-you-can -eat buffet looms on the foreseeable horizon.  There's an extra bounce in my step, and pre-buffet endorphins propel me through the mundane existence that has come to be my life.  I even have a buffet day ritual that I haven't deviated from since about the age of sixteen when I first discovered the Mandarin and later Frankie Tomatoes, but these veritable giants of the buffet world deserve mention later.  Yet I will briefly touch on my buffet day ritual here, because I think everyone should have one and I do hold considerable experience in relation to such matters so here goes.\n\nI start the day with a yogurt smoothie, followed by fruit, usually a banana and an apple for lunch, and maybe a few nutri-grain bars (for best results use strawberry), this modest caloric intake is supplemented with copious amounts of water and quite possibly a bagel with peanut butter before the big event.  However I refrain from drinking water about two hours before game time so that I can ingest my buffet bounty with reckless abandon.  \n\nNow on to Tuckers.  The buffet is definitely second rate, but still packs a first rate buffet wallop to the wallet.  The pizza was cold and chalk like, stations weren't replenished with any regularity and the selection just wasn't up to par.  Where's the shrimp???  The food was also eerily reminiscent of what one would find in any high school cafeteria.  I almost had flash backs to our old lunch lady slopping barely edible paste upon my plate-thanks for the trip down memory lane Tuckers.\n\nI like to end with something positive, so I will commend the service.  Our server was incredibly attentive for a buffet server, she offered drinks when needed, cleared plates with almost telepathic ability and was pleasant to boot.  Tuckers also offers a free meal to anyone and everyone on their day of birth ID required.  I think this may now account for the bulk of their business as those with birthdays inevitably have friends and somehow coax and cajole said friends into accompanying them to Tuckers for what some may consider a birthright.
