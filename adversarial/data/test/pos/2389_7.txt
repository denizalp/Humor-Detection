This is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. \n\nI bought a Groupon for $78 and thought I was getting a fabulous deal! The photo looked like maybe they cleaned the place up a bit and the extras were cool ($20 slot play, 2 free welcome drinks, 2 tickets to the comedy show) so I bought it. \n\nI got into town on Sunday at 4pm and was originally given a room at the North Tower. Ummm...Wet spot on the carpet (I didn't know if it was a blood stain, piss or just a spill or maybe a pitcher of beer), pubic hair plastered on the back of the bathroom door and the stench. WOW! For it not being a non-smokers room, it sure the hell smelled like a dingy old bar!! When I attempted to take a shower, the shower water didn't go down. Basically I was up to my ankles in Vegas sweat and the black sediment starting coming up from the drain. \n\nI complained and was told that they would give me a new room. Downstairs I go at 1am to collect a new key. I was then told I would be staying in a totally different tower. OK - Here I go....\n\n15-minutes into my stay in my 2nd room I spot something crawling up the wall. Ummm...yeah, a baby cockroach. I killed it and called the front desk. After a 7-minute hold time I decided to walk myself, my daughter and the dead bug down to speak with management one-on-one. I showed the kid behind the counter my findings and I said \"If there's one, there's more\". His response \"not necessarily\". WHAT? Are you kidding me?! I was then directed to the manager where I told her the problem and she gave me a different room. No apology, no comped drink (s), no breakfast...Nothing. Come on now, at least an apology!! So we were given another room where we slept uneasy. I checked out as early as I could the next day. I couldn't wait to get the hell out of there. \n\nI will never go back to that dump again. I'd rather sleep in my car.
