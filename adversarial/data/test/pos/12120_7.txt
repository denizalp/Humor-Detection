Yeah, Ruth's is good if you're a man. A manly man who has no time for any fru apricot-pineapple hair treatments. I don't want a fruit salad in my hair.\n\nThe three women who work there are all personable, efficient and they know their stuff. And they'll let you know that they know it. They remember their customers and it's laid back. My girl is Sheila and she don't take no shit. Great personality and knows her Boston sports.\n\nIT'S NOT CORPORATE.Thank God for that. Some days I think about printing up some tee shirts that read \"Keep Charlotte Corporate.\" So not only do I get my hair did, but I get to support a local business. Win-win.\n\nI saw some reviews grousing about how the haircut is now $12. Really? That's still less than SuperCuts, where you have a different person every time cutting your hair differently every time. It's a surprise! Or the other place, Great Clips. Last time I went there, a transvestite cut my hair. Call me old fashioned and small minded, but that ain't my bag. \n\nOverall, for quality, price, experience & service, I haven't found a hair cuttery that can top Ruth's.
