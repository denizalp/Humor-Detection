This is a midsize Smith's,nevertheless, it holds its own. What makes this store unique is that they carry a small treasure of unique and hard to find items. For instance, they carry tropical fruits such as dragon fruit. They carry Sapporo Japanese beer which is one of the best beers in the world. It goes exquisitely well with Seafood and believe it or not, with fruit tarts. \n\nThey have a good selection of steaks for that amazing \"meal for the boss\" dinners of old. They carry the hard to find Haggen-Dazs ice creams like their heavenly RUM RAISIN. The spice selection here is comparable to high end grocery stores. \n\nThe customer service here is like all Smith's, top notch and they know their store and love to assist. The staff here is like the staff at Barnes & Noble, they know where everything is and will take you there. \n\nMy only complaint is that I wish my go to store stocked rum raisin ice cream and Sapporo beer. But, its only 1 mile farther so I should just be quiet and happy to live near a Smith's.
