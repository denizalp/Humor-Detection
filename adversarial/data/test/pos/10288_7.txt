On 8-11-13, despite some of the negative reviews that I read, my wife and I went to Landry's for dinner.  Upon entering the restaurant, we were immediately met by the hostess, who promptly seated us, and that's where the good customer service ended.  I normally try to find something good to say about a restaurant when I right a review, but I HONESTLY say that Landry's was by far the WORST restaurant experience we've ever had!!!!!  Where to start: The server, who did not introduce himself, initially appeared to be a pleasant person, but as time went on, our initial perception was proven to be wrong.  He took our drink and appetizer order, and after a brief while he returned with our drinks.  While pouring my wife's drink, he spilled some of it on her; however, my wife didn't make a big deal out of it.  I specifically told him that I wanted a margarita on the rocks with salt around the rim of the glass.  He returned with a blended margarita with no salt.  Of course, I immediately sent it back.  Due to the fact that my wife's drink was horrible, she also sent hers back.  At this point, the negative attitude began to show.  Although he attempted to be cordial with me, it was obvious that he had an ATTITUDE with my wife.  We didn't feel appreciated at all.  Now, to make matters worse, if we had to rate the food, it would barely get a \"C.\"  The overall experience at Landry's was a \"D-.\"  The only reason we're not giving it an \"F\" is because we were seated promptly.  Quite frankly, we will never go back to this restaurant.  Overpriced, horrible service and sub-standard food.  STAY AWAY!!!!!!!
