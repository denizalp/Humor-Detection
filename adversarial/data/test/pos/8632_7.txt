We have ordered a few large trays of sushi from here and have never been disappointed.  \n\nThe sushi is fresh yet affordable..on average you can get a tray of 42 pc for $24. \n\nThe restaurant is small with some tables. I think the focus of this place is takeout. \n\nNext time we are going to try some more interesting sushi from the menu
