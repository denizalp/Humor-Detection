I have to start by saying in my entire life of going out and experiencing restaurants all over the country and the world, I have never ever been so disrespected and mistreated as I have been here. Yesterday was my 30th birthday, a day I feared and looked forward to for a very long time and after having an amazing weekend in Scottsdale eating at amazing restaurants such as Cafe Monarch, Citizen Public house and Steak 44 I had decided to leave the Mission to celebrate my actual bday dinner. I had made reservations maybe 2 months ago for a dinner with my family including two toddlers for a 5:30 NON rush hour spot specifically asking for a nice table because I would be celebrating such a big bday. The day came and they had confirmed my reservation and I had nicely asked for a table outside since it's a little nicer to be with my family as their inside is so dark and the music is blasting and the guy on the phone told me no problem we will get you a nice table outside. \n\nWe arrived on time, yep right on the dot and the restaurant was almost empty on the inside and half empty outside so I thought there would be no problem in accommodating my one request to sit outside. Their hostess was cold, no smile, attitude as large as camelback mountain, she just said sorry NO, just sit inside. She basically wanted to put us in a dark area of the restaurant where there was no people. I asked for a manager because I could not believe this kind of service I was getting at this point and I regret because what followed was just disgusting and inhumane. \n\nThis manager on duty on November 6th is a ruthless, pathetic lack of a person. He didn't care that it was my bday, he probably has something against toddlers (even though mine behave very well) and also, not sure where he is from, but we all had the feeling he has something against women since he spoke to me in a demeaning and very condescending way. I think the owners of this establishment should be ashamed in hiring someone who knows nothing about customer service and customer appreciation. I explained my situation and he said first \"sorry, nothing I can do you can go to another restaurant of ours and sit outside there.\" I explained to him that I have children and it's hard to carry them around town from one restaurant to the next. He just didn't care. I also told him that out of all the restaurants in Scottsdale I chose this one to celebrate my day, again he didn't care. I even promised if he sat us outside (which again was half empty) we would be out by 7pm to accommodate \"all this future reservations.\" Nope, he said can't do anything but to sit you inside. I found a round table inside and couldn't believe how rude he has been these past 20 minutes which we could have already started eating outside but I honestly didn't have the energy to argue anymore. So as we almost sat down he said in a sarcastic tone \"I'm glad I was able to help you.\" \n\nI thought to myself wow, you have got to be kidding me, he has done nothing but mistreat my parents in their 60s by having them stand with two toddlers while I tried to get us a table I made more than 2 months ago. I said no, you did not really help us. He said \"if you don't like it, you can get the hell out of here\" wow, I was shocked. I was just about to be defeated and sit inside of this empty restaurant on the inside. A man who was so egotistical who knew it was almost 6pm now on a Sunday evening during high season just basically kicked us out of a restaurant and then told me \"I know nothing about how the restaurant industry works.\" He knew I would have a hard time getting a reservation anywhere special last minute but he still kicked us out. This is not Latin America or Europe, this is the damn UNITED STATES where we strive to make customers feel appreciated. \n\nWell let me tell you something to that evil man who has no compassion for anyone but himself. \n\nA. We were lucky enough to get in somewhere very good (LAST MINUTE) a place that respects people of all ages.\n\nB. One thing I truly know about the restaurant business is that number one is customer service which you have NONE OF. People come back based on experiences not just by your food.\n\nC. You will also never succeed anywhere beyond a manager position when act like a chauvinistic piece of ***t. Pardon my language Yelp. But being from Chicago and knowing many successful restaurant owners, there is no way anyone would promote or work with someone who treats people the way you do. \n\nI would obviously never come back here just from my experiences of talking to two people here. It was something I wish I never experienced in my 30 years and hopefully never will again. In hindsight I should feel sorry for people who can be so rude to you for no apparent reason, must have some personal problems and he has to take it out on the rest of the world.
