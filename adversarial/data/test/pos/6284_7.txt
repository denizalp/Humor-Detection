Prices are great for quick chinese food.  If you're used to Panda...go to Panda.  Here, you've got a real chinese man cooking in the back not a Mexican.  It's not fancy...but I don't need fancy when I just want Chinese food.  Fortunately, I know how to select good food choices and not have to opt for ordering teriyaki chicken in a Chinese joint.  4 stars for cheap prices, quick food, generous portions and tasty enough to satisfy my hunger...after a long day.
