I'm a hoarder....let me put that another way, I'm an over indulgent DINK, who takes her pets and their needs, wants and perceived desires very seriously. (Stick with me, the crazy train hasn't derailed yet, these vets are awesome) So, when I first went to Pecan Grove, I was wanting a fancy lobby and exam room and well, it doesn't exist.  I thought my one eyed cat and the rest of the crew that have been rescued over the years from the e-list would need granite counters, hydraulic exam tables and flavored waters, turns out we don't.  I am giving them the best when I take them to Pecan Grove.. \n\nNo fancy lobby or exam room, instead, Pecan Grove is a nice hospital who doesn't cater to my crazy side but does an excellent job of meeting the medical needs of my pets while also keeping my wallet in check even if I'm willing to empty it all over their lobby in an effort to give my \"babies\" everything they need....yes, I will look into a therapist after I finish this review... \n\nDr. Edwards is who I typically see and she is extremely knowledgeable. I have had the usual host of kitty colds, dog ear infections, kitty ear mites and the like and the much more life threatening and unfortunately life ending experiences with her and she has gotten me through all of them with a great deal of finesse and I've always felt my pets were in the best hands possible.\n\n They have gotten me specialists when necessary and have delivered the news that even the best medicine would not cure what ails my pet and helped me with those decisions as well. Truly, some of the best vet care I could ask for. I'll keep going back.
