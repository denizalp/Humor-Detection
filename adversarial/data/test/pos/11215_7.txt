Yes and no.  There are some things I like about Patois and others that sort of turned me off.  \n\nThe place is rather busy, kind of noisy and crowded.  Normally that's a good thing because people won't necessarily congregate in places where the food, ambiance, service and overall vibe doesn't do it for them.  It's understandable why Patois is busy and I think it's because for most it's an enjoyable place and I have to agree with that.  I've seen line ups for this place on some evenings.  It seems pretty popular for a place that's only been open about a year and a half.\n\nThe things that put me off were still there though and as I do, I will honestly say what they were.\n\nMy first issue is how the chicken was served.  I had ordered a \"full order\" of OG fried chicken while my friend ordered a full order of Juicy Jerk.  Now while I see the words full and half in the same line I'm thinking well, full chicken?  Half chicken?  There is no real description of how much chicken you are in fact getting when you choose to order.  As opposed to say Kanpai Snack Bar, the chicken is explained in 3, 8 or 12 pieces.  For the most part you know generally how much 3 or 8 pieces of chicken will be, size wise because you want to order accordingly for yourself and others right?\n\nMy full order of fried chicken was in fact 5 pieces.  I had held off starting because I wanted to ask the server if this was in fact the full order or half.  She replied it was the full.  I had asked what exactly is a half order then and she said it's a quarter chicken.  So why the ambiguity?  Why not on the menu call a full order a half chicken and a half order a quarter?  That or be clearer on how many of pieces there are per order?  \n\nThis is where it becomes convoluted.  What I received from Patois for full order was 2 drums, 2 thighs and ONE unsplit wing (5 pieces).  Now if a half order is supposed to be a \"quarter chicken\" how to you cut 5 pieces of a \"full order\" in half for the half order?  Also is a quarter chicken actually an actual quartered chicken?  Quartered being a quarter of dark or white meat?  This full order I received had no breast... you know the largest piece with the most meat on it...???\n\nMy friend's full order of Juicy Jerk that we shared (we shared each of our chicken orders)... we were wondering where the breast was and we found it here instead.  It was one drum, thigh and basically the rest was breast and the amount of meat overall was visually double in mass to the fried chicken.  The Juicy Jerk IMO was much better overall, taste, quantity, all around goodness.  While the fried chicken was OK it IMO it wasn't worth it.  5 pieces for 19 is the same price as the Jerk.  8 pieces at Kanpai is 25 dollars.  That's about 4 dollars vs 3 dollars per piece.  I can't finish 8 pieces at Kanpai but full orders split (half jerk\/half fried shared between 2 people) I was still hungry.  \n\nI arrived earlier than the rest of the table and I had a Mad Tom's IPA and it was served in a sifter.  It clearly stated 16oz on the menu.  The drink I received was visually almost HALF head (see photo).  That pour was poor to say the least.  I didn't say anything but I should have.  I ended up ordering another when we moved to the table and the next one was fine or better as it seemed to be about 80% full and 20% head.  Obviously there is a consistency issue there.  \n\nOverall the food was good.  The Juicy Jerk alone is probably their feature item.  I could see this being the star of the menu, that or that pineapple bun burger which looks great.  The fried chicken while good didn't overwhelm and seemed pricey for what we were served compared to many other places in the city Kanpai being just one.  The serving size of the chickens (both) I find misleading and out of 5 pieces of chicken for something called a full order the count was 4 dark pieces to 1 white piece (the smallest white piece) for the fried chicken.  \n\nThe service seemed friendly and the place is crowded so it can get loud.  I was in good company at this establishment and the table basically ordered many different things so I was able to see much of the menu.  The burger looked really good and the Jerk was very good.  The OG fried chicken again, better value elsewhere and nothing that special about it.\n\nThat being said I would come back but only for the Jerk and I'd like to try their burger.  If I order beer I'll be sure to keep an eye on the pour and say something if I have to.  \n\nTo me there's little things that shouldn't be forgotten.  Expectations for amount of food (worded ambiguously or deceivingly) or pouring half a beer and serving it to me will make me not so happy.  Not so happy me turns into a 2* \"I've had better\" review.
