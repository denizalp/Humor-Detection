This place is the BOMB!!!! First time eating at the one in Cali and I'm so excited we have one in Vegas. Customer service is off the hook, they care about their food.\nFreshness is something they pride themselves in and you can taste it in the food. \nQuality will get you forever customers.\nI work at revolt tattoos across the parking lots so it looks like this is gonna be our new eatery. \nThanks to everyone for a fantastic experience. \nEverything is great, u can't go wrong.
