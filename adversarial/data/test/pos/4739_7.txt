It appears that there's not too many breakfast joints that open up early close to us, so we ventured to North York for some early morning grub.\n\nHazel's is a typical diner with old, dated mismatched furniture with a friendly and efficient hostess\/waitress that keeps your coffee cup constantly topped off (diner quality drip coffee). \n\nHere's where it breaks the mold: a bold and creative menu that pairs different flavors that you wouldn't expect. THE BEST example was my Eggs Natasha with poached eggs, smoked salmon, on top of pancakes, covered in hollandaise, a dollop of sour cream and topped with a little bit of caviar. Oh my! I ordered this because the description peaked my interest. I was surprised and delighted that the flavors complimented each other so well: salty, sweet and savoury. I thoroughly enjoyed the pancake underneath that was light, fluffy and delicious. It came with a side of home fries that tasted decent but were too soft and missing the crispy edges that I like.\n\nHubby ordered the Hazel Hash: 3 eggs, potato, corn, ground chourico, onions, (bell) peppers, jalape√±o served with a side of buttered Texas toast. It was alright, not very spicy at all with a pool of orange grease at the bottom of the plate.\n\nThey do need to clean up a bit with it's coffee stained menus and a few fruit flies buzzing about. Whoever renovated the wash rooms (looks newer) needs to redecorate the main dining area with some modern furnishings and splashes of color. \n\nWould come back if I'm up for an early breakfast.
