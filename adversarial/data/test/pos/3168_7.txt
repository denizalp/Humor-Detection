GENERAL INFO\nReggie's is a 24 hour sandwich shop. Need you know more? Ok, they make great, homemade sandwiches and apparently have the best carrot cake in the city on certain nights. Now wait until 4am and go!\n\nMENU RECOMMENDATIONS\nI've only been twice so my knowledge of their sandwiches is limited but I've tasted a few great ones...\nChicken Parm - huge piece of real chicken in homemade bread crumbs, deep fried and served on a large, soft bun. Good stuff. \nTuna Melt - the economical choice. Tasty tuna mixed with melted cheese and served on toast.\nFries - good stuff. \nCarrot Cake - apparently the carrot cake is made by someone different every night but most nights it's considered to be amoungst Toronto's finest. The kind of cake that can turn a good woman onto a bad man.\n\nLOCATION NOTES\nSouth side of King just East of Portland, right beside Craft Burger. \n\nSERVICE NOTES\nIt's not the world's fastest sandwich but it's not as long a wait as California Sandwiches. If you're in a rush call it in, I've found the staff to be very accomodating.\n\nHUMOUROUS STORY\nOur first trip to Reggie's was the stuff of legends (Cailen's already told this story but I surely tell it better). At about 2am we decided to get some food and Kat suggested Reggie's. However, after arriving, we found the street had been cordoned off by the police. This looked like the end of the line...but we wanted those sandwiches! So I called and got them to agree to bring them down the street to us. As we waited, we found ourselves in the back alley for \"some reason\" and figured one of the back doors led to Reggie's. So I called again and it turned out the door we were standing in front of was Reggie's. The cook led us through the cramped back area (I felt like we were in Swingers) into into the restaurant where we enjoyed our sandwiches while enjoying the great police show out front. Go us!
