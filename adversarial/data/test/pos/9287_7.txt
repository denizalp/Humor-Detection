I was staying at the Palms for a quick weekend trip. The weather was beautiful so I wanted to do some work from the pool. They wouldn't allow me to bring my backpack in with my laptop and notebook, I had to check it in or take it back up to my room. They also wanted me to check my vape even though it was an outdoor pool. And when I got to the chairs there were ashtrays. So it was ok to smoke but I couldn't vape. \n\nThen we ordered breakfast but you can't order ice water with your food, you have to order their overpriced bottled water. And to top it all off they didn't have any coffee or espresso so I went to the coffee shop in the palms to grab some and bring it in. And you guessed it.... they wouldn't let me bring it in. \n\nReal fun. Wish I would have stayed somewhere else.
