The. Bees. Knees. This place really knows their Yelpers. Not trying to be creepy, but if you've ever left a review, they know you by name. \n\nI told them about the \"traumatizing\" experience I had at a place close to home last time, which is why I came to them. Reviews from Yelpers I trust (thanks Stephanie S., Cathy C. and April D.) led me here. I was even more excited when I saw that Stephanie S. was the duchess here. It brought more piece of mind, and I certainly wasn't disappointed. \n\nI'm not particularly picky about my eyebrows, but the last girl that did them made them bleed and they were swollen for days. Guys made fun of my eyebrows. GUYS! I wasn't sure that I was ever going to do it again, but SO happy with my brows now; they've got a cute little arch that I never asked for before but looks fabulous. I especially liked that the threader had me lay back down after a close inspection, it made me feel like she really cared that they looked perfect, even if I didn't.\n\nThe only thing that would make this place any better is a stamp card. Just sayin'..
