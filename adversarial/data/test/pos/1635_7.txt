I needed a weekly pool maintenance service for my rental property in Scottsdale. I searched and found Pool Daddy so I decided to give them a shot since my landlord didn't know anyone and they were paying for it anyway. I haven't interacted with them too much, I just know that my pool is always clean and blue, and they always let me know to add more water so that my pump works properly (I have an older pool that doesn't automatically fill itself up). \n\nI haven't had any problems with my pool in over a year since I started using Pool Daddy's services. I pay them on time, and they come out every week on time (usually before I wake up for work) but I just leave the gate open when I know they are coming and they never disrupt my sleep or anything. \n\nNo issues yet, and I don't foresee any in the future. I've already referred a few of my south Scottsdale neighbors to George after their pool guys left them \"high and dry\" (pun intended). These guys know their stuff, highly recommended local business!
