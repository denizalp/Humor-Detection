I decided to finally check out The Blind  Pig with co-workers on our lunch break since we wanted to take a breather from our EDR. I ordered the BP Burger medium rare, and this first visit was perfect-medium rare like I ordered, everything served hot and fresh, totally excited to come back with the Wifey, so that's what I planned.\n\nWe came back the following weekend, and its literally night and day here, no joke. Dinner service here is a bit unorganized. First, there is no hostess stand, so we waited...and waited...until one of the workers came from behind the counter and told us to wait (yet again) until a spot opens up.\n\nWe were lucky enough to get a comfy booth, and we took advantage of the Yelp check in offer of a free cocktail. I got the Blind Pig and don't remember the name of Wifey's drink, but it had Proseco in it. both were okay. We decide on the Poutine as a starter and split the Blind Pig Burger. Our waitress seemed overwhelmed at the amount of tables she had for her station, and actually the floor manager ended up taking and delivering our drink orders.\n\nPoutine was kinda skimpy on the cheese curds, and the blind Pig Burger which I had raved about wasn't as good as when I had it during my lunch visit, a little more medium than medium rare. I guess when the kitchen gets slammed at dinner time, food doesn't really come out as it should? I probably would just return for lunch where there's no crowds and you can probably enjoy your order much better. Oh, and our waitress never got out of her funk...she was either frazzled throughout the night, or just didn't feel like being there...ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  3
