I bought my new 2011 wrx from this dealership a couple years ago and I've had no complaints about this dealership.  The move to the new location has made it much more convenient to get into, much bigger, and more parking space.  If anyone has been to the old dealership u know parking was a Lil tuff... But that's no problem at the  new location.  There is also an indoor service parking which is great when brining ur car in for service. So if your looking to buy a subaru let them know that TooTuff sent you!  \n\nSo congrats Willowdale Subaru you are TooTuff approved!!!!
