You need a quick makeover? Get your eyebrows threaded for $10. I read it in a magazine once that if you want a quick fixer upper to your face, get your eyebrows done so that's what I did... \n\nThe sweet female spent her time making sure my eyebrows were exactly what I wanted. I had no arch before because I'm lazy as hell and let them grow free and bushy (I'm a new mom- that's my excuse). She gave me beautiful arches that made my face looking fresh.
