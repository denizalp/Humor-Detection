Poor excuse for Asian food. Noodles are bland and just drenched in sauce. The sauce is too sweet and the tastes in it dont compliment each other but in fact make a tangy blend. Only dish I that didn't turn out horrible is the pho noodles and teriyaki chicken with rice instead of noodles. Rice at least helps make the sauce more mild. The curry is horrible. Its not even a good attempt. It was just a poor stir fry. They took veggies and threw some sauce on it and that was it.Bought a groupon here. Made sure to refund it right away. Not worth it even at 50% off. Overpriced disgusting poor attempt at asian food. No thank you.
