I have been meaning to write a review for this place. Good to Great!! Really good recipe they use for the waffles. I do not know what it is, but it is very tasty!\nThe toppings are great, A lot of different choices. I loved the Chocolate with fresh Fruit. Fro Yo on the side!\nit is nice and clean in here as well. Lots of parking in the lot. A nice new clean looking shopping center. When it is warm ,which  I will say is now and here to stay. You can sit outside and enjoy your snack. Although it is so filling it is like a meal. But, a sweet one.
