Tried to check this place out.  My bad, showed up at 3:30 and they dont open until 4.  All good - strange thing, dude in brewery t-shirt out front sweeping up the place (not a kitchen worker - seemed like an owner or manager) just looked at us.  Did not even say hello or , \"thanks for stopping come back at 4.\". Didn't really seem to give a sh** about our business or NO business.  So 4 Peaks welcomed up with smiles and thanks for our hard earned $'s.  save your time, attitude seems to go in line with many of the other reviews. Just because you can craft a beer does not mean you have the talent , personality or professionalism to open an establishment for patrons!  Go to Phoenix Brewing anda say hi to Fretzy and the team or  faithful standby 4 Peaks or the many other good brewers and restaurant owners that DO appreciate you.
