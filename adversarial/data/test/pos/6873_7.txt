This is one of the worst haunted houses, I have ever been to.I was highly disappointed, because it got sooooooooo much hype as being scary. The only scary thing about this place was the price you had to pay to get in.\nMy complaints:\n1. The VIP pass is a rip off.....you still had to wait to get in. They need to control the amount of sales to make it worth it and they don't.\n2. all their commericals on the radio talk about this scary \"Jacob Kell\" they do not tie him into the theme or if they do, it's poorly done.\n3. I walked around in this pitch black rooms that were super hot. There was like 3 actors and none of them were scary, 2 of them didn't even do anything.\n4. you had to pay extra to park.\n5. IT was NOT scary at ALL!!!! I got semi-spooked twice.\n\nOne positive note, they do have a kewl 3D skull room.\n\nGood morning America rated this place one of the scariest haunts in America........they must not have been to very many.\n\nThe Nest gets 2 devil horns down from this zombie!!!
