I've been taking my nephews to the movies here for the last ten years and we love the place. One of the side benefits has been watching the Desert Ridge development grow over the years. The location is perfect, right off the loop 101, which means easy access from any point in The Valley. There is spacious parking and plenty of places to dine, including one of my local favorites, The Keg, among others. With the addition of City North to the east we now have an added night club option in The Blue Martini. Now back to the theatre of dreams. One of the reasons that I like AMC is that, in general, the quality of the theatres is even throughout the country. This location, however, seems to have the best popcorn. As noted in other reviews and being that this is a nightspot for teenagers there is the drawback of frequent texts and cellphone conversations throughout the viewing. However, as noted by our Yelp friend Roland, this is not the theatres fault. The problem with this inconvenience is that a lot of people request that the management make more patrols without realizing that this also interferes with the viewing experience and causes more complaints. It is difficult to strike a balance with appropriate levels of surveillance and uninterrupted viewing. The audio and picture has been impeccable since opening day and this continues to be the case and in the rare occasion of an audio or visual problem, the theatre always steps up to the plate and compensates for the inconvenience, which is after all traditional AMC policy. Now since my nephew has become an AMC employee it is even better because now we get to see the movies for free.
