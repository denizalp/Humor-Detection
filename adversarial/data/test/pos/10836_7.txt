To Ethan, if that is your real name, I have no affiliation with pork on a fork. They are the best BBQ in Phoenix, not just in my opinion but many others as well. The reason I only have one review is because I never used yelp in the past and your food sucked enough for me to take the time to creat an account to post about how terrible of an experience I had in your establishment. Thanks for trying to save face on this one but this is a 100 percent legitimate response by someone who had a terrible experience when coming here. In addition, if you scroll through the reviews a lady posted a picture in her review and my family and I just happen to be in the background. I have uploaded a profile picture on here as well so you can see the legitimacy of both of these posts and how you are making yourself look like more of an idiot. This place is going to be the next ABC (Amy's baking company, google it if you don't remember them...). From the reviews and interactions you are headed down that same road and will be closed in the next 6 months. Good luck to you.
