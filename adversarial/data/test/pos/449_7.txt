We have been to their other location and had a good experience, so we were glad to find out there was a location near us.  \n\nWe ordered a medium half White Special and half Cugino's Special, paid and sat down.  Then another worker comes out to tell us they can't make a half white and half red sauce pizza.  When I asked why... she shrugged her shoulders and pointed to the man at the pizza oven.  So I went over for an explanation and he said because the sauce would run unto the white side.  I assured him it was fine as neither of us were allergic to sauce we just wanted to try two different styles on one pie. OMG how difficult are we huh.   He made a gesture like okay have your way and continued.  \n\nWe received our pie and the White Special was good with just the right garlic seasoning and chunks of ricotta, while the Cugino's Special which consisted of pre-cooked green bell peppers and pepperoni was not that great but the crust itself was delicious.  We also shared an Antipasto Salad with their house vinaigrette which was delicious and big enough for two. \n\nOverall I've experienced better pizza and service.    Although they closed at 9pm and it was only 8pm the staff was more preoccupied with getting the place closed down than anything else.
