if you want to relax while you get your nails done DO NOT go here. its anything but paradise. 1st of all they were advertising a full set for 20 dollars, but they don't tell you what kind. i ended up spending 50 dollars on mine. 2nd its just like any other nail salon in vegas, they're all speaking there language among each other which is SUPER ANNOYING and SUPER RUDE!!! 3rd there was a bridal party or something in there singing karaoke. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!!! spare your self the agony and go  somewhere else.\n\non a positive note... the guy that did my nails did do a very nice job. but still wont be returning.
