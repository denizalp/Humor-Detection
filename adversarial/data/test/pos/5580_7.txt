No thanks to standing uncomfortably in heels all day in the hot sun or in a murky pool buttcheek-to-buttcheek with other sweaty, drunk peeps...I think the murkiness was definitely caused by some drunken urination. :P\n\nYes, I'm going to be very blunt and say I didn't really enjoy my time that much at Wet Republic. It's probably because I'm such a grandma and would rather be eating at a buffet, napping or playing the penny slots at the time we showed up here.\n\nWith all that said, I still had a good time with my hot girlfriends and meeting some fun new peeps at one of the VIP cabanas.\n\nThumbs up to chicken strips and french fries, surprisingly very delicious!\n\nDouble thumbs up to VIP tables in the shade near the DJ booth!\n\nP.S. Staff that works here are all super friendly and pretty much wanna party with you. \n\nRecap of that weekend on my YouTube channel: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OFd8kfiZIJY&list=UU5YaBtOxOYqeFEEQ_aW6JiA
