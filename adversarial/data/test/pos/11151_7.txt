This place is a joke. I made an appointment to have my car in for its very first service since purchasing it AT Centennial Toyota. When I arrived for my appointment I was told that they were too busy to help me and that I needed to come back another day and offered to schedule an appointment for 2 days later. This was unacceptable as I have to work on this day and could only be in on the day for which I scheduled my original appointment (isn't that the point of making an appointment in advance?) Completely unreliable and unacceptable service it makes me question my overall choice of choosing Centenntial Toyota and will definitely not buy from here again. Thanks for wasting my time. I am taking my car elsewhere to get serviced.
