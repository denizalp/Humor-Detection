Ordered the General Tao Tofu... I thought perhaps someone had chopped up a bath sponge and served it too me; , the tofu was boiled (and boiled, and boiled) so it came out full of water; terrible tasting water which diluted the sauce and made it inedible.\n\nOur group had three tofu dishes and they were all equally bad.\n\nThey did remove the dish from our bill though.\n\nTwo stars based on service alone.
