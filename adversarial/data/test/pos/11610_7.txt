Came in after a Captains game around 5pm to get a victory donut.  We got 4 donuts total: 2 chocolate covered cruellers,  a triple chocolate,  and a chocolate covered raised donut with sprinkles.  Everything except the sprinkle donut tasted stale.  Really stale like it was a day old.  \n\nWe just ate them in silence and mourned the loss of the greatest donut maker and place in the world.
