Stopped by on a whim after a night out. Had a couple of beers at the bar where we were also able to eat. Shared a cubano sandwich and fries. Wow wow wow. That sandwich had so much flavor and juice just bursting in our mouths. It was like a food extravaganza on my tongue. I'm happy to have such a place and can't wait to get back and try other options.
