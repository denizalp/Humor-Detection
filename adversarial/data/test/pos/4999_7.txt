Our first time staying at Cosmopolitan.\n\nPros:\n- We stayed in a Fountain View Room, and it was worth it.  The view of Bellagio fountain show and the strip was probably the best view we've had at a Vegas hotel.\n- Great location.  It's central, and it's not too hard to walk around the strip if you'd like.\n- Great restaurants.  We had E by Jose Andres, Eggslut, Holsteins, and the fact that Momofuku is opening in 2016?  Awesome!  When it's 110 degrees outside, it's super nice to not have to set your foot outside.\n- Their rewards program called Identity, which saved us some money when we were checking out. \n- Hotel is part of Marriott collection if you participate in Marriott rewards.\n\nCons:\n- Our room had some issues with cleanliness and drainage (shower).  To be honest, I should've called the front desk, but we ended up just leaving a note for the maid.  It should've never happened at such a nice hotel in the first place.\n- Decor is definitely interesting.  Kinda weird mix of modern and coziness.  If you're going for modern, go all out.  If you're not, the different patterns on the floor and walls don't look that nice.\n- Check in\/check out took a loooong time.  Not sure how they can fix this, but there were multiple lines and it took forever.\n- Asked for late check out (which I've always been able to get as a Marriott Rewards participant) and got denied.  Nowadays 11am is the check out, I didn't know that.\n\nBecause of the cleanliness issue, I was going to give low rating, but during check out when I addressed this, the lady that was helping me (her name was Sherry) was super helpful and apologetic.  She helped us get the most out of our Identity program, addressed the issues we had, and overall gave me a much better impression of the hotel than what I was leaving with.  I wanted to give her a shout out since she made our experience so much better at the end.  Thank you Sherry!\n\ntip:  I prefer the East tower since it's close to Eggslut, Holsteins, Secret Pizza, Jaleo, STK.  West tower has closer lobby and Wicked Spoon.\ntip:  There are 3 pools altogether.  One is Marquee day club, one is in West tower and one is in East tower.  \n\nKeep in mind resort fee of about $30\/day.  Wifi is included in the resort fee.  Free parking for either valet or self park.
