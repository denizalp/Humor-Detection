Such a great find! Friendly and informative staff. Fairly small establishment, but worth the wait. Great selection of local beers as well as some not so local but still great! I love the flights of beer so you can try several at once. Their cheese and fruit platter is amazing as well. Great place to meet friends in the evening or weekend afternoon. \n\nI have also been told they have a nice selection of coffee. Because I despise coffee, I have to take their word for it.
