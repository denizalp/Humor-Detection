What do you when you have a less than stellar experience at the seafood buffet downstairs? Go objectify some men to make yourself feel better, that's what! I kid, I kid. Sort of.\n\nFirst off, Kenny was working in the shop that night. Super cool guy. Sold us our tickets, and thanks to him we got some primo seats.\n\nNow let me write I love myself some men. Oh yeah I do. And let's face it, these guys have these great smiles and sculpted bodies and well, although half of them are probably gay (hey, that's not a bad thing) and they don't get fully nude, little is left to the imagination if you know what I mean. I do love the male form. All of the male form...and still my partner in crime and I could.not.stop.laughing.\n\nThis is all in fun. I get that. Maybe I should've been drunk, but I had to be up at 5am the next day. Watching the women in the audience go NUTS over these guys was almost more entertaining than watching the guys themselves.\n\nThe choreography, when they attempted to dance in unison, was definitely a bit lackluster, but then again I was probably the only person paying attention to how out of sync they were with each other.\n\nOnce the clothes came off, yeah. WOW. I almost felt guilty looking at these men like meat. Their asses, well you could bounce coins off them. I'm not a big ass girl, and well...I think I may have been converted.\n\nHighlight of the night was the woman doing the splits on stage bouncing up and down. TOTALLY unexpected and got the crowd roaring. \n\nDefinitely some good fantasy material there, and the let's say that I won't be looking at a motorcycle the same way for awhile. \n\nSomething everyone should do at least once.
