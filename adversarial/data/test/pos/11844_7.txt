Park MGM Las Vegas...hmmm.. Where to start?..  Well let me just say that prior to this hotel being remodeled, I was a fan of the legendary Monte Carlo! Was this place due for a facelift? Absolutely! However I really wish they would've kept the Monte Carlo name... \n\nThe whole concept around the Park MGM Las Vegas I think was good and I can see the type of vibe they were going for and well it's working in some ways.. Giving that Miami south beach boutique hotel feel and all..  When you walk in the lobby don't be alarmed if you see a lack of staff to help you at the check-in process. This property has embraced technology to it's fullest and essentially replaced the front desk people with the self check in kiosk. Note that not all of the people are completely gone, you just don't have the traditional behind the counter type of transaction. Instead, they are planted in the middle of these enormous tablets that are used to check-in. \n\nAs a VIP M Life member I do feel like this new process is way to impersonal... more than is up to my standard. Not trying to come off as a snob or anything but let's be real that whole general population check in versus the upgraded experience as a VIP in like night and day. You get to the machine it ask you to check in, scan your ID, pick your room, assign your own upgrade and yeah you know.. do the job of what the front desk agent would do.. From what I was told, they will be making another VIP lounge but until then it's regular check in for the VIP's as well.. I'm not a fan of lines so I'm not sure I will be back until that whole ordeal is sorted out.. Moving on... \n\nThe hotel rooms are new and I can see where they may have cut some corners on some things but over all I was happy. The view of construction is the best but hey they obviously need to finish the pool. Oh and to that point the construction noises are going to happen no matter what side of the hotel you stay on and no matter the floor. Once they are finished with all of that I can easily see this being a pretty good resort. As long as they keep the rates averaging less than $100 per night (including the resort fee) then yes my friends this place would be worth it. Looking forward to the completed phase!
