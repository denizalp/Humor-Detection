WHAT TO TRY?!\n\nThe crispy fried chicken (the spicy one if you dare try!), the mango peach pies, the spaghetti and the pineapple juice. \n\nThe crispy fried chicken has its own unique texture to it! Not like other fried chicken chains, you can taste that it does taste different. Very crispy, light and fried just right. The only downfall to the fried chicken was the taste. It was on the blander side and you need to dip it in gravy to have some taste to the chicken. The spicy chicken was really just the skin that was spicy. If you remove the skin and just have the chicken meat, it's not spicy at all. \n\nMango peach pies remain a popular item at this place. I tasted more peach than mango but I thought what stood out to me was the pie pastry. It's different from McDonald's, fried crispier and not as doughy. But I didn't think the pie was something that special. It's different from other pies you've tried before, I'm sure though. \n\nExpect the spaghetti to be on the sweeter side. If you think it was sour because of the tomatoes, you're wrong! There's def some sugar added to this spaghetti. Very saucy and cheesy and there's a lot of sausage slices mixed in. Another popular dish with the fans. \n\nLastly, the pineapple juice. I didn't try the juice but people are raving it here. It's a popular drink and if you want to try it, give it a try and let me know what you think. I didn't try it because I thought it wasn't that special given that the juice most likely came from a can anyways. \n\nLAST TIP?!\n\nIf you have a big group, they have combo deals which I think is a better deal than to get all the items separately. You can also upgrade your combo that usually doesn't come with a drink with a pineapple drink for a small amount of money. It's not as busy anymore at the locations, so don't worry about the long lines!
