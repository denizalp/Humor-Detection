Small bites, huge flavor, excellent presentation, succulent carving station, and a wonderful gelato spread. Best buffet I've had period. After going to that other \"hot spot\" in Caesar's and returning here for brunch, it was clear to me Wicked Spoon is in my view one of the top shelf buffets in Vegas.\n\nI love the carving station. Sliced bacon! The fancy kind you can't find at the local grocery. Housemade sausage too. Don't overlook the fresh fruit smoothies too.\n\nThe gelato spread was most impressive. Imagine trying all the flavors in small little bowls to your heart's desire. The combinations are endless. I personally like the peanut butter and jelly.\n\nBest thing was my son to be (under 5) was free! Can't beat a family friendly buffet on the strip!
