Pretty decent Pho place in the chinatown of Montreal.  The food came real quick.  We had a number 7 and 15.   15 is their spicy beef soup and i strongly recommend it.  Spicy food on a hot day actually cools you off.  Raising your temp\/sweating ends up cooling you down when it evaporates.  Unfortunately, like many of the other restaurants in the area, they only accept cash which can be a bit of a bitch when you're from the states and paying atm fee's all the etime.  Our only complaint is that although we ordered the extra large's... for some reason the Vietnamese couple who sat down next to us half way thru our meal got a good bit more in their bowls.  So, be sure to tell them that you are Vietnamese.
