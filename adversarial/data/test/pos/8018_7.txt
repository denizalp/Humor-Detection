This location just recently opened up. I've been by a couple of times now both inside and used the drive thru and have been happy with the service and food I have received. The people working are friendly and on my first visit they didn't even charge me for extra cheese. There's pros and cons to utilizing the drive thru here. Not having to get out of the car is convenient however you can't see the toppings in front of you and sometimes certain veggies don't look so fresh. It's nice they have the option either way and the drive thru is long so it can fit a good amount of cars. There's parking right outside Subway. Inside was clean and they did a good job wiping the prep areas before making each sandwich. All in all a nice addition to the shopping center even though my wife was hoping this was going to be a Starbucks as it was being built lol. There's also In n Out Burger and McD's nearby but it's nice to have an option for a cold or hot sandwich too so I'll be back.
