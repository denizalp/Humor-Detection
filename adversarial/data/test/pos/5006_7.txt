I'm still a fan of Ematei so I'll retain the 4-star rating but on a recent visit, I did not like their:\nkaraage--the pitifully pale, fried coating on the chicken was hard enough to chip a tooth\nzaru soba--the noodles were an overcooked disaster; some chefs would commit seppuku for sending out the dish like that \n\nDifferent but OK:\nagedashi--fried in a thick tempura batter and served with tempura vegetables\n\nStill as delicious as ever:\nthe butter scallops\naspara bacon (bacon wrapped asparagus)\nmiso black cod\nbuta kimchi\nthe spoonfuls of udon I stole from the S.O.
