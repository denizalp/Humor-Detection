I have gone to pretty much all the clubs and bars in Old Town Scottsdale and Firehouse is definitely my favorite place to go when I go out. The reason I like Firehouse is because its a very relaxed environment as well as a fun upbeat atmosphere. You can go casual or done up and there is a wide variety of people. There is a huge patio which is nice during the day and night. I really liked the theme of the entire bar and the creative artsy set up.  The first experience at Firehouse I had a reserved table for my friends birthday party and the tables have couches that were SO comfortable. Our cocktail waitress was fun, prompt and made sure we had our drinks filled to the top! A+ I don't know how much the bottle service was but the drinks I bought from the bar were significantly cheaper than other bars that I have gone to. Other times I was out day drinking and the bar staff was very friendly and seemed to enjoy their work. And believe it or not Firehouse has the best food ever... Especially the Spicy Chicken Pita. I highly recommend it. Everything I have tried I loved but Im addicted to the pita! Firehouse is also open after hours so its a great place to end the night, sober up, meet up with friends and get your late night food! All and all I have had great experiences at Firehouse every time I have gone and its def my favorite crowd and environment.
