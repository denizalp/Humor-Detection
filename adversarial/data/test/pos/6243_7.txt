Dear Prohibition,\n\nPlease stop completely revolutionizing your menu at such feverish intervals. The vitamin D fortified soy milk in my fridge lasts longer than an average entree on the menu here. With every new menu pressing, the list of vegetarian options dwindles and the prices go up (it's not a good look). The current incarnation of the \"aged\" (yeah right) grilled cheese has so little flavour that it belongs on a BRAT diet meal plan (http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/BRAT_diet).\n\nThanks,\nKat F
