I've tried to patronize The Maine Lobster Lady (TMLL) since Foodie Fest in Las Vegas two or three years ago; alas patience is not my virtue, so the 1-2 hour lines kept me from the opportunity. Living in Arizona now, TMLL was on my radar because the truck and crew winter here. \n\nDue to a recent family tragedy, I haven't been much into Yelping, dining out, etc. Scott has done everything but stand on his head to try to cheer me up, when he called today and said \"I think I found your Lobster Lady in the car park at the Sheraton\" I was sure he was mistaken. Lo and behold, he was right! Diana and crew were indeed in the 'Tuk for a women's business expo, and I was in for a treat which made me happy, sated, and a total fangirl. \n\nWe shared the warm (CT style) Lobster Roll overflowing with claw meat, and lots of large pieces of tender lobster dressed only in butter, on a buttery toasted roll. It was worth waiting for! We also shared the Whole Belly Clam Roll, again a large portion, literally overflowing the delicious roll, not a hint of grease in the fried, succulent bivalves. Finally, we shared the Lobster Bisque: creamy with a hint of sherry, and plenty of lobster meat. The rolls ($19+ tax) come with a zesty blueberry slaw, and a bag of chips; the delightful bisque ($9+ tax) has oyster crackers on the side to add some crunch. It was a meal which put a smile on my face and a longing in my heart for my childhood home in NY, and summer spots in Montauk and on Martha's Vineyard. \n\nDiana was so kind to Scott when she noticed he wears a LifeVest (external defibrillator) and wished him well in his quest for a heart transplant. Yesterday I would have sworn that nothing could put a smile on my face, and TMLL did just that and more. We will definitely visit them again. Lovely people making delicious food. As good as it gets for us! \n\n* See their schedule on their website, FB, and Twitter *\n\n** Large menu (see photos) including sweets: homemade Whoopie Pies! **\n\n*** Diana works with her husband on their Lobster boat in Maine in the summer\/early fall.
