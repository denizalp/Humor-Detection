Don't waste your money.  If it wasn't for the pleasant server ( who was taking care of way to many tables); I would give this place no stars. Believe the bad reviews and be suspicious of the positive ones.  \n\nFood lacks flavor or personality and is over priced. Service is excruciatingly slow.  \n\nI simply did not enjoy my meal and I am annoyed that I can never get the time back that I spent  waiting for my disappointing meal. I would rather eat at Chioplte or Cafe Rio. \n\nMediocre food and abysmal service  at 4 star prices.
