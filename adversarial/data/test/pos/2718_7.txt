Crappy hotel, but you can't beat 9 bucks a night. First off...\n* elevators stink, they have a musty smell\n* the carpet in the room was filthy\n* wallpaper peeling on window ledge\n* hole in wall didn't hold the Kleenex box\n* shower was POWERFUL (fireman hose)\n* tv didn't work, terrible static \n* parking lot way to small\n* hanging cable cord from wall socket\n* shower drained slowey (shower bath)\n* cloudy haze (smoke) in room\n* hookers in front of the hotel \n* nails\/screws in parking lot because of construction on hotel \nThe showers were the worst, being that the water doesnt drain correctly, so your basically soaking your legs in dirt. We didn't spend time in the hotel except to sleep, the only plus is it's close to the Freemont Experience and it's only nine dollars a night. \nI provided pics as well, the pics I posted is of the following:\n* peeling window seal\n* hole in wall where Kleenex box kept falling out\n* hanging cable cord from wall\nBasically you are getting a 9 dollar hotel, I hope my Yelp was useful to you.
