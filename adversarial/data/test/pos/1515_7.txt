Wow!  I am really surprised by the luke warm reviews, We LOVE this place.  We moved from Hawaii a year ago, and miss fresh sushi, luckly we found Akai Hana!  We love the Japanese Firecracker Salad, & the soft shell crab handroll.  The service is friendly and fast!  To all you haters, stay away more for us!!!!
