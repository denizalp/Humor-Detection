Man oh man oh man... Imagine the look on my face as I'm walking down the street in downtown Toronto and see two big barrels sitting outside a bar called the Rum Exchange... Without asking any questions I dove head first into this place and looked around with the excitement of a kid in a candy store.\n\nUpon sitting at the bar, the bartender ran me through the treasure trove of rum that stocked the shelves. Needless to say, I sampled as much as I could in the short period of time I was there. They have everything from Diplomatico Venezuelan rum to even rarer rums I've never heard of.\n\nThe bartender was fully knowledgable on their stock and gave me a brief run through on the rums I've never heard of. If only I had more time, I would have parked it here for hours.\n\nThis place can only be enjoyed if you truly love rum. Given the under appreciated reputation of this liquor, this place gives it the spotlight it deserves and provides the best options you can ask for. I will certainly be back!
