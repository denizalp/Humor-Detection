Came here for lunch with a friend who worked nearby because Thai food is one of my favorites. They had a lunch special going on until 2:30 so we both ordered Pad Thai: I got the tofu and she ordered the chicken. It came with spring rolls, which were in a crescent shape rather than a roll, which is what I'm used to. When I took a bite of it, I noticed the filling wasn't the typical and it had some sort of meat, which I don't eat. I wish they would've said what was in it on the lunch menu (found out by looking on their menu online that it's ground chicken). The pad Thai itself was just okay for me, the egg taste was too strong, though I like eggs in the dish. I'm bummed the rolls weren't vegetarian, that's my main complaint.
