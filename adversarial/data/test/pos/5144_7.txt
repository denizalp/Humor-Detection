I'll be honest; I didn't have high expectations for Max Brenner when my bf suggested it for dinner because most of the rants and raves have been about their desserts. To my surprise it was a great dining and dessert experience! \n\nFOOD - 3.5\/5\n\nMac & Cheese\nThis was served in a large skillet and had a side of tomato\/marinara sauce and diced tomatoes. Although there were five different types of cheeses, I didn't find the cheese to be anything special like when I order truffle mac & cheese at places like Pop Champagne or Elbows Mac & Cheese in the LA area. \n\nTurkey & Gruyere Waffle Sandwich \nIt was my first time tasting a sandwich with waffle as the type of bread. I kind of wish that the waffle was crispy rather than on the soft side. The gruyere (cheese) was cut in thick slices and paired with apple, which complimented the sandwich well! \n\nDESSERT - 4\/5\n\nThey ran out of the melting chocolate truffle heart cake, their signature dish! We were kind of disappointed!\n\nThe hazelnut milkshake made up for it though! I've never had a milkshake that had the perfect balance of smooth, creamy, and icy goodness until this trip! \n\nSERVICE - 5\/5\n\nOur server was super friendly and was really honest about what was great on the menu and what wasn't so great. \n\nOVERALL - 4\/5\n\nI would come back to try some of their other desserts or even for another meal! Their restaurant is modern and cozy for small groups or a date. The gift shop section is small and cute, you could definitely pick up something for your friend and\/or family member!\n\nThere's also free wifi! My reception was so spotty, it was nice to be able to check in!!\n\nYelp 100 Challenge 2013 - 23 of 100
