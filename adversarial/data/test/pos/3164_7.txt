This location is very close to the house, but, we have been going to Tropicana Animal Hospital for so many years that we felt guilty and returned to TAH. However, we learned that this clinic is owned by TAH. Awesome! \n\nCraig Road Animal Hospital is a bit more upscale and it's not just the facility. The cute pets that come here look more affluent. lol. The staff here is very pleasant and professional. We would have loved the convenience of only driving a few blocks, but, we love our beat up TAH. \nAll in all, your fluffy family member is in great hands.
