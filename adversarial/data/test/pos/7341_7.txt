The massage was amazing and I paid ahead of time. However, when I went to give a tip, I advised him that I would be giving 10% because tips are not mandatory. The cashier stated that I had to give 20% for my massage in tip. That is not appropriate! There is nothing in writing that states tips are mandatory! I will not be coming back to this place again!
