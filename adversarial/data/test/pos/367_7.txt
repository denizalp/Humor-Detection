What do they fill the windshield washer bucket with? Swamp water? Port-a-potty \"juice\"? I'm all for recycling but this was so disgusting.  My husband spilled one drop on his shoe, and even though he wiped it immediately with some baby wipes we had in the car, it didn't matter.  As we drove away from the gas station I was noticing the skunk scent, I couldn't stand the smell.  I made him turn around and go to the grocery store bathroom to wash his shoe.  YUK!  Those shoes are going in the dumpster.
