This is different from bouncy house places I'm familiar with in California because:\n\n* It's huge - a bigger space than similar places I've seen.\n* It has many, many trampolines. I don't know how many.\n* There is an area for younger kids and an area for older kids (teenagers and such). For example, older kids play dodge ball on trampolines. This activity never would've occurred to me, but the kids seemed to be having fun.\n* It would likely be a good place to escape the Arizona heat.\n\nThey request that you not bring in your own bottled water (buy theirs), which is another way for them to generate revenue. If I remember correctly, we, as parents of a 5-year-old, were allowed to bounce with our kid for no extra charge.\n\nWe had a good time and I could see it as a fun place to pass a couple of hours, host a birthday party, or just expend excess energy. 3.5 stars
