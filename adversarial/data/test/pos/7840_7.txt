Red Lobster.  Aargh. For whatever reason, Red Lobster and I have just never gotten along. When Grandma C says she wants to go to Red Lobster I usually ask to stay home. My son C drags me along probably for some comic relief.\nComic Relief, seriously! They didn't need me for comic relief, the laugh was the sign on the front door indicating that their credit card system was down and that it could possibly take 20 minutes for the staff to process each card used to pay. Hmmm. Why would any manager put that kind of sign on the door? No, no, no. Yes, you should let the public know but don't tell them it could take 20 minutes. The only reason you do that is to turn people away. And the only reason you turn people away is because you're lazy. Calling a processing center and telling the agent your system is down is easy. Keeping the agent on the line while you process the cards is also easy. Regardless, I just thought the sign was funny. We of course continued in. The place was not very busy. Shocking, after seeing the sign on the door.  I guess a lot of people got scared at the thought of waiting 20 minutes for their bill to get processed.\nOur server was Christel. She did a great job keeping our drinks filled, checking on us and pacing the meal properly. Nicely done.\nGrandma C and C both ordered Fried Shrimp under the Endless Shrimp promotion ($16.99). They both got fries with their meals and ate up most of the shrimp. Was the shrimp perfect? No. Some of the shrimp was overcooked but overall, they did a decent job. Plus, they could reorder as much as they wanted. Both G.C. and C got Raspberry Lemonades ($2.89) as well. Pricey.\nK ordered the Habanero Coconut Bites and Coconut Shrimp bites under the endless Shrimp promotion. ($16.99). Again, all the shrimp was prepared ok. Some was overly breaded but most were not. There were plenty of each so portion size is not an issue. K also got a baked potato with toppings on the side.  K enjoyed them.\nI ordered the Coconut Shrimp Bites and Grilled Teriyaki Shrimp under the promo, ($16.99). I felt my coconut shrimp was just ok. There were a few pieces that were heavily covered in the coconut breading. The grilled Teriyaki Shrimp was fine, nothing special although it is served with rice pilaf. The rice however was a bit undercooked. I ordered the baked potato as my side with the topping on the side. Nothing wrong with the potato.  Again, there was plenty of shrimp included plus as much as I wanted to reorder. Not bad.\nK and I both got Iced Tea ($2.59). Why is it 30 cents less than the lemonade, must be the cost for the Raspberry flavoring. Seems like a McDonalds thing to do, charging for flavorings or sauce packets.\nI will say that my favorite thing at Red Lobster is the Cheddar Biscuit. Yum. When these bad boys are warm and the butter melts over the steamy hot biscuit, heaven.  Another plus is each meal comes with a choice of salad and two sides. Not bad. \nGood service, good food, fair prices. 3 Stars.
