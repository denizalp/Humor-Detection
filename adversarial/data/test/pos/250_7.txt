Terrible hotel. The room was maybe as good as a 2star hotel, we could hear the couple next door doing their thing through the night loud and clear, the only dish I ate here (a tossed green salad) made me fall sick, the service at the poolside was terrible. \n\nIn short, everything we tried our hand at at this hotel sucked, and I'm racking my brain for something nice to say but can\/t think of anything. I'd NEVER recommend it to anybody.
