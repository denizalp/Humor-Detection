The guy handing me my food had dirty finger nails! EFFING GROSS!\n\nI went through the drive thru and decided on a pollo bowl, I wanted to add cheese and he said it was one dollar more.... REALLY? What a rip off! I got to work and was taken aback! Literally, a bowl filled to the brim with rice and beans and 1\/4 of a small breast! BOO!\n\nI tasted it and was turned off, the chicken was bland and dry and it just wasnt yummy! Had I got the cheese and added salt then yea, but seriously EPL?? I also got some red salsa and it wasnt good. Just a sad visit!\n\nWhat was the worst is that the guy at the window had long DIRTY fingernails! OH HELL NO!
