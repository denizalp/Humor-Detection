Definitely not a place for an intimate dinner with your wife or partner. There was no music, in fact the only sound in the place was the conversation at the other table and the Lego's falling to the floor from the child playing at one of the tables in the back. Someone decided to turn on cartoons somewhere in the back of house (I'm not big on cartoons, but I think it was Sponge-Bob), so the music was finally turned on to drown out the sound of the television. \nThe spring rolls were decent, but the sauce was bland. My vermicelli was watery and flavorless. My wife's said her pork tasted like Kix cereal, which I hope was not their intention.\nI love Vietnamese coffee, but decided to skip it because no one came back to check on us -not that there would have been room at the table. Not a single plate had been cleared since we began. \nI had to get up to get my check.
