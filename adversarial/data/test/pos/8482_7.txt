I just came home from watching my brother compete in his third Ironman.  I have to toot his horn and mention that he finished in 11 hours and 29 minutes, his best time yet.  Go Z!\n\nIronman AZ is insane.  For those that don't know.  The Ironman triathlon consists of a 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike, and 26.2 mile run.  Yes - all in one day!  It's inspiring to watch these incredible athletes.  The city of Tempe and Ford, the main sponsor, do a fantastic job making this a spectator friendly event as well.\n\nI'm not sure I'll ever compete in a full Ironman, but perhaps a half. (I've done a Quarter distance before as well as Olympic and Sprint triathlons).  But as long as my brother continues to compete in the full distance, I'll be out there cheering for him and being an extremely proud sister.\n\nCongrats again to all of you that competed today!
