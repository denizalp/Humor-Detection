It's rare I give 2 stars to a place, so let's break it all down:\n\n1. The meats did not seem fresh \n2. The place was not very clean\n3. The service was OK but hectic\n4. I GOT FOOD POISONING!\n\nThis place is crazy popular and for the life of me I do not understand why except maybe location?\n\nI won't ever go back here again...\n\nThe meat tastes bad as in going bad... I was super hungry and ate it anyway. A couple hours later I lived in the bathroom for about 24 hours on and off and in bed the rest of the time....
