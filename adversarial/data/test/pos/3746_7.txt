I visited with a group and ordered fish tacos. I had informed my server that I have a severe tomato allergy and a manager even came out to speak to me about precautions they would take to prevent tomatoes from contacting me food. Then my tacos came with salsa, they professionally handled the situation and very quickly fixed my meal. I would highly recommend this restaurant for their kind service and especially for individuals with allergies.
