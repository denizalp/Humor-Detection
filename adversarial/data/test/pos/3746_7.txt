I was a bit skeptical about this place since it's located in an almost abandoned food court, but decided to come try it after reading all the glowing reviews.  As a first timer, I feel like I HAD to get a katsu dish since that's what this place is known for and went for the FRIED FISH FILET $9.04 (after tax) and it was fantastic!  There was only 1 person ahead of me in line when I came on a Tuesday around noon.  The food came out pretty quickly after I ordered (about 5 minutes).  The fish was fresh, crispy and tasty.  Really great light breading and not greasy.  The curry sauce was great with rice and had just the right amount of spiciness.  The coleslaw was a nice vegetable compliment to the meal.  I would definitely come back to try the chicken or pork katsu.\n\nThere is plenty of seating in the food court area.\n\nLOCATION:  Near the corner of Yonge and Gerrade.  Look for the building with the Marshall and Bed Bath & Beyond sign.  When you see the \"The Shops at Aura\", you're at the right place.  There's an escalator that goes down to the food court area.  There are 2 other restaurants opened in the food court offering sushi and ramen.\n\nThey take Visa and Mastercard.
