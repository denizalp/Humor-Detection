Ok, this is the kind of neighborhood place where people care about customer service, and care even more about the food they're making. \n\nCame in on a whim. While I waited for a to-go order, the guy behind the counter generously brought out a little sampler of homemade chips, red chili beef and green chili pork to try. It was so delicious I almost asked my boyfriend if he wanted to order another burrito to split ... then I was like, girl, calm down. No one's going to keep you from coming back.
