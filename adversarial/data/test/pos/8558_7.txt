Our church media team was in town for the NAB Show 2018 and after the first day, we met up here to enjoy a meal together.\n\nThey had a special going on where all their appetizers were 50% off until about 6pm which meant we had about 15 minutes to put in our orders if we wanted to make the deadline. Most of us decided it made sense to order appetizers instead of an entree so that's what I did.\n\nI ordered a plate called Burnt Ends which were twice smoked beef brisket nuggets which were then basted in a combination of barbecue sauces. This was definitely a winner in my book in taste. The menu price was $8.99 so 50% off was a great deal! I also ordered the Buffalo Chicken Fingers which are breaded chicken breast fillets tossed in a Buffalo wing sauce and served with ranch dressing. This was good too, not as great as the brisket as I thought it needed more barbecue sauce on it. The menu price for this was $7.99. I also ordered a basket of the Corn Muffins for $2.99. So you can see, I was able to get a great savings on what would have normally cost me $20 and more.\n\nThe waitress was a sweetheart and although she had a huge task of trying to keep all our orders straight as well as give us separate checks at the end of our meal, I felt she accomplished her job well albeit with a few check errors but otherwise we were all well-taken care of during the meal.\n\nI would venture to say given the fact that most of us are meat lovers in our group we would probably be back again if in town.
