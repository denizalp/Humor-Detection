The ambiance\/vibe and service is 5 stars. Decided on 3 stars because the food was lack luster.  Started with the crevice which was fishy and mushy.  My husband tried to drown it in lemon which did not help at all.  \n\nThe caesar salad was decent, but it's very hard to mess that up! Did appreciate the freshly grated Parmesan cheese though! The bread was a definite slam dunk. \n\nMy steak was just eh. Not seasoned too well.  If I'm being honest,  the dessert is what made me give 3 stars, because I was going to give it 2.  Warm cookie with ice cream....pretty hard not to make it to my heart with that one..
