I like to eat and I like chimichurri sauce.\n\nMy gf found this place the last time we were in Vegas back in November '09 and I'm glad she did.  The place is located in a strip mall with plenty of parking.  When you walk in, there's nothing special about it - there's a huge deli case in front, a small market, and the restaurant (albeit small) is off to the left.  \n\nAlthough I don't remember what I ordered, I couldn't get enough of the chimichurri sauce; I was using it on everything from the bread to my dish.  I thought there was crack in the sauce it was so good.  On the way out I perused the deli case and the market checking to see if they had chimichurri for sale, which they did.  The chimichurri sauce is bottled in these big ass bottles similar to the Ball jars you might see in certain stores or restaurants.  I ended up getting a jar and used it for everything and anything when I got home.\n\nIf you're ever visiting in Vegas, I would recommend this place instead of the traditional buffets everyone and their mom go to.  This is definitely the place I will be at the next time I'm in Vegas.
