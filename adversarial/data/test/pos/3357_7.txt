I just posted a review to another hair salon. And I wasn't going to forget about this place. I give it one star because it's so unprofessional for no one to return a call. I called left a vm Monday evening 6\/1 and then Tuesday morning 6\/2, my bday. I mentioned that I had just moved to Vegas from California on Sunday. \nI know now to never come here. Or the other hair salon.
