We like our current vet, but they've kind of grown large. We liked them before, so it's time to give a newer, smaller vet a try. And here we are at AAA Pet Services Hospital.\n\nLocated at a busy part of Park Road between Woodlawn and Tyvola, the facility is clearly a converted home. The waiting room is what used to be the living room, the patient consulting area happens in the kitchen and the treatment area and some kennels are in one of the side bedrooms. Not that there's anything wrong with a home that's now a pet hospital.\n\nFor our service today, we brought one of our senior cats for a checkup after purchasing a coupon from Angie's List (we have a few others in our menagerie that will visit next). The exam was thorough, the doctor and his two assistants were helpful and efficient, and we were quite pleased with how it was performed and the results. They have the tools to examine the bloodwork on site, which is helpful. They're just a little limited for some of the more serious treatments like ultrasounds and whatnot.\n\nAnd then the bill. Well, we'd paid for a coupon on Angie's List that included all sorts of things. During the examination, the vet said that he didn't need all of the services included in that coupon and so instead of burning a $200 coupon, our bill was simply $76. Very nice and we can save that coupon for another visit with one of our other fur babies.\n\nGood service, nice warm fuzziness from the place and the staff. I think we may well have found a new vet.
