Anyone who knows anything about Pittsburgh knows that Mt. Washington is one of--if not the--must see attraction in the city.  As the name suggests, Grandview Ave. offers a spectacular view of the city skyline, as well as the rivers that surround it.  There are several overlooks at intervals along Grandview that jut out over the edge of the mountain, offering numerous opportunities to take photos with the city skyline as a backdrop.\n\nCM and I visited Mt. Washington last Sat. on the 4th of July, since it affords one of the best views in the city to see the fireworks.  I think the last time I'd been up on Mt. Washington was 2 years ago when my parents visited Pittsburgh.  I was planning to take CM on the inclines, since he'd never ridden one, despite having lived in PGH for 2 years and having visited before; however, between free parking on the Mt. and the prohibitively long lines at the bottom, we decided to save that experience for another time.  (Oh, well--it just gives me another convenient excuse to visit again soon!)  We met up with some friends to hang out for a bit in a secret abandoned lot with a great view of the skyline, but a not-so-great view of the Point, beyond which the fireworks are set off.  Thus, we ended up fighting the unwashed masses along Grandview for a spot 15 minutes before the fireworks began, finally finding a half-decent one on the first overlook near the Monongahela Incline.  My original plan had been to stake out a spot at the West End Overlook a couple of hours prior to the fireworks, but sometimes, hanging out with friends takes priority over well-thought-out plans--this was one of those times.\n\nDespite our failure to do so, riding both inclines (Monongahela and Duquesne) is a must for first time visitors to Mt. Washington.  I highly suggest starting at the bottom and taking the Monongahela incline up, walking along Grandview, and taking the Duquesne incline back down--this is what I've done almost every other time I've visited.  As others have mentioned, there are several upscale restaurants offering spectacular views of the city near the Duquesne incline.  However, if you're hungry and don't want to spend serious $$$, there are several reasonably priced restaurants and bars with less of a view along Shiloh St. near the Monongahela Incline. (We had dinner at the Shiloh Grill on the 4th of July--see separate review for my evaluation.)  There's also an ice cream parlor and a bakery on Shiloh St. if you're looking for a snack, rather than a full meal.\n\nWhether you're a tourist, new to Pittsburgh, or have lived here for awhile, a visit to Mt. Washington is a must.  For maximum romantic potential, I suggest visiting during sunset or at night, when you can see the city lights twinkle and the fountain at the Point in its fully illuminated glory.  It's definitely one of the most beautiful views in Pittsburgh, bested only by the nearby West End overlook, which offers a head on view of downtown.
