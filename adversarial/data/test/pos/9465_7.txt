Absolutely appalled at the ill mannered staff! My father always stops by and purchases a few cigars when he is in town. He goes in today and gets accused of stealing! Because his hands were in his pocket. Excuse me it's cold outside!!!! Was he not the right color? How did your staff member feel when he told my father to empty his pockets and nothing was there??? DISGRACEFUL!
