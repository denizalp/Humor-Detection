This company came because they were the chosen vendor to inspect an HVAC issue through our home warranty. Their technician came in and completely scared us, saying there was a crack in one of our cells and it was rusted out, even leaking carbon monoxide, and we needed a replacement immediately. He also strongly advised us not to turn it on or use it. He then told the warranty company to deny our claim. We of course fought it and the warranty company sent out a second HVAC company to get a second opinion. The second opinion said there was absolutely nothing wrong, and said that Budget is known for doing that - using scare tactics then telling the warranty company to deny your claim - in order to get you to purchase a new HVAC system through them. We got our own third opinion since we did not trust anyone the warranty company was sending out, and they also said nothing was wrong. Budget claimed they took several pictures in order to prove the damage to the warranty company. When I requested the pictures from Budget, they claimed they only download them once a week but they would try to send them to me that day. I still have not received them days later. Stay away from this company.
