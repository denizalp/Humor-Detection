If you wanna spend 100$ p.pers. to listen to loud qu√©taine music, get ignored by the staff and mingle with obnoxious douchbags then that's the place!  Made us wait 45 min. with reservation after completely ignoring us for 15 min at arrival.  Food is way overpriced.  Overcrowded.  Forget getting attention or even a smile from any of the staff there.  Although, the 2 cops that came in at one point got free drinks...  Terrible experience, really felt like the staff thought they were way too cool for us little clients.
