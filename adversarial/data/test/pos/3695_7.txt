In terms of price and room size, the signature is a no-brainer. You can regularly get 900sqft 1br's for just over $100\/night. This coming with full kitchen (with large fridge. Def make a drink\/snack run beforehand), two bathrooms, balcony, a king size bed and a pull out queen bed in the main room. Sick. The rooms are modern and have desks, FREE WIFI and adjustable flat screens (make sure to tune to the last channel!)\n\nYou can walk to the Wet Republic (although there are 3 pools at The Signature) and the MGM restaurant area in about 5 min using the moving walkways. So, is it on the strip? Nope. But it's mighty close to the MGM. Anything else requires a cab ride. There are plenty of cabs on premises so don't be worried. \n\nThere are 3 towers, each with their own check-in\/out, valets and bellhops. Tower one has a Starbucks and a bar lounge, Tower two has an awesome deli and I've yet to venture into tower tre. This is the place to stay if you're looking to catch a good nights sleep while raging in the Vegas.
