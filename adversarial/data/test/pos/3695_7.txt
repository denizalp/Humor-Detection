Probably one of the most traditional Chinese dessert restaurant in Scarborough. The interior is also pretty nice and gives off a traditional Chinese feel with the d√©cor. I particularly liked the stone stools, so unique! \n\nI wanted to order the mango sago but I didn't see it in the menu (or I'm just really blind) so I just ordered taro sago and steamed milk egg pudding. Super delicious! Would definitely come back!
