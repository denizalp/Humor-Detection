Why is it that every  time I come into this particular Toys r Us store, I end up dealing with the mental defective or asshole of the store?\n\nThis did happen recently - about a month ago, so well before Christmas and generally I am a very pleasant person to deal with, that is unless you release the beast.\n\nI call in, \"Hello, I am looking for NHL Slapshot, do you have any in stock?\"\nLady Asshole: \"hold on\"  I am waiting about 5 minutes. \"what did you want again?\" \nMe: \"I was inquiring about the NHL Slapshot game?\"\nLady Asshole: \"hold on\" again waiting 5 minutes...I get transferred to Customer service, then they ask what I was holding for, I say electronics. I get transferred back\nLady Asshole: \"electronics, how can I help you?\"\nMe: \"give me a manager\"\nLady Asshole: \"What is the problem\"\nMe: \"I asked you if you had a game, you put me on hold for 10 minutes and you didn't even check then I got transferred.  I don't have time for this, now please, with sugar on top, can I speak with your manager?\"\nLady Asshole: CLICK\n\nSo, in my typical fashion, I head over there because a.)I needed to return a present that my little guy had 2 of and, b.) I wasn't letting Lady Asshole get away with hanging up on me. \n\nI go in hoping to get NHL Slapshot and hoping to speak to Lady Asshole, after all, it was the first day of its release and it was barely noon so figured some would be in right? Not so much.  I ask a young kid, obviously new, about this game and he didn't know what I was talking about and tells me that he will ask the lady at the electronics check-out - LADY ASSHOLE- we are now face to face.\n\nI say \"Good morning, I spoke with you earlier and you were supposed to check on NHL Slapshot for me but you hung up for some reason or other\".  Her response was, you are going to love this, \" I transferred you, you might have been accidentally disconnected.\"\n\nMe: \"Really? Accidentally disconnected?  Did you by chance look into that NHL game for me?\"\n\nLady Asshole: \"Actually we just sold the last one about 5 minutes ago\"\n\nI can't make this stuff up.  \n\nMe: \"so if you did look into having this game, say, when I called a half hour ago and you put it on hold for me, I would be purchasing it instead of having this conversation with you?\"\n\nLady Asshole: \"We were very busy this morning\"\n\nI am looking around and the store is virtually empty...\n\nMe: \"when will you be getting more in?\"\nLady Asshole: \"I don't know, you would have to check with customer service and they would give you a rain-check and it will probably not be in before Christmas.\"\nMe: \"I would like to speak with someone who can make an executive decision, could you contact a manager? I will be waiting at customer service.\"  I leave and wait another several minutes for a manager.\n\nManager finally arrives, I tell her the story, basically she is flustered and didn't want to deal with me and said that she will give me a rain check for the game and sent me away...barely apologized and said that shouldn't have happened blah blah blah.  I was steaming mad and basically told her that it is unfortunate that they will no longer be getting my business, or my family's business anymore and we all have small children and babies and in fact, I was intending on making a big corporate purchase but that won't be happening either.  Told her to keep her rain check for someone who will actually come back to this store.\n\nI ended up going to Cross Iron Mills and found it immediately and there were actually functioning human beings working there who were knowledgeable about the store and its contents, imagine that!
