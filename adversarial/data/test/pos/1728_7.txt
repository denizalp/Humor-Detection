Just FYI, passed by the place on this lovely Saturday night.  There were maybe two people in there at 8:30 p.m.  The gelato place down the sidewalk was a lot more hopping.  You would think with a 14 screen movie theatre directly across the shopping center from them, they would have more business; but the word is out.  I looked at the menu and there were not very many interesting choices.  I'm not sure, just based on reading their menu, why anybody would walk in there in the first place.  Scottsdale has many first-rate restaurants.
