Delicious! Great service. Fantastic options, veggie burgers included. Nice sized patio.\n\nHow do you get your out-of-town friends to visit again? Take them to Big Daddy's! I thought I was impressing my friend by taking her all over almost every Charlotte neighborhood, but it wasn't until lunchtime with a hamburger in hand did she start to really sing praises. The burger was perfect, the fries were great. \n\nOne of the managers came out to say hello and chatted a minute about being from Texas. I thought that was really friendly and created a personal connection. \n\nThanks, Big Daddy, for taking the delicious measures to ensure the return of my friend to the Queen City!
