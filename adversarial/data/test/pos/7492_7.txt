10\/28\/10\n\nCame here for a mani\/pedi after a hair appt. at a nearby salon.  Had high hopes since reading Lindsey's 5-star review.  Unfortunately, my experience here did not even deserve the one star I'm rating it!  After choosing my color and sitting down at the comfortable-looking massage chair, I saw that two women would be doing simultaneous treatments on me, and I thought \"Fantastic!  This'll be just like my experience in Charlotte, and  I'll be out of here in no time!\"  The process may have taken less than an hour (I didn't keep track), and I was out of there before closing time, but that's bec. they decided to call it a day and kicked me out before my nails were dry!\n\nThe retro blue chair may have looked new and comfortable, but the massage part didn't feel new- I could feel AND hear the parts move slowly in fits and starts..  Perhaps this was the reason no one bothered to turn the chair on for me- all of the nail techs at salons I regularly go to do If I forget to myself (even the one in Atlantic City that I tried for the first time did so).  I only remembered to turn it on more than halfway into the treatments, and that's bec. my back and arm were feeling fatigued due to my manicurist forcing me to lean forward on my chair (back curved) w\/ my left hand painfully stretched and at a cross-angle to reach her as she sat at my right side the entire time.  (At the salon in Charlotte, the manicurist would move her chair from one side focusing on one hand, and then move to the other to work on the other hand, leaving me to recline back onto the wonderful chair to enjoy my massage w\/out any inconvenience!)  I finally made it a point to take my arm away and lean my back onto the chair and let out a big sigh so she could see how strained I was, but I don't think she made the connection.  That, or she didn't give a damn!\n\nI much preferred the pedicurist as she was more personable and was conversational than the manicurist, who struck me as perhaps not as fluent in English since she didn't even bother to acknowledge my inquiry as to where she lived in the valley (pedicurist first posed the question to me; I answered, and then asked her where she lived, etc.).  I also preferred the pedicurist's work on my legs and feet over that of the manicurist's on my arms and hands, but on the whole, I've had better cleanings and paint jobs at other salons.  (The manicure I received here looked like the work of someone just learning how to paint-- the coatings were uneven and overlapped many of my cuticles.  I could've saved some money and do the work myself w\/ much better results!)  What followed next, however, was definitely not cool, and will be one more reason I could never recommend this salon to anyone I know.\n\nAfter the treatments ended, I sat at the chair waiting for my nails to air-dry slowly in barely-cool comfort-- there weren't any UV-light machines to help set the coats.  There weren't even any of those mini-fans to help the nails dry.  The tropical feel of the place (Asian decor-- ceiling fans w\/ blades that look like hand fans; wooden panel screens w\/ Japanese flora and fauna depictions; bamboo trees here and there) and the sleepy rhythm of the overhead fans made me reminisce back to childhood days in Manila, specifically to siesta time, when all you could hear is the whirring noises of the fan's blades and head as it rotated from side to side, and I was actually beginning to feel warm and fuzzy.  I was lulled back to the present when everyone seemed to be gathering their clothes and bags and lowering blinds down.  I commented that it must be time to go home as I looked at my watch (5:30p) and asked, \"but don't you close at 6?\".  A third woman chuckled and said yes, but business was very slow, so they were going to close early.  I've visited other salons when it was near closing time, but I never once was kicked out.  I've even stayed past closing and watched them clean up shop, bec. they cared enough about the quality of their work to make sure that I left w\/ dry nails.  The women at  Queen's Nails would not show me this courtesy, and I find that completely disgraceful.  \n\nMy suggestion is to skip this salon and go somewhere else where your body AND your money will be treated w\/ more respect!
