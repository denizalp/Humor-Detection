Sunday afternoon, 20 people in the bar and it took us 20 minutes before we tracked down a server to order a drink. Maybe it's BYO? Quality has gone down since the change from Derby\n\nQuick update. After complaining we couldn't get service the server was lovely but served terribly weak drinks. Ate an average nachos and then they scooped up my phone with the plates and THREW IT OUT! They \"let\" me go through all the trash in the kitchen up to my elbows, then had to go through the trash compactor out the back while some guy shoveled in food (literally). I found it, cleaned it up and received a full bill. Good times.
