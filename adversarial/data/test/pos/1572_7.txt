I really reserved my judgment of this place until I was actual able to confirm that Tempe Dental Care lies!!! I had a strong suspicion that they do for months but I was actual able to confirm it by going to another dentist for a second opinion and also asking a dentist friend of mine to take a look at my teeth. The writing was all over the wall folks....I asked FOUR times for my X-Rays and EVERY single time it was an excuse from the computer is down to the computer is under maintenance to blah blah blah. They basically didn't want me to confirm what they already know: THEY LIE! This place reals unsuspecting folks through the door with cheap cleanings and a nice clean atmosphere and then BAM they hit you with lies, in my case they told me I have 6 cavities, I know for a fact I have 1, but 6?? I just couldn't believe it since even the 1 cavity I know I have is the first cavity in my life and I take very good care of my teeth. This place is so incredibly shady it warrants being shut down. So frustrating to know that bad dentists are out there only for the money.
