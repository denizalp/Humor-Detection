I came here for a friends party and loved it because we had the place all to ourselves.  \nThe setup is cute with swings and slides and a ball pit, which looks tons of fun, but sorry parents strictly only for kids to enjoy.   If you forget there are signs posted everywhere that say \"kids only.\"   The owner is super nice and friendly and allowed us to stay a little longer after hours.   The oldest they recommend is 7 years old, so if you still have little ones this place is the place to go.   Clean environment and entertainment for the kiddos.  Lastly, check into Yelp to get $2 off admission.\n\nTIP:  don't forget your socks ... adults and children !   If you did, no worries you can purchase them.
