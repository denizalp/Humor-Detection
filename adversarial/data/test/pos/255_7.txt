WOW this mall gets busy, .. Busy doesn't even describe what I was dealing with!!! \n\nI usually only come here with a friend or two when I'm bored out of my mind, or last minute christmas or birthday shopping. I forget there are some great stores in here, along with a movie theater. And If not for shopping It's definitely great for people watching.. Almost better then the airport...almost!
