Very yummy!\n\nWe have eaten delivery from Ocha several times and its pretty good!\n\nWhat I like about this place is that you can tell them light or zero oil and they will accommodate!\n\nMy fav items from her would be veggie Drunken Noodles spicy, Panag Curry veggie, tofu Pad Thai, and veggie fried rice with extra extra garlic!\n\nWe have only used them three times for delivery so I can not speak to if the place is nice.\n\nThey deliver VERY QUICKLY via EAT24 and they are always super nice upon arrival!\n\nThey do not have a set veggie menu so you will just have to type out your special requests on each menu item.\n\nThey have never let me down with my demanding requests. The veggies are always super crisp, nothing is overcooked and the items are very flavorful!\n\nNext time we order I will take photos :D
