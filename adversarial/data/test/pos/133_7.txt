South Bayview just got a lot cooler. \n\nAs a major fan of the Lit over the last few years, I was excited to see the new location in this upscale neighbourhood. \n\nThe ambience is similar to the College and Roncy spots, but definitely improved. A beautifully copper tiled ceiling, comfortable seats, a really nice bar at the end of the counter for a quick sip of espresso, and the nicest\/most knowledgable coffee staff in the city. \n\nA great selection of sandwiches and treats (I had a fresh filled cannoli...the shells are shipped in from Italy every week). \n\nNot too far from the Brickworks, so if you're over on Bayview keep on truckin' up to 1517.
