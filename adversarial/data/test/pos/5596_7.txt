Unusual seats that rock and roll. Depending on the row your seat is in, you may have a regular theater seat or one of the rolling chairs.\n\nA pitcher of margaritas will make any movie be awesome. Well, almost all movies. I don't think Blade Runner was salvageable. But the margaritas were wonderful and helped the movie along. Two pitchers might have made this movie  a darkly poetic, thought-inducing extravaganza.\n\nThe actual venue is pretty cool . If you have upgraded to dine-in movie theatre  experiences, then this place will definitely be your cup of tea.\n\nParking here can be a challenge if you happen to arrive as multiple movies are showing and lots of families are eating at the restaurants surrounding the movie theater.
