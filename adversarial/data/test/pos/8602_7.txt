Such a cute store, I enjoyed my ice cream here on sunny October afternoon.\n\nI was looking for ice cream place and this was the closest with good reviews. It was a bit difficult to find and parking space was limited. \n\nThey have a few different kind of cones including waffle and pretzels. I didn't really look too much for flavor as the first thing I saw was Vietnamese coffee and my mind was set. I always enjoy drinking strong Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk, so why not? If I look what else they might have, I may be standing there forever. \n\nVietnamese coffee flavor ice cream was good, I enjoyed it. Well... I had better homemade ice cream somewhere else before but their ice cream was very good.\n\nThey have small tables and chairs outside in the back. Very small area but most people don't stay there too long anyway.  \n\nPrice was where it should be. I may come back if I am in the area and craving for ice cream.
