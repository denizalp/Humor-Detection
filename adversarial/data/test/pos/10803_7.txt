Have you ever been screamed at angrily in front of an entire floor of guests by a high end restaurant owner\/manager? If you would like such an experience, ask for Karan Tsoi of Terre Rouge! Read on for full details.\n\nBeen here twice now - first time for our 7 year anniversary and second time for Father's Day. Our first experience was decent. We got the beef tartare, black cod, and mushroom risotto. The service was poor - the waiter didn't even ask if we wanted dessert and just slammed the menus on our tables. He didn't smile once during our whole night. Despite this, I would have given them a 3 star because the food was great.\n\nToday we came for Father's Day dinner with a reservation. You can tell they were having a hard time keeping up with the orders because they weren't used to being at capacity. I ordered the same dish, the cod, and it was definitely not as good as the first time i had it. \n\nHere comes the worst part that warrants the one star. My father in law had ordered a trio of sorbet, but it came completely melted. We pointed this out, and her response was that it's humid, they scooped it first and had to wait for all the other desserts to finish before bringing it out. Um, does anyone else agree that for a restaurant at this price point, they should know to scoop the sorbet out last? It's totally fine, but she was so defensive and was very reluctant to give us a new one. This is still not the worst part. she saw me starting to write a yelp a review and decided to YELL AT ME, ASSUMING ILL WRITE A BAD REVIEW AND SCREAMED AT ME SAYING HOW INCONSIDERATE IT WAS OF ME SINCE IT WAS SO HOT OUTSIDE TODAY AND THAT I WAS DESTROYING HER RESTAURANT. And if you can believe this - SHE CLAIMED TO BE THE OWNER OF THE RESTAURANT. I wish I could have recorded her yelling at us. I was so shocked at her lack of professionalism and how such a person could run a restaurant. I really feel bad for the employees that have to work under her management.
