Grampa's? More like Grumpy's. I won't be returning after the owner Gilbert Altschul sent me this email: \"I'm sure there are plenty of empty pizzerias that you and your friends can camp out in and talk about nonsense.\"\n\nI had sent him an email expressing my disappointment in how rudely we were treated at the end of our meal. We enjoyed an app, two pizzas, a dessert and a bottle of wine but apparently spreading out that meal over 2 hours was unacceptable and we were rudely told to leave by a manager when she said, \"We have a long wait and I need you to leave now.\" We had signed the check only 10 minutes prior. Also, we are three very nice ladies in our 30s, not like a group of rowdy, rude, annoying people.\n\nI know the place is small but a simple, \"Due to our small space, we'd appreciate if our patrons restricted their meal to 90 minutes or less,\" on the menu would have been helpful or a \"I'm so sorry to ask this but we're on a long wait. Do you mind wrapping up your conversation?\" would have been perfectly acceptable. \n\nAfter hearing about their breastfeeding debacle and all the boycotters within their first couple weeks of business it's surprising that an owner who treats his customers so poorly can remain in business. Madison is a wonderful food city, there's no need to support a man who treats his paying customers in this way. Ever heard of \"the customer is always right?\" I was even up front with the fact that I'm a food and travel writer (trying to let him redeem himself) but he still sent that ridiculous response to me.
