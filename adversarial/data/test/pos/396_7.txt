A nice start to the day \n\n\nThis Starbucks is not my usual stop however, it just might be my favorite. I love my coffee and what's better then a Starbucks iced white chocolate mocha, I can't think of anything and vanilla scone.\n\nThe service at this Starbucks is phenomenal and the staff are always very friendly. This location is clean, inviting, and feels comfortable and they have seating outside at the patio, and wuth this cooler weather what a perfect option.\n\nMy coffee was made exactly the way I order and tasted great. In addition, to the great coffee Starbucks has delicious pastries if you need a snack. I really enjoy grabbing a cake pop or two to go.\n\nGreat coffee, pastries,  friendly staff, and shopping.  It doesn't get any better.
