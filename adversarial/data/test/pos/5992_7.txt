Food: 3 stars for the price paid.\nService: 1 star.\n\nBeen there with a French friend visiting the US because we had a 50% (or 30%?) off coupon which would make the whole day buffet on a Saturday at 25$ (you can get 11$ weekday brunch with that coupon from Tix4tonight).\nNot a bad deal. Especially it includes free flow of wines and beers.\n\nFirst: don't go there unless you have a discount coupon. I don't think the buffet is worth over 20$ (unless you drink a lot of alcohol).\nThe food is OK, very standard, slightly on the cheap side.\nSuchi bar? lot of rice, nothing fine nor gourmet, small selection.\nCheese? industrial, small selection.\nMeat? quite oily. American buffet? on the heavy side.\ncrab legs? yes unlimited snow crab legs. Frozen though and not cooked very well (very salty, watery).\nDessert buffet seemed great. Too bad I don't eat sweet.\n\nI think it's a 3 stars food-wise, for 20ish $.\n\nOK now why 2 stars? Service.\nyour dirty plates can sit on your tables for 20 minutes. piling up. Our waitress was making a pretty long face and worst of all: she dropped sauce and meat from our plates twice (and a lot, not just few drops), while removing them form the table. Sauce landed twice on your bags that were on the chairs next to us. Not a sorry, not offering to clean, she probably even didn't notice.\n\nYou can go there if you wanna eat whole day and don't mind the service.
