Today is a nice autumn Saturday and this restaurant has been on my bookmark list for some time now. Almost went to it the last time we had Queens Fest aka Charlotte Restaurant Week.\n\nWe got there a little afternoon and were promptly seated, menu's presented and drink orders taken.  Quick review of the menu and I had decided on the French Dip.\n\nServer comes back a couple of minutes late with our drinks and informs us that they are out of Prime Rib. I asked if that translated to no French Dip and when she said yes, back to the menu and time to formulate Option B.\n\nMy wife decided on the Fancy Grilled Cheese Sandwich minus the fried egg and a side of asparagus. This is a combination of both Gouda and Gruyere Cheeses.\n\nI went with the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich with a side of steak fries.\n\nWhile we waiting, i took advantage of surveying the restaurant. Nice clean archtecture with modern lines while keeping some of the historic feel of this being the former police station. Good feel and I like the lines.\n\nLunch came out and while my wife liked here Grilled Cheese Sandwich, my Buffalo Chicken was a big disappointment.  The Chicken was overcooked and very dry and while it had been sauces with Texas Pete, it had very little heat to it. The Blue Dressing was very runny and I could not pick it up and eat it without making a big mess.  The Steak Fries were a generous portion but unfortunately they were under cooked with poor texture.\n\nService was very good I  must say.\n\nAll in all, nice atmosphere and service but nothing special or noteworthy in terms of the quality of the food.  Menu is impressive an there might be better items on it, but I did not find them.
