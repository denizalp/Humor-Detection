Awesome local Greek place. I've gotten takeout from here a couple times, and they totally remind me of my now-closed favorite gyro shack from my time in New York City. I am very, very happy to have a sweet place like this literally on my drive home from work. Quality and quickness are great, as is pricing. AND they offer a seven-pound mega-gyro challenge that I will take when I want to throw off the shackles of any semblance of a healthy lifestyle.
