I did not like this place \nFor one they don't have drill machines, I waited over an hour for the lady to use a file to remove my shellac on my toes and nails. \nFor two they use the same foot scrubber to remove dead skin on every customer! Disgusting ! \nFor third, they didn't even use gloves!\n\nThis place is the type of place you'll get hepatitis horror story from.
