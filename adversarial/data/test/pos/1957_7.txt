This has always been the closest mall wherever I've lived in Toronto (I've always lived in the west end).\n\nWhen I moved to Toronto in 1987, the Dufferin Mall was a dump ... dirty with no food court.  Over the years, it's cleaned itself up and has been renovated in the last two.  Big brand name stores have pushed most of the independent stores out (some deserved to go).\n\nThe Dufferin Mall has pretty well everything I need ... except a liquor store (it left in the 1990s).  Most of the time I'm not in the mood for a monstrosity like Square One or Yorkdale anyway.
