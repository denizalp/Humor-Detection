I love Thai food and jumped at the opportunity to try a new Thai restaurant on the Strip when I saw it pop up on Groupon. Plus, who doesn't want to save a few bucks in Vegas whenever you can. The Groupon took about 40% off the regular price and gave us $100 to spend on four or more people. We ended up having five people and, of course given Vegas prices, had no problem reaching and exceeding that amount. In fact, my friend and I decided to share our plate of pad see ew to avoid leftovers and the five of us still hit $150 with four entrees, four drinks and a beer.\n\nOf course, this happened to be the smallest portion of pad see ew that I've ever seen in all of my Thai eating days. Every other time I end up with enough leftover for at least one, if not two more meals, but this time I probably could have finished the whole plate. Aside from the size, the rest of the dish was perfect. Our waitress advised us to try the beef over the chicken and it was very tender and delicious. There was a perfect sauce to noodle ratio and I was very happy with the flavor. I don't care for Chinese broccoli but I liked that it was stacked on top of the dish instead of mixed in and my dining partner volunteered to eat the greens. At $22, I wouldn't say this dish is worth the price but it was tasty. My friends ordered a couple fried rices and the drunken noodles. It seemed like the fried rice dishes had the largest quantity of food.\n\nAs always, I loved my Thai iced tea, which was a bit pricier than usual at $5 but in line with Vegas prices.\n\nThe restaurant is small but has a nice vibe. It was relaxing until a very loud person was sat at the table next to us. Apparently, noise carries very well in here. \n\nService was good at first but then our waitress seemed to disappear after she dropped the check off. We were in a hurry so it was a bit annoying that it took her so long to return to get the payment. We had to rush back to our hotel to get ready for our evening plans.
