So they took out all their gaming and relaunched themselves as a lounge. I'm not quite sure what happened to the hotel rooms and what they are used as now. \n\nI came during the evening to check it out. It was really busy, really loud and lots of dumb drunken antics. There's a DJ playing and you can play too : shuffleboards, darts, billiards, board games, cornhole, etc. The plus is there's lots of space and abundant seating and couch beds to lounge on. There's outdoor areas as well with chairs and lawn games. \n\nIf you want something to eat, they have a diner in there. It's not much quiet since it opens up into the great room where everything is happening. \n\nI'm sure I've missed more than it has to offer since it's a big place and I didn't go exploring more once me and my friends found a table. \n\nI heard it's open during day and is a far different vibe. It's relaxed and quiet since it can attract the laptop set who need alternate place to work or study. I think that's more my speed.\n\n I don't know if it's always that crowded, but it was a little too crowded for my taste with some rowdy people. It was good people watching though. Where else can I find a hipster in a suit sitting there zoned out with one shoe off?
