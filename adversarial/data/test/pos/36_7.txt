First of all  BIG THANKS to Alex our waiter. Saddled with the party of women celebrating, he never was rude or impatient but handled us like a pro at customer service!  He made the evening click with smoothly timed drinks and ordering. \n\nBrought some of my friends to TICOZ  for a go away party for a friend  getting married. So glad we came here..the ambiance was festive yet upscale.  We loved the food , music , guacahummus and the the nice big table which we hogged all evening. \n\nThe gals loved the guacahummus , salsa and chips , a great start with drinks , we had wonderful entrees  like the special of chicken pasta and my delicious blue corn enchiladas which I would gladly have again. \n\nNice touch with the complimentary  Churro with ice cream and raspberry sauce. I will be back!
