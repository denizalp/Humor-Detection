Parking is ALWAYS a problem at FMP. Well, maybe it got a little better after the movie theatre closed, but on weekends, we would still be parking over where WinCo and HomeDepot are, or at the theatre parking spaces. \n\nFirst Markham Place is home to many East Asian restaurants including, but not limited to dim sum, Vietnamese food, noodles, dumplings, Chinese, Japanese, Shanghai foods, desserts, mini cafes and much more. Inside First Markham Places houses a few shops and a food court with more food options.\n\nThe shops in my opinion aren't too attractive and not worth roaming around at all. Perhaps if they spaced out the restaurants around the entire First Markham place, it would help. In addition, I think if they were planning a renovation of this place, they could add a parking building and fun activities for young people to enjoy (e.g. pool tables, karaoke, an arcade, etc.)
