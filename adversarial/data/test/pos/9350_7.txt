In A Nutshell:\n\n-Chase Field, which is the home of the Arizona Diamondbacks is pretty unique baseball stadium.\n-Parking is so, so easy around the stadium, not to mention cheap too (can't beat $10).\n-As you enter, it felt darker than any other baseball stadium I've been to (10 total).\n-The retractable roof was closed at opening pitch, but luckily after the sunset, they opened it up and wow, such a great view w\/ fresh air coming inside.\n-I liked the southwest atmosphere as you walk around the stadium.\n\nOverall, this is an above-average baseball stadium, a very nice place to catch a ballgame.
