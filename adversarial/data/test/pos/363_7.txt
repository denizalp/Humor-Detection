Nice, comfortable condos, for $600-1000 (1-3 bedrooms), within a gated and well-landscaped community.  We've lived here for only a few months, but really like the people as well as the environment.  Now that it's summer, things are a little crazy from time to time by the pool areas, but it comes with the territory, I guess.  Since there are three of them, we just go to the one that's not crowded...  Oh, and the HUGE tub in our master suite is great, too, when it's just too hot out there.   :)
