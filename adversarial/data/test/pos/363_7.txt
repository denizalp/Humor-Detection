When anyone asks me what my favorite restaurant is in Toronto, the Black Hoof always makes the list.  It's probably one of the secret gems of Toronto that has stood the test of time and always a treat to go to.\n\nThis place is on Dundas street in between Little Italy and Little Portugal.  The challenge is that unless you have been there before, it's not the easiest thing to find; It's not like they have a giant neon sign hanging outside.\n\nSo I learned this the hard way, but vegetarians beware.  I had a birthday here once where one of my friends was a vegetarian.  The only thing usually on the menu that is vegetarian is the bread and the cheese.  Fortunately the staff here is really accommodating and made a \"off the menu\" pasta dish for him. \n\nAs for the rest of the carnivores\/omnivores, this place is heaven.  At first you'll notice that they don't really have very much space or tables.  You'll even find it funny how they use a standard coiled home oven range to do most of their cooking.  What you will notice though is a deli slicer, a cozy atmosphere and a pretty nice bar.\n\nAnother note about this place... No reservations.  This place usually get's pretty busy by 6:40ish so try and get there before.  The magic number for this place is 2, so if you have any more people than that, make sure you're getting there early.  We waited for 1.5 hours one time (but it was worth every minute).  \n\nNow onto the food.  One thing I really appreciate about this place is their ever changing menu.  While there's always a new flavour on the charcuterie platter, some new cheeses or some new dish or appetizer, they do seem to keep the favorites on the menu.  Take for example the raw horse sammy.\n\nAgain, it's hard to tell you what is good here cause the stuff changes so much.  I remember having pate laced with vanilla, foie gras moose, all kids of cured meats from pig, bison, duck you name it.  Seriously, if you go in here, CHARCUTERIE PLATTER.  It is probably one of the best experiences you'll ever have in life... but in your mouth.  I've had the procuitto there too and it's also amazing.\n\nDescribing the raw horse sammy to people is always a coin flip.  I mean, you're eating horse... raw.  As weird as it sounds, it's actually amazing.  The sandwich comprises of raw horse, topped with shallots and an egg to bind everything together in between two pieces of rye bread.  Top that with some \"hot sauce\" and you've got yourself an amazing sandwich.  Personally I get it every time; that's how good it is.\n\nAs for the non meat option, the cheese platter is actually also amazing.  The thing they do really well here is pair their cheeses with jams and sauces that complement them really really well.  This is again one of the things I order every time.\n\nEven though the magic number of this place is 2; I always tell people that ask me the best number to go here with is 4.  Why you may ask?  It's cause you'll get to try more of the dishes, and since the dishes are all sharable dishes, it just promotes that intimate group setting and the overall experience of the place.\n\nLong story short, I can't wait to go back to the Black Hoof.  Combine superior food, a great atmosphere and staff that's always willing to tell you what's going on and you've got yourself one of the best restaurants in Toronto.
