So I thought I would give this place a trial run since it is a women's only location and I have never been to a women's only fitness club...\n\nI don't think it really matters who you are in the gym with, so no big difference for me, isn't like I stare at the people next to me and hope they don't do the same to me.\n\nThere is alot of things going on at this gym, from different classes every night to different instructors, always something different to do and try! \n\nThe service is fairly well, everyone seemed friendly enough, not that I could really tell anyway from those fake smiles but... \n\nThe good thing is the no contract, so are you free to do as you may ..\n\nFor the most part it is a quiet place but with limited hours as it closes when the Superstore does since its located into the store, which is open until 11PM I believe\n\nPersonally I think I will stick with my regular gym, nothing above and beyond here to be found..
