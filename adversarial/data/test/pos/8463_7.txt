This is a good place to go if you are all by yourself and need to go out because you're tired of binge watching Netflix on your laptop and all the dudes on your OkCupid match list have bored your tits off. If you live in this city, they all look like variations of hipster Jesus and they are all somehow \"living life to its fullest.\" They have no time for your drama. Try messaging one of them, they won't message back, I promise. They are too busy handgliding in Thailand to care about your common interest in \"Sons of Anarchy.\" Slap that lap top lid down and start living IRL, bitches. That's my motto these days.\n\nCame here the other day at 5pm, I'm growing out the silvers around my temples so I'm not afraid of the early bird special. Sat down at the bar and had a Creemore and some dumplings and that Korean fried chicken, yum. But! I don't care about food at this point, it was all good and yes, reading the reviews next time I will order the steak tartare. Whatevs. My eyes were darting around the room which was filling up fast. It was a long winter, I am staaaarving. For peen, not fucking tapas, I've eaten enough over the last three months, I'm like a bear waking up from a grilled cheese\/Netflix coma.\n\nSo this happened: At first I was the only one there, it was a Tuesday, so I was feeling a little weird but by 6 pm the place was packed with who else but the hipster Jesus dudes from the OkC scroll. Then he walked in. I was sitting at the corner of the bar, by this time the sun was setting in such a way that I was blinded and could only see his silhouette. I could tell he had that kind of tinge of ginge brown hair that i melt over and he was wearing a jean jacket, pushing the season like a real man. Honestly if I see another black parka, I will set it on fire. He took a seat at the end of the bar, and we were buffered by an unlikely couple where he was a young hybrid hipster geek with a sleeve tattoo who probably worked for an app developing company and she looked like a MILF-y-type middle-aged real estate agent with newscaster hair. IDK but I like seeing couples like that, it proves that people are out there mashing it up willy-nilly and it gives me faith in humanity. We all need to bone beyond our comfort zone, don't you think?\n\nAnyway, tinge of ginge dude and I lock eyes. And he is hot. I can't look too hard because I get embarrassed easily (I really do) but I pretend to look at my phone like all the urban zombies do these days. He doesn't have phone, which is refreshing. The music is super loud there, btw, so I can't hear what he orders. But his girlfriend (of course) arrives at some point and shimmies herself on the stool beside him. I order a second Creemore and some weird thing I forgot I ordered showed up but I couldn't even tell you what it was but had some potato skin on the bottom? Not sure but I think there was cheese and mushroom in it. Ate it, there was gravy too. It could have been poutine reinvented, genius in theory but meh in taste. But never mind that.\n\nEvery single time I looked over at him, he was staring at me. While his super hot model girlfriend nattered away, he seemed completely disinterested in her. I wonder if there is some kind of shift in the universe?  I tried not to stare back because I was palpitating and perspiring and preparing for my graceful exit. After I paid, I went to the washroom (nice, clean) and when I swung the door open, he was standing there. Everything froze, me, the door, him, and what seemed like an entire weekend in a cabin in the mountains (but was only a split second), he grabbed the door i was holding and smiling at me, he put his hand over my hand and I felt an electric charge go through my whole body. Or at least part-way. Yaaasss, bitches, I am fully awake.\n\nSo yeah, next time I will try the tartare. My teeth should be sharp soon enough.
