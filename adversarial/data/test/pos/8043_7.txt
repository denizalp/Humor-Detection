@FoodieBear and @katfishkh did me a solid by recommending this place after seeing me check-in on @Yelp at another Thai place (Archi's, decent in their own right).\n\nI have driven past this sorry looking, God-forsaken strip mall a few times over my many trips to Las Vegas and never once thought about stopping in.  As you drive by on Sahara it looks like sketch all the way.  Major sketch.  With graffiti on top.  From the back.  You see the back of the strip mall.  Not sketch from the back, that's gross.\n\nWhen you turn in it's not much better - people of Vegas, would you please patronize these poor businesses up in here?!\n\nBut once you enter Lotus of Siam you feel like a sprightly lotus blossom yourself.\n\nWell, you feel like you're on to something good.  And you are.\n\nI had the lunch buffet and it was very good.\n\nI'll be back to try the regular menu.\n\nAnd Thai hot.\n\nFire.
