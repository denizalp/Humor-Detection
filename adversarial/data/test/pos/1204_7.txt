Hawaii people!  Have your family and friends got their fill of Vegas beef jerky and bagel chips?  Well, then head to Popped and bring home some of the best gourmet popcorn there is.  \n\nI brought home the salt and vinegar, la famiglia (parmesan, garlic & onions finished with sweet basil), and chocolate tide (caramel base, dark chocolate & New Zealand sea salt) which is just 3 of their awesome 20 flavors.\n\nBe sure to check in on yelp to get 15% off your order! \n\nIf you visit their Eastern location, be sure to make a stop at Pink Box Doughnuts.  :D
