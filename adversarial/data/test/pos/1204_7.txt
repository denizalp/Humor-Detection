I saw The Lyons on Saturday. I've only been to the Cleveland Heights area for Cedar Lee movie theatre. There is a lot going on! The Dobama Theatre is across the street from the main library. Parking was easy, lots of options: behind the building, parking lot off to the side and on the street. The theatre was packed, only a couple seats open. I heard a summary of the 2013-2014 season plays, they sound amazing! I'll be going back.
