Coming back after a fun & indulgent weekend in Vegas, we hit the airport in time for an early dinner.  Running so late in town, we didn't have time to get something delish to-go & were left w\/ only airport offerings\n\nEnter 360 Gourmet Burrito\n\nSince the airport is going through a MAJOR rehaul, the Southwest Terminal is like a ghost town & literally 2 min after we exited the place at something ridiculous like 6pm, they closed.....guess everyone traveling on later flights will just have to go hungry b\/c there's NOTHING else around, unless you want a pretzel\n\nBF & I got the burrito w\/ spicy thai sauce & tofu - just a standard rice, beans & cheese burrito w\/ teeny cubes of tofu & a non-spicy, spicy sauce - in fact, I'd go so far to say it was bland.  \n\nOverall, the burrito was okay & it was filling but we weren't all that impressed - more like meh, okay..... & I was hating myself for trying something all fru-fru when I know I like my burritos to be the classic RBC.  But I always seem to get sucked into those \"gourmet\" menu items!  Darn it!\n\nNext time will stick to the basics & get the Rice, Beans, & Cheese\n\n'Cause, yeah, we'd probably go back if found in the same situation & not lucky enough to be flying out of the Virgin Terminal - where all the tasty fast food options are located
