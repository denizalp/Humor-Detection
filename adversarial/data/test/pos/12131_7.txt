Boy, am I glad I never waited the two hour wait while at the NYC location for this glorified chocolate milkshake with tons of whipped cream and shaved chocolate served in a sundae cup.  Well the wait wasn't bad at all in the LV location so we decided to go check it out.\n\nI really do not know how this place is getting all the 5 star reviews! The decor fit with pink and white ceilings and oversized lamps somewhat like a venue where you would host a little girl's princess themed birthday party.  We shared a $14 BLT and it had too much mayo but was still BLAND BLAND BLAND. Thumbs down. The \"highlight\" of the meal was their sweet potato fries tossed in a salt and sugar mix which was quite tasty even though it was pretty dry. \n\nExpensive and food is subpar. Sorry, but I'm gonna have to say skip it!
