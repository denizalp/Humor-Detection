I love love love IKEA. When I first moved to Vegas over 10 years ago, I ordered my furniture from IKEA's website because there was no IKEA in Vegas back then. Shipping was double the price of the stuff I bought but I was desperate.\n\nIKEA to me, is like Lego's for furniture. The fun and fulfillment come from building your furniture yourself that you can't get at any other furniture store. I can stay in the store forever. I enjoy looking at furniture, designs, fabrics and different materials.\n\nEverything is organized. You start on the main floor. Follow the arrows on the floor for proper flow of traffic. At every section, there are information cards, pencils and paper measuring \"tape\" to make your shopping experience better. You can write down the item number and where it's located in the warehouse on the info card. You can measure furniture and see if it fits your room according to your specs.\n\nBest part is nobody follows you around hungry for a commission. You walk around freely. Get ideas...and buy 4 shower curtains like me. I can be bored or sad and come here then, I leave feeling happy again. I helped a friend move and get new furniture from here. I got to assemble furniture...YUSSS!!!
