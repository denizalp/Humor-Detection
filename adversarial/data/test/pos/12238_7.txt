chickennnnnnnn.\nI ordered the sandwhich trio and it was delicious. Juicy and flavourful chicken. I was a newbie to this place so I didn't realize you could customize the sandwich, it was still really good!\nPotatoes were ok and the macaroni salad was great!\n\nI love the way this place smells when you walk through the door. ughguhgu so heavenly.\n\nGet you order to go because you can eat outside when it's pretty and warm.
