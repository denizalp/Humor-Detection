I have had Sushi in three different countries non of which are Japan. I love sushi and have long sought a rival to my favorite Sushi restaurant  Islands Sushi and PuPu bar inside the Crown Plaza San Diego. I am still searching; however Kanpai has come the closest in Arizona. \n\nIf you have the time GET THERE! if you dont have the time stop what you are doing and GET THERE!\n\nThe fish is fresh and the rolls actually have flavor. For the price the size of the rolls make RA look like preschool meals. Besides where else can you go in the valley and fit 30 of your closest friends inside your own private Karaoke room? \n\nThe way I see it is I have about 10 more rolls to explore then Ill move on to the actual cooked menu. Im hungry now, whos up for Sushi\n\nTo my beloved RA I would like to say\n\nYou meant nothing to me, I used you for a while and now it is time for me to move on. I found the one I like more than you. And yes you do look fat in those jeans.
