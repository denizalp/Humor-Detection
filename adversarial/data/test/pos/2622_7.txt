I absolutely love it when food tastes as good as it looks and Craftkitchen nailed it! I'm still dreaming about that short rib hash but the other dishes were really great too. The staff that I met there were all really wonderful and seemed like really great people that have such a love and passion for food. \n\nBeautiful delicious food and amazing people behind the food are just the perfect combination for me and really speak to my heart. \n\nKudos, Craftkitchen! I really can't wait to come back!
