\"So cute!\" That was my first impression of PB & J Time, and I'm not even really a big peanut butter fan! It has this vibe...some people have said 50's or whatever, but I really think it's just authenticity. They people there, the products they use, the way they greet everyone who comes through the door...it's just genuine. \nWe got the brown bag special (5 classic sandwiches for $11.99), a great deal and a really neat way to get and tray a bunch of different PB&Js. Of the 4 of us, we all pretty much had a favorite; mine was a tie for the Apple Jack- PB with think apple slices and honey I believe- or the Cookie delight. I think the BF's was the Elvis- PB and banana of course. We also tired one of the sushi, but I can't remember which one. It was good too, and there are a bunch of others I can't wait to try. They also have grilled cheese and a cereal bar. You really can't beat the prices either. most of the classic sandwiches are $3.50 or below and they are really neat combinations. A regular PB&J is like a buck! They also have white, chocolate and strawberry milk which I thought was a nice touch. Ice cream and floats kind of round out the menu. Of the group, we had both and both were great. \nSome people complain in the other reviews about store bought white bread or bagels, but I liked it. I hate when restaurants throw weird, fancy ingredients into a dish for 'wow' factor. It's a peanut butter and jelly joint, not a five star hotel restaurant. And honestly, if they tried using some fancy artisan bread, not only would it ruin the whole vibe, but a PB&J would cost like 7 bucks and then people would complain about that, so...go figure.
