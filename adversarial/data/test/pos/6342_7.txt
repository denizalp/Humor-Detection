520 (I love you) \n\nApparently certain combinations of numbers mean certain phrases, as I recently learned by reading the menu at 520. I really enjoyed their salmon sushi and their phili rolls are amazing. Not to mention their salmon rose rolls are also really good. The service was great, I never had to ask for a water refill because the staff was definitely on that. If you like deep fried things, I definitely recommend trying the \"butterfly cheese\". Overall a solid AYCE restaurant. Nothing overly spectacular but I would come here again for sure. \n\nNeedless to say my gf and I were talking in numbers the whole way home.  \"I 520 you baby\"   ;)   Fun place for a date.
