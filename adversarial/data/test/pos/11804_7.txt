2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge 64\/100\n\nCame here for 100% Kona Coffee! It's the only place in Vegas that serves it. 100% Kona Coffee is different from \"Kona Coffee\" -- if it doesn't say 100% then it's mixed with other coffee beans. It's also pricier than other types of coffee, and well worth the $5-6 a cup. \n\nAs I walked in, the owner saw my Hawai'i hat and joked they don't serve Hawai'i people. They from Ohio. Haha joking of course. You know they really from Hawai'i when they joke around and tease. I miss that. (Don't take it personal, it's Hawai'ian humor) \n\nMy first visit, I got the 100% Kona Coffee and a coconut macaroon. By 4pm on a Saturday they were out of the desserts I wanted to try. So freakin' bummed. \n\nCoconut Macaroon: \n I'm usually not a fan of this dessert, but I tried this one and it's delish. Baked well, not too sweet. Soft & chewy coconut center & toasted just right. Try it! \n\n100% Kona Coffee: \nI got mines black. Just how I like my coffee. It's strong, bold, not bitter. I have been off caffeine the past few weeks and this was well worth that caffeine kick! After a few minutes I began to sound like a Gilmore ;-). (Gilmore Girls reference) \n\nLoved this and will be back for it. It's the real deal 100% Kona Coffee. \n\nTheir 100% Kona Coffee is great, but the best 100% Kona Coffee I've had is from Sugai Kona Coffee on The Big Island. I'll have to ask where they get their Kona beans from next time I stop in.  \n\nI also tried their Cold Brew which was great as well, bold and strong. \n\nUbe\/Taro Flan Cake:\nThis past week, I tried a slice (custom order from OnoSweetz702) -- this was onolicious! The cake layers were soft, moist & flavorful. You can taste the taro and flan. Not too sweet. \n\nService was great. I didn't get to stay long. After I got my coffee I left. I took a sip when I got to my car and noticed it was lukewarm. I wondered, why isn't it hot? Walked back in and he heated it up for me and was super nice about it. Not sure what happened during the coffee making process. \n\nWill update when I try the other desserts! Aloha!
