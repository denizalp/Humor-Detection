I'm going two stars on this mainly because the bar service was the worst. It took 20 minutes before we got our drinks. No word of a lie, we had our appetizers before we had our first round of drinks. If you're going to charge people $16 per drink, make sure you can deliver it within a reasonable amount of time.\n\nOther than that, the food was excellent, the show was cool. I think we'd go back, but I'd make sure we were good and drunk first...cause this place obviously doesn't want to accommodate that.
