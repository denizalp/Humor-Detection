Horrible customer service I went in and sat down in the chair for my pedicure. I'm 29 years old so I know how to work a message chair as I'm doing the settings the woman doing my nails gets up and changes it, she says oh no this one. I said I just want the kneading on my Lower back so as I try to change it back the man next to her doing someone else's nails gets up and tries to change it again that's when I said I've got it I'm not going to break you chair I just want it on my lower back and he says this button does everything as I'm trying to explain to him I don't want everything the owner I'm assuming gets up from her chair in the far front doing another persons nails says no no no at that point I'm like ok I'm just going to go, she says yes you go, I don't know what happened or what it was about but they were all very rude and I felt like they were treating me like I was stupid I will never come back here.
