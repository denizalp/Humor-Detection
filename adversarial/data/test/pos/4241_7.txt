The Steelers game made me sad but thoughts of this food, and giving this positive review makes me happy! I saw some previous reviews about this place and decided to try it out myself. It is the heart if the Southside of Pittsburgh that is loco but always a great time. \nI was planning to eat there but it was so small, I preferred to do takeout instead. I ordered multiple items because one (chicken pot pie) I planned to eat later. \nI did order the infamous fish and chips and it was totally amazing. The fish was perfectly flaky and the chips (fries) were so good. I asked for tarter and ketchup but didnt use it because I didn't want to disrupt the flavor.\nThe Scottish egg was good as well.\nThe next day, I ate the chicken pot pie. It heated up well in my microwave and still tasted so good! \nThis is a great place to go to during lent or any other given time. I am already planning my next time to go and bring friends and I might eat in and grab a beer.
