The place is pretty HUGE. The decor is a little grungy looking...almost like the 70s type decoration. It felt like it was missing that big brown box tv that sits on the ground? They seated us quickly and the waitress was nice and attentive, continually walking around refilling wate and tea glasses.\n\nI ordered the Moo Goo Gai Pan, when the order finally came, becuase yes it was busy so it took awhile, but it was yummy! It was like chicken soup without the soup. A comfort chinese food when sick? I think so! I've been having this spicy craving lately, they didn't have much in that area, maybe one dish per meat option. :( But they did have pepper and chili flakes that I made use of. Just be aware that the chili flakes...when sprinkling, the fumes will attack. lol Lean back a bit when shaking that bad boy.\n\nMy coworker got the sweet and sour chicken, which I promptly ask for a bite, lol, yes I am that person. If you say no, thats okay but I will ask and definently offer a bite of mine. :) The pieces were HUGE, so I just cut one in half, because I did just want a taste. The fried batter was delicious, it reminded me of the fair food, all the fried goodness.\n\nMy other two coworkers got the special, Kung Pao Beef. It was a huge helping with a lot of sprouts, I mean a lot. They said it was perfectly spicy and crunchy. \n\nI saw people ordering the combination around us, and that will be something I will be trying. It came with a huge egg roll and I thought it would be like the other places I've been so I ordered one. No such luck. It was filled with cabbage and sprouts, thats it. It was good, but not great. \n\nWould I be back? If I have training again and craving chinese food? Sure. But there's Thai  closer and I loooove Thai, so we'll see. Total cost of tea, meal and egg roll: $13.13.
