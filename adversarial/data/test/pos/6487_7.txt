Oh Deli, you never seem to disappoint, last night you had 6.75 draft pitchers that were ice cold as well as the mention of $1 draft specials and $2 vodka u-call-it's, we never seem to leave with our pocketbooks hurting.\n\nThis place is the mecca of people watching, like characters from a steinbeck novel all sorts elbow up to the bar and settle in for a while, looking for something.\n\non fridays they have a DJ which plays everything from honky tonk girl to the cha cha slide, there was even some impromptu karaoke, \n\nat one point one of the patrons got rowdy and one of the bartenders and his friends quickly dispatched him and put him to the curb, though an old man almost got knocked over in the process.\n\nthey have a toaster over and on previous occasions we've ordered tombstone pizza's the glasses are always frosted, and there's even a popcorn machine in back. They even have a chilled shot machine which I've yet to partake of.\n\nThe Deli doesn't look like much from appearances, and when you're thinking about what to wear that night \"don't\" you're fine as you are.\nno one judges here.  It might quite possibly be one of my favorite bars, just because it has character. We never really plan on going to the deli, we just kind of end up there.\n\nP.S. if you ask the bartender you can play Wii on the Big Flatscreen in back.
