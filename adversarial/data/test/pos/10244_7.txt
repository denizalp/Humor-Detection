Open until 1am! Yay! Love that this ramen place is near us and away from Chinatown. I liked their ramen. I got the tonkotsu ramen and the flavor of the broth was very hearty and delicious. I liked that they include the bamboo in their ramen dish unlike some other ramen spots in Vegas. Whenever I've had ramen in Japan the bamboo shoots always came with. Also the chashu was very tender as well. I forgot to ask for an egg with my ramen though, didn't realize it didn't come with one. Oh well. \n\nService was excellent.  Happy hour drink specials were fun with the buy one, get one free beer and house sake special and the ramen was delish. First time here and definitely not my last.
