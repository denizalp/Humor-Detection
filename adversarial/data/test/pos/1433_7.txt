Lunch with a view! Location location location! you can not beat the relaxing views here of the Gray hawk golf course! We loved sitting bar side taking in the lush green landscape while enjoying our lunch. We had the quinoa salad and fried chicken sandwich and a couple of iced teas! Food was good, the view and ambiance even better.
