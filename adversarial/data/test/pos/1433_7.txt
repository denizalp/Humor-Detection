NEVER COME HERE!! Terrible. Worst experience at a Mexican restaurant ever. I mean the food was straight out of a can. No flavor. Tasted old and reheated. Service was horrible and the owner thinks all the customers are crazy if they don't like the food. I should have left when I heard 2 separate parties complaint about the food while we were waiting. TELL EVERYONE TO STAY AWAY!!
