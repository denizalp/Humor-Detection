This is the MOST AMAZING Indian restaurant I have been to in ages. No actually, it is the MOST AMAZING restaurant that I have been to all year. Every food item was DELICIOUS. I had the urge to lick not only my plate, but my friends as well. But, didn't want to get any unwanted looks so I tried to get every last bit with my spoon. I think I could live on this food for life. It's true, the price does come to about $25 per person - but folks, don't let that dissuade you from coming to Savera. Save that coffee money - and use it here. You will not be disappointed. I promise. \n\nFor appetizer: Aloo Tikki, potatoes topped with an orgasmic sauce. I don't know what is in it - and I don't care. It was the beginning to an amazing assortment of food. \n\nEntree: Okra Masala - OMG! The spices, the okra, the right amount of heat near toppled me off the seat!\n\nPaneer Makani - I could have swam in that dreamy gravy all night long. But, I saved it for my buttery naan instead. \n\nYum. Yum. Yum. \n\nYes, mam! You can count your Aunt Fannie that I will be back!!!
