I love going to this cafe for a quick bite to eat since it is so close to my work. Prices are really inexpensive, the food is not bad, and they are quick! \n\nI recently ordered two egg cheese sandwiches (one with bacon) and a small coffee: the price was only $9.09! It was a deal - and the sandwich was so good! As long as I work close by, I'll continue to be a customer.
