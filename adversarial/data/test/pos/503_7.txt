If you've been to the original Babystacks (nee Babycakes) off of Smoke Ranch, you know there's a price to pay for amazing gourmet pancakes: the wait can be upwards to an hour. But once you're seated, the food is delish, the service is stellar, and the clientele includes a lot of cute Islander boys.\n\nOK, maybe it's just me that noticed that.\n\nWell, Babystacks has a new location off of Stephanie in Henderson. The food is still delish, the service is still stellar, the Islander boys are still cute...\n\nAnd we walked right in. **gasp**\n\nI went off the pancake menu (finally) and gave their omelettes a try, opting for my beloved chili omelette. They boasted Hawaiian-style chili, which was even sweeter than a Chicago or Cincinnati chili, but still really good. I added a babystack of S'Mores pancakes. If i had one complaint about the place, it's that I thought adding a babystack of pancakes would get me 2 regular-sized pancakes. Instead, they're mini-pancakes.\n\nBoo your face. If I had known that, I would have stuck with the pancakes and tell the omelette, \"Excuse you, buster, do you know where you're at? I need pancakes and I need them right meow.\"\n\nBut I digress. That was the only downside to our experience. Elite Emily had the Adobo Fried Rice, which has been widely lauded elsewhere, and she enjoyed it, though she had the same reaction to her Red, White, and Blue babystack pancakes.\n\nOur server was great, and she kept us refilled with a big smile. The place feels new and clean -- a good thing since it just opened.\n\nI definitely will come back. Carrot cake pancakes, you're next on my hit list.
