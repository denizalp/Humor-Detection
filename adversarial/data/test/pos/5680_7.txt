Eeeeee. Long yet important message to follow!!\n\nIf I was blind and If this place gave me the ability to see again.... Eeeeeehhhh I still wouldn't go back.\n\nThe first time I went, a few years back it was good. Good food! Then got take out and yeah, just well cooked good food. Nothing to write home about but still good. \n\nThis time... Wild tiger turned into wild sloth. Arguably just as cool in animal comparison but the tiger could, if he so chose to, rip apart the sloth with vigor. \n\nThe hostess was hard to find and inattentive. Se really wasn't present or rememberable. We sat down and ordered. Waters came out. Then our app. It was some roll thingy. It tasted like frozen shrimp wrapped in rice paper for 9 bux. Oh oh oh it tasted like the rolls you get at the sushi place in Safeway. Yea no thanks. Plus the waiter seemed to disappear. A while later the food was delivered. Hhmm. Pad Thai you say? Uh nope! Well if you call over cooked noodles shoved under a huge pile of cabbage pad Thai the yeaaa.. I guess. \nCurry you say.... Hmmm nope just over spiced over cooked and tasteless except for the over spice thing.., which is just down right confusing. \n\nThe waiter never came back to check on us. My lady dropped her eating utensil on the ground and I went inside to get another. Standing at the empty hostess station looking around....looking....still looking....oh oh hey  hostess can I have a.. She cuts me off. \"I'll be back\" denied!!!! By the drive by host from a terminator movie. \nWell waiting still. Find someone. Utensils. Cool. Thanks. Sorry to be a bother as a paying customer.   \nThen I sit back down. Take a few bites and realize everything tastes the same. Cold, over cooked and over spiced. \nSo in effort to try to salvage this meal I try to ask for some limes. Guess what... Shocker..... It took me getting up to find someone. Cool got em. Cool, great, not real limes. Just little ones, like the ones you use for Mexican food!! Wtf!!! \n\nAnyways. Forcing it down cuz I'm sick of the search party of two game that they have thrust upon us, the waiter still never came back. The lady bussing the tables cleared our stuff except for the untouched pad Thai. We actually tipped the bus lady she was nice and a very hard worker.\n\nStill\nWait\nIng\n\nOh wait I forgot the rules of the game.... I got up to search for the check. Yeaaaa! At what point do I win? And really what could the prize be?   Oh nothing. I guess you could say I win by not ever having to go back there. \n\nSad really. Was a good place. I understand running a place like this has challenges but no care was shown from beginning to end about the customer experience. Oh well except for the bus lady she was cool.... Maybe she should own the place? Winning! \n\nAnd I'm out!
