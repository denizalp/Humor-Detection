Cake... Cake... Cake... Cake...\nHelpful Tip: Located behind Jack N The Box (closer to Decatur Blvd)\n\nMy favorite unfiltered dame and I checked into Gama to satisfy our sweet tooth after stalking their social media of course. We were remarkably indecisive with Gama's large selection of sweet treats but after a few rounds of paper, rock scissors we settled for the coconut cake, German chocolate cake, flan and chocolate mousse.\nGama's slices were generous and the coconut cake hands down was our favorite purchase. Sweet, moist, did I mention sweet! The German chocolate cake was equally great! My friend raved about the flan and how consistent the texture was. Regrettably, the chocolate mousse or lack their of requires immediate attention. The spongy-like gelatin substance was not edible $3.50.  \n\nI'm certain we'll be back soon! (Please offer bottled water for purchase!!!! Please please please!!!)
