Me and a sizeable group of yelpers descended upon this Riverdale sushi spot on a Sunday afternoon. It's a long space with heaps of seating and cute Japanese screens dividing booths. It's clean and very sleek.\n\nThe menu is a bit hard to understand. There were lunch specials, premium bento boxes, regular bento boxes, teriyaki, and so forth. I managed some spicy rolls and sushi. Our waitress (who was attentive and quick) brought over some complimentary appetizers including a delicious noodle soup, miso soup, and deep fried tofu.\n\nMy sushi was so-so. I liked the sushi but my rolls were soft in the middle. A huge turn-off. That said, from the strength of the appetizers and their expansive menu, I'm sure they have solid options here. Might just take some experimenting -- or culling the menu of subpar options.\n\nI would return.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: This BAR'S NONE too shabby.\n\nMenu Readability: A tonne of different typefaces, bold and italics thrown hither and thither, weird unaligned leaders, and too many colours. It's atrocious.\n\nNeed to mention: \"Brown rice available for extra dollars.\"\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: Brown costs more, baby.
