EASILY the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant.\n\nfirst we show up and there's a 30 minute wait, which is completely understandable on a Saturday in Cleveland. so we get some drinks at a bar next door and wait to be texted to come back for our table.\n\nonce we got seated, it took about 10 minutes for us to be greeted so we are off to a bad start already. when our server took our drink order, we asked about specials and she told us about some drink they had which had gin, st germain and green tea simple syrup, which sounded delicious so all 5 of us ordered that. after about 5 minutes she came back to the table to tell us that only 3 of us can have the drink.. so we were forced to decide who couldn't have the drink? which I wish I was one of the ones who wouldn't of gotten it because it was only about 5 ounces, and $12 for a semi-decent cocktail.\n\nnext, it's time to order (off the tiny happy hour menu which has MAYBE 12 items on it). one of the girls I was with ordered the hummus and they informed us that they haven't had hummus anymore but didn't change the menu? \n\nso the food arrives and she comes by to check on us and we are missing a side of pomme frites (fries) and she goes \"yeah that happens it takes them awhile to come up from the basement\". not a \"I'm sorry I'll go check on that for you\"\n\nlastly, one of us ordered a miller highlife and she goes \"OH highlife\" with a look of disgust on her face. then once she brings the highlife she asks if he wants a champagne flute for it... which after the terrible attitude we've received for the whole visit, this was icing on the cake.\n\nthe food was decent but over priced, service was semi ok but her attitude was terrible and I will never be back because of that negative experience.
