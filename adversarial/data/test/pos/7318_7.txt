This is my final review for 2012. So I thought it was fitting to review Fed Ex.\nThis location is great and Edward is a really nice guy. (He works there).\nI had to visit this location a few times during December, he always had a smile and was happy to help and answer questions. \nAt times he had a lot of people in there. All wanting and needing information, help, and packaging.\nHe was so laid back and helpful.\nEven thanked everyone for their Business.\nSo nice to go into a place like this. Plus, all our packages arrived safe and sound and in perfect condition.\nThey will take Check, cash, or credit as well.
