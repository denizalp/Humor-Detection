Hey Rudy L. Take you snobby sushi eating attitude somewhere else. So what it used to be a l&l and has no bar doesn't mean the food isn't good. FYI you need to reread your review before you actually save it. \n\nI've been to literally 20-30 sushi places around the valley some gross and some awesome and this place is close to awesome. Yes it's family owned and the daughter with a huge bun on top of her head is the waitress and the son and father make the sushi. But most of the time mom and pop shops are the best but in this case the son is the owner. \n\nMy favorite things to order are Tuna Karai, Arizona roll and surf and turf. the tuna Karai is a tuna salad with octopus and it's spicy but sooooo damn good. Sometimes I'll order 2 orders with some rice and make that as my meal. \n\nI've had a lot of other rolls to with friends and they are great. The big thing for me is presentation and the sushi looks great. Doesn't look sloppy, no big and small pieces, rice is tight and intact. The fish taste and smells very fresh. \n\nThey also have Korean tea. Which is basically barley tea it's very good, ask for it cold. \n\nAnytime I'm in the area I try to stop by and get my tuna Karai fix. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because they don't serve alcohol yet. \n\nKeyword is \"yet\" I talk to the owner Steve a lot when I'm there and he's already in the process of getting his liquor license which should be approved by may. Nothing like have some sushi and washing it down with some saki bombers.
