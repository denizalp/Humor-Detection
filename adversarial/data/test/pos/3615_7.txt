When I come to Vegas, my tastes change. I want to go to that pretentious club, dress scantily, and drink the good stuff. This place met all my nightclub desires. \n\n* Beautiful layout, spilling into the vast pool area \n* Awesome periodic trance\/techno\/house music on the dance floor \n* Droves of Asian eye candy \n* Huge cabanas and poolside couches available for table service \n* Poolside gaming and full bar \n* Plenty of free seating in the pool area along benches.\n* A hot tub for my tired feet \n* A drinking fountain (This is very important. Usually you have to pay for bottled water in Vegas nightclubs, but because we were at the pool, they have them.)\n\nI agree with other Yelpers on the extremely crowded bars. It made me want to double fist drinks because of the long waits. \n\nBest people watching moment: when the Asian girl's pump sandal fell off her foot into the hot tub and she fell in trying to retrieve it. Very amusing! \n\nThe only downside was the confusing, long line winding around several hallways. I got there 15 minutes before it even opened and there was a line. A really, really, really long line. Luckily, I only waited an hour and a half to get in. Geez. However, in being part of the \"early\" crowd, once I got in, it was easy access to the dance floor and bars. At about 1AM, I couldn't move around anymore. There must have been 8000 people at the club.\n\nFor me, this was the biggest party I've ever been to. Despite the long lines, I loved it and can't wait to go back. \n\nTip for girls: Buy passes ahead of time on Ebay. Save $$$! Sorry guys, you have to pay full price.
