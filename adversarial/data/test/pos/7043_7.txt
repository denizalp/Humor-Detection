There are two times every year when Las Vegas Blvd shuts down to vehicular traffic. The first time is New Years Eve, when you can be sexy while teetering in sky high heels. The second is during the Rock 'n' Roll Marathon, when you can be sexy while huffing and puffing in running shoes. \n\nI signed up for the 1\/2 marathon this year, and this was my first time running with the crowds rather than catering to them in the hotel at work at. Since The Great Marathon Disaster of 2011, it looks like this shindig has shaped up for the better. The registration, expo, and actual event process all went smoothly for me with no hiccups and since the course was flat, there were no surprise hills or valleys to throw me off my pace, which is also great for first-time racers like myself.\n\nAs much as I enjoyed the event, I did have a few gripes in the lack of respect for the road from both runners and spectators. Runners would stop to walk abruptly and either in the middle of the road, or on the left. Folks, remember freeway etiquette and move to the right if you're going to slow up traffic. There were also tourists who thought that crossing the street in the middle of the marathon would be the most appropriate time of all. This is a huge no no and a safety hazard for both parties involved.\n\nThinking about running the full, 1\/2, or half of the half next year? Here are a few tips -\n+ Register early. Man, marathons are where the money's at! The sooner you commit to the mileage, the cheaper it'll be.\n+ Attend the expo to pick up your bib & gear on Friday; the mass of out-of-towners come on Saturday.\n+ Stick to your assigned corral. The whole point of having corrals is so we don't all run at the same time. But I guess some people didn't get that. \n+ Study the course map in advance and set up a designated reunion point with friends and family - after the race is over, you're on your own, baby. \n+ Take care of your body before, during, and after the race. You have your usual suspects: drink water, get enough rest, train in advance, etc. but don't forget to massage your muscles post-run too! \n+ ENJOY! When else can you run up Las Vegas Blvd without the fear of being hit by a car!?
