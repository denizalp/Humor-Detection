My A\/C broke down on a 112*F day.\nI called Wahl and they sent a technician; he was very nice, went on the roof, checked\nthe unit, and came back to say that it might be fixed, but I should consider replacing it\nwith a new one. He said, you know, I can fix it now, it will probably be 600 bucks, then in a month you'll need to fix it again, pay about the same price, and it will just be like that until it's completely dead. I said, okay, I'll meet with your sales guy.\nThe technician was kind enough to go back on the roof, to see if he could make it work \nfor at least few days, till I get the new unit. Sadly, he couldn't.\nHe charged me $70, company policy, he said, and left feeling sorry for me.\nAnd so I waited in my own private hell for the salesman to come.\nWhen he did, he too went on the roof, spent some time there, came back down, and said, sorry, it's dead. Then he showed me 3 units I could choose from, ranging from \nabout 5,000 to  about 6,000 bucks. \nI said, I can't afford this, but thank you and I will let you know if and when I can.\nAnd then I called another company, Ocean Breeze Air. A technician came, climbed up the roof, came back within about an hour and turned the A\/C on; it's working!\nI'm back to life again! The bill was for about $200. He said, who did you have up there? \nThey really messed things up. \n\nWell, I only had Wahl up there.\n\nJust in case my unit dies on me for real, I asked for a quote for a new unit; apparently I can get  the same one Wahl's salesman showed me for $2,000 less. \nSo, I must wonder: Doesn't Wahl have enough work that they try to sell me a unit in\nan inflated price? Or are they just not that good? Hmmm.\n\nHey Wahl, you owe me 70 bucks; yeah, you!
