Great grocery store near the Worldmark timeshare resort! We stopped by to grab drinks and snacks and were happy that we were paying way less than what we would have on the strip.\n\nThis is a Kroeger chain so if you have a Ralph's card (I'm from San Diego and we have Ralph's in San Diego) then you'll be able to give them a phone number for the club price.\n\nPlenty of parking and the store is generally clean.\n\nI highly recommend!
