I am really rooting for these guys. We went for dinner. And we were the only ones there for dinner. But it was a Tuesday and the weather has been less than desirable this winter. \n\nThe menu looks great - I found it in the lobby of my building. Ordered the Veggie Cakes and they were seriously delicious. The whole plate was. I would get it again but I would explore the menu a bit more first. My other half got a burger and up-charged to fries vs the house chips it normally comes with. They were served with a malt vinegar aioli that he could have chugged out of the bottle (aka amazing).\n\nGrowing pains to point out. I think the up-charge for fries - $3 - may be high. The menu says it's for the hangover fries. Misprint. That up-charge would be $7. Or server was nice an told us of the faux pas. Miller Lite is spelled wrong both on the menu and on the website. And their dipping sauces should be portioned with the container. We both got half or what should be in the given container. Just my personal condiment opinion.\n\nTheir happy hour looks great and so do the variety of other food choices. I'll be back and wishing them the best of luck!
