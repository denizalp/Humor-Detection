Great coffee shop\/cafe!! \n\nThis is a nice cozy place to chill at and sip on some coffee and grab some bites in the Summerlin area. The ambiance is awesome with it's decor and atmosphere, and there was a guy playing live music when I came by here. \n\nI decided to try the *Nutella Latte* and it was one of a kind! The design on top is cute like icing on the cake, but the flavors were divinely good.. espresso was strong and the nutella sweetness was perfect. For food I tried their *Caprese Sandwich* and it was tasty on baguette bread! The service here was fine on my recent visit. \n\nSAMBALATTE TORREFAZIONE is the cutest place to enjoy a cup of joe solo or with good company.~ :)
