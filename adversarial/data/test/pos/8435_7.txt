Chuck E Cheese for retirees.  Don't take offense if you are a retiree because I am getting pretty close to that myself, I just thought that the crowd would be much younger. I was astounded at the sheer volume that place does on a weekend as the place was huge, people were packed in like sardines, I felt like I was at a KISS concert.\n\nWe had the kids with us and so no alcohol consumtion was possible....that might have helped.  Once we found a seat with aisleways that were not large enough to sit down without getting up every five seconds to let someone through, I had a chance to look around and was impressed with the building, which is the organ. Very cool ,thats why the two  stars.  Past the organ and the show, the place was a tad annoying starting with the fact that they only took cash and checks chiseled on stone tablets like the flintstones. I got in the long line to buy the pizza with the one check my honey gave me and then found out that to order drinks, I needed to get cash out of the ATM in order to get in a second long line to buy drinks.\n\nFood was edible...not good, not the worst. Price was actually not bad, but keep in mind we did not drink.  I think next time I will just get some Totinos Party Pizzas, tune in the Lawrence Welk show and sit 6 people at a card table and the effect will be similar.\n\nI would go back for the organ during the summer, on a week day, when they first open. I think if the crowd was smaller it would still be a cool place to take the kids.
