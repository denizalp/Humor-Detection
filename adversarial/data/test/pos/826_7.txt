Originally set to go some place else, my aunt and company wound up here due to driving miscommunications LOL. Had I known they wanted Pho, I could've checked Yelp and laid options on the table. When I got the text of the meeting place I immediately looked it up and was flabbergasted when I saw the low 2.5 stars. Oh well, I vowed to be more adventurous this year didn't I?\n\nWhen I got there it was packed! Hmmm so maybe this place isn't so bad after all? My family had already ordered and was half way thru their meal when I sat down, they said the service was really fast so they waited to put in my order until I got there so my food wouldn't get cold. So why the 2 star review? \n\nI first ordered egg rolls, it was delivered less than 5 minutes I kid you not. Wooah that was lightning fast! It was hot, crisp and a little well done. Standard egg roll taste, it did its job. I opted to get the rare beef pho for myself and the grilled pork chop for my son. The pork chop had great taste but it could've used a couple more minutes on the grill, very little charring or burnt edges which I like. That was the extent of my favorable experience as immediately after that everything went downhill. They took at least 30 minutes to finally deliver my soup, we've had to ask them several times. We knew it either had to be forgotten or missed cause my aunt said they got their soup delivered within 10 minutes. The Thai tea took about 5 or 6 requests before it got to my hands and the vegetables for the Pho was another mishap. Now I do understand things could be skipped cause it was seriously a mad house in there but no one could give an explanation on what was happening and definitely no apologies were offered. All they kept telling us was \"it's coming\" yet everyone around me that came after was already served. \n\nAll in all the food wasn't bad, honestly I expected worst due to the low ratings but I don't see myself coming back at all. There are so many great Pho places in town, why would you settle for less. There's just way too much things going on here that most times things get missed or forgotten. Just by observing the employees, it didn't look like they had a system in place, it was pure chaos. Also, we were informed by a family member how nasty the bathroom was, I didn't want to imagine how the kitchen must be, away from the scrutinizing eyes of the patrons *shudders*
