I've been to this establishment twice.  The first time we did not have a reservation.  We bellied up to the bar and waited, and waited and waited...eventually a table opened.  I had no complaints that night.  The food was lovely as was the atmosphere.\n\nFast forward to tonight.  We had a 5:30 reservation for a birthday celebration.  At 7:09 we were told that we needed to leave as the table was spoken for.  Now granted we were winding down anyways, but A) this was a terrible business practice and B) yes the table was spoken for, BY US.  They knew we were celebrating a birthday and did bring out a very lovely birthday surprise for the birthday girl.  But for 60 bucks a plate I do not expect to be rushed out the door.\n\nSo now that we've gotten the service outta the way - onto the food, this is a restaurant after all.  Well, my meal of tenderloin tips was super salty but still pleasant.  The dessert (key lime pie) was really good.  My dining companions had the special - a prime rib\/ shrimp combo.  They said the shrimp scampi was really good, but they've had better prime rib.\n\nI'm just flummoxed, why would Beef and Bottle risk alienating customers?  I sure as heck won't be back.  Oh and I got sick from my meal - not sure if it was me or them, but after being rushed out the door I'm gonna say it was them!  I will not be back.
