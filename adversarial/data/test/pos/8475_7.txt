We enjoyed a nice Valentine's dinner at Chart House before heading across the tracks to The Smith Center. I chose this place because of its proximity to our show and because the girlfriend used to eat at the Portland location all the time. I guess it's tough to top a view of the Willamette, but the gargantuan aquarium that anchors the Vegas spot is a sweet feature. We were at the end of the tank and with the way the glass curved, watching the fish sometimes felt like a 3D movie.\n\nWe started our evening with a couple of cocktails. I had their version of a Bold Manhattan. The girlfriend had the Downtowner. The Manhattan was enjoyable but very sweet. I preferred the Downtowner (and indeed ordered my own).\n\nAs for food, we thought everything we ate was great. We shared the Roasted Beet Salad to begin our meal. The fact that they split it up onto two plates was a nice touch. Not quite as spectacular as we've had before, but excellent nonetheless. For the main course, I ordered the Bronzed Swordfish while the girlfriend chose the Tour de Shrimp. We accompanied that with their Asian Green Beans and Gorgonzola Risotto. Everything was well-cooked and well-seasoned. No complaints whatsoever. And the plentiful leftovers were just as delicious the next day.\n\nEver since I saw Superman II as a kid, I always wanted to eat a soufflé but just never got around to it I guess. So it was a must that we tried their Chart House Soufflé. It was much too sweet for me, though the server did warn us about that. Luckily, the Grand Marnier Crème Anglaise complemented it perfectly. You're supposed to choose a sauce, but the server allowed us to have all three on the side. The raspberry had a nice tartness to it that also helped break up the sweetness of the soufflé.\n\nA note on parking: It seems like you now need to stay at the hotel or dine at one of their restaurants in order to get validated.
