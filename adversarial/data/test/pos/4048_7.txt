A ten dollar gift certificate arrives in the mail from SLT.\nIn print fashioned for a person of advancing years, a notice at the bottom reads; \n                \n                NO PURCHASE NECESSARY\n\nLoad up the car baby, we're headed to Sur La Table!\n\nWe spent 92 dollars after receiving our unwarranted ten dollar prize, however, the event did yield a cathartic moment.\n\nI now know the pride one (wife) feels when sashaying about, in an all-too-obvious proud-shopper moment, explaining how she saved ten dollars today.\n\nI totally get it now.\nThanks Sur La Table.\nOr not?
