I've been back to Hikari at least five more times since my first visit.  The reason for the lowering of the stars was what happens after I leave Hikari!  Yes, everyone in my party had multiple visits to the restroom by the time we got home.  Sure, it's probably because we eat A LOT of the uni, ikura, and oysters on the half shell, but still!  \n\nWe still enjoy Hikari for the most part and will probably continue to go, we just have to be careful every now and then, that's all!\n\nThese usually make up our menu: \n* Uni\n* Ikura \n* Oysters on the Half Shell\n* Shrimp Fried Rice\n* Baked Mussels\n* Yam Yam Roll with Scallop\n* Hamachi sashimi\n* Super White Tuna sashimi\n* Sake sashimi\n* Agedashi Tofu\n* Soft Shell Crab appetizer\n* Amaebi sashimi with deep-fried heads\n* Salmon Skin hand roll\n* Fried Oysters\n\nSashimi cut has always been an issue.  Sure, they don't pretty it up on a plate or anything, but rather just toss it onto a plate.  And sometimes the cuts can be pretty bad where you can't even chew the fish up.  Then again, it can depend on who is cutting up your fish.  \n\nService has been better.  On one of the last times we went, the sushi chefs were rushing us to order, but we were still waiting for a friend.  (And there was no one waiting for our seats.)  And when we were ready to order, they were either watching TV or spacing out.  Orders were forgotten and had to repeated.  It was just slacking that night on their part.
