I had been following this new business ever since I read about it in the newspaper so I decided to try it out. It is an off shoot of \"or the Whale\" in downtown Pittsburgh. The restaurant is set on two levels both with bars on each level.\n\nUpon entry you will see the vast array of the freshest oysters picked imported from New England and the Atlantic seaboard. Since I arrived shortly after opening I could sit anywhere so I took a small table in the back. \n\nThe lunch menu is small but can be pricey. You can opt for appetizers, salad and chowder pairings or just salads alone. Sandwiches come with kettle cooked chips. I knew that ice tea wasn't on the menu so I had a chance to inquire about that. I was told that they really didn't have enough space for one at the time being but soft drinks are available if you prefer not to go with an alcoholic beverage.\n\nI decided to go with the crab filled grilled swiss cheese and drank water. All of their water servers are in a glass shape of a fish. I got my sandwich panini styled. It wasn't too big but there was lots of cheese in it. I had to look twice to make sure the crab meat was in it and sure enough it was. The manager told me they do use a lot of genuine crab meat in this sandwich. I must admit it was different. Never had crab meat this way but it was indeed very filling and good. My sandwich and chips came to $12.00. A bit high but remember you are paying for the crab meat.\n\nThey have a gender neutral restroom which has a light sensor in it. Be aware of that in case you think there was a momentary power loss. My only pet peeve was that there was no purse hook. Again I told the manager about this and she told me that I could lay it on a table nearby. Unfortunately that table she was referring to already had things on it and I didn't want to disturb it. She will see about getting a hook for handbags.\n\nThis place has great potential and would like to see them add more items to the menu. I'm not an oyster fan per se but to include more seafood items on the menu would help it along with some more reasonable prices for the lunch time crowd. The restaurant is conveniently located at the corner of 41st and Butler St. Paid metered lot is close by if you are unable to find street parking.
