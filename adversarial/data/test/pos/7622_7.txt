After reading mixed reviews for Moxie, I was a bit hesitant.  However, I figured I could just try it out and review it for myself.\n\nI arrived half an hour early for my appointment.  I was immediately greeted by a friendly receptionist, who offered me a beverage.  While I sat down on a contemporary sofa sipping my chai tea from a white, clean porcelain teacup, my eyes scanned the salon.  Very stylish, modern, very clean...good sign.  Time flew by quick because next thing I know, my stylist came to greet me.  She was so friendly and her hair looked great...another good sign.  I came in w\/nothing in mind so I took her recommendation.  Then I walked over to the shampoo area where another person (very stylish as well) conditioned my hair.  He was super friendly and gave me a heads up that he will be using cold water since the treatment calls for it.  I liked the fact that they have good communication skills.\n\nAfter that, Ama started cutting my hair.  Constantly, others would sweep the chopped hair away to ensure that the area is clean.  She even showed me how to achieve a beach wavy look if I don't feel like wearing it straight.  I really liked how it looked on me.  Was very effortless for a nice look.\n\nAlthough she said that it will only take me 20 mins to do, I think that's 20 mins longer to get ready for work.  I would probably use this technique for special events or something.  Regardless, it was awesome of Ama to take her time and teach me how to get a new look with mousse and a curling iron.  She is very knowledgeable and helpful.  I would definitely come back to Ama.\n\nOverall, this is one of the best salon experience that I had, from the moment I walked into the salon, until I stepped out.
