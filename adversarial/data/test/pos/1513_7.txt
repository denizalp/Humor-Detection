The tomfoolery has to stop. \n  \nCitizen Public House is just a bar in the guise of a restaurant.. And because it's Scottsdale, everything has a price tag  that hovers 30% above where it should be. Does anyone but me notice this problem?\n\nIf nothing else, the noise level at CPH is unacceptable. The reverberation of the diner's voices in the space is deafening. I was there on a Saturday night and I had to raise my voice just to have a conversation with one of my dining companions sitting right next to me.  The acoustics of the building are particularly bad and no one, especially the owner has done a thing to absorb the sounds by softening the surfaces. Does he even notice?\nMy drink was tasty (The end of the world)  but not really worth $12 for five tablespoons of liquid. I get it though. Mixed drinks = high profit margin.\n\nOur chopped salad was a tasty combo of ingredients. I did enjoy this salad.\n\nI wasn't super hungry so instead of ordering another starter (our waiter said the tuna crudo was very small) I got the hippie dippie sandwich. What a disaster. The greasiest fries ever. The chunks of eggplant were only partially cooked. Too much mayonnaise - and why mayonnaise? In 'n out burger does better grilled onions and fries than CPH.  Such an unpleasant sandwich. Had it not been so busy, I might  have marched into the kitchen and demanded that the chef explain how this is acceptable, quality food in an expensive restaurant.  \n\nThe young waiter was obviously overwhelmed and far too obsequious. The other diners had scallops which looked tasty but I couldn't hear their opinions due to the din in the dining space. $30 for three scallops? Some bars parading as restaurants will hopefully have enough reviews like this for them to sit up and take notice. A bigger menu is not better.\nI won't ever eat here again. But honestly the responsibility was mine to send back food that is poorly made. We as diners must demand more from restaurants.
