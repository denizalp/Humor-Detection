Blossom was one of the restaurants in Aria that I had never been to even though I had read very positive reviews of the restaurant.  I had a ticket to see Zarkana so I went last night and ordered from the early dining menu which is a prix fixe 4 course meal.\n\nI started with the corn egg drop soup.  It was standard fare.  Very tasty and a good starter.  Next came crisp fried beef roll with enoki mushroom and Mandarin brown sauce.  The rolls had a crisp exterior and very good tasting, moist beef inside.  The brown sauce was flavorful.  The main course has a choice option and I went with the beef tenderloin with portabella mushroom.  The beef was coated with black pepper and there was a small amount of black pepper sauce with the meat.  Accompanying the meat were stir fried bok choy and rice.  The meat was so very tender it could almost be cut with a fork only.  For dessert, there were two mochi--red bean and green tea.\n\nService was superb!  The servers knew I had a 7 PM show.  Since the restaurant opens at 5:30, time is an issue.  The courses were brought out in a timely manner with enough time between so not to feel rushed yet never was I tapping my foot nor looking at my watch.  They know what they're doing!\n\nMy server, Kenny, was very polite and pleasant.  The restaurant is quite elegant.  It was relatively quiet with modern music playing at a low, background volume which would be conducive to conversation.\n\nI have to return and order Ã  la carte when I can try some of the very interesting things on the menu.
