Not worth it.  Very high priced.  Everything costs more at Aurora Farms and it takes you 45 minutes to an hour to get there.  Most of the crap the stores have in them are last year's fashions. The return policies are very, very bad and the parking is not convenient. You are far better off just going shopping near your home where you will find the exact same items for less. \n\nI have to say that Prime Outlets has done a good job of marketing the place.  They really make many people that go there think it is a good place. I mean just look at the reviews. The reviews are not accurate -- so please beware.\n\nI have been going to Aurora Farms since 1980.  Back in the 80's it was an enormous flea market. It was one of the best flea markets anywhere.  It had several barns and a auction house and acres of outdoor flea market. There used to be a real Amish restaurant there.\n\nThen someone got the idea to commercialize the place and put designer outlets.  A couple of the barns were kept for a short while and they continued the flea market and the auction house but eventually phased the stuff out and put more outlets. They ruined Aurora Farms.
