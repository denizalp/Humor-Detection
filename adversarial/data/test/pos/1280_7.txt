2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     50\/100\n\nStopped here while at Meadows Mall yesterday (a Saturday) and picked up mini chocolate chip cookies for my dad. I tried a piece and it was chewier and softer this time. Which I enjoyed. Service was great and quick. Will be back again. \n\nTIP: check out the specials they have.
