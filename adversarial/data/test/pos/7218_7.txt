I love Chicken and Waffles... it disappoints me that more places do not have this delicious and magnificent item on their menu.  I guess that is why I like places just like this.  \n\nAfter living in Cleveland for a while, I finally discovered Mr Wonderful's.  Thankfully, it was not too far from me either.  The place is YUMMY.  Their sweet Jesus glaze is to die for.  They actually will substitute tenders if you ask too (I believe there was a small upcharge but it was well worth it).  \n\nEven though the food is super duper great, and I have never been disappointed with food or service when I am there, I cannot give it 5 stars.  Why one may ask?  It is because I often would beat the staff there.... they never opened when they were supposed to.
