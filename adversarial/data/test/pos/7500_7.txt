I really liked my stay at SLS.  It seems others gave it mixed reviews, but I liked it.\n\nSo, I was in town for a convention...if you must know, it was KBIS.  Last time I was \"conventioning\", I stayed at The Platinum - BORING!  This time, I decided to try something new and SLS was it.\n\nHere are the highs:\n\nI liked the vibe of the place - it's a casino resort with restaurants, bars and shops - all wrapped up in a kinda trendy-cool, but not over-the-top crazy decor.  Fun.\n\nNice food selection.  I ate at Cleo - loved it (I'll do a separate review).  Umami Burger, Beer Garden & Sports Book for lunch was good.  There were a few other places that looked interesting - for the size of the place, SLS has several solid food choices.\n\nMy room was quite comfortable - no issue with size.  Again, I liked the funky decor - much more fun than several other places I've stayed in Vegas.  Loved the ultra fast elevators up\/down to the 5th floor.\n\nPretty close to the Convention Center - I walked back to the SLS on a sunny day (~20 minutes).\n\nStaff was overall pretty friendly - bell hops were excellent.\n\nLows?  Nothing too low, but worth noting:\n\nEarly morning noise from the street (I faced the street with the monorail).  Not horrible, but not super quiet.\n\nFar away from the Strip - not mileage-wise, but far enough that I spent $20 and 1\/2 hour in traffic via cab to meet friends at Caesars.  Don't stay at SLS if you plan to spend lots of time on The Strip - traffic sucks in Vegas.  BTW, I didn't try the monorail - it just seemed counter-intuitive to walk to public transit with a beer in my hand.\n\nAt check-in, the line was a mile long and they didn't have all the front desk stations open to accommodate the crush of conventioneers.\n\nSmoke present - disliked, but at least it wasn't overwhelming.\n\nBottom line:\n\nI enjoyed a drink at Monkey Bar, coffee at The Perq, dinner at Cleo and lunch at Umami Burger.  My wife lost $100 on slots, but had fun doing so.  My stay was 2-nights of decent sleep in a nice room - it worked out well.\n\n4 stars
