This was our first and likely our last time eating here. The shrimp cocktail was okay but you can't really scree that up. The caprese...the basil was good.\nThe pasta was cooked okay, the sauce was okay, the chicken was terrible in both our entrees. I am pretty sure it was either microwaved or frozen when the cooked it.\nWe probably won't go back.
