This Denny's kept me alive my first two years at Case....but after eating here weekly (or more like nightly during finals week), and then leaving the meal plan behind, I swore off Denny's for good. \n\n2 years later and I was craving some Denny's, or \"The Den\" as it has been rebranded. I was pleasantly surprised to see some major menu changes. Unfortunately, food was no where near as good as it looked\/sounded. I should've known better and just let Denny's live in my fond memories.\n\nOverall, if you need some late-night, cheap, and greasy food to fuel your studying, Denny's is still you best choice. Unfortunately, all the other students are thinking the same thing, and it can take a decent amount of time to get your food.
