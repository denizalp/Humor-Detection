Shaka!\nIf I could give a 10 star review for this Dutch Bros., I would! \nWe are out of towners, from L.A. and were driving past when this tiny coffee spot caught my eye. \nDrive in was 8 cars deep but we went for it even though we had a game to catch.\nSo glad we did...\nCoffee, espresso and service were killer! Seriously, if the world could adopt the tude of the people working here we'd be a happy,  happy world.\nThey asked if we had a stamp card and we told them we didn't need one as we were just visiting. They gave us a stamped up (free) card and said come back before we leave town. \nThat is exactly what we did except they said that our entire coffee order was on them and to keep the (free) card for another visit. \nI've written 100's of Yelp reviews and the service and product from these guys at Dutch Bros. is hands down in the top 2!\nGet yourself a Dutch Bros. Or you are seriously missing out!
