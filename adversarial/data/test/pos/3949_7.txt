I had no idea who Frank Lloyd Wright was until we drove past this place and my BF started freaking out. He had just spent 3 days shopping with me so I couldn't deny him the chance to go visit. \n\nThe tours weren't expensive since they were so long (I think 90 minutes?) but there was no option for a shorter, cheaper tour so we ended up passing. \n\nI ended up falling in love with a lot of his art and almost went home with the overpriced coloring book until I realized I would rather use the $10 to get another pair of shoes.
