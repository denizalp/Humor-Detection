You bet your ass Albion gets a 5 star yelp rating.   Why?\n\n1 star for the fact that its so damn clean.\n\n1 star for the portions, holy shit huge.\n\n1 star for the price, for real 3 dollars for the small chicken plate that's not small at all.  You'll probably regret ordering the 5$ medium and only eating half.\n\n1 star for the friendly service, they're really nice to me!  \n\n1 star for the fact that I can't find anything wrong with the place.  Everything is fresh, tastes good, I never wait too long and if I do it's for a pizza that's more than worth it.  \n\nIf you're feeling shawarma or pizza there is no reason to go anywhere else.   On tuesdays 2 slices and a pop is $2.50, what is it 1973?
