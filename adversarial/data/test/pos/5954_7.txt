I blame Dear Daniel for this...\n\nI was innocently looking for Lobster ME at the Miracle Mile Shops, when Dear Daniel insisted on getting a beverage at Fat Tuesday. \n\nHe encouraged me to select a cup. The options were tumblers, football shaped cups, steins with and without handles, tall flasks, etc.  I chose a mug with a tapered bottom, so I could put it in the car's cup holder. It also had a straw and a handle.\n\nDear Daniel knew exactly which combination of beverages to get: half Cat 5 (151 rum and tropical juices) and half Strawberry slush.  It was sweet and fruity with a tad bitter aftertaste. \n\nService at this takeout counter was friendly and efficient. The experience was fun and we will be returning because we get a discount on refills when we bring back reusable mug!
