Possibly the best place in the world to purchase a Rolex, but keep in mind I have only been privy to this single purchase, which means I can't be considered an expert. However, I do know a couple of thing: 1. You will not find another \"Rolex\" store anywhere in the States. Yes, you'll find plenty of spots that sell Rolexes, but the store at Wynn is dedicated to the brand, carries over 1000 options and will be expanding soon to carry even more and at that point, have an in-house Rolex certified watch handyman. (I am sure that is not the right title.) 2. Service at the Wynn is generally top notch, and that is definitely the case here. We went in to help my mom-in-law purchase a new watch, and she found a model that we hadn't seen anywhere else. The service included all the bells and whistles, and when the watch was delivered to West Virginia, it was polished to perfection and set to exact Eastern Standard time. Watch lovers beware; it's a true candy store of time.
