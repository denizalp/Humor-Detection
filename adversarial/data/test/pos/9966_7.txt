I have been coming to this store for many ,many years now. \nIt is open 24 hours a day. I know that for sure, once I had to get my girlfriend pantyhose for work @3:30 am.\nIt has a Pharmacy,with a drive thru. Which I still find odd for Drive in drugs. \nBut,I guess it is good if you have sick children in the car.\nIt has a really good selection on everything, you can even buy food here.\nCleaning supplie, laundry products,etc.\n\nThey have a great little photo dept. as well you can get photos developed as well as reprints and movies, even copies of photos that are 30 years old.\nWhat more could you want?\nThey have great sales all the time, every week and the have a CVS reward card, let me tell you this card is well worth the time it takes to use it.\nLots of savings here for sure.\nThere are 2 ways to get into the parking lot here as well. One from Rural and the other from Southern. Nice big parking lot. \nWith a few Pan handlers of course.
