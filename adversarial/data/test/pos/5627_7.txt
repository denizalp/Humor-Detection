I really like the lady that waxes me. But the girl at the front desk is rude and doesn't relay messages. Its the pierced black lady. She's  rude and doesn't relay messages. I called three times to speak to my girl. To set a appointment. She never told her to call me. Then I called again later in the day and she said my girl was gone. I asked did you give her the message to call me. Their was just dead silence. So I said I guess you didn't relay the message. Still nothing. Then she said I'll try to call her on her cell. Still no call back.
