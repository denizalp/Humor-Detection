I would rather die than go back to St Rose. From the one ER doctor that told me \"hyperemesis gravidarum isn't even a thing,\" back in February 2016 to the admitting doctor this past December who didn't want to include me in my own treatment plan (as is my right) and sent me home with pain medications I couldn't take as a nursing mother (I made it clear I was nursing and needed medication safe for breastfeeding). Trying to deal with the billing department is a different kind of hell. I had multiple representatives tell me and my husband one thing regarding billing and financial assistance then this morning a supervisor said that was not the policy. \n\nSo if you want bad medical care and to be sent to collections while being told you won't be sent to collections then St Rose San Martin is the place for you.\nToo bad since the nurses there have been exemplary.
