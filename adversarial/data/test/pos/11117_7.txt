My first introduction to OneZo was in Waterloo this past July. I visited that location on the final day of its soft opening and spent an hour lining up to place my order. I look back and shake my head. Then again, I was on vacation and had nothing better to do but give the store's tea a go. I'm glad that I did.\n\nThis OneZo store is a five-minute drive from my home. I frequent this area often. My usual Starbucks, Popeyes, and Pizza Hut hangouts are here. I now have a potential fourth.\n\nThis store is roughly three times as large as the store in Waterloo. I didn't have to wait an hour. I walked in at nearly 8 pm on a Thursday night to cheerful staff.\n\nI ordered the dirty sugar oolong tea. It comes in a medium size only. You don't get to customize the amount of sugar or milk. The homemade tapioca is included. You can only adjust the ice. I went with 25% ice.\n\nSadly, they were out of oolong tea. I went with black instead. It's a good thing that I like tea. I had green and regular as remaining options.\n\nThis store is clean and minimalistic in design. Like the store in Waterloo, i got to play a plinko-like game as I waited for my beverage. \n\nThe price of my drink, with tax, came up to $6.77. It's not cheap. However, considering that one of my students highly recommended this drink today, I had to give it a shot. I can still hear her say, \"Mary, it is the best. I highly recommend it. It's so good!\"\n\nShe's right. It's good. I like that you see all the tapioca, milk, and tea layers when you get your sealed drink. It's fun shaking it up. Stab your straw and enjoy. It's sweet, but not overly sweet. It says volumes, as I tend to take my tea black.\n\nThe homemade tapioca is delightful. It's soft and chewy. It's perfect and highly enjoyable.\n\nI would come here once or twice a month to get my fix. Otherwise, I would be broke. There are plenty of places to sit and relax. I ended up bringing my beverage home, but it's nice to have options.\n\n(376)
