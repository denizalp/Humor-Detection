Originally reviewed in 2012. So many bad reviews they changed their Yelp page by claiming to move location. Here's my original review: \n\nRude sales clerks. They don't even acknowledge you. It's one thing to leave a customer to their browsing after saying hello and checking to see if they have questions, it's another to avoid eye contact and act like the customer is not even there. I stopped by thinking the place carried only couture or designer clothing ... it's more like a church garage sale. Overpriced, as well. Employees definitely have an inflated sense of importance. You're still working retail, people.
