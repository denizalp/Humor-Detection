Dr. Phan is my go to dentist. I had a 10 year old crown replaced about six months ago and I do not have any complaints. Initially I was very apprehensive because my previous dental work in Texas was horrible and I was very scared of going through the whole process again. Dr. Phan explained every single step and reassured me everything was going to be ok. Sure enough everything went great and I felt silly I was so nervous. Dr. Phan made the crown in office, she takes pride in her work and wanted the crown to look and fit perfectly. Overall, I am very pleased with her work and the crown looks amazing (you would not even know I have a crown)!!
