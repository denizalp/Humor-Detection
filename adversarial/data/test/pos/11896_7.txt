Bad Daddy's Burger Bar is a small chain located in Colorado, North Carolina, and South Carolina; approximately 23 locations as of June 2017.  According to their website, they first opened in 2007 in Charlotte, NC with a passion for hamburgers!  This particular location was located in the Charlotte International Airport in Concourse C, Gate 4.  \n\nI tried their Breakfast Burger (basic burger topped with ham, fried egg, bacon, and American cheese); burger patty ordered medium.  YUM!  \n\nTip:  Give yourself at least an hour before your flight departure.  The burger took about 30 minutes to make.  \n\nENJOY!!
