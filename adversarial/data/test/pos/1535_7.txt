I kept walking past this place on college thinking that I needed to drop in, and so far I've been three times and the food is really good. \n\nThe fried chicken sandwich, the lox and bagel, and the caprese all surpassed my expectations. Kind of pricey but so worth it!\n\nThe only thing that sucks is parking around this area, it's almost all meter parking. \n\nIf you're around asu or going to a game this place is definitely worth checking out. Oh! They also have beer on tap that I have yet to try.
