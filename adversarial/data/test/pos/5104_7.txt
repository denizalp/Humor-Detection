Staff here can be considered rude and snotty.... Went here for a late night meal. Their menu is unreadable and after having indicated what toppings I wanted on my sandwich - my toppings were still wrong and loaded with MAYO after having said 3 times No mayo. Their system does not seem to ensure that toppings are added as the sandwich is being prepared. When I called back after getting home - I was told by some guy Raza that it was 4:30 in the morning. Hello you are open for business and you just took over 20 bucks from me for 2 sandwiches. If u taking folks money in the name of providing a service make sure service rendered is what was asked for.
