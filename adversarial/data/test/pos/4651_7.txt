Wow, why haven't I kicked it at the Golden Nugget before? My mom opted to play some slots here because she had won before. They offer complimentary valet, so you know I hit that up! \n\nWith this hotel being as old as it is, the hotel lobby area is not that big. But as soon as you walk in you are greeted by the outdoor pool and \"The Tank\" full of fish and shark! They actually have a water slide that goes thru The Tank, it's super cool! As for the pool area, it's pretty big,  it looks like it can fill up fast especially with the blazing heat outside. \n\nThe actually casino floor is not that big. You have the usual suspects of card games, high roller rooms slots and more! The cigarette smoke is apparent but not as bad as sunset station. \n\nWe ended up having dinner at Claim Jumper. This restaurant is open 24\/7 and there was no wait for a party of 3 the day before July 4th. Yay! \n\nCool thing 'bout this hotel is that it's along the famous Fremont St. of Downtown Las Vegas! It seems that they are really revamping downtown so it's nice how this hotel is directly connected to all the downtown fun!
