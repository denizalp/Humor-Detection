My neighbor's dog could give me a better reading than this chick. What a waste of money! It was the worst reading I have ever had. I'm open minded and generally want to believe that some people can connect to the divine. This woman seemed more interested in getting her money from me and running off to drink with her friends. I had to feed her all names and information which she still got wrong. Totally disappointed. There should be some type of law or code of ethics for people that do this type of \"work\" for a living.
