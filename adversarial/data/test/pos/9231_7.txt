I'm sorry but this place is a freaking joke. The only reason they have good reviews is because they push their customers to put a good review for them to get extra cash. My husband pawned my laptop and we only needed to do it for like 4 days. He gave me the slip so I can go get it. Well when I went to go get it out after the 4 days as promised they denied me. I had the slip and everything. The girl at the counter first off was eating hot cheetos licking her damn fingers after I gave her my slip. (Unprofessional) then she noticed it was my husband's name on the slip and said sorry but he needs to be the one here to get it out. I said to her that we are married and our last names are the same....her excuse was that she didn't know if we really were and she just couldn't.\n\n\nAt this point I'm pissed because not only do I have the pawn slip but I'm paying them for the amount requested with the finance charge.\n\nI called my husband told him the situation and he said ask if they can call him on the number he left when he pawned it. I asked, and that little girl went and got another guy to come and ask me \"how can I help you\" really?!??! I'm sure your hot cheeto eating counter girl already told you.....anyways I told him...look...we need to get this laptop out and my husband said you can call him on the number he left as a contact number. He said sorry but unless you have a notarized letter from him there is nothing I can do.....I advised him that my husband would change his good review and all he said was....unfortunately that's out of my control.....we haven't had to pawn anything in 5 years!!! And for us to get this bad of an experience thank GOD we don't have to again and if we did believe me we will never do it again from here. The area in itself is scetchy so maybe I see why they are so quick to judge. The hot cheeto girl at the counter had the nerve to basically assume I'm lying when I told her the person who pawned my laptop is my husband, all she said was she didn't know if that is even true. I don't know what kind of people they deal with but honestly if your desperate for money just go somewhere else. If people find my review funny or non appreciated then please do yelp a favor and delete your yelp account or Google account for that matter.
