Intrigue is quite the modern upgrade from the days of Tryst. You can really tell that they spent top dollar on making this joint a fantastic nightspot for us folks to enjoy. They succeeded, this place is chic, hip and cool all the way into the wee hours of the night. It's slightly smaller then XS but has a similar yet more intimate feel to it. Overall, if the DJ is right, you may see me coming through Intrigue more often then not... \n\nLegit-\nNice remodel\nChic and modern \nFriendly staff \nGreat table service \nGood acoustics \nWaterfall brings out the ambiance \nGreat location (within Wynn)\n\nMeh-\nCrowded \nA bit small VIP area \nDJ lineup could be better
