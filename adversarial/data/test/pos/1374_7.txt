This is the second Jiffy Lube we've been at today trying to find something \"jiffy\" about this place. We tried this one after they said there was a 30 min wait with one car ahead of us. All we need is a top up because our oil is low even though the oil was changed within the past month. They said we still had to wait in line even though there are at least 3 guys working.\nThe guy couldn't find our license plate in the system because he couldn't tell the difference between a New Mexico and Nevada license plate...then he said our oil level was at the top even though we had checked it at home and it was low...like we would come to wait here if we weren't sure our oil was low. So my husband had to show him how to properly check the oil. Seriously, they are not to sharpest tools in the shed. Plus, while we were waiting a client came in to complain about how his truck has been leaking since he had it serviced with them.
