So after reading the rave reviews of how good the food and service Metro Diners are known for throughout the U.S, I was curious to see what was all the fuss about this chain. Honestly, it's just a step up from Denny's. Their menu items offered here is better, ambiance is nicer, but that's just about it.\n\nCame here couple times over the past few months, hoping I'd find something I can be excited about and tried different dishes each time. Nothing memorable to me, well, except pass on the grits here, the texture and taste are off. trust me.\n\nMr B loves their Monte Cristo. I had liked it too. But that last visit, it was heavy on the grease. The jam that it's served with was good too. I assumed it was made from scratch from what I read. But when I asked our server for more, she looked and pointed to the packaged jellies on our table and said just open those, they're the same thing. Okaay.\n\nService is friendly. Nothing more or less. It was on point when the servers had their trainers hovering over them. Last two visits, got seated right away, but it took more than five minutes for a server to acknowledge our existence. Plus they were forgetful. \n\nAnd whoever was the lead giving their employees evaluations, should use a little more discretion. Like do not do the employee evals at the boothes with patrons within earshot. Real tacky.  Employee got rated 3 cause she \"needs to smile more\"... which may be true, but how about how unprofessional evaluator was? I didn't need to hear that. \n\nMetro Diner still on the list to visit, just not as enthusiastic as others are.
