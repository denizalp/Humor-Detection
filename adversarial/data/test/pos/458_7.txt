If I could give 0 stars I would. \n\nI drove out of my way to go to Herbal Wellness Center to get a gram of shatter. Got a gram of the Super Lemon Haze Shatter. \n\nGot it home and it is nothing but a sappy fucking mess. I was told it was shatter. It is sap. Apparently, HWC does not know or care about the difference and are cool making their customers keep it by not making an exchange or some other credit or way to compensate for this. \n\nI was told to \"put it in the freezer\". Yeah, I'll do that when I'm out camping. What a joke. \n\nI told them very nicely that if they wouldn't see their way clear to make it right then I would never return as a customer. \n\nTHEY COULD CARE LESS. Truth. Beware. \nThey keep the shit all shrouded and secret except for the \"stuntcock\" grams sitting behind glass. \nWhatever is in the actual bag that you leave with is a big fat mystery, until you get home that is. Then it's too late for a return. Great strategy for HWC.\n\nBut hey, enjoy it while you can guys. I hope that the owner is reading this. If you are, know that selling product like this, is bullshit. Also know that your days of not having any competition and being some of the only game in town are numbered as fuck. \n\nI am going to go out of my way to let everyone I know that will listen that this is what they can expect from HWC.. and I know you don't know me, but that's a whole lotta mofos. \n\nSo, good luck staying in a profitable business while you can. You are a PR joke.\n\nupdate: spoke with the manager. he tried to tell me that \"once shatter leaves their pristine environment, it will automatically become sap\" which is 100%. Total. Bullshit. \nalso, if this is the case, how does everyone else get nice snappy shatter?? answer: because they're doing it right. \nthe super lemon haze has a funny taste on the way out.. like \"fake\" or something that was fucked up the first time around and they distilled it and added terps later. also.. every dab snap\/crackle\/pops.. this means that there is moisture content still left in the slab. no bueno. \nlast, i'm left with this fucked of piece of sapped up ? in my fridge because, according to HWC's management, it's the \"only way\" - wow okay how about 10 wtf's with some \"i call bullshit\" mixed in on top. \n\nNew Lows.
