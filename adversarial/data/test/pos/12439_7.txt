I recently bought an old Giant from the 80s and have been into Pro Cyclery a handful of times for repair inquiries, parts and tools, and various purchases. The bike itself is outdated and not in the best condition, but my guy and I are working to get it roadworthy.\n\nStaff at PC have been helpful and professional. The tool I needed to remove the bottom bracket is not one they stock, but they were great about referring us to another place in town and spoke well about their competition, which is classy. Previous experience picking up and dropping off for a spoke repair was quick and easy. \n\nSelection of bikes and accessories in store is on the higher-end side but they do have sales and in store events. I really appreciate that they don't use a hard-sell approach here and are straightforward and cognizant of budget restrictions- my wheels would have been $30 each to true, and it made far more sense to just replace the tires and make spoke adjustments given the age of the bike. Will be back here as needed!\n\nTIP: Ask for Penny, she really makes a trip here a treat! ;)
