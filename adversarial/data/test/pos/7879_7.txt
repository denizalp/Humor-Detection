I've been here three times on three separate occasions.\n\nThe first time I was with my parents and two friends for my 21st birthday. The second time I brought a huge bachelorette party of 10+ girls. The last time I was and will ever go there was just with my boyfriend for a romantic dinner.\n\nEach time I've been, the service has been unfriendly, impersonal and slow. Having worked at an upscale restaurant before, I'm really surprised they operate this way on a regular basis. I feel their lack of service is pretty offensive to their high-paying customers. Doesn't matter if you're here on a weekend (the first two times I came here), in the middle of the week (the last time I was here), with a big group or just one other person. The service was consistently bad under every imaginable circumstance.\n\nThe sushi isn't great. During my last dining experience, the rice was actually undercooked in a rainbow roll I ordered-- for three times the price I'd normally pay, a crunchy rainbow roll was not what I was expecting. I also ordered albacore nigiri. It was so small and plain-- not even any garnish. Very sad looking. For the money, I was extremely disappointed. The only dish I did and have consistently enjoyed each time was their crunchy spicy tuna appetizer.\n\nThe desert-- the lava cake-- was underwhelming in flavor. The waiter didn't ask us how our food was or anything about our experience. Maybe they figure you're a tourist and won't be back? Not an attitude I'd think a place like this would adopt. The atmosphere is nice... but thus is the case with a lot of restaurants in Vegas, on the strip. As I recall from the first two times I was there, the drinks are nice-- but again, who has trouble finding a nice drink in Vegas? I wanted some great sushi and a nice dinner with good service in an upscale restaurant! I just couldn't find that here.\n\nI always tip well, but I won't return. After our meal, my boyfriend turned to me and said \"Let's not come back here again\"\n\nI definitely agreed. Enough is enough-- three strikes and you're out!
