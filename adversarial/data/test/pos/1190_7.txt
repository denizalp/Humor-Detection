I was fortunate enough to try Mary's Hash House on my last trip to Las Vegas. \n\nI wanted both duck hash and corned beef hash for breakfast. The waitress was nice enough to give me duck hash & corned beef hash combo. \n\nDuck hash & corned beef hash: served with choice of two eggs, home fries & toast, both duck and corned beef hash were delicious. The duck hash was slightly crispy. I don't know the price of the combo, but corned beef hash is $9.50 and duck hash is $14.25. \n\nFresh brewed coffee ($2.50): you have a choice of either bold roast or medium roast. The coffee was not bad. \n\nI loved the mismatched plate and mugs at the restaurant. \n\nDon't forget to try their jelly samples!! They have apple butter, apple jalape√±o, watermelon, strawberry and grape. \n\nHash selections:\nCorned bef, chicken, ham, roast beef, lobster, turkey, roast lamb salmon, meatloaf, duck, and party (corned beef, ham, roast beef & chicken).\n\nThey also serve pancake, waffle, biscuit & gravy, fried chicken & waffle. \n\nOur waitress, Lily, was the best. This social butterfly is sweet, outgoing, quick, attentive, helpful and friendly. We asked for recommendations and she recommended both her favorites and most popular dishes. Thank you!\n\nWe even met the famous Mary. \nWho is Mary?\nMary, the owner of the restaurant, was on Chopped @ Food Network. \n\nMary's restaurant is a diner type restaurant that serves homemade, delicious food with a twist. It's almost like eating at your aunt's house. \n\n4 stars!! I am a fan!\n\nMary's Hash House is yummylicious!!
