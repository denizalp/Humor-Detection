BEST PIZZA in town!  Your tummy will thank you.\n\nCan I get a WOOT WOOT over here for AJ's pizza master?!  \n\nI know their secret too, home style loving!  Oh AND the fresh ingredients.\n\nSome coworkers went here for lunch today, and they brought back a large BBQ chicken specialty pizza with them.  The dough was thin but tasted just like hand tossed, very soft and crisped to perrrrrfection.  If you like hand tossed but trying to stay away from all the extra calories, you could go for this dough.  They sell fresh pizza dough also, so you can make your own at home with the same great taste.  This pizza was NOT greasy.  My BBQ lightly sauced slice melted in my mouth (as I chewed slowly savoring every bite) with every bite including sliced chicken, lots of fresh cheese and topped with vibrant green cilantro.  Oh yeah!\n\nSo, I've never fully stepped into this store, I was lucky enough to enjoy their goodness from afar, but I will soon go grab me my own pizza after this amazing experience.  \n\nYou should get up off your behind and head over there right now also.
