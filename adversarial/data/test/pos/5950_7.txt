Bloom Bakery gives me all the feels. Not only do they have an excellent artisan European bakery, but most awesomely...their goodies are prepared by those on the pathway out of poverty.\n\nYou can enter this surprisingly glamorous bakery right off Euclid Avenue or through the 200 Public Square building. This space is HUGE. With a small fireplace, bright colored walls and comfortable seating, you could easily spend hours cozied up in this bakery. I also love that all the tables have small sugar bowls and coffee accoutrements. It's a really nice touch.\n\nTheir standard of service alone deserves a million stars. I purchased a small glazed donut and key lime tart to go, and the staff was incredibly helpful. I came at an off time, yet they were still truly delighted to help me and strike a conversation, despite the bakery being a little picked over (good sign!). Their suggestions were spot-on, and the key lime tart was literal perfection. Can't wait to try this place again in the daytime, when the selection is a little more plentiful!
