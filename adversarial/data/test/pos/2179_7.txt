HOA is very strict!\nYou can be out after 10 pm... in the pool, at a ramada, pretty much anywhere. They charge you a $50 fine if you are in the pool or at a ramada after 10. They also charge you fines if you jump a wall. They close all the gates at 6-7 pm every night so you have to go the long way around if you live in the back. All condos are individually owned but \nNot good for people with physical disabilities all the floors have stairs.\nthere is surely some favoritism\/discrimination going on here as well.
