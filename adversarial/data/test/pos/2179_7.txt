I have been with OneGuard for 1.5 years and have been satisfied by the service.  I recently had a confusion with the plumber that came to repair our shower to replace the cartridge.  I took the issue forward to OneGuard and had Enoch help me with my incident.  He took my case and was helpful.  I was very satisfied with the outcome and would definitely recommend OneGuard to you all.
