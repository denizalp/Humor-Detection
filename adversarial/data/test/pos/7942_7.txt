I called this place one day to get an insurance quote next thing I know I get a bill from them saying I owe them fo rinsurance, even though I've never been to their office, never signed anything, never payed anything and never requested a policy. So of course I had to call again and find out what this was all about. They had the nerve to tell me I had a policy with them even though I only asked for a quote. I ignored their ridiculous demand for payment for a service I did not use , demand or pay for. I have Geico thank-you. Now after 5-6 months I am receiving letters from a collection agency trying to recover Mr. Orchards nearly $200 fee for giving me a quote.
