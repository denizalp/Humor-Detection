Busy bee, that's what I am... I just find it hard to find time to exercise and going to the gym just doesn't work for me. When I am fortunate enough to have that extra hour in a day to go for a walk, my boys and I like to come here. \n\nAmple parking, I've never had an issue finding space for my speed racer ;-). \n\nPeaceful....\n\nHuge grassy field for my boys to run around when I'm resting after my walk. \n\nI LOVE trees and they have beautiful trees here that kids can easily climb. Reminds me of the days when I was young, oh so long ago.... \n\nIt's always clean, I've never seen garbage here ever. Follow the path and you'll find benches to rest, a playground and tables with shade for people to bbq. The path I take goes all the way to Rampart but you can also follow a path to the right where you enter a tunnel. I've never taken this path so if you do, lmk where it leads hehe and just maybe I'll consider this path. \n\nAlso, enjoy the rabbits and squirrels!
