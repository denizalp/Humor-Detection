This place is awesome. \nGreat customer service\nGreat food\nGreat prices\n \nI had the 3 taco plate. $6.99 Chicken pork and green chili. Loaded up with cheese lettuce pico de gallo sour cream and cilantro. It may have been enough food for two, but I managed to scarf it down. Each of the meats have their own special seasonings and flavors. My favorite was the chicken. It seem to have a smoked flavor. The only downfall I can see is if you wait too long your tortilla will get soggy from the juices.
