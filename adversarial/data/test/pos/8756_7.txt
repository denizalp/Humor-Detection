My boyfriend and I were looking for a place to eat and since it was late at night, there weren't many options. We came during happy hour so we were sat in the lounge\/bar area. Not the quiet, romantic dinner I was looking for; the music was getting louder as the night went on. Our waiter was very friendly. I ordered a basic spaghetti with oil, garlic and mushrooms--it was the saltiest dish I have ever had. I could barely eat it there was so much salt. My boyfriend was unimpressed with his dish, he compared it to a can of ravioli. For this place being a $$$, very disappointed. Once we left, we wish we chose somewhere else.
