This is probably one of the best transaction I've done. Nice doing business with this guy, Ben. He is very easy to talk to and will really spend time with you explaining all the options based on your needs and style. Requesting for an appt is really a breeze. He went to my house the same day I called him. He communicated with me very well. Actually we became friends after the first meeting. I did went to at least 5 different company here in Vegas that provides window coverings but the price quote of Ben can't be beaten. He even gave me a discounted price from his first quote. The best part is he agreed for me to split the payment so I issued him a post dated check to be cleared after 30 days. These are just bonuses of what he can offer. The QUALITY of his work is just AMAZING. I call him \"My friend from the underground\" , THANK YOU VERY MUCH  for your services BEN HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
