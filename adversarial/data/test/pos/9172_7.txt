Valentines weekend with my Honey! It was a Saturday night after the big love holiday. I had a Living Social deal for dinner. Made a reservation at 8pm 2 weeks in advance and I was set. Parking in the garage on a Saturday night on 6th street pre event, symphony, theater, what have you.... slightly painful but not really an issue. The restaurant is inside a hotel. Did not know that. The decor is modern romantic, deep booths, dark browns, and violets. The booths take you back to an older era. Mob boss round booths have an intimate appeal. I had asked from my open table reservation to be placed out of the way but we were sat in the middle of the restaurant in an angled booth. It felt like I was on a center stage. \n\nThe menu was interesting but one item caught my eye. Lobster Cassoulet! They were sold out. Pouting I asked the waitress to reccomend something for me. Lobster Gnocchi?? Hmmm. Gnocchi can be kind of heavy and pasty but I went with it.\n\nSo incredibly delicious. Tiny puffs in a creamy mushroom and artichoke base sauce. Lots a lobster and perfect sweet claw meat right on top of the dish. If I would go back for just one item it would be The lobster gnocchi. \" Lobster Killer\" They have two sizes half and full portion. I was begrudgingly sharing with my BF so we got the full but I don't think the half would have been adequate.\n\nTo start we had the meat plate. The sauces were tasty that accompanied the various meats in the Charcuterie plate. The half size is plenty for two. The BF had mussels that were good and standard. If we did not have a deal the bill would have been on the expensive side and we didn't order anything alcoholic either.
