HATED it!  Took the kids with us to try it out as we live in the neighborhood; had never been to a Sandbar before. It was busy, turned out to be Ladies Night, so lots of tables of desperate guys looking for 'dates' among the heavily-perfumed 'ladies'.  We should've left, but at that point were famished, so we sat outside (the only table available). The kids liked the sand and the water feature. We, on the other hand, were truly disappointed.  If we were in our 20s, single, chain-smoked Camels (like the guy next to us) and wanted a night on the town, it maybe could work.  But as a local dinner place for a family, no way (not even at 5 PM).  Service was horrible; we ordered a $5 bucket of chips because we were so hungry, but our entrees came BEFORE the chips. It took at least ten minutes to get our drinks.  My husband got a draft beer; I got a bottle, with no glass.  We asked for a glass, from both our ditzy server and the harried busboys; said glass never came. The food was passable to decent.  Hubbie had tacos; I had fish tacos, which had more sauce than fish and tasted a bit mayonaisse-y.  The high point was when the kids dipped their legs in the water; and I liked the colorful chairs on the patio. Other than that, we will most likely never go back--which is a shame, as we like to eat out, frequently, in our Desert Ridge neighborhood.
