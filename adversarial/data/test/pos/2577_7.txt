We were walking into the restaurant as 2 customers walked out and one told us \"DON'T EVEN BOTHER.\" We didn't listen to the advice.\nThe meal consists of tasteless grocery store hotdog with coleslaw, barbecue sauce and fries. The server asked if we want extra coleslaw, we found out why...\nIt's because the hotdog is so tasteless you need extra coleslaw to add to the taste. \nThe fries are OK.
