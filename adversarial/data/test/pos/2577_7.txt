Had to make an emergency stop here for bandages and triple antibiotics + snacks. The displays are very well organized. Janice and Holly provided wonderful customer service. They were so sweet, courteous, and articulate. They personally showed us where the items were. I felt that these ladies really love their job and take pride in it just through the way they genuinely treat their customers. Come here and you will appreciate how genuine and smooth their service is. It's rare to find such great customer service providers nowadays.
