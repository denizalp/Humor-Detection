I don't know what I was expecting... I thought this would be a nice place for a nice breakfast... I was expecting frills... and boy was I disappoitned! My mom had breakfast there with a friend at the downtown location and loved it. So when we were on a shopping excursion to scottsdale this was the natural place to go for breakster. \n\nWe entered the CRAZY busy resturant that was all hustle and bustle... I was excited. We sat down and pour ourselves some water and ordered our food. We laughed at the silly egg-centric western themed paintings and waited for our food. \n\nWhen it arrived it was a bit of a let down. The eggs benedict were mushy. I wish the english muffin was toasted more and the hollandaise was luke warm at best and became cold before I was done with my meal. It didn't help that the skillet they served it in was ice cold! I would have preferred it on a warm plate. The country potatos aren't anything great - but they aren't anything terrible eaither.  My mom loved her sun devils egg scramble with bell pepers and onions. \n\nEverything really reminded me of Denny's and Ihop. Nothing was substantial, other than the rudeness of my fellow diners. One woman sat and picked at her teeth with her bare hands! Mouth WIDE open and everything!! Another man came in without shoes!! not even flip flops! WTF?! I thought this was Scottsdale?! The hell?!\n\nTo my fellow yelpers: it's nothing great, save your money and your time and try somewhere else.
