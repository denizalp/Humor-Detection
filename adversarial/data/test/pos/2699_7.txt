Brian, Brenden, Brittany, Vicky and Kenny are wonderful.  Two more guys are, but I can't remember their names!  Sorry.  Brian and Brenden remember what you drink and usually eat.  They all have great recommendations and Brenden told me to order the Poke w\/o red onion and it is now my absolute FAV!  I like true opinions and they are all great.  I hate to see some of them leaving to pursue their dreams, but am happy to have met them and wish them true success always.  A+ personalities are what keep me coming back.  \n\nIf it wasn't for them, I'd give one less star because now that I'm in love w\/ a few new items, they are going to change the menu!!  Why?  I love the orange garlic edamame!
