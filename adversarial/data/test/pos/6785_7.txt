My first impression is that Chas Roberts gives a mixed bag of service. I purchased a new home a year ago and have had many issues with the AC blowing too hard in one room, barely at all in another and some service issues with the downstairs unit. They have been to my house no less than 5 times in the year. The first guy to rebalance the air was clueless and a supervisor came out the second time to fix the issue. The downstairs unit stopped working early on in my home owning experience and the repairman indicated it was a bad coil. He serviced what he could and said he would be back when the part arrived. He installed it and the unit worked for several months. Two months ago it went out again and a service man came out - but when he showed up it was working and he didn't fix anything. My one year warranty ran out and the AC stopped working again. \n\nThe repairman that arrived today gave me a window of 3pm - 5 pm. He actually beat me to the house and I arrived at 3:03. He asked what the issue was; I explained it and he looked over the unit. 10 minutes later he came back and said I was finished. He indicated the problem was that the fan was not properly reinstalled when the coil was replaced months ago. Since he deemed it their fault, there was no charge for the service visit and repair. Many places would have charged at least the $65 for the service visit, but he did not. Very cool (literally!) in my book!
