Queensland's hidden gem, CPU has always been a reliable place for a single slice pizza or a full pizza order. The shop is very minimal. Every time I come here I feel like a character off Spike Lee's \"Do the Right Thing\" but instead of racial tensions the guys at CPU always greet me with \"what can I do for you today my friend?\". \n\nNo fancy dining room or waiting service. Just a counter\/till for you to place your order. They offer several sizes pizza and do not bother with the listing various combinations with appropriate names like \"Mediterranean pizza\" or \"meatlovers\". Just look at the list of available toppings and make your own pizza of madness. I always order a thin crust with all the various kinds of cheese (including feta and goat) with peppers. I call this \"Buzz's revenge\" (RE: Home Alone)\n\nMy only criticism is that sometimes when I buy their single slices I get a derelict piece that has been left out for hours. But if I am willing to wait, they will usually make me a fresh piece with no arguments or hassle whatsoever.
