Hippie zealots, earth energy mongers, mineral collectors or (like myself) fossil freaks will be in heaven here.  You know you have passed by this place before and seen the tall giant geodes with amethysts before.  If you ever stop inside you just may find a little geologist in you.  The decorative stones and gems can be found in all shapes and sizes.  Perfect for bead work or hemp jewelry makers.  I love the fossil shapes and furnishings.  Things such as a black granite sink carved out of fossil rich stone.  paper weights and desk objects abound.  There are worldly crafts and also the largest crystal sphere in the world is here too.  You just have to ask and the staff will take you to it in the back.  I mean we're talking Indiana Jones in the Temple of Doom large!  Kids will have a blast and adults alike.
