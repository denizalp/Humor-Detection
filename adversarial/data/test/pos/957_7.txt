I don't understand how this place has four stars. Maybe it's because 6 of the five star reviews are from people with only one review (Buzz BBQ) and zero friends. \n\nI've had a Restaurant.com coupon for Buzz BBQ for quite a while, so my boyfriend and I finally decided to try it out. We had pretty high expectations since the place has a solid 4 stars. The last time we went out for BBQ, we went to Lucille's and I guess I was expecting it to be comparable to that, but I was very wrong.\n\nUpon entering, we noticed that had a 2 for $20 deal, which was a better deal than what we would get with our Restaurant.com coupon, so we went with that instead. You get to choose 3 meats, 2 sides, and 2 desserts. We got the rib tips, beef brisket, chicken, mac n cheese, and corn on the cob. There wasn't an actual menu for the 2 for $20 deal, so the lady just told us what we could pick and she failed to mention that the dessert was included. We were under the assumption that the dessert was an extra cost because she asked us, \"Did you guys want any dessert or anything?\" Why would she ask us that rather than tell us to pick which dessert we wanted? I later found out that the dessert comes with the meal, which was pretty annoying because I would've wanted dessert to rid my taste buds of all the horrible flavors. \n\nEvery meat we ordered was extremely dry and extremely smoked. If it wasn't for the different textures, I wouldn't be able to tell which meat was which because it all just tasted the same (very smoked). I pretty much had to drown everything in the sauces which tasted like gourmet ketchup.The sides were both bland, so those didn't even help. I don't even understand how they made the mac n cheese flavorless, but they pulled it off. This was the first time we didn't finish a 2 for $20 meal together and it wasn't because of the portion size. We only ate half of everything and we didn't even want the leftovers.  \n\nI can honestly say that I will not be coming back here again. I left this place feeling like my mouth was used as an ashtray. You know how smokey and gross your hair gets when you walk through the casinos? Well that's how my mouth felt after eating here. The only good thing about my experience is that I was able to get a refund from Restaurant.com after telling them about my experience.
