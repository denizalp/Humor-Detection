Marc was great! He came to my place and took a ton of notes. Though my little 4 legged friend is quite laid back and easy, Marc still made sure to get a solid sense of her personality and needs. I got a text and video every time Marc came by and when he left. I also appreciated how Marc checked the place to make sure my little one didn't leave me any unexpected \"gifts.\" My little one seemed quite happy and well adjusted upon my return. I definately recommend  Marc and his services!
