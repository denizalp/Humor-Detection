I have been putting off cleaning my apartment since my folks left after xmas. No, there were no decorations up or a tree, I am not that bad. But it needed some good old fashioned spring\/winter\/whatever season clean. But ever since I moved to Phoenix\/Tempe, I have had a horrible time finding a good house cleaning service. I need one that works with my odd work hours (3rd shift manager) and that can come on Sundays (one of my days off). Plus I hate scheduling things over the phone. So what was I suppose to do? Give up and leave with it? Maybe...but NO! because I stumbled across a Homejoy coupon. Signed up and made an appointment. \n\nSunday rolls around and Donna shows up. And she is a real trooper, the first words out of her mouth were not \"oh man\" \"or this might take awhile\" or \"this is a mess\" (actually phrases from other clearners not from Homejoy) but Donna said \"Where should I start\" and in 3hrs my apartment looked brand freaking new. I was amazed. I told her I would be definitly asking for her again and signing up for plan. But I had already done that! So now once a month, I will get my apartment cleaned. Cant wait. \n\nSo if you have read this far and havnt signed up. Please do. This is an amazing company that I am really happy to find. They fit all my crazy needs and the UI on their website is super easy and super clean (pun intended)
