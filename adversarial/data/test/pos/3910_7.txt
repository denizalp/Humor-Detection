The garlic knots and calzones on display looked good but the slice I received was completely unappetizing- $6 veggie slice wasn't even as good as a generic frozen pie and was taken directly out of a warmer and slapped on a paper plate. They could at least reheat to order, but in addition to being lukewarm, this slice looked visibly old. The crust was thick and flavorless like cardboard in the middle and crispy shards like a tostada on the edges. I liked that the sauce was slightly spicy but the pizza was not good.
