I'd give this place 0 stars if I could.  I play pool leagues here and it is as hole in the wall as hole in the wall gets.  Really really super small.  In an awful neighborhood.  The other pool team was nice but that is about it.  Unless you want to see one eyed jack and get stabbed in the parking lot go somewhere else cause this places gives me the creeps.
