This place is is hella chill. Its more of a lounge with the chairs and couches they have for seating. Bar was just as expensive as the rest of course. Paid $24 for 6 buds (bucket) and $9 for mixed drinks. Thats where the word 'Pre-game' comes in heh. I find it interesting to drink and watch people dance, that is until im forced to join them.. alcohol is not the greatest friend. :{\nIts pretty unique to see a restaurant attached to the karaoke bar. Prices are cheaper than i thought, plus quantity and quality paid out as well. Pretty convenient so everyone can sober up with some carbs before the trip home. Dont worry, its a whole seperate room so you dont have to hear the wonderful intoxicated singers. \n\nCant throw my 5th star just for the fact that i was standing most of my time in the bar area. I recommend a UYE for this joint soon. Who wants to sing?!
