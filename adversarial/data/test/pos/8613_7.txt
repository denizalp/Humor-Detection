The rumor @Rumor ---- Beware, DO NOT waste a penny here! This place is effin disgusting and nasty!  Don't let the online photos deceive you into booking here.  Ughhhh!!!! Stay away from this place if you're reading this!!!!\n\nOur recent stay this past weekend, we had checked in on Saturday evening, 7\/16! \n\nMany of the other yelpers have complained about this already, but I thought I should give you our experience here.  Because of the obvious smoke smell in the room, which is causing my cough, so my BF had asked for a non-smoking room, and they said to him, \"all the rooms here are non-smoking rooms!\" Which is total BS!! Because as you enter into the hallway it smells like cigarettes and you open up your room and you immediately smell the smoking odor! The sink faucet in the bathroom was hard and loud to turn on. I also noticed the mildew as I turn the faucet on, and there were bugs crawling in the bathroom too. The bathtub wasn't even cleaned it was still dirty when we first walked into the room. After we came back from dinner to pick up our show tickets that we had left behind, when we pulled into the parking lot, there were like 10 cop cars in the front. And it looks like they're arresting someone. We immediately did not feel safe here and we felt disgusted and hated this place so much and couldn't stand staying here for the second night. Luckily my BF was able to book a room at Vdara on the strip at 3am, for Sunday night! So, we immediately pack up our stuff and left Sunday morning! \n\nMind you, I've stayed here over 6 years ago when it was still somewhat new, it wasn't that bad, just terribly slow service and or 'no room service' available at all or whatsoever. But trying to compare the service then and now, nothing has improved, it only got worst! \n\nTotally not worth $260 for two nights, and the checkin service is terribly slow! \n\nOwner\/Management team don't care to take care of this boutique! And if you're reading this too, please renovate this place so you can stay in business a lil longer!!!
