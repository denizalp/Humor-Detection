This place is a fast good fried chicken option, much better than the other corporate spots.\n\nPros:\nSpicy cajun style breading.\nGood family combo options.\n\nGrey area:\nGravy seems to be out of a bag or from powder.\nRice seems to be pre-made too.\n\nCons:\nRolls they give you are kirkland dinner rolls, they just warm them under a heat lamp.  Can't stand bogus rolls, or at least don't let me see you pulling them out of a kirkland package.\nAlso, it seems that their is a moderate probability that if you go in there when it's slow, you might get chicken that has been sunbathing under said heatlamps for hours.\n\nIf I need fried chicken, I definitely consider this place; however, it's not the best and it's not the worst.  The value is great and the fixin's adequately fill their role... you be the judge.
