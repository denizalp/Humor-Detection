\"At LAST! My love has come around. My lonely days are over. And life is like a song!\" I finally got to stay at the Wynn! Before staying here, I have read 99% of the reviews and most of them talk about how the lobby is beautiful. If you are ever planning to be a guest and not just walk around, READ MY REVIEW :). I had to shorten my review because of the MAX Char.\n\nSteve Wynn.. THANK YOU! You're hotel is exactly what I would have imagined a Las Vegas hotel should be. I wish that I could personally shake your hand. \n\nIf you are in college on a low budget and need to cram 10 or more people in to a room, please skip this review. You may want to try Venetian or Palms maybe. If you don't sleep,, just drink and gamble all night long, any hotel will do, but if you want to live a little The Wynn Resort in Las Vegas is for you. I highly recommend the Wynn if you will be entertaining a Lady friend. It could be your girlfriend, your fiance, your wife, or your potential Ex-wife. A Resort should be more than a hotel. It should be a destination. You should find everything you need and more. Leave your car and luggage where it is, because hotel hopping a thing of the past. A Resort should an experience! Your accommodation should equal or exceed your personal living standard.\n\nCHECK-IN: The Check-in area is a bit small compared to some of the huge Check-in areas of hotels on the Strip. It feels like a Airport Security check-in line, but instead of angry patrons waiting for a flight there are a lot of well dressed guest with designer luggage bags. It is still very claim and not too hectic. It was nice of the Wynn to open more Check-in stands.\n\nTHE ROOMS: *SPOILERS** (Please don't read this part of the review if you are staying in Wynn for the first time) I booked a standard suite and found a pretty nice rate around $130 a night, about $100 less than a standard weekend. The room is very simple, white, and clean. The very simplistic art style makes the room feel like home. It really isn't the largest room, because about 60% is entrance hallway\/ bathroom. The main attraction is the view. The Wynn tower is set up like a small apartment in Uptown New York. At most hotels, I keep the curtains shut the entire trip, but at the Wynn I kept the shades open almost the entire time with just a press of a button. The bathroom is easily any woman's fantasy and up to MTV Cribs caliber, but make sure to put on your complementary robe and slippers because that marble floor can get COLD! Central AC is the best invention ever so you know that it's on 24\/7. Since internet is include in the Resort Fee make sure to bring your laptop, and an Xbox 360 if you have one. I really like the desk chair and sofa. They are both very comfie and great place to conduct your business. I appreciate all the small details of the room. There's a ipod docking station so you can listen to some tunes, but more importantly it has a audio cord in the back. I like the little \"cocktail station\" with wine glasses, glass cups, and stainless steal icebox and pick. I this is a nice touch of class and it makes my Free beer and drinks taste that much better (BYOB). \n\nTHE GYM: \"What's a Guy-m? Oh a GUY-M!\"- Simpsons. Who works out at gym when your in Vegas? If you want to keep it real even on vacation, YOU DO! You don't say no to buffets, so don't say know to the gym. I wish that 24 hour fitness was like this gym. I like the free fruit plus the bottle of water with a towel on every workout machine. The staff is constantly refilling each station. The gym doesn't get overly packed, but you may want to go during the mid afternoon.\n\nTHE SPA: I accidentally walked in without a reservation. I'm not quite ballin' enough to go there yet, but I did use a \"bathroom excuse\" to walk around. There is men's and women's side. The Men's looks like a high class Exclusive Country Club for the elite. It has a fire place with couches and Men's magazines to read. Most women are probably use to a nice restroom, but this is a PIMP men's locker room. The showers and bathrooms have every possible grooming and bathing item. Everything is made with a dark maroon wood. I feel like I'm handing business when \"I'm handing my business\".\n\nTHE POOL: The pool is a little bit Cabana crazy. I felt like an idiot because I was probably the only one swimming in the Adult pool. I was just trying to avoid splashing kids. It's suppose to be more of a social pool. Yes, I believe pools are for swimming and not wading. I'm not a pervert, but it was creepy seeing so many guys there. If ladies want to get a European tan, let them be. After the men left more woman came.\n\nI guarantee if you stay at the Wynn, you will actually relax. Unlike most of Las Vegas that doesn't sleep and runs around 24\/7. You will take your time and enjoy the little things in life. I spent a lot of time in slippers and rope, board shorts, and gym clothing. Spend a little less time gambling and invest in your room and dinning experience.
