It's my first year with my golden visiting Woofstock, and we were super excited! Tickets cover both days, so you don't need to contemplate on which day\/time slot to purchase.\n\nI decided to go on a Sunday. We arrived at the park at around 1:30pm, realizing how hectic traffic was. If you thought rush hour in downtown is bad, this was worse. There was a huge lot when I first started seeing dogs. There were no signs saying it was Woofstock, and no one there to guide drivers for parking. I thought it wouldn't be too far of a walk as my GPS shows that it's already the woodbine park area. I made a left turn into the lot, only realizing that it was narrorw enough for cars to come out. I somehow got myself out of the mess, and found another lot right after this big lot. I turned in, and it was completely full. The drive way into the lot was narrow enough for 1 car too, so imagine that I had to back out into a busy, jam packed road!! I made a turn to finally see the Woofstock sign. The street was fully covered with cars parking on the side of the street, and the parking enforcement giving out tickets. I decided to drive all the way down to the beach to park, which was full but I waited. By the time I finally got a spot to park, it was almost 3pm. I parked for almost 1.5 hrs with my dog in the car while it was 32 degrees outside. I have seen much smaller events with some sort of parking direction, parking signs, or visible parking \"people\" to help direct visitors, but Woofstock did a terrible job accommadating drivers.\n\nAside from the hectic, messy parking situation, the event itself took up a massive space. There were vendors from treats, to food, to equipments, insurance,...you name it! There were also booths for human, if you were tired or thirsty. The things they sold here were definitely a better deal. But,unless you brought a trolly or something,the deal was not good enough for me to carry them back to my car, which was a 10 minute walk away while holding on to my dog. A lot of these vendors here also seem very fed up with the heat, the dogs, and people. Shoutout to the old guy that was trying to sell his deshedding tool - he basically told me and my dog to gtfo after learning that I have a furminator at home already. \n\nSomething odd from this event too - it is very small dog oriented. \n\nI really want to come to woofstock again, but in many reviews saying it used to be free, the whole experience was fun but might not be worth the effort.
