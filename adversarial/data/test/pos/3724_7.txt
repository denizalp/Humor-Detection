Tasty food, cheap prices, fast & friendly service. Had a little pig sammy, a bud light tall boy (which I didn't drink but felt compelled to order it b\/c everyone else at the restaurant had one and I'm a loser and succumbed to bandwagon peer pressure), and seriously the best hush-puppies ever! Being from SF, where there are no hush-puppies, I didn't quite get why it came with a side of whipped butter... what, you need to add more fat to deep fried cornmeal balls?!... but my local coworkers told me to shut my trap and just try them. I happily obliged and now am fatter b\/c of it. (It was well worth it.) No wonder this place gets packed, especially at lunchtime. Atmosphere is kinda like a l'air du country-barn-rodeo genre; really don't get why they tout this as a biker bar, as it was neither bad-ass nor Harley-ish; nor did I even see bikes in the parking lot for that matter. \n\nI wonder if it's on purpose that all the servers are PYT girls in their 20s... eh, who cares, pass me some h-pups, those are my eye candy!
