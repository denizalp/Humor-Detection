10\/10 \n\nBest Korean BBQ I've had by far! The hostess and wait staff were so generous and kind, which is hard to find in the costumer service industry. The last two waiters before I left gave us some insight upon Korean BBQ history and that made my day! \n\nI disliked their green tea, it was just too strong for my taste buds. Next time I'll try a different specialty drink from the franchise.\n\nGet the red wine pork belly, it's a must!!
