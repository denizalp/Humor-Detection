So long as you know what to expect when you're paying less than $50 a night, you're not going to be disappointed. We stayed on Memorial Day weekend, so to pay less than $50 a night for a room super close to the strip was definitely a good thing.\n\nIt's right off the 15 on Tropicana, so you're super close to everything. The nearest \"big\" hotel\/casinos were the MGM Grand, NY NY, the Excalibur, and the Luxor. Really wish we had tickets to Zumanity or Jabbawockeez since they were playing so close by.\n\nThe room itself was spartan, which of course is no surprise given the price. Just a king bed, a table & two chairs, and the bathroom. Carpet was dirty, but again, no surprise. Most important of all the AC was working just fine. Wasn't an issue when we arrived, but by Monday when it hit 102Â°, it was definitely a good thing.\n\nThe adjacent casino was a fun addition. Low-ante card tables, and the usual assortment of video machines. In fact, I won my biggest prize here the entire weekend! \n\nAs others noted, the room price includes breakfast at the attached Denny's. We didn't partake as we headed over to NY NY to eat, but it's a nice thing to have the option at least.\n\nOnly quip -- WiFi was super spotty. Averaged no more than 2 down most of the weekend. But considering it was a packed house, no surprise.
