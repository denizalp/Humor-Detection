Blink and you might miss The Henry as you walk out of the Cosmopolitan and onto the Vegas strip. It looks like an unassuming coffee shop that is tucked off to the corner, right at the Cosmo's side entrance that is the closest to the Bellagio.\n\nWe first stumbled across it one early morning while searching for a nearby breakfast option, and decided to give it a try. I am so glad we did. It is now a \"must visit\" whenever I am in the area early in the morning or when staying at the Cosmopolitan.\n\nWhile The Henry serves up soups, salad, and burgers and is open 24 hours a day, I have (thus far) only come back time and again for their signature Short Rib Benedict that is decadence on a plate. \n\nImagine a sexy hunk of skillfully braised beef short sitting atop a somewhat crunchy yet delicate potato cake, the whole floating in a glistening meat sauce. This is topped with a couple of expertly poached eggs (that remain firm to the touch, but bleed their citrine yolks at the slightest poke from your fork), a luscious Hollandaise sauce, and a smattering of caviar for added effect. It's the stuff that dreams are made of.\n\nI can also vouch for their Cinnamon Roll French Toast when I've been in the mood for something sweet over something savoury, which is dipped in an unctuous vanilla custard and served with maple syrup, creamery butter, and candied pecans.\n\nIf you visit early in the morning and the Hungarian-born Attila is working the bar, you're in line for whole other treat, especially if you like to get your Vegas drink on before noon. If that's the case, I would highly recommend sitting at the bar and passing on the coffee and orange juice, as Attila is quite the mixologist and it would be a shame to let his talents go to waste. \n\nMy favorite cocktail, that pairs ever-so-nicely with the Short Rib Benedict, is The Henry's Midtown Manhattan. Imagine some bacon-infused Maker's Mark bourbon, some cinnamon and fig infused sweet vermouth, and a mix of bitters (including Aztec chocolate bitters). Perfection!\n\nIf you absolutely need coffee with your breakfast, ask Attila to make you a Beam Me Up Scotty, which mixes Van Gogh Double Espresso Vodka with Tia Maria, a shot of Espresso, and a creamy vanilla syrup. There's also a nice selection of unique Bloody Mary drinks, including the Spicy Swine that uses that tasty bacon-infused bourbon in place of vodka.
