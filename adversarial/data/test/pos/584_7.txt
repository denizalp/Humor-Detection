As you slowly pull into the parking lot that is just big enough for Sunflour, you may notice an alien life-form: the hipster. Don't fear, they are mostly harmless. Push your way through the sea of gnarly beards, the manbuns that need clipping, and the noserings and you'll come to the counter. The menu features a small selection of coffee, pastries, and lunch items. Starbucks yuppies may feel out of place here.\n\nOrder some coffee and a pastry and have seat. Yum, that pastry tastes good. The coffee? Tastes fresh, not bitter, and certainly not the garbage served at Starbucks. As you observe your receipt for the damage, you probably notice the fair prices (for a U.S. bakery). No $10 coffee, no $5 pastry...ahh, that was great.\n\nI will be back, and I am sure you will too. Just bring a flyswatter for the hipsters next time.
