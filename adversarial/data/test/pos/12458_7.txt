I needed to rent a pick up truck to move some furniture quickly.  The online process to reserve the truck was great...but what was even better was the EXCELLENT customer service I received. From checking in, to receiving the truck to turning it back in!  I want to thank the guys there today 10\/1\/14 at 4pm  YOU all ROCKED!  Thank you for making this old gal feel okay about driving a truck!
