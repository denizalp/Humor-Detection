This place is a dump.  I've had a membership there for 6 years (along with a Lifetime membership and another gym too - yeah, I'm a gym rat)\n\nThis gym has gone downhill bigtime. \n\n I don't think the interior has been painted or new carpeting installed since the Carter Administration.\n\n It's dirty and the equipment isn't in the best shape.  A few weeks ago the air conditioner was dripping puddles of water on the cardio floor.  Instead of repairing the unit, there were buckets and towels laying around to pick up the water. \n\nI gave it '2 stars' because the trainers and the staff really are great people (it's this gyms only saving grace)\n\nIf you're looking for a better deal, just go across the street to the JCC.
