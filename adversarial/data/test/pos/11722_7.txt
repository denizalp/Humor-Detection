Sometimes I forget that NOT EVERYONE is a super freak and loves the GFG food. I wonder how this is possible? The realize because I forget to tell you all. \n\nClose your eyes and imagine this....well shoot that didn't work...um...ok... err.\n\nThe gyro bread is a soft, chewy, perfectly flavored, life vest for a quartet of ingredients. Spread lightly, yet enough to know it is there, is a hummus base used to tingle the taste buds in the back of your mouth as the flavor mixes with the fresh and crisp salad\/lettuce\/veggies mixture that is seasoned and intertwined with the lemon juice and tahini sauce. The charred and seasoned hunks of moist chicken fresh off the skewer are places on top the bed of mouth watering delight happening below. The flavors are meant to satisfy your buds and you will gladly lick the drippings off your wrist as they drizzle down at a constant pace because you never let the sandwich get more then 4 inches from your face the entire time...\n\nDamn just drooled on my shirt.  \n\nAs a freaking devoured the entire thing last night all i could think about was two things. \n\n1. Imagine how good this would be with a bunch of other Yelpers, chatting it up about the quality of the meat, veggies etc. The passion of Ninos and his amazing people skills. The impeccable cleanliness interior, furniture, kitchen, and my gosh the Restrooms...Mom would be proud. \n\n2. How everyone of the Sheeple passing up GFG to go to CHINO BANDITO....and the cheap quality, messy atmosphere, disgusting bathrooms...don't get me wrong I go there but...\n\nEat at Good Fellas and have a cookie at Chino's. Best of both worlds!
