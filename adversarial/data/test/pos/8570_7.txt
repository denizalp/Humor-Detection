The food was absolutely delicious and the service was great and hilarious. I came here with a party of 12 or so. I recommend the seafood platter app and the lobster. We noticed that every time someone would get up, the waiters would replace their napkin and fold it up all fancy. It got to the point where, just to be obnoxious, we would get up and down and up and down. I think we had almost as many waiters as people in our party.
