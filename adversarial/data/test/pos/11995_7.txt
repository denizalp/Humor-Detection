Frisbee Golf anyone? Or I suppose the technical term is Disc Golf. This park has 9 holes that equate to 3588 ft. long. So a quick and easy game, that is unless the wind picks up. I have yet to actually play here golf here, but I've been wanting to. UYE anyone??\n\nThis is the closest park to my home, (please don't stalk me). I stumbled upon it looking for somewhere to get some steps in, out in the great outdoors. It's located at the intersection of Arby Ave. and El Capitan Way, next to an elementary school, tucked behind a neighborhood. There's a walking trail all around the outside that measures 1.1 miles (I tracked it).. .So it's a convenient way to keep track of distance if you're like me and that's important to you. It can be crazy busy on the weekends but weekday mornings and mid afternoons it's a nice place to catch a breath of fresh air.\n\nFor a small park it has something for everyone: They have 2 baseball fields, where you'll often see kids playing on the weekends. There's also a playground for the littler kids.There are a ton of park benches, 4 or 5 pavilions, a large open grassy area for touch football, tag, red rover or whatever else you fancy.
