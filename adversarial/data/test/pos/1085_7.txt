The footlongs look shorter than normal and they only put 4 pieces of turkey on the whole footlong. Then the girl actually tired to put only two slices of pickes! By the time she was done none of the veggies even spaned across the bread even after I asked for extra veggies.\n\nIt was the saddest, thinest, most anorexic looking footlong I have ever seen... Not to mention that the sandwich had a strange salty\/sour taste even though I ordered it exactly as I always do.\n\nWorst subway ever.
