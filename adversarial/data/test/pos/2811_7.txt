I usually love this pizza but the poor choice of crispy chicken ruined this meal.  The chicken was over cooked, tough and salty.  I waited over 20 minutes for this order.  \n\nThe cannoli was perfection but small for the $2.49 cost.  \n\nI was unable to separate the burnt pizza from the cheese, so into the trash it went.  What a $14 waste.  Their pizza is usually amazing, and the wait is rarely this long.
