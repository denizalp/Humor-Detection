I'd still like a decent explanation about why they have TWO stores within 40 yards of each other.\n\nYou can sometimes find a good deal at this place - and I think that's how they draw in customers - but WATCH OUT.  These guys may get you at the other end.  I wasn't surprised when I found other warnings when doing a Google search on these guys.  Big warnings on the web about service and follow-up with these guys.\n\nAnd I have my own horror story.  I was pleased that they had in stock a very hard to find (and expensive) lens that I wanted desperately.  So I put down a deposit so they would hold it for me, and I expected I would have the remainder soon.  But my business took a down-turn, and it took me 6 months to get in to pay off the remainder of the lens - and DAMN - I could understand that they sold that particular lens, but when they reordered a new one - the price had SKYROCKETED - and I had to pay $1,300.00 more for the lens.  (Because the value of the Yen changed and the price of the lens went up.)\n\nCan you tell that I felt ROYALLY SCREWED ?\n\nNow, if I was smart, I would have transferred that deposit to some other item, that was priced similar to other camera stores, and then buy the lens elsewhere - because the lens was now available several places - and MUCH cheaper than at these shysters.\n\nCan you tell I'm still a little raw about the whole deal?
