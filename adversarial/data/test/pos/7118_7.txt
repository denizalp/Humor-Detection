How do you thoughtfully write a description of disappointment? Is it really worth my time to tell you about a disappointing experience at a place with a strange mix of reviews that primed me to accept a meal of mediocrity? Or does this solve a greater desire to be heard and this review is nothing more than self-affirmation, pandering to other, similarly worthless opinions about capitalism and internet reviews and why didn't Garfield Artworks ever clean up their bathroom?\n\nHere is a boring and disappointing review of a boring and disappointing experience. The dumplings were soggy and drowned in sauce. They were lazily pan-fried, unintentionally deconstructed, and served looking like a bad science project. The sushi rice was off-putting. The fish were poor quality and my body told me to stop eating. I was glad to see a bit of seaweed salad served with the chirashi, but confused by the thick-cut jalapenos and avocado slices.\n\nIn a place expensive because of location, I expect a bit more. The vibe of the place doesn't really fit Tamari's contemporary\/upscale environment that was left untouched when Pan moved in. They were playing a weird mix of white rap and alternative rock, but now I'm getting a bit picky in my judgments so I'll stop. Reading my draft of this review, I don't really want to publish it. I don't think it's very well written. Maybe I should end with some praise. The server was really nice.
