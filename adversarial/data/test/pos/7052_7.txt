How many times has this happened to you? \nYou: \"Hey, what do you want to eat?\" \nBf\/gf\/friend\/dog: \"I don't know.\" \n\nNo longer do you have to play 20 questions to get an answer. Take them right to Assembly Chef's Hall! It's the answer to all of your \"I don't know\" hassles. There's representation of cuisines from all over the world, there's bound to be something for everyone. Tacos, pizza, burgers, American BBQ, Thai, Chinese, ramen, sushi...If Toronto is all about diversity, then Assembly Chef's Hall should be its official headquarters. \n\nFor your beer-swilling, meat-eater, \"salads are the devil\" bro: brisket at Cherry Street BBQ, fried chicken at Love Chix, and multiple drafts on tap. For your hipster, vegan, latte art loving buddy: matcha chia pudding at Mira Mira, avocado toast at Nutbar, and caffeinated beverages in all different shapes and sizes.\n\nThe hall itself is very trendy. It's like a high-end food court with restaurant style quality and prices. Even during the lunch rush with hundreds of suits, we found spaces to sit no problem. My dining companion and I had the privilege of trying the $14 \"42 Ingredient Salad\" from Hibiscus and the $30 truffle mushroom gnocchi from Boemo. \n\nThe salad was really good, for a salad. It was filling and bursting with different colours, textures, and tastes. But it couldn't hold a candle to the gnocchi, which was decadent, marvelous, and had me shamelessly trying to scoop up tiny bits of sauce from my companion's plate to savour that flavour.  Washing all that down, we had $5 handmade ginger ales from Ramen Isshin. Very gingery, not very sweet, and perfectly refreshing. \n\nAssembly Chef's Hall might be expensive but as a frequent \"I don't know\" answerer, I think I've found my place in this world. \n\n(25\/100) - 2018
