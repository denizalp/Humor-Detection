$5 MONDAYS!!! YES PLEASE~!!! AND THEY HAVE A YELP $22 (2 tickets, 2 sodas 1 popcorn) CHECK IN OFFER FOR TUESDAYS~!!! I'm a sucker for a good bargain deal ;]]]\n\nPlush seats, big screens, clean theater!!! They also have IMAX movies which I don't really think are worth the $$$.. Located right by the food court so you can sneak some yummy Earl's in if you're hungry!\n\nService is awesome here.. From the guy at the box office who gave us his honest opinion to the guy who checked us for tickets.. He gave us \"free fist bumps\" LOL no really, he did. And the guy at the snack bar was super friendly!!! Nothing worse than going to a movie theater and encountering workers who hate their job! \n\nHot Tip: Park in the garage closest to Arville.. Parking is plentiful and close to the theater~!!!
