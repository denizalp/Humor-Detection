The service was a hot mess. Probably messier than the aftermath of what was left from our lunch. During prime lunch time, they only had two staffs running the whole restaurant. We felt irritated by the poor service but guilty at the same time that they were so overwhelmed + short staffed! \n\nHalf of our foods never arrived - we saw the table seated next to us ordered the same items but seated after us received theirs, I knew ours were either forgotten or given to another table by accident. An hr into lunch and with no seafood left on our table, the sides were still nowhere in sight! We were fed up with the wait and cancelled the other half of the order. \n\nAs if the missing food items weren't enough to drive us away from ever coming back, hair was found in our bag of King crab legs. Bag was snatched out of our hand when I notified the staff. No apology was given. And the new order wasn't served for another half hour. My poor mother in law watched us eat for majority of the meal. \n\nLobster, King crab legs, shrimp - all taste fine but nothing to write home about. The captain boil's sauce (a blend of lemon pepper, Cajun, and garlic) was my personal fav. The chicken wings were outrageously small in terms of portion - I would advise to sticking to their seafood or other sides. Overall - It's a matter of time before a handful of knock offs open up - captain's boil needs to straighten up its act before competitors come on.
