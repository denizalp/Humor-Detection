Lou Dawgs seems like a place that can't decide what it wants to be...a bar? a takeout place? a bank? We went to see a friend's band play.  Which in and of itself seemed strange for a takeoutish joint.  However, it totally worked and they were great!  We shared a beef brisket sandwich.  The meat was tender and flavourful, but a bit on the fatty side.  The sauces were yummy.  \nThe weirdest part was the seemingly never ending stream of people coming in to use the ATM...it seemed like it was some sort of special ATM given the number of people using it!
