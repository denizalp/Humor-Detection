I bookmarked this place even before the POTUS came to town and made it famous.  Thanks to all of the national publicity, I had to wait for the hype and long waits to die down and finally got to try it for dinner last night.  A friend and I showed up around 8:00pm and were told it would be 20 minutes before a table became open--not as bad as I thought it would be.  There are chairs and a couple of patio sofas out front, complete with outdoor heaters, so, between conversation and comfort, the wait for a table passed quickly.  \nThe restaurant was bustling, but our service was on point throughout the meal. We started the meal sharing the Simple Salad with the name saying it all:  nice greens, tomatoes, and a light vinaigrette dressing.  I came for the pizza and ordered a small New York style with mushrooms, while my friend ordered the Brooklyn Chicken.  The pizza yielded about six slices and it was greasier than I've had in a long time, but still delicious!  My friend was not as enthusiastic about his meal, rating it as just \"okay.\"  About half-way through my second slice, I spied the people at the next table going to town on some kind of chocolate dessert.  I haven't had chocolate cake in a long time, so, stricken with food envy, we ended the meal with said chocolate cake and it was DaBombDotCom, garnished with strawberries and whipped cream--definitely a nice ending to a good meal.  I'll be back to try the thick-crust pizza, have more cake, and delight in the fact that Dom DeMarco's can please the palate of the President as well as that of the hoi polloi.  Grazie!
