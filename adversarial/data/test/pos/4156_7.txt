Today is May 12th and there must be some sort of organized event because when we first arrived in a group of seven with open tables clearly available we were told by a \"security guard\" that the garden was rented out, after proceeding to the main bar we were helped by a bartender who said she'd love to help us and allowed us to hang around in the back yard area, about five to ten minutes afterwards she approached us again with an older gentlemen claiming to be part owner and he expressed that though there are open tables and although we had been seated that there were tables informs of us and advised us we can drink but not eat.... I am absolutely baffled that an owner would take money straight out of his own pocket after their mistake of sitting us... I will never return as I've never actually been so disrespected in my whole life\n\n\n\n\nIn reply to Dave; You were clearly embarrassed you couldn't resolve the situation your staff put itself in, rightfully so, however you're trying to make it seem that waiting was our problem which is hilarious considering we were already seated. You and your establishment are a joke. You as the \"part owner\" clearly had an agenda and righting your wrongs was not priority, we didn't \"bypass\" anything we tried to bring business to your place by going to the bar where Adrianna sat us.  I'll review you in this fashion on every platform I can find. If you noticed I review lots of places, GOOD AND BAD  I average a 5 star review rate so you receiving ONE Star is nothing short of accurate
