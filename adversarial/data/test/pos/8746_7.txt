Sadly I was not very impressed by anything at this place. Meals were very bland and not much flavor. There didn't seem to be much effort made by the restaurant to go above and beyond to provide a great dining experience. The water that my date received tasted like tap water and the lemonade that I ordered tasted like lemon flavored tap water. The catfish nuggets that I had were terrible. There was too much batter and not enough flavor. My date had to add pepper to her craw fish Mac n cheese as there was not enough seasoning. It literally tasted like three cheese hamburger helper with crawfish added in. The one positive were the Patron Margaritas that we had. Will not return.
