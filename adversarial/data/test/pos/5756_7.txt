Made an online order and it took more days than they claimed. I opened the package and both jars I received looked mixed like this. I understand it won't look like the picture online but come on. It's all melted and empty. Contacted the business and they basically said it wasn't their problem which is completely unprofessional. I don't know how it is in person but I would not recommend ordering online as they have a no refund policy which is ridiculous. Never ordering from this business again.\n\n-update-\nI don't believe it's right for me too have too pay another 10 dollars for shipping when who's too say I won't get more melted air jars. And posting the email just shows how unprofessional this establishment is. I also Never received an apology or anything. I don't recommend this place to anyone it's clear that instead of taking responsibility or caring about the customer, they only produce excuses. \n\nHave a wonderful day.
