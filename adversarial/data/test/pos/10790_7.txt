Located in the building that housed that old (Brick) Home Store, part of the building is now a regular Brick and the rest is a Sail.  \n\nI only went into Sail for the first time, at their Oshawa store, this summer, and found it very MEC-like.  I always thought MEC was leaving a lot of room for competition with only having locations in Barrie and downtown, and with Sail moving in on Vaughan and Oshawa, I'm saying goodbye to MEC and hello to Sail.\n\nAnyways, nothing too crazy about the store - it's nice and spacious, with lots of selection of merchandise, just like MEC.  Have I compared this place to MEC yet?  \n\nCame in to buy an inflatable sleeping pad and pillow for an upcoming trek.  Asked for advice and was helped by their resident expert in the department, who was pleasant, helpful, and knowledgeable.  They didn't have the pad I was interested in, but they did have last year's model for $10 cheaper, only difference being the colour, and also got another 10% off for it being an open item (though not a demo).  Score.\n\nOh, should mention - it's nice that there's now a new bridge from here going east across the 400 and you can follow the road all the way to Jane Street, avoiding Highway 7 in the process.    Picture a crossing over the 400 parallel to Highway 7, just a touch north.  I'll be back..
