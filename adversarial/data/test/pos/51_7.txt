The Westin Kierland Resort & Spa is a great place to stay while kicking flavor in Scottsdale, AZ! \n\nI have stayed at this resort twice now in the last three years on business and enjoyed both visits very much. The rooms are spacious, clean and offer the best shower heads in Arizona. Whats more is that a gorgeous Golf Course surrounds the resort and offers incredibly scenic views at dusk and dawn. \n\nThere are several restaurants and bars available on premise and although you should not expect a Michelin rated experience in cuisine, they will get the job done in a pinch. There are numerous options within mere walking distance if you prefer a more refined dinner including SOL, Mastro's, Eddie V's and Morton's. Before you even say it Yelp - Yes, these are all Steakhouses. It is Scottsdale where retired old white guys play golf and eat steak!  Calm the hell down! \n\nThe conference rooms are gargantuan in size and can easily fit 250 people in total comfort, although I would have to say that the restrooms do not match sizes so large lines can build up between break out sessions. They keep all of the amenities in immaculate condition, from gym to elevator there is absolutely zero question of the cleanliness of the surfaces. That is a welcome trait any traveler would enjoy. \n\nHonestly, you will be hard pressed to find a better resort in the surrounding area thanks to the views, tidiness and rooms offered at The Westin Kierland Resort & Spa and I very much look forward to another visit if the opportunity presents itself in the future.
