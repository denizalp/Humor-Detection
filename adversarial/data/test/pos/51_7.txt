Messy and ugly bouquet! My boyfriend paid over a hundred thirty dollars for two dozen roses and I only received 16. One of the lilies even had a broken petal and half of the roses already look wilted and it's only been 2 days!!! Also had to pull out some of the ugly leafy fillers because they looked cheap and horrid. Do not order from here!!!!
