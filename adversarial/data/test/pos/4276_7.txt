So far I have only played mini golf twice with my 6 year old.  The glow in the dark course more than makes up for being indoor. This is the desert who wants to play outdoor in july?. Can handle large size parties and welcome s walk ons. Ample parking , food is what you would expect. Staff is friendly. I would have given them 5 stars however it's a bit pricey if you want to come regularly
