I absolutely LOVE THIS PLACE.  My cousin and I waited at the door for them to open at 9:00 AM.  When we entered, I was in heaven.  Guns filled the walls and they practically have ANY gun to rent- From a Glock pistol to a mini UZI and the AK-47.  My cousin and I rented an AR-15 and a Beretta 9 mm to start.  Both great guns and fantastic to shoot on their range, which features the most up-to-date target retrieval technology.  Since it was our first time at the club, I asked that they walk us through everything thoroughly and they did a great job.  The staff was extremely accommodating and I can't say enough great things about them.  High honors for the Scottsdale Gun Club- Highly recommended!\n\nAlso if you're wondering, you DO NOT need to be a member of the club to shoot at the club.
