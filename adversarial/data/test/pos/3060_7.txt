Second time in 17 years I have ever sent sushi back at a sushi bar was here.\n\nI should have known going to a Sushi bar so close to Apache Junction was a bad idea.  First, the prices are low and pieces are huge.  Too big actually.  The proportions are all off and like stated before, makes you seriously wonder how they can sell such large quantity for so cheap.  \n\nWell, I guess by serving less-than-fresh fish.  I ordered Albacore sashimi and took one bite, spit it out, and sent it back.... the fish was BAD.  The chef actually took a piece, ate it, and tried to tell me nothing was wrong with it and that perhaps it was the pungent sauce!  Wtf?
