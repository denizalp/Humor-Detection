Worst service ever. Absolutely racist, and tried to move us from the emergency row since they assumed all the Asians on the plane were immigrants and can't speak English. They never even spoke a word to ya to confirm it but made arrangements to give away our seats . Not only that , some old 70 year old lady tried to tell my husband to get out of \"her\" seat since we can't speak English and she was more capable than him. They they Continued to check our ticket, match our names again, and re verify we can understand English. Wtf ? Who checks id on the actual plane ???? Are you kidding me ? Y'all couldn't hear me bitchin after they said we can't speak English ? Although we were in our ticketed seats (20a,b) she still continued to try to bully him out of his seat. She was assigned somewhere in row 24. For those of you who do not know my husband, he is extremely fit and strong enough to help every passenger off this plane in case of an emergency. The lady trying to take his seat was bitching at us after I denied her repeatedly to take his seat . She then continues on that she was promised more leg room from an attendant if she moved . Not our issue you hag. Great judge of character UNITED... I'm totally furious . You'll be hearing more from my \"non English speaking ass\" trust me.\n\nTo add to the commotion and disorganization of this airlines, People were piling up in the isles as well because so many passengers were assigned the same seats ! This was not even the same issue as we experienced .\n\nNot only that, immediately before this, we missed our first flight. The gate was still Open and we were not permitted to enter our plane, so we had to take a standby flight to experience this atrocity. \n\nOnly the elderly ( who can't hear ) and people who can't speak English ( or understand) can tolerate treatment like this since they are unaware what is going on. IS this your motto United? \n\nNever again !!!\n\nSpirit airlines is leaps and bounds better than this .
