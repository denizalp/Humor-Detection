The first rule of farmers markets is that you don't talk about them to the uninitiated.\nThe second rule of farmers markets is that you disregard the first rule when you encounter someone who will use the information for good.\n\nSo gather close, because I won't say this twice: the Vegas farmers market is at the Gardens Park location (an actual park in the middle of a neighborhood) on Thursdays from 4-8PM.\n\nDon't get there AT four, because no one else is- but 6PM is perfect. \nIt's fairly small, but I'm hoping more businesses join as the weather gets more bearable after summer ends.\n\nThis visit, there were two different farms represented with fresh produce, Winder Farms promoting their home delivery, a gourmet pet food delivery, a gourmet sauces\/popcorn\/snacks lady, a hot dog stand, and Frozen Frog.\n\nEveryone appeared to offer the options of taking cash and cards (in the age of Square, you're really doing yourself a disservice if you don't), and everyone was quite friendly.\n\n3.5 stars, rounding up for the potential and the fact that summer is probably their off season- less produce and insane temperatures would drive me away, too.
