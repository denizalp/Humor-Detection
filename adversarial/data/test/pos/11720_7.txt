One word my friends: tableside!!! Yes, tableside carving of your steak chateaubriand for two\/Creekstone farm steaks never disappoints. One of the best dinners I had this year for sure.  I would recommend Delmonico restaurant in Vegas who ever goes to Vegas or lives there.  \n\nDelmonico is settled within the Venetian hotel and with a 5 pm dinner reservation , they were pretty busy by 6 pm. I'm assuming people want to eat good streak before different shows and other entertainment in Vegas. Service was impeccable with the server and assistant both working harmoniously together.  The restaurant is not overly pretentious or glamorous looking.  I liked the overall atmosphere with the white walls\/crisp white tablecloths on the tables with dim lighting.  \n\nThe service starts with the complimentary brioche bread and butter which were decadently heavenly.  Then they entice and educate you about their wine list etc but I don't drink so I was ready to order some steak, steak, steak! I did the chateaubriand steak for two carved for us.  It was a 18oz steak but really my 9 oz share was big but so yummy so yes I was able to finish my portion.  The garlic smashed potatoes were delicious.  The creamed spinach was just ok, a bit of a let down.  \nOther than that I enjoyed every minute of my dinner before my red eye flight back to Florida.
