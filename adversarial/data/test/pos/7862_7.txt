Came here for a work dinner (yay! we made goal this month!)\n\nFriday night and GEEZ it was packed! Expect a bit of a wait, but nothing horribly unreasonable. Probably took up around 30-minutes, during rush hour. You should get here earlier if you want to beat the crowd. They don't do reservations, so by the time we were seated, I was starving. It's $20 all-you-can-eat so it was a total steal compared to places like Sura, Honey Pig etc.\n\nWe had the smoked garlic pork belly, galbisal(?), beef tongue, and garlic calamari several times. I think I found religion. THIS must have been what heaven tasted like. The pork belly melted in my mouth. Although I felt like my party overcooked it a bit, our server (Terry I think his name was), helped us out. Most of my coworkers never had KBBQ before and when I wasn't paying attention, they seared it on their side of the grill for a little too long! It was perfect the second time around. Salty, well-seasoned enough to give you a heart attack. Glad our server paid attention heh. Coworkers were kinda hopeless haha. I mean, how hard is it to cook meat right?!\n\nThe kalbi was AMAZING. Thick, marbled meat that sizzled beautifully on the grill, it tasted fresh. My best friend (korean), is pretty critical of KBBQ joints and this, by far, blew her expectations out of the water! I can normally tell when she doesn't say anything and slightly nods and doesn't criticize the food. I was kind of shocked because she absolutely dislikes going out to eat korean foods that fall short of her expectations. Her number one complaint is usually freshness and Gen, she admitted, was pretty damn good. FINALLY, she and I can agree on something.\n\nWe had a couple waiters tend to us, but Terry stood out by doing a good job of refilling our drinks (I drink water like it's alcohol) and keeping an eye on my companions when they were stubbornly cooking the meats themselves. \n\nDecor is very stylish and modern. Fits right in with Galleria. I like the open-air floor plan. Whatever ventilation system they have, it was way better than the other Gen I went to in Cali. My clothes didn't stink of pungent meats, which is a refreshing change. My friend complained a bit about that lol.\n\nFor the price, the quality is unparalleled. It's about $15 AYCE for lunch! Even better! I'll have to bring my other friends here next time!
