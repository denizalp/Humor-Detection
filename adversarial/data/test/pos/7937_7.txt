Maybe they should change the name to phoenix cause this place is reborn.\n\nIts nice to see spot like Firefly bounce back from the whole Salmonella disaster last year. Yes people got sick from the food here, will it happen again? Nope. In fact they have a food safety consultant and its probably the safest place in town to eat.\n\nI've been slacking on checking out the new location but I finally got to stop by a few days ago. The new location is a building over from their original spot but is probably three times the size. Its a large stand alone building with a big patio, massive bar, and plenty of space for diners and large parties. The new spot captures the look and feel of the original Firefly while expanding a little and establishing itself as its own restaurant. Across from the bar is an open kitchen viewing area\/bar which should ease some concerns about food handling and safety.\n\nDuring our visit the service was spot-on. Our server and bussers were on top of refills and had some great recommendations. Keep in mind that the tapas come out in waves not all at once. The food thankfully (unless you had the limited edition Salmonella flavors) is the same. During this last trip we had the mac n cheese, chorizo and chicken stuffed mushrooms, bacon wrapped dates, and chicken skewers. We also had the chicken and mushroom pallela, kind of like a gumbo without the shrimp, this thing can easily feed 3 to 4 people. All of the dishes were as delicious as before and I recommend checking out all of them. I think their raised their prices on the pitchers of mojitos but its still worth it especially if you are stopping by during happy hour.\n\nIts great to see people give Firefly a second chance, and I commend the restaurant on making some substantive changes.
