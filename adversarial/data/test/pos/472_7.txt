Walked in at approx 2pm and was seated at a table on a Saturday.  There was myself and 2 other couples. There was a breakfast menu on the table and thought she misunderstood.  While looking at it and not wanting anything on the menu, I was about to walk out.  Then she asked if I wanted the dinner menu....yes!  Got fettuccine with sea scallops and shrimp with sauce.  It was delicious!  I am not a big eater and always have leftovers, which is preferred; however, this was truly a dish for one; I finished it all.  While waiting for my meal, the chef\/owner came over and mentioned that I should make a reservation.  I was taken aback since 1) I was seated immediately and 2) only mtyself and 4 other people in the restaurant.  It was obvious they were setting up (& loudly) for a large party.  \nPRO: excellent food; would have loved a larger portion for $25.00\nCON: Was told: \"Next time make a reservation.\"  No bar. Plain ambiance.
