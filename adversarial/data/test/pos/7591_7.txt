One of my goals while in town was to try several locally owned coffee shops. This one was on the radar based on all the Yelp reviews with interesting comments and its location.\n\nI ordered an almond milk latte and was impressed to see the option of not only that but coconut milk as well. Not being a fan of coconut water, I decided to play it safe but might give it a try in the future. There is an additional charge for almond or coconut milk, but the barista pointed that out when I ordered, which was very nice of her. It also clearly stated it on the menu.\n\nThere are both indoor seating and outdoor seating on both sides of the place. We tried both only because the side with the parking lot was a bit cold in the shade that morning. Warning: the street side outdoor seating appears to be the smoking side but was in the beautiful sunshine. \n\nNo ceramic cups for the coffee, however, only to-go paper. Having this option creates a need to have a machine that cleans those cups to health standards, so maybe that isn't an option. Perhaps, there is a bring your own cup option that I don't know about.\n\nOverall, a pleasant experience.
