My experience at Nevada S.P.C.A. has been great from the get-go. \n\nWe have been wanting to get a dog for a long time now and I originally wanted a puppy, but got turned around when informed \"When you adopt from a shelter, you're saving a life.\" Anyone who knows me knows that I love pugs so I searched their website for an adoptable pug and saw that there were none. Thinking that it might not be completely updated, I pulled up to the shelter on a whim wanting to see what they were all about. \n\nThe NSPCA building is older and run down, but don't let it steer you away especially because they are a No Kill shelter. As soon as you walk in, you will see a board where they display a few dogs and some \"Adopted\" stickers slapped across the ones that now belong to a loving home. On your left is the Dewey Veterinary Hospital and on your right is where they keep the bunnies - the dogs and cats are kept at the end of the hallway (employees only). I was greeted by a gentleman as I headed in and he asked if I needed help with anything. I told him that I was there to possibly adopt a dog and he asked if I knew what kind of dog I was looking for. I responded that I didn't and he guided me to a computer where I may see the dogs that they have available for adoption. After a few minutes of browsing, him and another gentleman checked up on me to see if I had any questions or wanted to see one of them. I told him that I wanted a smaller dog that loves to cuddle, but would also be active as well. He immediately guided me to \"Marley\" and showed me a few other dogs that would fit the criteria. He asked if I wanted him to bring \"Marley\" out and I was excited! When the little guy came out, I was in love. Little baby sat on my lap, licked me, and in the meantime they give you a packet with information about the dog as well as his current shot records. They asked if I would like to take him to their backyard area and play with him so I took him out there and let him off of his leash. After play time, we hung out inside some more and I told him that I would like to come back tomorrow with my fiance if possible. Another gentleman informed me that I should call in the morning and make sure I let them know that I have met \"Marley\" before and possibly adopt since they do not hold overnight.\n\nI was so eager all night to bring my little baby on home and started purchasing the essentials for him. My fiance wasn't able to see him the next day, but trusted my judgement (the multitude of videos and photos also helped) so I raced to the rescue after work. I called and asked if \"Marley\" was still available and they said yes but I had to hurry since it was almost 3 PM and they close at 4 PM with adoptions taking about an hour.\n\nRunning inside, I asked for \"Marley\" and another gentleman brought him out to me. After spending more time together and bonding, I had to take my little baby home. He came out and \"interviewed\" me to make sure that I was a suitable candidate to adopt and that I would be able to provide a forever home. I LOVE that they interviewed me to make sure that I would not only be a great dog owner, but a great person for Winston - his new name - and able to provide him with a loving home. Adoption contract signed!\n\nAdopting from NSPCA means that your baby will come spayed\/neutered, up to date vaccinations, complimentary veterinary check-up, and they are microchipped! The adoption packet comes with a few samples of the dog food they use (and coupons!), Nutri Source, which they advised me to mix little bits in with his new food to acclimate him if I decided to change it. The information for his microchip is provided - all you have to do is mail Avid (the company they use) $20 and the registration papers. A new parent brochure is provided along with a list of veterinarians that will provide a free vet check up within 10 days, he reminded me to bring along the Certificate of Vaccination along with his shot records. They are currently partnered with Bogart's Bone and have coupons for multiple offerings at their locations.\n\nWhat are you waiting for?
