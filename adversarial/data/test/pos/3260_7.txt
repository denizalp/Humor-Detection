Overrated.\n\nI'm not saying that as a bitter partier who had to wait hours in line while the asshole security guards went on their power-trips.  (Seriously though...the line outside went on for miles!)  We got hooked up and actually got in within a few minutes, but I soon came to the conclusion that I would've rather stayed outside in line...at least I could breathe out there.  \n\n1.  The narrow stairways leading to the second story dance floor and the rooftop lounge were always packed!  We started out at the bottom, excited to see what awaits us atop this famous club...Within a minute of reaching the top, we turned around and pushed our way back down the stairs, eager to escape the extreme cold of the rooftop and the disgusting humidity of the dance floor.  What a waste.\n\n2.  I'm giving it 2 stars because the lounge downstairs was actually pretty nice...and their drinks were strong, so that's always a plus.  \n\nComments my friends made throughout the night:\n\"Hey...if there was a fire right now, we'd all die.\" - Friend #1 (while we were on the main dance floor)\n\n\"I know the decor is supposed to be Asian, but it's really really awkward drinking and clubbing with a million Buddhas watching you...\" - Friend #2
