Ok, I'm updating my review. I come here far too often not to bump it up another notch. Plus, now I don't have to worry about someone calling me out when I stop by for my favorite chicken salad. Honestly, this is probably the best bang for your buck HH around. Who doesn't appreciate cheap and delicious food? Obviously, past Morgan didn't.
