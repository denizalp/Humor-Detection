If you have to go to this store literally your will to live will be sucked from you as you breathe, time stands still...You literally move through the store unaware to the verizon employees until your name magically gets called from the carney barker in the kiosk in the middle of the store....\nSave yourself....Serve yourself...\nI URGE you to do so...Go to Southpark to the corporate kiosk and not only will they see you but empathize with and do right as best they can....\nI like the Verizon kiosk at South Park A-LOT!! \nThe store?\nNOT-A-LOT!\nCheers!!
