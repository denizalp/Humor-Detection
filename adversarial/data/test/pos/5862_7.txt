Please read all of this if you are really considering going to this place \n\nIf you want that new car buying experience where you feel like its sleazy and shady then you have come to the right place.   I would have given them a half star but that is not even an option.  So lets recap my Pre Certified 2013 Ford Flex experience.  \n\nSept 18 2013 - Arrived at dealership to look at the Flex.  Kurtis met me in the parking lot, and at first I thought, great attack me right when I drive in, but that is their style from what I understand.  Yup stand in groups in the parking lot. Not intimidating at all.   All in all Kurtis was a good kid and good salesperson, since really everything that happened has nothing to do with him.    Deal approved, signed the papers, all is good. \n\nSept 19th 2013 - Drive to Grand Canyon from Phoenix and hear a knocking noise throughout the whole trip.  \n\nSept 23rd - Get a call from Josh Jones about the financing and we need to come back in.   Ahhhh what?    Tell him we will be in on Sat.   Partner gets home that night, calls Josh back leaves a VM and we dont hear back at all.   Come to find out that Josh was on days off.  We didnt realize this until Josh gets back, and you will see why in a second. \n\nSept 24th- I call again ( remember I didnt know Josh was out yet ) to see what is going on with the financing.   Leave VM Pretty aggravated that Im not getting any calls back, I called again and asked for a manager.   I get transferred to Andre, and he answers the phone with a Yea??  I asked who he was and he said Who is This.  I said its a paying customer, now who are you? ( My tone not so friendly )  He states that its his cell phone and how was he supposed to know.  Call me crazy but if you the manager on duty and get a call transferred to you, wouldnt you be a bit nicer?  Nah it escalates, we get into a heated argument, he calls me a D**K and hangs up on me.   Lets rewind, Andre is a MANAGER, and Im a paying customer. Im in the Corporate World and any class, session or conversation I have ever had, never mentioned when talking to the client please call them a D**K.     I called the dealership back, told the receptionist I wanted to speak with the owner Tim Hovick, and not to have Andre call me back.    ring ring, guess who, Andre, trying to back peddle.  Sorry Andre dial tone for you.\n\nLong story longer, and if your reading this and thinking about going there, please read on. It just goes down hill from here.   Oh and that whole week, no call from anyone with power, just Kurtis my sales guy who didnt know what was going on but I told him car was coming back and he was going to loose his commission.  \n\nSept 28th - Bring the Flex back in and meet with Josh, who now is stating we have to go with another finance company and bla bla bla.  Bottom line papers got signed, deal was the same, numbers got shuffled, he needed signatures.  So the day I got the car I assume he pushed things through and stuff didnt come back right.   AND  drive the car to service, where I needed a tail light replaced because of excessive moisture in it.  Wouldnt you have fixed that before putting it on the lot?    Tell them about the knocking noise.    Leave the car all day\n\nSept 28th EVE - go back to pick up car, and they tell me my Pre Certified ( that means they looked it all over and its met a ton of inspection points) is NOT ROAD WORTHY.  The knocking noise, two bolts that were missing holding my drive shaft on the car.  UM HELLO I drove it all week and to the Grand Canyon?   Car sits there till Wed because bolts had to be ordered.  I do want to give a great THANK YOU to Robert Pence. Knowledgeable, nice, and really felt bad for us.   \n\nPicked up car on Oct 2nd saying ok were done with this place.   Hee hee, not yet!!\n\nThe week of Oct 28th called the dealership 4 times and left VM's because my temporary tags expire on Nov 2nd. \n\nNov 1st  called over and over again, repetitively until the person answered.  Asked where my registration was.   She has no record of the car, or our names.   She said she will call us back.  20 min later she calls back and says Oh yea we never processed your paperwork.   We are going to do it tonight and rush it to you.   If I had not called I would have never heard from them at all.  \n\nIf you want to buy a new\/used car here you have been warned.  I wish wish wish I had read this before I went there, I would have never gone.   \n\nAnd to the San Tan person that is going to read this and state, oh please give me a call so we can talk about it.  You call me, hunt me down, and try to make this right.  Im not calling you anymore, all I get is VM that is never returned.
