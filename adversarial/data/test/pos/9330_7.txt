I will just say to IGNORE the recent flood of one star reviews by idiots who have two or three reviews!!!! I am certain that they are family or friends of other restaurant owners in the area who trying trying to taint Bamboo Cafe's good reputation!! I never trust a poster who has two or three reviews, especially when they bash a place!!\n\nThis restaurant serves an AWESOME lunch for ONLY $5.25!!! I am just shocked at how much tender beef they put in their Mongolian Beef dish!! Only $5.25 for a combo lunch?? WOW!!! \n\nThe atmosphere is relaxing and actually kind of upscale for a Chinese strip mall restaurant, the food is good and the portions are big!! Their crab puffs are very good!! I usually pass crab puffs off to my hubby, but not when we are at Bamboo Cafe!! No way, Jose!!!\n\nLook at ALL of the GOOD reviews!!! Yes, this place is good and their prices are cheap!!
