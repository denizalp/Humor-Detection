This location is one of their permanent clinics and one of the swankiest. You get to make your donation on cozy leather recliners, and their multiplicity of stations means really short wait times. Truly my favourite clinic.\n\nI'll write this review for the uninitiated. If you've never given blood before you might be nervous, but the entire process is quite simple and actually painless.\n\nThey accept walk-ins but appointments are always preferred. Once you sign in, you take a number and wait a few minutes to have your iron levels tested. This is done by pricking your fingertip and analyzing a slide of your blood in a machine. I find this to be the most annoying part of the process but it's not painful. If your iron levels are high enough (males usually don't have to worry about this but females might) you get to proceed. \n\nYou are then given a booklet to read and a must answer a short questionnaire. Answer the first 13 questions in a private area that resembles a voting booth. It's tempting to blast through these questions, but read them carefully. You might not qualify based on recent travel, some medication you are taking, or ailments you have had in the past.\n\nAfter this comes \"The Interrogation.\" You are taken into a private room, where they take your blood pressure, and ask you personal questions -- including ones about your sexual history. Some people find these questions controversial, but obviously their primary concern is the safety of the blood supply.\n\nAnd once you've jumped through all these hoops: it's needle time! You get to choose which arm you want, though the phlebotomists are keen to meet your most cooperative veins. There is a sharp feeling when the needle goes in, kind of like stepping on a pebble in your shoe. I'll say this: there are reasons not to donate, but this millisecond of discomfort isn't a good one. Man up, dawg.\n\nOnce stabbed, you just lie there for about 5-10 minutes. The needle isn't noticeable and I usually chat with the RNs and other bloodletters. The more water you've had that day the faster the donation, so come hydrated. Five minutes is normal, and they won't let you spend more than twenty minutes in a chair. While some people feel lightheaded after giving (and usually on their first donation) it's actually pretty rare to pass out. Once drained, you will be gently escorted to the kitchen for the big prize: cookies and juice and a thank you from a volunteer. This is the only time in my adult life that I eat those jelly filled Peak Freans, so I savour these post-donation moments.\n\nAnd that's it from soup to plasma. You can learn more about the blood donation process, including other things you can donate like plasma, platlets or bone marrow on their website.\n\nAnd just to squeeze one more entreaty to donate: While I can't name a single person who _chooses_ to get seriously sick or in an accident, at least one person reading this review will need blood one day. Lend them yours.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: I like the way you work it\/BAG it up.\n\nMenu Readability: \"Have you ever had sex with someone using clotting factor concentrates?\"\n\nNeed to mention: Thursday night is pizza night at this clinic.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: This might be my probably my only opportunity to save a life.
