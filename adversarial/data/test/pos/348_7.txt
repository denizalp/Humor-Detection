Hidden Harbor is honestly one of the best hidden gems in Pittsburgh. You'd probably never guess that you'd find an astounding tiki bar behind a small blue neon sign on a street in Squirrel Hill. \n\nWhen you step inside Hidden Harbor, you're transported to a different place. This is not your average tiki bar with tacky leis and grass skirts; on the contrary, Hidden Harbor brings a certain class to their tiki decor. The smaller wooden tables with poufs and benches allow an intimate and laid back vibe. The plants hanging from the ceiling, dim lighting, and large wooden tiki statue will make you feel like you're truly in the islands! If the decor isn't enough, the drinks will knock your socks off.\n\nThe price of the cocktails may be a turn off when you first survey the menu, but they are well worth the price and I guarantee that you will not be disappointed. I have never discovered a cocktail that I do not like at Hidden Harbor. The best word for me to describe their cocktails is \"balanced.\" You will not find one overly sugary drink on the menu (unlike many other tiki bars). My favorite cocktail is the Tropic Thunder. Not only are the drinks delicious, but they're decorated beautifully. Where else can you get a cocktail served to you in a barrel topped with flowers or in a glimmering golden fish mug?\n\nThe food at Hidden Harbor is also notable. Their grilled pineapple tacos are to die for, as well as the pulled pork buns. Finally, they have a happy hour, which only makes them more appealing - their happy hour daiquiris are phenomenal! I cannot recommend Hidden Harbor enough. An absolute must-try in Pittsburgh!
