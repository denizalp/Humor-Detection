It had been several year since I have had PH Pizza. Especially IN an actual restaranut. \n\nThe pizza was hot and fresh. We had a 3 cheese white pizza and an everything pizza. The alfrado on the white was too much for me. The everything pizza was good. Seemed better then I remember PH to be. \n\nThe server was really cool. She joked and had fun with us. \n\nThe prices were good. We had a coupon and she gave us a discount for a birthday that we were celebrating. Yeaaaa for me.
