Super busy today must be the nice weather. They always have enormous selections of food and choices.\n\nMy go to dish is the Asian salad which I get on a plate by itself and I get an extra plate for the cucumbers, sweet pickles, mushrooms, and broccoli with a scoop of thousand island dressing on the side.\n\nAfter 4 bowls of chicken noodle soup. I get my soft serve ice cream with brownie bites to finish the night.  \n\nService was subpar tonight. I think they have new management since the last time I was here.  What got me annoyed was we waited for a table, but there were two empty tables with the reserved sign on them. So we asked if these can be used, which we were told no. So we waited and then found a table.  Within minutes, the manager removed one of the reserved sign and wave the customers behind us to take the table.  Ok this irritated my wife and we all know unhappy wife is an unhappy life, which sparked me to give this review.  \n\nPlease make sure your Manager go through training on how to treat your customers.  Better yet, why reserve tables on a busy night.  At this point my experience was down hill from here and everything I normally liked just tasted awful.  Guess I lost my appetite. THANK YOU new manager. (~Fuming).\n\nBTW the other table still had the reserve sign when we left, which was an hour later.  Really?! Come on, do better sweet tomatoes!
