We had a very good experience on this trip. We had a large group and the staff handled it well. I struggled with what rating to give. I do not give out five stars lightly, but I really struggled with a reason to lower it at all.\n\nThe decor is like you have come to expect from Fleming's across the country. It is clean, and cool. The staff was attentive and friendly through out the evening. Our server was knowledgable and provided helpful advice on food and drinks.\n\nWe started with some wine for the table. Our server made a solid recommendation that was well received by the group. I wish I remembered the name of the wine.\n\nWe started with a few appetizers. I tried the Pan-Crisped Pork Belly. The pork belly comes with creamy goat cheese grits and sweet onion chutney. Those three components combined for some good flavor.\n\nFor my meal I ordered the Main Filet Mignon medium rare. It came out as ordered. The meat was juicy and packed solid flavor. We had several sides for the table as well. As always I ate a lot of Fleming's Potatoes. They are fantastic. I also ate some of the saut√©ed corn. That was a pleasant surprise. The flavors and textures were very good. The last side I tried was the Chipotle Cheddar Mac & Cheese. It was creamy and tasty. I was far too stuffed to order any dessert.
