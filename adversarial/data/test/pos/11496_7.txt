Just whatever you do,  don't come here before a badger game. \n\nThe staff is overwhelmed, the place is tearing at the seams,  and the food,  while you order of the menu,  is prepared buffett style and served to you from a warmer. Not only that,  but you also have to wait a long time for the incompetent staff to assemble your meals. \n\nWe've had the unlucky experience of stopping here for a bite to eat before a badger basketball game and this is what we observed. \n\nOr waitress was frazzled and we had to wait 15 min just for our water.  We were to afraid to order anything more than burgers.  We waited 30 min for our food and another 20 min for a refill on our water,  which would have been appreciated sooner as we were choking down on our dry hamburgers. \n\nI wouldn't even come back here again when it's not a game day because the food was only sub par.
