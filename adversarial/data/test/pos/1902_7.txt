This place has seriously gone downhill. My husband and I took our boyfriend with us to the reef yesterday. The woman who was at the ticket counter was very snotty when we talked about the CCSD employee + 1 guest thing. Apparently they've removed it and made it only 2 days a month now. \n\nWe asked when that had happened, and she got very bitchy and said that we OBVIOUSLY had received an email about it already and should know. Then waved a paper in our face with the dates. Unfortunately for her, no support staff in CCSD have received this email that I'm aware of.\n\nWith the locals price of $13.95, we decided that for $42 + tax, it wouldn't be worth it, considering how short the place is. She even got snotty about it still and rather than being understanding or apologetic or even offering some modicum of customer service, she told us \"You'll have to go in THAT line if you want to come in now.\"\n\nOh well. They've lost our business. Probably on a more permanent level now. Get some customer service skills, please.
