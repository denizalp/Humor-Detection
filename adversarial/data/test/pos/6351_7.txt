I was torn about leaving a negative review, as in the past I've had incredibly positive experiences with six different piercings at Sadu.  However, after thinking back on today's events I feel compelled to issue a stern warning.  Since Autumn left last fall, it seems as though the staff has been different each time I went in for work.  This in itself is not an issue, why I write is to offer you warning that your experience will likely be ruined by the inhospitable staff who excel in condescension while offering a ham-handed piercing technique.  After having both nipples pierced, a labret, an industrial, nose-ring, tongue, and ears spaced, and a multitude of other piercings, I am aware of what to expect when I decide to do further body modification.  \n\nThe staff that was working was, simply put, rude.  They were discussing disdainfully the questions that earlier clients had tendered and when they did take a break from verbally assailing these customers to help me they were short and discourteous.  Since I was there for a tragus and not to make friends I tried to dismiss this effrontery.  While the mood temporarily lightened once I went back for the piercing, the young lady with dreadlocks couldn't help but talk about herself for the entire time coming off as narcissistic and  somewhat arrogant.  Again, I soldiered on as I was terribly excited about the piercing despite the staff.  If the verbal treatment of the staff wasn't sufficient to turn me off to Sadu permanently the piercer's brutish handling lacked any semblance of finesse.   So I  would give her skills  five stars -- five stars that had each collapsed into a black hole and merged to form the largest black hole in the universe.  \n\nIf you cannot afford a professional dominatrix to mistreat you I would thoroughly recommend Sadu, if on the other hand you are looking for a positive lasting experience I would go elsewhere.\n\np.s.   to be completely fair they have great jewelry, but nothing you can't find online for the same price.  Good luck.
