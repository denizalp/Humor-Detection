This cute new juice bar opened by one of my gyms and I had just had to check it out. They have bottled juices and fresh-made smoothies, everything organic, all with fun names and tasty flavors. Samples are available for you to try before you buy, and the gal I worked with was super sweet.\n\nThe Purple Rain (coconut milk base) was my first pick, and was great before, during, and after my workout- frankly the portion was more than I expected, which makes me happier about pricing. Dine-in version is served in Mason jars with optional whip for those who are indulging a little bit. The Chai and Cherry Bomb juices are both unique and not too sweet or too bitter, but their cold brew coffee was even better than either.
