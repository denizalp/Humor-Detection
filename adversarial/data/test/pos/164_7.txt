Greasewood Flat is hugely popular with winter tourists, and for cowboy ambience and entertainment it pretty much is in a class of its own.  Although they could, they don't charge outrageous prices to rip off the tourists.  Burgers are about $7 - 8 and beer is about $2.  They accept credit cards for the food but beers are cash only.\n\nIf you are a local, Greasewood Flat is a great place to go on a weekday afternoon to get a good burger, a cold beer and have it somewhere other than a chain burger joint.  There were 3 of us a couple of days ago and it was HOT outside, so the place was empty.  The combo bartender\/waiter\/cook had a great friendly personality and our burgers were ready promptly.  Two of us had the special bacon\/cheese\/green chili burger which was served with lettuce, pickle, tomato and onion with a bowl of Ruffles.  The burgers are very large, but not those ridiculous things that some places show off with.  Just a good honest home-style burger, cooked perfectly.\n\nThe Old West decor is honest as well, it doesn't look like a theme restaurant, it actually is old.  They have a VERY tiny dining room which is comfortably air-cooled, and decorated with hundreds of autographed dollar bills.  It's all very real.  Outdoor dining when it's 116 degrees is NOT very real, however, so please don't go there if you can't stand the heat and then complain how hot it was.\n\nThe owner dropped in to say hi to us as we were leaving ... a nice touch.
