Another great location.  Had the buffalo tofu appetizer and the steak sandwich Melt.  Both were awesome.  Has some drank with grapefruit vodka and ginger and IT was awesome.  Usually its not something I dig but damn it was tasty.  Hope it stays on the menu.  Staff was all really fun, unike a lot of the new places popping up everyday.  Being a good server or bartender and actually engaging the paying customer is a lost art now.  My favorite part is all the amazing posters from Cleveland rock shows from years past.  I remember a lot of them when they happened.  Good times.  Sorry Indie buttrockers, country bumpkins and pop music putz's, these posters showcase bands that actually play music....with instruments.  Keep on keepin' on....
