After the center manager manager, Dan, got news of my review on yelp he reached out to me directly to address the situation. He said that yesterday (April, 9th) was his last day but he a man of his word and wanted to see that our car was taken care of properly. He drove from Henderson over to my house in Summerlin to personally pick up the car and take it back to Caliber Collision to fix the remaining issues. The car was returned to my house today (April 10th) by Dan and the new center manager, Matthew. The car looks great! I wish it could have been this simple from the start. They fixed all of the issues and did a great job cleaning the inside of the car. I wanted to write a review update because it is only fair to mention that they did make things right and I am truly appreciative about that. It for sure gave me belief that Caliber Collision can make good on their word.\n\nI want to take a moment to mention Dan, the now previous center manager. From the very beginning Dan made myself as well my husband feel that he had every intention of making things right for us. Unfortunately, things obviously didn't go so well at first but Dan went above and beyond to make everything right. The simple fact that yesterday was his last day but he took the time at all to take care of us the way he did just impressed me to the max. I don't know where Dan is headed to next but wherever it is that company will sure benefit from him.
