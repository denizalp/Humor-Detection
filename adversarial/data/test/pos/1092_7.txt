I went here twice only because it resided in the hotel that we were staying and that it was convenient.  We came here with a group of 9 girls for a bachelorette party.  We were on the VIP party list and when you approach this line, it is ridiculous.  There is no organization whatsoever to talk to the host.  It's really depends whether you can squeeze through the crowd or not to talk to the host.  I can see how a lot of arguments could occur in this situation.  After waiting for 30 minutes, our club promoter came to get us.  We enter an elevator to get to the club.\n\nThe ambiance and decor is really nice here.  The main dance floor gets really crowded.  If there was more room, i think we would have had a lot of fun.  I loved that they had the confetti drop.  It felt like new years for a minute.  There was also dollar bills flying down towards me.  I don't know if this is a normal thing for this club or we had some ballin' celebrity that decided to throw dollar bills into the crowd.  It was pretty fun trying to get the dollas! We came away with a whopping $5 that went towards the tip of our drinks lol.  Most of the music played on the this dancefloor is EDM.  \n\nThis place has alot of stairs so make sure you wear somewhat comfy shoes girls!. Their hip hop room though on the other hand is pretty cool.  I just only wished it was bigger.  It's super crowded down there on the dance floor.  I only wished we had some room to dance.  We ended up dancing on a box but to be drunk and dance up there that long, it's kind of scary. \n\nOverall, wish there was more hip hop music in vegas instead of this edm invasion but oh well, what can you do? It's fun with the right company!
