I tried this place about a month after the grand opening. Its a sister company that Sushi mon owns, I think, anyhow the place is beautiful and servers were ready to serve. All you can eat style, sushi was fresh & hella tasty, sushi chefs were speedy but precise , servers were good in keeping up with orders and maintaing a clean table. Another real good sushi joint to try.
