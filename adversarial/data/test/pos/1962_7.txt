We passed by Hubee D's one day, said \"What's that?!\", and then visited the next day to give it a shot when we were looking for a quick, cheap early dinner.  \n\nThe menu is fairly simple -- all chicken-related -- but there's a little something for everyone: wings, tenders, boneless wings, sandwiches, salads, sides, and desserts.   You order at the counter, get a number, and then the food is brought out to your table, so at least you know it's cooked to order.  \n\nI tried the crispy tenders meal which included fries.  For a dollar more, you can get the platter which also includes coleslaw and cornbread.  I opted for the 4-piece tenders for $1 more than the 3-piece.  Unfortunately, what I got was about 3 1\/3 tenders.  Like the chicken wings, I figured you could also get hot sauce on your tenders, so I requested that the tenders be tossed in their \"seriously hot.\"  Seriously, it's not that hot.  And I was charged an extra 50 cents. And they have five kinds of sauce (including buffalo hot sauce, which tasted the same) on the tables.  I basically paid 50 cents for the labor of someone putting sauce on my chicken that I could have done myself at the table.  And then another 20 cents for blue cheese.  All of which should automatically be included with ANY kind of chicken.  \n\nThe tenders (all 3 1\/3 of them) were very tasty and the buffalo sauce (that I could have just put on myself) was flavorful, too, although not very spicy.  The big handful of shoestring fries (with skins on) were very good, too.  \n\nI'm not a fan of chicken wings, but looking at the menu, they seemed a bit pricey (about a dollar a piece).  And their fried banana pudding sounded interesting...but not for $5 a pop.  Seriously?  \n\nWould I go back?  I might.  The food was good and fresh.  I'd know just to put the free sauce on myself, though, and next time I'd probably say something if I just got 3 1\/3 tenders for the 4 that I paid for.  That should be part of their quality control, though, not mine.  \n\nI'm probably being generous with four stars, but three stars seemed too low.  It's probably more like 3 1\/3.
