What is this? Mexican food for ants??? They should rename it America's Smallest Tacos. Seriously, ridiculously small, about the size of your palm with 3 tablespoons of meat. I am not a big eater or overweight by any means and I would need about 6 of these tacos which would cost $14.50. Sorry but that's just crazy. If I'm going to pay grotesquely inflated prices for Mexican food I'll go to Mango's in Mesa where at least I feel like it's a value. That being said, the favors were fantastic, really delicious marinated meats, the corn with cream sauce was amazing. Great chips and salsa too. If you're ok paying for it, it's a tasty place to eat. I just can't justify the cost.
