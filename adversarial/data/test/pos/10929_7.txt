Guillaume is a small little bakery that offers traditional French breads, sandwiches, and tea.  When you step inside, you see shelves of different types of breads, all neatly organized within their respective racks.  I tried a Champignon choco blanc et vanille (this was cutely shaped like a little mushroom, it had a subtle hint of sweetness, but there wasn't much flavor to it), a regular croissant (flaky and buttery, this was okay), and a croissant au fromage (flaky and filled with cheese, this would have been more perfect if it was freshly-baked; heating it up a little bit in the microwave helped, which also released some butteriness, and the filling of the cheese was nice and melty.  The male employee in there was super sweet and friendly, and he was totally jamming to the trance track that was playing AHAHA This is mostly a to-go place, but there is a small little bench if you want to rest for a bit before you go on your way.\n\n+friendly staff :D\n+variety of breads
