These guys messed everything up during a recent trip. Reservations, arriving and leaving dates etc.  The people out front were horrible in attitude and plain rude.  I will never stay at TI again when I go to Pubcon - from now on ... its all about the Wynn ..... nuff said - don't want to get my blood boiling again - oh yea and they charged me for Internet THAT I DIDN'T USE!!!!!  Still haven't reversed the charges...... (like a pirate - no pun intended -- GRRRRRRRRR)
