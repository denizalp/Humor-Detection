Played Manakiki over the weekend.  I won't pretend to be that knowledgeable when it comes to golf courses, but it certainly seemed like a very challenging course.  There are a lot of elevation changes and it seemed to me that on many, if not most, of my shots, I had to deal with not being able to hit the ball on a completely flat surface (i.e., feet above\/below the ball or left foot higher\/lower than the right).  The course itself is beautiful--the view from nearly every tee is a sight in itself.  I thought there was a restrained and judicious use of water hazards and sand traps.\n\nTwo negatives: The greens must have just been recently aerated--it was a little disconcerting lining up long putts.  Second, on one hole, there was clearly construction going on in a \"sand\" bunker to the left of the hole.  It ended up being a brutally deep mud hole complete with a backhoe shovel sitting in the middle of it.  Needless to say, my ball strained mightily to get a closer look, but fortunately my approach shot...sailed right over the green.
