What a disappointment.  During the high pressure sales pitch I bought three training sessions.  I decided to see if they would give me a trainer with anything but there own agenda in mind. Usually they just want you to sign up for a lot of training.  So I made it clear with the manager who booked the trainer that I don't used weight stacks, and in my initial consultation with the trainer (and every conversation after that) that I don't use weight stacks. Calesthenics and stretching both tone and stretch you.  That is fine for me.  They assured me this was no problem.  The trainer spent our training sessions and conversations manipulating and bullying me to do it his way... weight stacks... all the while he was saying we would do it the other way.  Don't waste your time with trainers here if you want anything other than mainstream dreck where the trainer stands and watches you ride the bike while you pay him to do so.  Worst yoga classes in the city  Otherwise the club is clean. The front door staff are very pleasant and accomodating. They make you feel very cheery when you come in.
