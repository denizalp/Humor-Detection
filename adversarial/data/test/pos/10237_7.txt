I've been a fan of Goodwill since childhood. It's where all my \"oldies, but goodies\" went after I out grew them. It's where I bought that crazy costume, cool cowboy boots and old prom dress. Haha come to think of it, it's where the \"ugly sweater\" Christmas gifts and the old sofa, rug and lamps went, too. Go there and buy my old stuff!\n\nBut anyways I know they use donations to put people to work and that's a good thing! I have made about $1,000 worth of donations during my recent move and hope that goes to good use?! :)
