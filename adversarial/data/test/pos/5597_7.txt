I remember driving by this place and thinking how I can't wait to check it out when it opens. \n\nImagine how excited I was when my date surprised me by taking me here! \n\nAt first, all I kept thinking was that show, Black Out, where one has to complete certain tasks in total darkness. As I signed the waiver, even though I was assured none would be served, I pretty much told myself I was going to eat a bunch of live bugs in the dark. \n\nI was very relieved that nothing I ate contained any live bugs and once I calmed my nerves (the music helped) as I'm afraid of the dark, I found myself really enjoying the whole experience. Eating in complete darkness really perks up your senses and it was fun trying to figure out what we were eating. \n\nI think this is one of those 'bucket list' things that everyone must experience at least once.  :)
