I called ahead and inquired if they sold 100% VG juice. The answer is yes and  the Vape Inn Rep who answered the phone also went a step further and told me the flavor of all the 100% VG flavors they had in the store. I ended up purchasing a 80%VG\/20%PG mix. \n\nWhen the Vape Inn rep told me they had been open for 3 years I felt like smacking myself in the face for asking such as ignorant question as how long have you been open. Vape Inn on Carson is located on the chill side of E. Carson, just past the Birmingham Bridge. \nShame on me for not getting the name of the young man who helped me. He was very friendly, and helpful. My social awkwardness has me hiding at home a lot of the night on the internet making uninformed purchases all in the name of avoiding human contact but with USPS delivery service being what it is I had to go to a Vape shop. I feel accomplished I have a uber tasty bottle of e liquid and had a great experience.\n\nI'm happy and vaping. VAPE on Friends VAPE on!!
