Stopped by at Tacomania, so of course the menu is limited to tacos.  Would like to try some other items Rogue BBQ has not just tacos.  \nFriendly service and $4 tacos.  Thought the tacos were a little expensive compared to other taco vendors.  Both the Seitan Chorizo taco and the Pulled Pork taco but thought the Pulled Pork taco could use a tad more meat.
