Daahhling, I'll have a gin and tonic. If you don't feel fabulous here, then you don't have any imagination. \n\nI love the decor, it's fun to hang out here and have drinks at night. I've also had breakfast here before too, it was pretty good and certainly a different feel from the saucy evening there before, but it still had the same effect on me, that I was ab-fab. \n\nHanging out by the pool is fun too, smaller than I thought it would be though. (that's what she said)
