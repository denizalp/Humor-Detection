We highly anticipated our spa visit after paying a hefty price for the evening. We arrived at a simple bungalow with some religious signs hanging at the top of outside wall, situated in a non descriptive neighborhood .\nNothing like its website has depicted. There's outdoor furniture, a hot tub where a few couple got in and a small pool. Snack are potato chips. The massage was so so. Cleanness was very much in question overall, there's a basic changing room with toilet, What's striking is We couldn't even find a shower to use before and after the hot tub !!! We left baffled.
