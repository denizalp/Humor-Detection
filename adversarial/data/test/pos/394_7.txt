Let me put it this way: if Trattoria Italia's Lobster Ravoli wasn't soooo incredibly good, this place would be a one star joint. \n\nTo begin with, most food comes out way under salted and under seasoned. Very bland. If you send it back it comes out just fine the second time around, but when sending food back just to achieve flavor becomes their M.O., something isn't right. \n\nPositives: pizza is good, cioppino is good, and lobster ravioli is great. \n\nNegatives: food is very under flavored, service at the front is very pushy. Prices are too high for what you're getting. Oh, and their caprese salad has microscopic amounts of basil, and a copious amount of spinach and lettuce. Seriously?! I didn't order a house salad with tomato and mozzarella. \n\nAs for the staff, I've just come across much more accommodating staff elsewhere. Customer service and family atmosphere is definitely lost in this dive.\n\nPutting aside all biases from my former love of Montesano's, it really is not the best restaurant around. So many other places I will go to in the future besides trattoria.\n\nWould I recommend this place to others? Absolutely not.\n\nWould I come back here myself? Only for the lobster ravioli.
