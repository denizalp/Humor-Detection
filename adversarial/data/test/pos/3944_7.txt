XS definitely lived up to all the hype. My boyfriend and I got in for free (yay for being hotel guests) since we went on a non-weekend night. After reading reviews of how expensive it is and how long the lines were (even though we saw for ourselves), I think we were lucky that we both got in free. We were both blown away by how nice the venue is. First of all, it's HUGE; I already knew this going in but I was still surprised by how nice and big the venue was. Since it's both indoors and outdoors, it's nice, especially when it's crowded so you don't feel like a sardine. I definitely want to come back with a huge group of friends next time.
