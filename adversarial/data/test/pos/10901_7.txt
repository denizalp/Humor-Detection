Being in a car accident can be a very traumatic experience. The compassion and helpfulness of their staff went a long way in making me feel better in a true moment of need.\n\nThey did extensive repairs on my car and actually went out of their way to minimize my out of pocket expenses. They always treated me with the utmost of integrity and service, and completed my repairs in a time less than quoted.\n\nA year later, the repaired part of the car might as well be new. I have no complaints about my experience with Ewing Bros.
