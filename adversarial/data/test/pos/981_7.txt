This place is the new hype in Vegas so we knew it was a must on our trip. \n\nWe got there early on a Saturday afternoon. The line was not too bad, about a 15-20 minute wait. You must order first and they will call you when your order is ready. \n\nI decided to go with a hamburger with lettuce, pickles, and onion with shack sauce. I thought my burger was delicious. I thought it was better than in n out cause of the bread they use. The bread was nice and soft and it soaks up the juice perfectly. I could eat this burger forever. \n\nI also got an order of crinkle cut cheese fries and jackpot concretes. I thought the two didn't live up to the hype. \n\nShake shack is a little bit more expensive than the fast burger joint here. I would skip the sides and just get the burgers time and time again.
