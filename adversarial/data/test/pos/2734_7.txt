i would more soon die in my home then go to lakewood hospital emergency.  i've been there 2x - kept there over 7 hours each time.  sat in my exam room listening to the staff mock patients in the other rooms (hey if i can hear you all so can they!).  nurses had a very mocking tone in general, very condescending almost annoyed that people were there taking away from their flirting with the doctors.  really, if its an emergency go somewhere else.
