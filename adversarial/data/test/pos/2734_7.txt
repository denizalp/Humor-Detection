I'm in love with this kind of living. Resort style apartment homes (that doesn't cost an arm and a leg -- as far as CA prices go) in a convenient location to the freeways, stores, schools, restaurants and a 20 minute drive to\/from PHX airport.\n\nThe property is well taken care of and is evident from the common use areas. It offers so much in terms of amenities as part of the monthly cost of living here. Although, I need to take into account what pros and cons I face when comparing California to Arizona living. It would be difficult to find a property in CA that offers all that this location does for under $1500\/month for a modern 2bd\/2ba first floor unit.\n\nThere were a few hiccups that needed addressing. However, minor as far as property management goes. From what I saw, the move in process is fairly effortless. It would benefit the (new) residents to have an office open longer than what is posted. There were some issues with the unit as far as basic versus upgrade amenities that should have been dealt with prior to moving in but not a deal breaker. The key fob\/gate key is poorly designed and seems to be intermittent in its ability to function. That needs to be fixed, like yesterday. Overall, nothing that would deter from making an informed decision about moving in.\n\nIf I didn't feel like I was going to melt into the ground from the unforgiving Arizona sun, I'd move in without any hesitation. For now, I'll just admire from a distance and visit when it doesn't feel like an outdoor oven.
