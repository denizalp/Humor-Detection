NEVER NEVER NEVER USE THESE A-HOLES! \n\nit took 2 hours or our bags to arrive and I had to leave and get ready or work so I assumed I could go back and pick up my bag. When I say 2 hours, I'm not exaggerating, we landed at 5:15pm and I let at 7:15 and the bags had still not arrived. I went back after work and no one in the entire airport worked for allegiant, I went again the next day and still no one. How do you steal customers bags and not have one person in the baggage claim area or at the desk??? I've gone back to the airport wasting, gas, time, and money and I still can't get my bag. Don't try to call them because you wait for over 30 minutes with no one, I've done this twice and now again as we speak. DO NOT USE THEM. \n\nI don't care about fees, ticket prices, any of this crap. I want my gdamn bags.\n\nYou've been warned
