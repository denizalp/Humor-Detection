I dont normally go this low on rating unless there is a problem & omg houston we had a problem. First off we got that we walked in 30 minutes to closing n didn't realize it til after we've ordered our food n i checked in on yelp n seen the time update. So on that note 3 more group of peeps show up b4 closing like 10 minutes prior. My tacos were expensive and they were tiny and the tortillas used was fuken stale ass hell with no flavor at all on the asada or the fish, then i had a shrimp ceviche and hell that shyt was horrible worst I'd ever tasted, then the horchata was just watered down even am\/pm had better horchata n they're shyt sux but compared to this place yah..no! Got my son an ice cream wit churros n the chorros were also stale, smh! The absolute worst mexican restaurant i have ever been to, never again will i eat at this place.  Thats just my opinion, and i dont bullshyt when it comes to food, i tell it for what it is..bout the only thing good that came out of this dinner was the server kept coming to my table to check on us which is a plus, so service wise it was good. Quality of food was terrible! Waste of $33 bucks spent.
