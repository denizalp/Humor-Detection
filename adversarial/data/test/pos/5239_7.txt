Sushi at it's best. You get to see everything before you enjoy. A short wait when we arrived but that just gave the wife and I time to start eyeing what we wanted to eat as items were being delivered to tables before our eyes. \n\nWe were seated and immediately got to see a wide variety of small plates displayed on the revolving belt. We chose a couple drinks and looked over the menu \/ iPad which is on each table. We ordered the Ginza Mule and Hana Sake which were both delicious 5\/5. Plenty of great items to choose from, made fresh and placed on the belt for quick turn around or place an order on the iPad on each table and the item will either be sent via a robot who blinks and plays music at you or by the less conventional human being ;-). The server told us the items stay on the belt a maximum of 30 minutes. \n\nWe began grabbing plates off the belt including: sea bass, salmon, tuna, shrimp tacos, squid, white tuna, New Zealand salmon which is delicious, a couple rolls, seaweed salad, halibut. And before we knew it had devoured 18 plates worth of sushi! From the iPad we chose the hamachi carpaccio which was superb 5\/5!\n\nFor dessert we shared a bowl of pistachio ice cream 5\/5. \n\nOverall this place was amazing! Can't wait to come back and update this review.\n\n***update a week later:\nWe came back with the family this time and enjoyed more great sushi, some ramen noodles and popcorn lobster. For dessert I highly recommend the strawberry shortcake 5\/5. The table for 6 was about a 15-20 minute wait but well worth it. The entire family enjoyed a great meal for lunch. We devoured 22 plates and about 8 items from the menu. Arigato Sapporo Revolving Sushi\n\nTill we meet again my new found friend...
