I absolutely love Yuzu.\n\nAnymore, its so hard to find a place that oozes personality and character. I still standby my previous review-- the food is awesome and I love the skewers. Also, they have one of the most pun-y and fantastic drink menus ever (the 3am Snap Story, #basicbitch Iced Coffee, Straight Outta Pinterest... to name a few).\n\nNow that i've had a chance to experience Yuzu more often, I adore it. Portlandia Patio Party? Crazy Cat Lady night? 90's Girls Only Sleepover Party? Yuzu infuses the fun back into the neighborhood with their hilarious and original events. Not to mention, the staff at Yuzu are just totally lovely people. They care about your experience and are dedicated to the neighborhood in an incredibly authentic way. I just love to give a giant, virtual high five to anyone creative enough to program a restaurant with such awesome, fun things to do year-round, while also having great service and unique food.
