I highly recommend you sign up for the Gordon Biersch Passport Program.\nIt's free and they send you TONS of discounts via email.\n\nBeyond the deals, this restaurant has GREAT food (I really like their burgers), good Happy Hour deals, decent-good service, and a really cool patio to hang out on.\n\nEnjoy!
