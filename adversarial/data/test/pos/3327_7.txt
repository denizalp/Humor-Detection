This park looks like it has a lot of potential, but unfortunately not enough of a user base to be worth the drive.\n\nWith three separate enclosed parks including a small dog run, large dog run, and a run for both large and small dogs combined it offers a lot of variety. Unfortunately only the mixed dog run has all the fun equipment so if you have a smaller dog that is skittish around large dogs you're going to miss out vice versa if you have a larger dog who is aggressive towards smaller breeds. \n\nThey also have a very small water dog play area for those hotter days which is nice but there really aren't any dogs here. I've been multiple times of the day and evening and there's maybe one or two dogs, the most I've seen at a time is 5. I like taking my dog to dog parks of course so she can roam freely outside and use up some of that notorious puppy energy but the main reason i bring her to dog parks verses simply taking her for a run is so she can start to learn to interact with other dogs and people to become sociable.\n\nThe dog park at Sunset Park may be more of a drive for me since I live in Henderson but its always got a decent flow of dogs which makes it worth going to!
