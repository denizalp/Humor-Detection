Came across this spot while searching for new places to try out on Yelp. After looking at the photos and reading reviews I decided to try this place out this past weekend. \n\nThey have a fairly large menu with all sorts of chicken items on it. From sandwiches to wings and tenders, sides, salads, milkshakes, Boozy shakes, shots, alcohol drinks and of course fountain drinks. Many of the items on the menu I wanted to try but decided on the Firebird sandwich since I was looking for something spicy. \n\nThe Firebird sandwich is a sandwich made with a crispy chicken piece (mine was huge!), shredded lettuce, tomato, cucumbers, pickled peppers which are jalapenos, and a spicy Chipotle sauce all on a toasted bun. Cost $8.75. The chicken was delicious. It was cooked perfectly. It could've used a little more salt, but that's nothing I couldn't add myself. The chipotle sauce was tasty without overpowering the whole sandwich. My only problem with the sandwich was the number of jalapenos they put on it. The jalapenos were terribly hot and they added oh so many of them on my sandwich. My mouth was on fire, so I had to take off 90% of the jalapenos. So, if you don't like spicy, don't get this sandwich. I'll probably ask for fewer jalapenos next time I get this. \n\nMy guest got the Cheesy Supreme sandwich and made it a combo. He added a small order of \"Fries with the works\". All combos come also with cole slaw. The Cheesy Supreme sandwich is made with a crispy chicken piece, lettuce, tomato, cucumber, your choice of 2 kinds of cheese and Blue Ribbon Special Sauce. His combo cost just under $14. \n\nThe Fries with the works are made of crispy fries and topped with aged cheddar, smoked bacon, and sour cream. The small order was more than big enough for 2 people to share, especially when you have one of those HUGE sandwiches. \n\nThe inside was very clean and organized. They had a selection of different kinds of honey and hot sauces at each of the seating areas as well as at the Hot sauce table. They offer ice water for free to their customers, which is very nice on hot days here. Their trash can is a trash compactor. First time I've seen this. \n\nEmployees were friendly and very knowledgeable of the items on their menu. \n\nCan't wait to come back. Definitely, a must-try stop if you're in town and love chicken.
