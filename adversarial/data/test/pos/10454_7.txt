Maybe we just got very lucky, but our stay here was excellent and I have no real complaints. Let me say that I have very high standards when it comes to the cleanliness and safety of hotels, and I still found Circus Circus to be fantastic.\n\nOur room was spotless, and cleaned and maintained brilliantly by the housekeeping staff. The bed was really comfortable, there was lots of storage space, the bathroom was big and came with lots of clean towels, shampoo, soap, etc. A coffee machine, hairdryer and two safes were also provided. The air conditioning worked perfectly (albeit loudly) and with 40degrees heat outside, this was hugely important.\n\nThe hotel in general, like most Vegas hotels, was like a city in itself. In addition to the casino, there was a huge variety of restaurants, shops and bars within the hotel, as well as an oxygen bar, a kids theme park and of course the obligatory wedding chapel. We didn't use the pool or gym, but it was nice having those options on hand.\n\nThere's a lovely McDonalds (seriously, really clean and the nicest staff ever) and a Subway right outside. \n\nYes, the hotel is a bit of a walk from the main strip (30-45 mins based on how fast you can walk in the heat) but really, that's obvious from looking at a map. You can't book a hotel and then complain about the location afterwards.\n\nI had no problem with any of the other guests whatsoever. At the end of the day, you're in Las Vegas, if the sight of drunk young people or old people smoking at casinos bothers you, you've come to the wrong city. (For the record, there was very few of either of these examples in Circus Circus)\n\nOnly complaint was that we waited in line 25 minutes after check in just to get into an elevator! I realise that at peak tourist season at check in time there will always be lines, but I've never encountered such a long line in any other hotel just to get an elevator.\n\nIt's not the most luxurious hotel in Vegas by any means but unless I become a millionaire between now and my next trip to Vegas, I would happily stay here again.
