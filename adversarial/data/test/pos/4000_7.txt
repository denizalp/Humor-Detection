An exceptional experience with Cajun food + white table cloth service and charming staff + delicately lit dining room, and gorgeous views of Las Vegas through large glass windows (if you get a seat upstairs).\n\nMy family and I came to Rhythm Kitchen during Las Vegas Restaurant Week. We arrived a few minutes before our reservation and waited for the hostess to prep our table. After we were ushered into their dining room, which is classy, yet has a feeling that you will be served Cajun\/French Creole food from the heart.\n\nNot everyone in my party dined on the RW Menu, but I did, as did my mother and God-mother. \n\nFor starters when I checked into Yelp the restaurant offered a free drink, including their house wines. I opted for the white, a Chardonnay that was decent, but not anything surprising. My father ordered the house Merlot, also a decent varietal, but nothing special. However, they do have an extensive wine menu that I glazed over seeing numerous choices from France, Spain, and the like.\n\nNext - for appetizer my family opted for two orders of the alligator tail, one grilled with a spicy seasoning and the other deep fried. The alligator was surprisingly tender and had the consistency of a medium-well done steak. I like both versions, but preferred the grilled with the extra spice.\n\nWe were also served tasty, warm rolls and hush puppies with honey-butter. AMAZING hush puppies. Deep-fried to perfection, and a lovely spicy taste... I think there must have been some jalapenos added to the batter. But these were quite addictive.\n\nAs for my order, I started with the Cashew Vinaigrette Salad- Mixed Greens In A Spicy Cashew Vinaigrette Topped With Red Onions, Red Peppers & Crispy Wontons. The addition of red onions and red peppers to this salad made all the difference, adding spiced-up flavors one does not typically have in a garden varietal salad. The crispy wontons add a very nice mix to the mouth-feel and are kind of like a \"better'\" version of a crouton.\n\nNext up, main course: N'Awlins Seafood Delight- Blackened Catfish Over Rice With A Rich & Creamy Alfredaux With Shrimp. This was a delicious, creamy main course. The catfish was main star, having a flaky grilled exterior, and a melty white fish center. And it was a good portion. Shrimp were plentiful as well, no skimp on the shrimp here. The alfredaux pulls everything together, making you believe you are in New Orleans... not South Las Vegas.\n\nLastly, dessert. Homemade Bread Pudding Served With Bourbon Sauce. Their bread pudding was certainly... different. It is a firm cake, dense. The bourbon sauce here is served cold and it is a white sauce (some places offer brown). I was not a fan. I was expecting a warm bread pudding and a warm white sauce. The was neither. But. It wasn't *bad* and had a very NUTMEG flavor to it. It is just different, that is all.\n\nOverall - Service was prompt, genuine and our server was congenial to our large group. Food overall was as expected with pops of surprises and flourishes of creativity from whoever is chef here. I would certainly come back.
