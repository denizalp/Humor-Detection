Marquee at The Cosmopolitan has topped many lists as one of the best clubs in the world. I wanted to love it, but did not. I have been curious about Marquee and it was a let down. It was not as energetic, exclusive, or opulent as XS or Hakkasan. The dance floor inside was small and crowded. I was there on a weeknight and barely anyone was outside near the pool area.\n \nBottom line: The lines are shorter and there are more deals for Marquee, but there are clubs in Vegas with better DJs and atmosphere.
