I am BEYOND happy with my service here. I got the Brazilian and my underarms waxed. My service provider was and will probably always be Paige. She is incredibly helpful and mindful to my lower regions needs.lol  Made the entire experience a breeze! I feel we definitely bonded, I mean, when someone's THAT close to my puffy muffy(lmao) and there's no connection, things can't get pretty awkward... Needless to say conversation was flowing easily and before I knew it I was in and outta there... Thank you Paige you are greatly appreciated! \nSide note for all new comers... This location is located by the Bonefish grill side of towne square. They are inside Look Style Society beauty bar store. When you go in there don't bother checking in with the front desk\/ checkin area, head straight up the stairs behind the front desk and follow the signs to the Birthday suit. Hope this helps =)
