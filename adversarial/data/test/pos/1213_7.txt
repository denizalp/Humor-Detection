Totally a fan of this place since before I joined the Military in 04. We enjoy coming to this place to forget about our diet and it's one of my favorite \"dive's\" ever. The Jade chicken is the bomb, the hot sauce is tangy sweet and they go well together in a burro or quesidilla. The Jerk fried rice is great, and the Jerk \/ Pollo Diabllo are great spicy options. I always leave this place so full I'm sick so I guess it's a great place to get out and try. Be sure to take samples if you are new so you can really tell what you like. Guy F was here and he had this expression of indulgence which I seem to mirror every time I eat here. Some say it's hit or miss but this place has never been a miss for me.\n\n\nViva la Bandido!
