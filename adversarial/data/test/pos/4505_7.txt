DO NOT bring your vehicle here!  These pushy clowns LOVE the 'hard sell'.  My experience is that they try to push every extra service (even stuff you don't need) to try and weasel more dollars out of you, often to the point where they make you feel uncomfortable.  This is actually true of the 3 Lube Stops i've been to over the years in this area.  If they want to do more business, they should retrain their staff to NOT be so pushy and assertive!  There are customers (ex. customers, in my case) that will not put up with it!  I now take my vehicle to Valvoline or Conrad's for an oil change.
