Besides the new six-pack dorm building, upgraded computer center in the Illini Union, Panda Express on Green Street, and new dining halls being built AFTER I graduated and thus making me feel like a chump, this restaurant being a new addition to Green Street is the cherry on top! Thanks, U of I, thanks.\n\nIf you're a college student taking your girl (or guy) on a hot date and want to impress but don't have a car, THIS is your spot. Make sure you bring $$$$. It's not for the cheap.\n\nIt's small, trendy and a bit romantic on the inside. You pass by the sushi bar on the way in with seriously the cutest sushi plush dolls sitting inside the display. Try staring into one and being able to say no to its face.\n\nSo, now what?\n\n- Order the Sakanaya roll! Sooo good!\n- *****Make sure to check in on your Yelp app to get your completely free miso soup***** (which was really good)\n\nDefinitely hit up this spot if your wallet allows it!
