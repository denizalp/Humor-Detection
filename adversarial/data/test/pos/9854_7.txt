My beautiful bride and I came here for Valentines day weekend.  I made reservations ahead of time for 530pm and we actually got here right when they opened at 5pm.  There was already a line building up to get in here.  If you plan on coming here make sure to call ahead for reservations just to be safe.  Even though we were early they still sat us at our table right away.  It's a small dining room and it was packed.  So if you don't like eating in a small place maybe just order take out and go to a brewery.  Hey that's not bad idea!  Anyways we were seated and got comfy.\n\n We have been eating a lot of Thai food lately and we both have been in a wide noodles type of mood so that's what we ordered.  First we started with Spring rolls with shrimp in them that were delicious.  We were hungry and ate every roll with no problem.  Like I said we have been eating a lot of Thai and this was up there as one of the best rolls.  Carrie asked for their hot spices to whip up here own spice which turned out pretty good.  I used some it too for my rolls.\n\n It took about 15 to 20 minutes to get our main dish.  I ordered the Phad See Eaw and my wife ordered the Spicy Noodle.  Her dish was really good so check out her review on that.  My Phad See Eaw was good too.  I ate about half of it cause I wanted to leave some to take for home.  I'm glad that I did.  I thought my Phad See Eaw was a solid 4 at first.  I thought at another Thai restaurant my wide noodles were slightly better.  It wasn't until I got home and reheated my food the next day that I liked it even more.  I'm not sure why but sometimes reheated food does it for me and it sure did here.  It's a solid 5 just like a lot of our Yelp friends who love this place.\n\n Overall we had a very nice dinner here and we are looking forward to coming back soon.  It is a little small in there but it's not too bad and it's a decent price for a lot of food.
