So decided to come here and give Blue Fin a try, since everyone has been yelping about this place like crazy with good reviews..\n\nI must say i was a bit disappointed.  Hate to do this but i must write about my experience.\n\nSo a friend and I decided to give this a try for lunch since everyone has been talking about this place. Not to brag or anything but my friend and I know what good sushi tastes like cause duh we are Asian, we have it down to the texture to the temperature and to the flavor.\n\nI'm not sure if the food was just horrible just because it was lunch? But we were in shock how horrible the food was.\n\nFrom what I remembered we ordered the baked mussels. We were like ok this is cool it's on little plates rather than on the shell. As we were chewing the mussels we were about to vomit. NO joke or exaggeration. For starters the mussels were not hot enough. It was not baked long enough so we were chewing cold mussels.\n\nWe decided to ignore that and try the other dishes.\n\nWe ordered the Ahi poke salad, that i must admit was really good, it was spicy and different than all the ahi poke salads we tasted. My friend enjoyed it as well.\n\nThen we ordered the Shumai, Ehhh it was ok nothing too good.. Shumai is shumai they all taste the same in all the sushi places..\n\nI decided to order the crab cakes since i have not seen crab cakes on the menu in a sushi place. I was disappointed. The crab cakes were cold and they tasted old, like they were sitting in the back for awhile.. no joke.\n\nDecided to ignore that as well and we came to the ultimate test. The Nigiri and the Sushi.\n\nSo from what i remember we ordered the salmon nigiri. It was just ok. The temperature was not right it was too cold, and the rice was weird like it was old. I have to give them props at least the texture was good their was no veins at all in their Nigiri.  Same went for the tuna nigiri and all the other nigiri we had.\n\nThe sushi rolls were ok, kinda sucks they didnt do half rolls, I usually order half rolls to make sure i like the sushi.\n\nAlso during lunch time they didn't have Uni ( sea urchin) lunch is 22$ and dinner is 26$ something like that.. a difference of 4$ what does a difference of 4$ do, just add the sea urchin and all the other stuff not included in lunch, that's on the dinner menu.\n\nOverall wasn't to fond of this place. I wouldn't mind giving it a try during the dinner time maybe dinner is much better than lunch.\n\nService was great the waitress was on top of everything and the cooks greet you when you come in and thank you when you leave.\n\nI would give this a try again since i was in total shock of the ratings for this place, maybe i just caught this place on a bad day.
