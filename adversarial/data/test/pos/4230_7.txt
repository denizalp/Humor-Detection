Might honestly be the best burger I've ever had. Umami has held the title for a very long time, but after eating here, I really felt like it might have been topped. I need to hit Umami's soon to judge it one more time. \n\nStill, Holstein's makes a might fine burger and every single bite is amazing. Also check in here with your yelp app for a free beer! Can't beat that. \n\nThey have a huge assortment burgers here and I'm sure they are all good. Service is fast and easy so you won't wait long for your food. \n\nOverall, it might be the best burger in the world if not close. No joke.
