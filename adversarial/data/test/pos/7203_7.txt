Shopped home depot and lowes for the same items. Lowes was atleast 10 to 29 percent more expensive. But this store is really lovely.. Gorgeous home improvement store really. But not a soul working. I heard them calling for a paint consultant literally my entire trip in... \nReally quiet if you need to just get in and out.
