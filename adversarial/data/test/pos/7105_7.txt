I'll be looking for a coffee shop with these same feels back home. If I lived in Montreal, you would find me here daily!! The place is pretty laid back and definitely has that cool European, sipping espresso, crossed leg, chatting thing going. \n\nThere was a line on a Sunday morning, but it moved quickly. The smiling, friendly barista who greeted you warmly and with lots of contagious energy at the front made it all worth the wait. He knew almost everyone's name in the place! It definitely has the small town neighborhood feel. Oh, and it's customary to tip the cheery man behind the counter .50 or more so add that to the price of your beverage. \n\nThey offer nothing fancy here, just good old fashion fantastic grinds, cafe au lat, cappuccinos in a few varieties and espressos. No dairy free milks available as it's a very traditional Italian cafe so I opted for just a house brew, black and it was very good! (That to me is how you can tell the quality of a coffee, if you can go at it with nothing masking the actual taste.) They have cannoli, tiramisu, carrot cake and biscotti ready to go as well. \n\nThe place has old fashion hammered tin ceilings, bar seats by the big front window, bistro tables and is darker by the back, a seat for everyone. There's also apparently a cute courtyard which I did not see. There were families with littles, people getting work done, couples and groups. It's a nice spot for everyone.  \n\nThey're big on soccer so if that's you're thing, head here for a game. Although it's not a bar, I can see this place getting pretty fun during a game they have playing on one of their flat-screens. Lots of obvious Italian pride here! \n\nUgh this place made me roll my eyes at our chain coffee spots back in the states. It's so just not the same! Not fair! It made me realized just how rushed life back home is. Come here if you're used to the places like that. Such a very nice change of pace here! \n\nOh, and it's conveniently located down the block from St Viateur Bagels. Make a stop at both, and you literally have the perfect morning. People were outside on the benches out front, chatting and indulging in the things that make both of the places so popular. Just lovely!
