Best burger in Toronto (for under $10).\n\nThe Detroit Eatery's \"Detroit Burger\" is the ultimate banquet burger.  Large flavourful seasoned meat patty, slice of cheese and toped with back bacon. I prefer mine with a side of home-fries, but regular french-fries or mash potatoes are available.\n\nA local greasy spoon, yes. But in CBC's best burger poll the Detroit was highly rated.\n\nI had to put the ten dollar part in because I know a better burger place just down the street, but it's a twenty dollar burger and thus, in a totally different league.\n\nIf 'ur going there - have a milk shake too! Might as well do the full monty!
