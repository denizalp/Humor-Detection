I don't really want to waste my time writing a review for this place, given lots of people have already voiced their opinions. I just want to address couple of points:\n\n1. Please wash your salad before serving it to me.\n2. Anything that have chicken in it is completely dry, tasteless, and disgusting.\n3. Tortillas are actually pretty good.\n4. Cocktails taste like some 4th grader's chemistry project, absolutely horrible.\n\nThat being said, there are many other Mexican restaurants in Montreal one can try.
