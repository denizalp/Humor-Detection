I just happened to hit my deals button on my yelp app when it showed me a coupon for this place.  Shortly after noticing that I had never had my eyebrows waxed at 31 years old, my female counterpart for the day decided it was time.  Plus, I needed to look pretty for the evening, we were throwing a concert at the Fillmore.\n\nI wasn't going to just walk into a place and have them physically harm me by yanking hairs out, so i went with the $25 pedi and eyebrow special.  Wow, they did such a great job on my feet.  I feel sorry for the lady, I wasn't quite Jim Carrey in Dumb and Dumber bad, but they did need some scrubbing and filing.  Very quick, very professional, and extremely comfy chairs.\n\nThe eyebrow waxing is what it is.  I paid a lady to rip hairs off of my face, not something I want to do on a regular basis.\n\nAll in all, great service at a reasonable price, I was in and out within 30 mins on a Friday afternoon.
