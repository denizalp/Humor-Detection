I received a gift card to this place but never used it. Ended up giving it away to a family member because I stepped into Layers once and looked at the menu - NOTHING VEGAN. \n\nWhen I asked if they had anything vegan the staff was rude. She said \"no\" then rolled her eyes and said \"next.\" \n\nThis place might have good coffee (from what I've heard) but they can't even be bothered to have a little soymilk or almond milk on hand. Apparently, they can't even do a traditional bagel, fresh fruit salad, or just not put cheese on the veggie salad or sandwich.
