You can't really go wrong with frozen yogurt (also called froyo by hip peeps, unfortunately I'm not one). Place seems like a mom and pop frozen yogurt shop, with interior similar to other frozen yogurt chain. \n\nI came here and saw that there weren't much options. I wanted something fruity and all they had were strawberry and pineapple flavors. Both were good but just a generic flavor you can pretty much find at any other frozen yogurt shops. \n\nI did like the topping options. Unlike other frozen yogurt shops, they had toppings found in boba shops like lychee jelly and different flavors of popping boba. \n\nThey sell boba drinks on the side, but seems like boba drinks were more popular than their frozen yogurts. They do have ample drink selections and seemed like thai tea was a big hit during my visit. \n\nFriendly but staffs were stressed out over a group of 3 which is a bit concerning. They seemed overwhelmed. I rather visit frozen yogurt shops with more flavor options so they stand at three stars for now.
