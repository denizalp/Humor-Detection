Presto Cafe always gets a glance from me whenever I drive by it going towards or coming from the 215. My cousin and I live close to this, so we decided to go in and have a late lunch to see what this place was about. \n\nIt's pretty small in size, and the interior is painted a bright lime green with fake potted flowers as table decoration. When you think about it, everything inside is fitting with the cafe's mission. It's a neighborhood cafe -- they use fresh ingredients from local vendors to make the delicious meals here. It's really refreshing to see places that support healthy and fit lifestyles.\n\nThey say that their food is \"healthy comfort food,\" which might seem like an oxymoron when you hear it at first, but it makes me feel a little less guilty for indulging in their fare.\n\nI ordered the Hanger Steak Chimichurri because it sounded amazing. I didn't really wait that long for the food to come out because it surprisingly wasn't that busy when we visited. Anyway, the hanger steak did not disappoint at all! The presentation alone was enticing enough for me to dig in full force. The hanger steak was cooked medium-rare on top of couscous and mushrooms with little dollops of pesto sauce on the sides.\n\nThe meat was perfect. It was succulent and it melted in your mouth. The couscous was cooked risotto-style with the mushrooms mixed in there. The pesto sauce brought everything together with its strong pesto taste. For what it's worth, it was pretty filling (well, to me anyway)!\n\nIt's a small cafe, but the food they have here really packs a punch! Also, with it being healthier than the other dine-in options around you shouldn't be afraid to go all out. Definitely coming back to try out other menu items.
