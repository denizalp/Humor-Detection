Updating this because it's been years and I'm vegetarian now and the banh mi here keep us fed and healthy and happy and wise. They are affordable, fresh and fluffy and crazy delicious. The tofu mushroom is filling and juicy and the fresh pickled veg are so good I want to put them on everything. And they sell them here in mason jars so I can! I also like be the smiling friendly helpful staff here, and the iced Vietnamese coffee is everything good in the world in a cup.
