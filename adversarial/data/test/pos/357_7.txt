Bagels still good, but general manager is a moron. Last time I wandered in about 2pm, they had six bagels for $2,,50 that they normally would just throw away. Nice dude at counter says he can mix up all the bagels (they were already bagged in six) and give me whatever variety I desired. Walked in today and requested the same treatment, but GM with scruffy beard nearly had a cow saying he doesn't normally do this and look what my employee has to go through with all this re-bagging. If that idiot would just mind his own business and not butt into what was already happening, none of my hostility would have came out. I know that jock strap is off on weekends, so that is when I will be back.
