(Lyrics - Mariah Carey - Honey)\n\nHanny got me hooked on you\n\nThink I can have you \nWhen I want you\nI'll simply yelp all my way there\nAnd you're the only one\nIn Phoenix that makes me come running\n\nBecause what you got\nIs far beyond compare\nAnd it's right at Hanny's\nWhen your drinks comes over me\nOh baby, I love your atmosphere\nAlways ready\nFor another round at Hanny's\n\n\nHanny's a little hot spot in downtown PHX.  This place is always packing every time I attend.  The place can get loud especially if the DJ is mixing things up in here.\n\nI usually sit at the bar since seating can be tough to get around here.  I order my whiskey and shared a snack plate with my buddy; cured meats, olives, pistachio nuts, and ciabatta bread.  So far a decent start, but nothing too crazy to rave about.  For our entree we shot for the Carne pizza, Italian sausage, pepperoni, cheese blend, and tomato sauce.  I have to say it might not sound too exciting, but rather enjoyed this pizza.  I would really taste the tomato sauce on such a thin crust which I appreciate.  Sometimes I order a thin crust pizza and everything else along with it is thin including the ingredients, but not here!  \n\nIn the end, Hanny's a go to spot which I generally come downtown.  It's a great atmosphere for drinks and kicks.  I'm can't say the food here is phenomenal, but it'll do the job! - Enjoy!
