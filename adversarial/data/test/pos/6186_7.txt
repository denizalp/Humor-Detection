Such a hidden gem! \n\nThis family run food joint is a restaurant disguised as a fastfood joint. Ok, so it technically is a fastfood place, tucked inside a food court. But the quality of the food they produce is definitely restaurant quality! I absolutely love their green curry chicken and Thai tea! I cannot handle an ounce of spice, but the curry is so good, I couldn't figure out whether I'm crying of pain or bliss with every spoonful because I just can't stop eating it. I also normally don't eat rice, but the green curry sauce mixed with the rice is divine! Gobbled it all up! They make their Thai tea less sweet than the traditional, which for me is the perfect amount! (Traditional Thai tea is sooo sweet, probably sweeter than bbt)\n\nThe husband and wife team are absolute sweethearts and you really feel appreciated being one of their patrons. Also, if you ever have a chance to chat with the wife, you'll find out she studied culinary cuisine in France and can whip up some delicious macarons made to order! :) \n\nGreen curry with rice + Thai tea + macarons + lovely folks and service = makes me one happy camper. :)\n\nDefinitely recommend and I already go often :)
