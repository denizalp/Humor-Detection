This is nothing like a Benihana style teppanyaki place and I'm not a big fan of the uber-teppan chain. It's a teriyaki chicken bowl fast food place. Walked in, it didn't smell or look appetizing so we left. FYI - Fellow Yelpers a teppanyaki place typically cooks on a flat grill in front of the seated customers, look it up.
