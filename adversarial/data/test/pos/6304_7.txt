Passed by this place around 3pm and saw this place but it's empty... I thought instead of waiting a long line up at Alley, let's give this place a try...\n\nStudied the menu, they have variety of matcha ice cream\/drinks and other tea item. And I guess since the name of this shop is matcha, I would guess its focus is matcha ... but then also see they offer charcoal flavour soft ice cream which sounds interesting but I only have tummy for one ice cream... what a decision I have to make... lol. I decided to ditch the matcha and try the charcoal because I never had one before. Maybe there are other place offer charcoal flavour, please let me know. Anyway, the ice cream looks really black, sure looks like there are charcoal in it but I really don't know how charcoal should taste like. Maybe I should buy a bag of BBQ charcoal in Canadian tire and take a byte and compare.. :)\n\nWell, it just taste like regular ice cream, no special taste or aroma. If charcoal is good for you in some way, I guess why not. Sure it's fun eating it. It looks pretty cool, pure black with a shine. And you should share this with your female other half and make her smile after taking a few byte of the ice cream.. haha! I would recommend, which I did also, ordered a hot tea just so after the ice cream, you have something to rinse your teeth with to get rid of the charcoal from the teeth.\n\nI ordered the white peach oolong tea, nothing particularly special, a normal cup of tea..\n\nSo, without trying the matcha item here, my rating is probably slightly above 3 stars given the price is not cheap either. Total comes to $11 bucks for ice cream and tea. But it's a cool little place, and the service is friendly and quite accommodating , give it a try!
