I dig the name.  I have always had a crush on the word Hawaiian.  It is definitely the four vowels in a row, arranged in mirror image form.  Very appealing on the eyes.  That being said, that's about all I can say (good) about this place.  This is how the ordering process went...\n\nMe: Can I get a Kona Blend?\nHer: Do you want that black?\nM: No, go ahead and add a little non-fat to it?\nH: Non-Fat Milk? You got it.  Anything else?\nM: Yeah, can I get a few sweeteners on the side?\nH: Sure. Pink, Blue or Yellow? Hehehe...\nM: Um, Yellow.\nH: You got it, see you at the window.\n\nAs much as I liked the way she asked Pink, Blue, or Yellow, I can't help but feel a bit short changed here.  The total for a 20 oz coffee was $2.11... At Starbucks it is $1.83 methinks... Lets do a compare and contrast of the two.\n\nMaui Wowi\nOld and Run Down\nBelow Average Coffee\nAbove Average Price\n\nStarbucks\nNew, Clean and Appealing\nAbove Average Taste\nAbout Average Price (for plain coffee)\n\nGranted they serve smoothies and other stuff, but overall it was disappointing.
