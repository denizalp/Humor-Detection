When I say I'm going to the park, this is the park to which I am going.  It's a beautiful, amply forested piece of land, with a large dog park and some interesting and challenging trails.  My usual routine involves taking my fuzzy four-legged companion around the long Sierra Loop trail. I enjoy the scenery and peace; he enjoys the smells and squirrels.  We then end the afternoon at the dog park where he burns off the remainder of his energy and socializes with other canines.  The dog area is equipped with a watering station and a hosing-down station.\n\nThe lakes are good fishing, if you're into that sort of thing.  The nature center is charming and has a classroom for kid-oriented educational activities.  There's also a gift shop, so buy a tee shirt and support the facility!  \n\nA final point of interest is the farmhouse ruins off the main trail... if you can manage to sneak out there with no one else around, it's quite tranquil.\n\nReedy Creek Park is one of Charlotte's treasures!
