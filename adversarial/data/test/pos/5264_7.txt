I've always been a BIG fan of the Gap Outlet, but I can honestly say that i've scored the best deals at this location! In years past, I was shopping for me, but now at 7.5 months pregnant, i've been shopping for baby!\n\nI ended up getting the Gap Credit Card a few years back because 75% of our family wardrobe comes from Gab, Banana, Old Navy, etc. and it is SO worth it because you get loads of cash back, extra discounts, and free shipping when you order online. \n\nThat said, I popped in here to take a look at their baby clothes this past weekend and oh my gosh - they were having the biggest sale ever! Not only are their baby clothes adorable and good quality, but when you catch them on sale + CC perks, they're basically FREE! Their clearance section was an additional 40% off of the discounted price and then for being a cardholder, I got ANOTHER 30% off of my entire purchase! You guys, I almost felt guilty for walking out of there for under $30 with about 10 pieces of baby clothing and a dress for me. Is this real life?! \n\nI refuse to spend full price on kid's clothes because they grow out of them so fast! It is safe to say that i'll be buying most of Sterling's clothes here throughout his lifetime! The gals at the counter celebrated my deals with me and were so nice. See you guys again soon!
