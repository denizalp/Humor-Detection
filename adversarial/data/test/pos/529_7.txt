This review is long overdue. POLISHED IS THE ONLY SALON TO GET YOUR NAILS DONE IN LAS VEGAS! I've been coming here for a while now and slipped up by going to a salon near my house and after comparing their processes, I had to write the review.\nFirst of all, the salon is huge. Rows and rows of nail stations, plenty of spa pedicure stations and they need it for the incredible amount of business they bring in. I was referred to Polished because all of the industry girls go there because they want their nails to look top notch, and I see why. Its clean, everyone is on the same page, they're extremely organized with their booking process, etc. and are ran like a real professional business.\nThey have a huge selection of polishes and definitely specialize in the gel process. They remove the gel polish with by filing it down rather than using harsh acetone to soak it off. They're nice and quick. They use a hard gel so nails don't break off.\nI CAN GO A FULL MONTH WITH ONLY ONE GEL APPLICATION!!!\nThe only reason I need to go get my nails redone is because they're just grown out. They don't crack. My nails still look great after 3 weeks and I'm extremely rough on my hands. After going to the other salon, 3 of my long natural nails cracked in half!!! I swore that I would never go anywhere but Polished Nails again. \nIf you're considering trying this nail salon out, take my word and just book the appointment. You won't be sorry. All the ladies\/men I've ever had work on my nails here have been great.
