Beans and rice and beans and rice!!! And boyyyyyyy these were good!\n\nNow there is not whole lot of vegan here, but who cares! Those BEANS!!!!!!\n\nThe plantains were bomb and their hot sauce is to die for!\n\nNow I'm all about garlic but unfortunately theirs is more like an oil chutney. I drained off the oil and ate the garlic. \n\nIf you could eat beans and rice everyday 3x a day...go here and get them BEANS!!!! \nThey have a lot of love in them.\n\nOwner is very sweet! Check out my pics!
