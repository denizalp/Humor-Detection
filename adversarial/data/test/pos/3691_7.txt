Online poker is legal in Canada!\n\nIf you're a live cash game grinder, you'll understand the excitement.\n\nA great card room just 15 minutes outside central Montreal where 18 year olds are allowed to play the game.  Solid action and more importantly, an excellent place to play against and learn the latest online honed and tested strategies (for those of us in the States).\n\nComforts including f&b comps great but come at a price; very high rake.\n\nNote:  This review is for cash game action during the WPT500, WPT Montreal, and WPT Deepstack.  Non major tourney action and player mix may be different.\n\n\nEnvironment:  Clean, well lit, with extremely comfortable seats.  Lots of low and mid stakes agro action.  Good selection of f&b comps for cash game players.  Below average wait time for drink service.   \n\nGame Mix:  1\/2, 2\/5, 5\/5, 5\/10 NLH with 10\/25 spread during major tourneys.  2\/2 and 5\/5 PLO.\n\nPlayer Mix: Low limit games (1\/2 and 2\/5 NLH and 2\/2 PLO) mostly local regulars recreational payers.  Mid limit almost entirely tourney players with online experience (capitalize on this if you're a live cash game specialist).\n\nStaff:  Excellent dealers; accurate, able to carry on a conversation, keep the game moving, and can properly calculate the pot.  Floors are knowledgeable, fair, and very capable of enforcing rules to keep action moving.\n\nWait Time:  Long. Further it is almost impossible to get at table change.  Good thing the seats are comfortable.  Get on the list before you arrive by calling or texting. \n\nBuy-in's, Straddle, and Rake (CAD):   Min \/ Max buyin for games standard (1\/2 NHL $40-$200, 2\/5 NLH $100-$500, 5\/5 NLH $200-$1k, 5\/10 $500-$3k, 2\/2 PLO $100-$500, 5\/5 PLO $500-$1.5k).   Mississippi straddle.  High rake\/drop.  \n\nPromotions and Room Rates:  Progressive bad beat jackpots for both NLH and PLO, various splashed pot promos.  See website for further details.  Discounts on room rates with major tourney registration.\n\nAll around enjoyable card room but if you're a grinder, stick to mid limit else the rake will eat the game.
