My breakfast was lukewarm.  The turkey sausage was small and thin to me.  My hash brown was lukewarm to cold.  They screw up my husband's order oftentimes and the servers are not hospitable.  My husband is a meat man and always asks for extra bacon and they have omitted either the bacon or the sausage on more than a couple of occasions.  \n\nI did like my coffee however which was IMO medium brew.  And the location is convenient.  It is a fast food joint, but still has a modern look.
