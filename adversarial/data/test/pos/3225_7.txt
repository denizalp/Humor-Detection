Fxxk, the worst hotel ever! I came back to my hotel room at 2am. And preparing for a shower, but no god damn water coming out. My girlfriend was so upset, such a luxury hotel, but just worst! I called up for the guest service, they said their water is down, need to wait for couple hours. I was like WTF! Are you serious? He said he could get us another room. (We were at the West tower, they will change us to East tower). I said okay. After I came to the registration desk, they told me the system is down, FUCK! Needs to wait another 20mins. Worst experience ever! It's really happening! Ruining my fxxking night. It's been very exhausting day. FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK!!!!!!!! After I got to my new room, it was a long damn hair in the bath tube. What a wonderful hotel! NEVER FUCKING AGAIN. So fucking pissed, fuck!
