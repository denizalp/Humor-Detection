I was intrigued about Kekkou and their Asian gelato that I had to take the opportunity and just go.  Once a video rental \/ ice cream parlour, this new place I think will be a wonderful addition to what is becoming an increasingly more Asian influed street.  On paper, I think it offers up a niche market of gelato lovers (like myself) and blending with common Asian flavours that I used to have as a kid (just in a gelato form).\n\nThe environment is great, clean, bright, but rather a quaint place.  No tables, but just the window sill\/seatery at the front area.  Staff are pretty nice and offering to allow customers to try different flavours before ordering.  The gelato containers look like those soup canisters from those huge Chinese buffets so I thought that was kind of amusing.\n\nAs for the gelato, it's pretty good!  I ordered the small portion ($3.75) for two flavours and I'm pretty happy for the price given that I was prepared to pay $5 (for one, they're really unique flavours so I just thought it came with a premium and I normally pay around $5 when I'm at an Italian gelateria.)  They packed my cup with a decent amount of gelato (I got Jackfruit and Lemon Chrys)\n\nBoth gelatos taste really good, the Lemon Chrys is predominantly lemon as that's the more distinct taste but it's really refreshing without it going overly acidic.  To put it simply, it's like a floral lemonade.  And as for the Jackfruit, could taste bits and pieces of Jackfruit which was paired nicely with the creaminess of the gelato, although dare I say it was a touch on the creamy side.\n\nOverall, I'm already planning for my next visit to Kekkou.  See you soon!
