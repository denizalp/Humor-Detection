.    5 Stars...  Woohoo!  As good as it gets!\n\nThis and the Rocky River Westwood Town Center locations are the two where I'll get take-out, but this is a general review for all McDonald's.  I'm not a regular, but it's nice to know I can get something cheap, decent, and fast when I'm too busy to cook, and on my way home. \n\nThere are very few places where one can have a fairly-priced filling meal and beverage for under 5 dollars, and less than 3 from their Value menu.  If there's a problem (very rarely), they're always quick to apologize and quick to resolve.  And it's wonderful that they employ senior citizens, since some Social Security checks are barely enough to survive on.\n\nI wonder if Ray Croc ever imagined that with his first location set up decades ago, it would replicate itself---and encourage competition, too---throughout nearly the entire globe!  Amazing, really, when you think about it.  McDonald's---and others---make the \"eating out\" experience, something even the most budget-minded, lower-income families and individuals can now enjoy.   YAY for the convenience and affordable pricing of all fast food spots---there's something out there for everybody---but McD's is my choice.    \n\nWhere else can you find an energetic 2-year-old being just as happy as a hardly-slowing-down-still-energetic 75-year-old on a fixed income, eating their burgers and fries... or where can a judge, a doctor, or an attorney take their tray and sit down at a table next to a smiling dad and his crew of fresh-faced talkative young sons sharing an afternoon out...or next to a couple of hungry T-shirted dusty construction workers...or a group of cute, perpetually giggling pre-teeners...or next to someone who could very well be a homeless person---blue plastic bag of guarded essentials near-by---savoring a rare and special treat.  They're ALL eating Happy Meals.\n\n~\nCre-e-e-ch.  Time to put on the brakes.  \nOne thing that really irks me is having the government trying to dictate what chains serve, i.e., fat and sugar content in foods and beverages.  Totally unfair to those who watch their intake---AND the franchise owners.  Nothing's going to stop some people from overindulging in poor choices, and then putting on weight---whether from ignorance of healthy eating habits, depression, or disinterest in cooking.  If they don't get enough \"bad stuff\" from fast food spots, they can always rely on bakery, beverage, candy, and bread departments in grocery and convenience stores to make up for it, easily supplementing their personal daily dietary requirements.   \n\nRather than throwing so much of the blame for fat and sugar content at the fast fooders or products found in stores---another reason, and one maybe even MORE responsible for obesity---is that handy, innocent-enough-looking rascal found in probably every home, that encourages over-eating.  Begs for it.  Very easily and conveniently it heats up or cooks up anything---in seconds.  The naughty little microwave.\n\n~\nAnyone remember McDonald's fabulous fries from maybe 10-12 years ago?  The ones dropped into beef lard, or pork fat, or whatever that unhealthy heart-clogging greasy stuff was?   Delicious.  ah-h-h-h....give me...a second...please.......   \nthanks---had a momentary blissful reverie.   Regretably, they're gone forever.  Just a crunchy, salty, oh-so-tasty, but now nearly-faded, memory. \n  \nEven though I miss those bad little buggers, McDonald's, and know you really didn't want to take them off your menu---I'm still lovin' you.\n.
