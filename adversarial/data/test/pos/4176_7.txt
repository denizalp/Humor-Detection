Insomnia cookies is a disaster. Friends and I ordered through grubhub, and waited 2 and a half HOURS for our ice cream cookie sandwiches. Called in a few times and people on the phone were just annoyed and condescending. Once the delivery came, we brought it inside and realized they had not given us forks or napkins. We ate it with our fingers and didn't even enjoy the chocolate ice cream, as it seemed to actually be frozen yogurt. \nNot ordering a delivery from here again.
