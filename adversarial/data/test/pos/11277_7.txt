The tire center was rude I stood there for 10 minutes before being acknowledged. Then the guy rudely asked can I help you. I said yes I need to check and air up my tires with nitrogen. He point to the house and said something that I couldn't hear and I said what. He proceeded to turn around and continue working. I then pulled up and sat there for 10 minutes thinking he was going to come since I didn't hear what he said. Nope nothing someone didn't even come to check on me to see if I needed help or anything. It was the guy in white glasses. Worst experience ever. I'm not an idiot I know hoe to put air in my tires and check then but the fact he just stayed back there working trying to answer my questions I thought was so rude.
