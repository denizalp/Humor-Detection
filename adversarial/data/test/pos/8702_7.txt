Studio B Buffet was GREAT. First of all, just like Paolo D. mentions, the decor is awesome. Very modern and very nice. I also liked the tables - very minimalistic yet nice looking, not the usual plain boring seats you see at restaurants. One of the things that first astonished me was the free, unlimited wine and beer. I have never been to any other buffet that offers this. \n\nHeading to the food line, I was surprised to see how much food there was. The food line was very long and offered everything such as American, Italian, Greek\/Mediterranean, Italian, Meats, Chinese, Mexican, Japanese, etc. Most of the food I tried was excellent. Some of it was okay, but that's understandable since it would be hard to have every item out of so many to taste great. I particularly liked the several fishes I tried and also the baked salmon at the cutting station. The sashimi and salads were also great.\n\nLast but not least, I loved the dessert options. I tried the creme brulee and chocolate gelato.. yummy. If you're looking for a new buffet to try out, check out the Studio B Buffet. I definitely want to go back next time.
