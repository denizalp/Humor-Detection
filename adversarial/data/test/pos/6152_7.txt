I've heard of this place for a while now, but we always wanted to try it when it wasn't too busy.\n\nWalking into Khao San Road at 11:20am (10 minutes before they open), we were able to get a view of the beautiful tiles in Khao San Road. These wonderful tiles stretched from the floors all the way to the top of a two story floor. There wasn't a wait line when we got there - closer to lunch, many people came in for lunch. Washrooms are located on the second floor, which was home to a bar.\n\nFor the weekday lunch, we decided to order a curry of the day, which was the panang curry ($11.85) and one of the signature dishes, a Khao Soi ($14.95). The dishes came pretty quickly, it might be because we were the first ones there, but they are quite small compared to the typical portions served in Toronto. \n\nThe Panang curry came with a small scoop of rice and another bowl with a bit of curry and lots of chicken (we had the chicken option). The curry was quite tasty and was very rich in herbs. It wasn't too spicy as we were able to choose a variety of spice levels.\n\nI REALLY LIKED THE KHAO SOI. Coming in a thick curry broth, the noodles were not my favourite, but we ordered an extra jasmine rice for $3. The curry was sort of sweet and delicious, perfect for a curry rice. Extremely tasty!! The Khao soi also had crispy topping added to it giving the plating points an extra A++!
