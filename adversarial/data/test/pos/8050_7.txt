John has been taking care of our taxes for years and we are very happy with his professionalism. \n\nBefore seeing John, we get everything prepared by visiting the web site, download and fill out the forms since we have other expenses to claim. Less than 30 minutes and we are done. We got our tax return in about 2 weeks!!
