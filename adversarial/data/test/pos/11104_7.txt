Went this past weekend. Had a funeral to attend. Being that I am a Diamond member it was cheaper for me to stay at a Resort than book a hotel. I figured it would be nicer as well. Well...I was wrong. My daughters and I arrived about 5. Check in was quick but was madness. So many people they were just rushing along which was fine with me. I get my keys go to the concierge desk they give me some coupons and a pool bag with some waters. Go on my way. We get to our room unload our cars shower real quick and leave to go visit with family. We don't come back until close to midnight. At this point we just want to go to bed. \nAs I am getting ready to go to bed I notice a bug on my pillow. Ok not a big deal is one bug. I kill it. Then I notice another bug. I kill it. Then I notice a third bug. My daughter calls the front desk. They say they ate sending security to check it out. (Like really what is security going to do) So as we are waiting, security takes forever like 20 minutes. I actually end up walking to the front desk. More about that later.\nWhile waiting I discover a smashed bug on the wall above the bed. A nasty goo on the wall and crusted stuff that looks like dried boogers. Not mention found more bugs crawling on the walls and floors.\nAfter waiting 20 minutes I walk to the front desk all to wait like another 10 minutes. I have pics on my phone of all the bugs roaming around my room. All the front desk tells me is that unfortunately its bug season,and it sometimes causes a problem and there is nothing she can do besides have EcoLab spray the room the next day. After just looking at her she tells me she can give me another room which obviously I take.\nMeanwhile security finally shows up while I'm at the front desk. He just tells my daughter that he has no idea what to do about bugs. Its bug season and leaves. I finally make it back to the room. So at almost 1 in the morning we're moving all of our stuff to anther room. Luckily it was across the way but that didn't solve the problem. We finally get settled in close to 2 and my youngest lays down and looks up. There is a bug on the ceiling. To be perfectly honest at this point in so tired i don't even care. Between the 6 hr drive from Ca and the late night visit,  I figured one was better than a room full. \nNeedless to say the next morning all of us were in less than desirable moods. And we still had the funeral to go to. I get into bed the next night and I'm half asleep when my girls start flipping out. A bug is crawling on me!  Again I was so exhausted from not sleeping the night before and being out all day that day I just told them to get a tissue and flush it down the toilet.\nI mention this at check out and all I'm told is to make sure i note it on the review they send out. Which I did but it's not like I'm going to hear anything back. Thinking about it if I were at a hotel I would have been comped for at least my 1st night stay due to the inconvenience of having to change rooms or I would have been upgraded. I got neither. Next time I'm in the area I'll spend the few more points and stay at the Scottsdale Links. Its much nicer and only a few blocks away. For being a Diamond property I was disappointed.
