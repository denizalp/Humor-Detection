There wasn't even a heading for this one.\n\nOne thing I noticed about Yelp, is that there's no hangout section in the bars category. It took me awhile to decide to categorize this as a sports bar.\n\nThere is a bar, some video poker machines away from the bar, and a dining room area with a pretty elaborate kitchen, so I wouldn't call it a dive bar. I have even seen guys stand in line one Friday when I first came here, as one of the bars that has a cashier where you can cash your paychecks at.\n\nI have been here several times, it's a good Man's Bar. And by that, I mean it could be on the Man Show as a good afternoon hangout. It's a place just off strip for construction workers to go before going home. \n\nThe kitchen is GREAT. Prices are good and I never had to worry about quality. The first time I came here, it was a football night and families were actually all over the place. They used to have a janky setup where you scraped your own plates in a bus tub, it was like a cafeteria, but the steaks and appetizers were\/ are worth it. \n\nAnd then a few visits ago, they redid the whole dining room area. Instead of the awkward mini stage, there was a bank of televisions for sports, the table chair seating was replaced by nice dining tables and furniture. And gone were the bus tub setups! \n\nSo, I called it a Man's bar, but saw that families go there, too, which is nice. It separated The Lift from those janky afternoon hangout bars that are just filled with smoke and hardened old Robert Duval character types.\n\nThey serve sodas in cans, which is interesting to me. I actually like it because you know the soda 1) will be crisp and 2) not taste all syrupy or stale from the gummed up soda gun\/ fountain that's been in use since the 70's. It always seems strange to me when a bartender gives you a can that they or sometimes you pop. Is it me or does everyone give you a look when you pop a can open, as if you smuggled a beer into a movie theater? Or does that sound make you look just to see what is being opened?\n\nOverall a great place I frequent.
