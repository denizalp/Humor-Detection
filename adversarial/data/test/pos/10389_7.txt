Granted we only walked around the Venetian, Palazzo, and the Mandalay but I have to say Mandalay Bay has the cutest guys. Yes i know you guys already know my hormones are raging at the moment but seriously. Mandalay has the biggest selection of hot, young guys. Kinda frat boy-ish but cute nonetheless. \n\nI'm not sure if it was part of the Mandalay or just in the connector section but it has a bunch of really cool restaurants and lounges (eyecandy, bayside buffet, shanghai lilly, j-pop, etc). There was this really cool wine bar\/restaurant that had a wine elevator made of glass. Very snazzy.\n\nand omg the Penthouse. Our friends had a suite in the Penthouse and it was bigger than my house. It had like 4 bedrooms, a theatre, and six bathrooms. The view was magnificent. \n\nSo it begs the question, are you a hot frat boy? Do you want to share a penthouse with me?
