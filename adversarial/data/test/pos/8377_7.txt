DO NOT MOVE HERE!!!!!\n\nThis place is a dump!! The website shows one side. Reality is quite different. NO FURNISHED apartments. The website is a lie. Ask about the vacancy rate. Don't be surprised if half the complex is empty. Gee, wonder why!\n\nThe leasing representatives in the front office misrepresent the amount of rent for unfurnished apartments. Their stupidity will cost me $76.00 more per month in rent for the one year lease. No apologies. Nothing. \n\nThey said they will send me copies of all the paperwork signed. Did I receive them? No, not until I made a special trip back to their office and stood for twenty minutes while they dug them up and copied them.\n\nThe complex is dirty all the time. Trash is on  the grounds EVERYWHERE! No one cleans up around here at all! the dumpsters are regularly filled by everyone on the east side of the city. Slobs drive through at 5:00 and 6:00 in the morning every day digging through the trash. Nice wake up call, don't you think?\n\nNo one follows the rules around here. Disgusting old blankets hanging in the windows. Abandoned old cars left in the parking lots. Children left unsupervised outside playing with trash in the streets while others ride around on their scooters in between cars risking being hit by traffic in the complex. \n\nSecurity? Some guy sitting on his fat a___ eating and texting on his cellphone. \n\nThe pools are closed and locked. Call the office and request to have them opened when it's above 85 during the day? \"we will take care of it for you, Sir.\" NOTHING. The pool has been closed and locked since I moved in 45 days ago. I was told they are getting ready to close it for the winter - in the desert. Hey, don't bother. They are already closed. Job done!\n\nI called the management company to ask them about any of this. Surprise! No answer. That's their style. Ignore and hide. Too busy buying more properties, so they can continue acting like slum lords. \n\nJust telling it like it is. Think twice before moving here!!
