After a successful night of clubbing in early October, my friend said he was going to The Tuscany to get $4.99 steak and eggs and offered to bring some back for me. I'd never heard of such a thing and was skeptical about how good a $5 steak would be. I also don't like eating late at night but he told me I'd regret it if I didn't.\n\nI was starving by the time he got back since I stayed up waiting for him to return. My take-out box had steak, eggs, hashbrowns, and toast. The steak, to be honest, was barely edible and had a ton of fat. Another friend, who was also starving, thought it was delicious and ate most of it. The eggs were scrambled, pretty bland, and could've used some salt. So... why 4 stars?\n\nThe Loaded Hashbrowns -- it's $1 more to get them loaded, but do it anyway (uh, it's only a $1). I can promise you you won't regret it, because it's the most delightfully delicious concoction of hashbrowns, gravy, cheese, and only God knows what else (crack?); especially when you're starving at 4 AM. I'd pay $5.99 just for these hashbrowns alone.\n\nSo, go. Marilyn's steak obviously won't be the best you've ever had, but for $5, who's complaining?
