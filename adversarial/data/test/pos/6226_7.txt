Everything in Vegas is an imitation of something from somewhere else. Famous restaurants in NYC, LA, Chicago, Yountville, all open outposts in Vegas. So when I discovered a true Vegas restaurant that is one of a kind, it was like travelling back in time. \n\nMichael's is THAT kind of a restaurant. \n\nIt is truly unique and authentic Vegas experience, the traditional, classy, old school Vegas. When the mobs used to run the town. When public nudity was frowned upon. When a magical oasis sprung up in the middle of a dessert and drew people from all over in. \n\nDon't let the off-putting South Point Casino (and rodeo boys) deter you from visiting. The fact that it is in an unsuspecting corner of a kitschy casino - apparently they literally moved it from the old spot into this new spot - makes it even more fascinating. \n\nThe meal was enough to feed a village. My tip? Basically skip lunch for the sake of dinner. Trust me. Also allot at least 3 hours for dinner. After all the courses, it's essentially a French dining experience.  \n\nEveryone's meal started with a massive pickled plate of beets, carrots, cucumbers and assorted pickles. We ordered fresh stone crab appetizers on a decadent ice bowl, with a bib I could not refuse. The table-side Caeser salad was so involved it required two people. The dressing was maybe the best garlic to lemon ratio I've ever had. The Michael J's salad had avocados and similar ingredients, and was equally refreshing. \n\nIn the middle of our meal came a palate cleansing lemon sorbet with Dom Perignon with the perfect little bit of lemon rinds. Some other unique details of the service include the almost kitschy massive wine glasses with golden letters \"Michael's restaurant\" on the side and the beer that was put on an ice bucket the way one would serve champagne. \n\nAs for entrees, the Chateaubriand for two just blew me away. The cut was unbelievably tender, and both bearnaise and hollandaise sauce decorated the plate. Asparagus, baked tomatoes, broccoli and carrots were perfectly pan-cooked, again with table-side service. \n\nAt this point I may have loosened the buttons on my pants. \n\nDue to time constraints, we had to skip the key lime pie (flown in fresh every day from Key West) and plethora of cheesecakes. In its place was a complimentary dessert plate of chocolate and white chocolate dipped strawberries, petite fours, chocolate covered kiwis, bananas and pineapples.\n\nThere is no doubt I will go back to Michael's every time I visit Vegas. It's a pilgrimage, no, a right of passage, an homage to the history of the city. And if you don't want to get too philosophical, it's really just a really superb meal.
