I am totally not sure why people complain. EOS is super cheap with upgraded equipment. I have been going to this gym forever (even though you'd never be able to tell) and I really enjoy it. \n\nFrom time to time they implement crazy policies, but they seem to vanish rather quickly. They have a really great selection of classes, a cinema, tons of equipment, an indoor pool and etc. I wish they had an indoor track, but maybe one day. I heard they were doing some sort on renovations.\n\nI will say that they don't have the friendliest staff. Not everyone, but for example, the Group Exercise Manager - Rude! There is a pretty high turnover and eventually all the rude people disappear. Overall though, it's pretty good.
