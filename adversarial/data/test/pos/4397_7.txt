I like tacos and they sell some decent gourmet-ish ones. I have been there twice now and had a variety of options. I have almost stopped eating meat entirely so this time around I tried the fish and tofu. On my prior visit, I had beef, chicken and pork. I thought the beef was the best option. The spice is not too overwhelming. I enjoy my food very spicy and the ghost pepper sauce was not too crazy. The atmosphere is nice. I enjoy coming to places where I feel comfortable and in my \"element\". Usually this is a bar type setting. I appreciate that this is a bar that serves semi-healthy and fresh tasting food. My friend and I were driving around aimlessly yesterday and after about 20 miles of cruising we ended up here. The beer selection is pretty good. And now that I come to think of it, 806 was a terrible place. I think I only liked it because good things happened a couple times after going there. Barrio is a good addition to Tremont.
