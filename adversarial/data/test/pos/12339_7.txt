Some of you will look at this review and wonder has she lost her mind giving 5 stars to a fast food faux asian restaurant?  No, I'm perfectly sane as I write this.  I have been to Pei Wei many times over the last year.  Is it authentic?  No.  Is it tasty?  Yes. Is it easy on the wallet?  Yes. Are there healthy options?  Yes. Does my daughter like it?  Yes! I have enjoyed many different dishes here.  Rice bowls, noodle bowls, kung pao, pad thai and everything has been good and I was satisfied. I have always had good service at this location too.  The staff is friendly and accomadating, even on a super busy night. I love that you can get brown rice too.  My daughter and I can eat here for under $20.  That's pretty good for a decent meal.  All these things combined make me want to give Pei Wei 5 stars.  But more than that, my daughter loves their Lo Mein and she will eat every last bite almost every time!  I know what I'm getting when I walk in and I know it will be good.  Authentic or not, I still love Pei Wei!
