I'm going to have to agree with the 2 and 3 star reviews on here. \n\nI wasn't impressed at all with this place, nor was I impressed with the food. I usually consider sushi as \"food made by Japanese wizards\", but this time it just felt thrown together for how long I waited..\n\nThe order took over 20 mins to prepare for 2 maki sets, which were priced considerably HIGHER than some of the best spots in the area (Raaw or Koja, for instance).\n\nTo be fair, the vegetarian maki set was actually really well done with the flayed avocado on the top and the lettuce bed of garnish, but the salmon\/tuna maki set looked like they just threw it into the styrofoam container in a big damned hurry... Additionally, they were the POOREST CUTS of fish I have tasted in a sushi dish to date... Boo.\n\nYour safest bet is to take a 15-minute stroll over to one of the 3 other sushi gems in Liberty Village instead (From high-to-low : Raaw, Koja, InJapan) and get your fix there. It's cheaper, and miles beyond what you'll be left with here...
