We went to Anejo for a late-night dinner and drinks.  Being from Los Angeles I know a fair bit about Mexican food and Tequila, so we were really excited.\n\nThe tequila selection was definitely decent - I'd like to try a flight sometime, but I was really hoping to be \"sold\" on the idea by my waiter, who never mentioned it.  We settled on margaritas, my boyfriend had an original and I had a Mango.  I felt the margaritas were decent but wished they weren't so sweet.  I asked for salt on my rim instead of sugar which helped.  I will say, that both my bf and I make homemade margaritas all the time with freshly squeezed lime juice so we are spoiled.  I really wish that a restaurant that is a \"tequila bar\" would serve a real margarita with lime juice instead of sweet mix, or so much agave.\n\nSecond, the food.  We ordered the Queso Fundido, which I thought tasted like pizza in a bowl.  Was delicious, but hard to eat - my suggestion is for them to add another type of softer cheese to this to provide a more dip like texture which would be easier to eat on a chip.  I ordered the Short Rib Tacos (3), which were underwhelming - where's the flavor guys - the meat was bland, and the condiments boring.  Also, the salsas they served in the little glass bowls were really bland and I missed a real pico de gallo or a table salsa to dip the chips in.  Next time I guess we will try the guacamole.\n\nMy boyfriend had the Mole Chicken which he thought was okay, however it lacked the depth of flavor that we would have liked.  The complexity and layers of flavor of a real mole are something we were looking forward to and this was just, basically a standard sauce without much gusto.\n\nFor dessert - we had the molten chocolate cake with tequila berries which I thought was delicious and memorable.\n\nI feel that the ambiance at Anejo is cute, they are lacking in the food and drink department however which is what will bring their customers back once the \"newness\" of the establishment wears off.  Also for the same price we could dine in a really amazing restaurant like Ox and Angela, or Una or somewhere that I find the food and atmosphere to be first rate.
