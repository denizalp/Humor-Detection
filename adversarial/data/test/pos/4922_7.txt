No idea why the reviews are so low here. I've shopped at nearly two dozen Harris Teeter supermarkets in the Charlotte area and another dozen around Maryland, Virginia, North and South Carolina. This one seemed perfectly adequate. Same layout as others with produce, meats and seafood, frozen, groceries, beer and wine, personal care, etc. Wide aisles, well lit, shopping carts with four good wheels.\n\nOn a Saturday afternoon, the shelves were well stocked and well leveled. There were no queues at the register and I was able to run my few bits through the self-checkout speedily. An associate was there immediately to help with one item that needed approval.\n\nLarge parking lot and the cart corrals were clear.
