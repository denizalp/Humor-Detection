I read all of the great 5 star reviews and wanted to give this shop a chance.  Big mistake!  My car was misdiagnosed by Mike...he ordered an unnecessary part which I did not even need  soaking me for $350.00 then quotes me an additional $1800.00 to fix the car.  I then took another mechanic who fixed the problem for $340.00 out the door.  Save yourself some money, time, and aggregation pick another shop...and Mike stop having your friends write all of these BS 5 star reviews!!!
