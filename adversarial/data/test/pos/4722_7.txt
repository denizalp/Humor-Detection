Our first time to shake shack in Arizona. My brilliant wife and I have been in nyc and Boston but never in AZ. Came here on a Saturday when the outside enough was 115+ so the mall was packed and SS was paced as well. Quick ordering a nd we found a seat right away which was very lucky. \n\nShake shack burger: standard not customer. Lettuce tomato mayo. I should have gotten it with what I like. Be sure to do that. It was kinda bland. \n\nBacon cheddar: much better. The smoky bacon was very nice and this was a much better burger. \n\nChicken shack: the best of the bunch. Not as good as chick-Fil-a but good in its own right. Piping hot. Crispy crust. Fresh tasting. Very good. \n\nRegular fries: sort of bland. Could have used more salt or seasoning. Good Potato flavor. \n\nCheese fries: best of the 2 fries. The cheese was good on these fries and made up for the lack of salt on the plain. \n\nSalted Carmel shake with malt: wow really good. The malt came thru so well. I love that they have a small size. Just right for a desert after burgers and fries. \n\nPlace was paved but clean. Service was 5\/5. Food was 5\/5. The food was 4\/5 overall. I feel hopadady burgers is much better.
