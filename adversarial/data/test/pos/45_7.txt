Wasn't sure what to expect because most Mac & Cheese at restaurants is overrated.  There are two sizes, a snack size and  a regular.  The regular is relatively large. They had 3 specials and\/or Plain Mac or build you own with about 6 items to build your own.  \nWas pleasantly surprised with my order of Prosciutto & Lump Crab Mac.  The cheese is definitely a sharper cheese which made it a winner.  It came with lumps of crab and crumbled prosciutto, a great combo.
