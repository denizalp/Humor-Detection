We tried this place for dinner tonight. The service was pretty bad, when we ask the server questions about the menu, he was as if he doesn't want to be there! I give two starts only because the both stakes were good! I also tried ceviche and that was a mistake. The shrimp was made with shrimp cake or something, it was not good at all. The ambience was good if you like bar setting.
