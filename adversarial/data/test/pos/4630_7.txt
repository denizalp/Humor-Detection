Chris made our wedding cake in 2007. We had a nice tasting session and she was helpful designing a cake to fit our reception. The cake was simple, elegant and beautiful, just as I had hoped until.......\n\nIt took a great fall. The cake completely collapsed before we could cut it. Fortunately, a guest literally caught the cake as it was sliding apart, off the table and onto the floor. (A hilarious scene!) The servers at the reception were able to salvage three tiers to cut and serve. The cake was delicious despite it's appearance. \n\nChris's response after hearing that our cake literally fell apart seemed very defensive. Specifically, she stated that the cake is no longer her responsibility after she leaves it at the reception site. She was unwilling to refund even a penny! \n\nHer cakes are delicious and she seems creative with flavors and design. Due to the incredibly horrible customer service and attitude that we received, I would NEVER recommend Chris's Confections.\n\nUPDATE: I recently attended a wedding for which Chris's Confections was the cake vendor. The slices of cake were so thin that other guests were literally laughing. I've never seen such a thing. It was quite bizarre! Later, the bride told me that she had no idea what had happened. She felt that they had either way underestimated how much cake they would need or something had gone wrong. By the way, I did not know who had done the cake until after the wedding.
