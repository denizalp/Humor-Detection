Before anything else, let me just state that I hate driving to downtown LV because I have no patience to parallel park my yacht, I'm too cheap to pay for parking and there's always some crazy\/drunk person crossing the street when they're not supposed to tempting me to run them over.    \n\n\/endrant\n\nI read on a review to park in DT garage 3 - well, I didn't do that. You can also parallel park in front of the restaurant or across the street - I didn't do that either. I parked at Binion's which is a short walk from Pizza Rock. I was told that the DT garage is a mess anyway. I had no clue where I needed to walk after parking my car so I followed a showgirl wearing sparkly stuff and feathers. She was walking towards the opposite direction - I was late for dinner but I got pics of her nice cheeks!\n\n\/endshenanigans\n\nThe place is filled with TV's so you can watch sports. There's a big rig coming out of the wall. Sheet metal with a heart, spade, club, diamond cut out on the ceiling. I got a Chimay...3\/4 of it since 1\/4 of it ended up on the table when it was put in front of me. They were giving me a grapefruit drink which I apparently ordered and not a Chimay. I hate grapefruit so let me go ahead and order me a grapefruit drink because that makes sense!\n\nI was looking forward to trying their truffle fries\/ rosemary garlic fries and Cal Italia pizza. So we get those plus meatballs and margherita pizza. Kacey informed us that this is the same as Tony's Pizza Napoletana in San Francisco. She was right. Same menu and everything. We were debating whether or no we should get a Sicilian pizza but it's $30...for a pizza? What?\n\nTruffle Fries:\nFries were crispy inside and out. Truffle flavor was not noticeable. They drizzled a little bit of truffle oil, I only saw a few tiny specks of black truffles on these fries. Flavor was definitely lacking. 2\/5\n\nRosemary Garlic Fries:\nThe rosemary taste was strong. I was hoping for more garlic flavor instead of GROSSmary. 2.5\/5\n\nMeatballs:\n6 tender smelly balls. Smelly because of the cheese probably. They were ok. 3.5\/5\n\nMargherita Pizza:\nGreat crisp chewy crust. Real tomatoes, mozzarella cheese and basil. A pizza for the purists. 4\/5\n\nCal italia:\nMario and Luigi did not approve of the Cal Italia. This California-inspired pizza was a Food Network Gold Medal winner if it matters to anyone. It has gorgonzola, asiago, mozzarella, sweet fig preserve, prosciutto di Parma, Parmiggiano-Reggiano and balsamic reduction. Sweet and salty...not for the purists. I enjoyed this bastardized pizza. 5\/5\n\nWe got a 20% discount for being locals. Their happy hour starts at 10pm and some menu items go for $3, $5 and $7. Service was not the best but it wasn't horrible. Pizzas were good but skip the fries. So, overall, this place deserves 3.5 stars.\n\nShortly after posting my review, I got a message from one of the owners and he said:\n\n\"Would like to send you some additional info on Pizza Rock:\n- Free valet parking is available for Pizza Rock directly across the street at the Downtown Grand casino.\n- The Sicilian pizza is a large format pizza and generally serves 3 people, hence the $30 price tag.\"\n\nSo there! Now you know.
