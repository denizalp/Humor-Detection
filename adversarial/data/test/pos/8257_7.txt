BEWARE AND STAY AWAY!!!!\n\nFor all the local foodies and those who prefer quality customer service. DO NOT go to this restaurant. Mariko Japanese was utterly disappointing.\n\nFor fear of ranting, I'll try to be straightforward about this. We made a decent size order on what we assumed would arrive in reasonable portions(it is an all you can eat after all) the sizes that came were gargantuan. Starting with udon noodles that was the size of a full entree(oversized) after a minor complaint to the owner who barely acknowledged our annoyance the rest of the food came.. Which was just as ridiculously large followed by more of a sour attitude. My boyfriend and I head to pay the bill and left promptly to take photos of the resto to review later. The owner rampages outside shortly after our departure and begins PUNCHING my bf.. Yes I said it my fellow foodies.. Punching incessantly.. Then runs back inside to grab two glasses of water and douse him and myself with it.. As well as an innocent bystander.. There are no words.. Other than BEWARE and stay away. This was both staggering and unacceptable. \nService:0\/10\nFood:1\/10\nExperience:0\/10 \nDownright awful
