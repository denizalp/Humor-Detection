Patron beware everything here is cooked with wine.  last time we were there,I felt like we just got raped after we got the check lol. I felt the quality of the food did not equate to the prices they charge here....just because it's a French restaurant does not justify over pricing unless the food is just so special it equals the price..however that is not the case here.
