Keep in mind we drove here from Gilbert. When we arrived around 2:15 there was a piece of notebook paper on the door that said they were closed for lunch. I asked the man working when they'd be open and why they randomly closed because it didn't state it on their website. He told me that the workers were tired and they needed a break. He was not apologetic, sincere or friendly at all. It would've been one thing if he gave more of an explanation, but apparently we were just another dollar to him. We drove 45 minutes to get told they were closed for an unmarked lunch break and to be treated poorly. The food looks good on the website but there is equally as good food with much better customer service. Will never attempt to eat here again, there are plenty of other phenomenal restaurants that carry ALL vegan food along with impeccable service: \nThe loving hut\nThe Green\n24 carrots\nPomegranate cafe
