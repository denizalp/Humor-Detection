I use to work here, one boss was sweet and understanding. The other one didnt care about your problems and will fire you for wanting to get paid on time. I dont recommend working here, unless you want your check to be rounded down on and to be held an extra few days.  Im extremely pissed off, the mean one texted me, that i was fired. I have a child to feed \nCheenu you were great! Sorry you have to work with that horrible woman
