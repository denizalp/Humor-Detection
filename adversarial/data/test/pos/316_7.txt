I recently stopped in and saw a gorgeous bag that I just had to have. Stephanie helped me and she was a sweetheart the whole time even though I was a little tipsy and probably annoying. The only reason I am taking off a star is because when I got home and examined the bag I noticed it was uneven. It ended up being a defective bag which now I have to find another one to exchange. Other than that the service was excellent! Definitely ask for Stephanie when shopping here.
