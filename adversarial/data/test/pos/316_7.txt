Streetcar Po' Boys is located in a small center on the corner of Western & Oakey. This is a family owned joint with no shortage of friendly and helpful staff. They've got the placed decorated like it's 24\/7 mardi gras too! Purple walls, red booths and beads hanging from the lights...it's great! \n\nWhen it comes to the po' boys, you got tons to choose from. There's a few seafood options including one that comes packed with shrimp, oysters & catfish...they call it the Streetcar. And if you or your foodie partner in crime aren't into seafood, no biggie! They have a huge selection of po' boys with all kinds of stuff from hamburger to chicken parm. All the po' boys come with a side of Cajun chips and coleslaw. They've also got a few other sides you can order as add-ons. \n\nI ordered The Gulf (catfish) and my wife had the Treme (BLT). First off, the bread is just so dang good! It's the perfect balance of a crisp, flaky exterior and a super soft interior. While the BLT was slightly lacking due to the amount of bacon, it had great flavor and could easily be a hit po' boy if they would pack it with meat. My catfish on the other hand was just right. The catfish filet was a great size, it had a light, flavorful crust and was nice and flaky on the inside. I had mine dressed which includes fresh lettuce, tomato, pickles and a killer cajun mayo. We also ordered up some fried okra and fried mac 'n cheese. The sides and the chips included with the po' boy are seasoned with their very own cajun blend and it Is ahh-mazing! It's full of great flavor and the perfect amount of heat without being overpowering. \n\nWhen I heard about this place, I couldn't get here fast enough! I found it on the new section of Yelp and came in the very next day. I've been looking for a good po' boy ever since my favorite spot, Seafood Station, closed a while back. With Streetcar, I've found it! With their amazing food at great prices and awesome service to top it off, I can't even wait to go back!
