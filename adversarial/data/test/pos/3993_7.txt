Its a Wal Mart. Its reasonably clean and well stocked. Prices are low. Yada Yada Yada.\n\nThis WalMart always seem to be in the process of stocking. I came here about 4 days apart this past week and on both days there were TONS of pallets all over the place. Put that sh*t on the shelves already! What are all those employees doing anyways??\n\nOn the plus side there is a Redbox in the front, in addition to this great key making machine in the front(which is a helluva lot better than getting your keys from the Home Depot next store, but thats another story)\n\nIts also located in a great area right next to the aforementioned Home Depot, OfficeMax, and a bunch of other business'\n\nSo, as far as WalMarts go, its serviceable..
