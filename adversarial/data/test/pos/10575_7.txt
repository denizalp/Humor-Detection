This is the WORST TV repair company around! They came to my house three times over a period of three weeks, The guy just couldn't get my tv repaired even though he claimed to be doing this for over thirty years. They took my TV and have never called me back about it, it's been almost a month since they took my TV. I call them and get tossed around like a hot potato. They always act like they don't know who I am when I call even though I have called god knows how many times.They keep asking me if I want it disposed of and I said \"no\" I want it back. They are supposed to deliver it and haven't as of yet. I think something majorly fishy is going on here! Don't use these people. Highly unprofessional and seemingly scammers.\n\nUPDATE: I drove all the way there and they didn't know which TV was mine. I had to point it out. The screen was broke and they tried to tell me it was already like that. If there was a ZERO star option I would give that to them.
