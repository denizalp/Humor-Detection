I was here before work today. HUGE supermarket. We're talking an airplane hangar. \n\nTheir baked goods are better than most other area supermarkets. With a wide variety of cookies, you'll come across kinds you don't see at other large grocers around the metro area. Their chocolate chip and thumbprint cookies are actually quite good, their chocolate chip cookies being chewy and a little salty like they should be. Someone knows how to make 'em here. Great bread can also be had.\n\nEverything's that's on sale is easy to find; the sale items are in special aisles which means you can't miss them, and they're never out of what they advertise as being on sale. Shelves are uncannily well-stocked. Everyone's efficient, from the cashiers to the meat cutters. Their deli staff should get raises for how acrobatic they are (this store gets insanely busy). \n\nAnd speaking of their deli, there's lots of lunchmeats to choose from.  I bought a couple of big-ass Triangle Bar-style torpedoes that I'll be lunchin' on for days, made on the premises right in front of me I might add. \n\nTalk about a gorgeous meat counter too (we needed ground chuck that day).\n\nAnd they're open 24 hours! Top that.\n\nThis is a model supermarket, the very definition of top-flight, and narrowly beats the neighboring Giant Eagle every time in every category except perhaps in pricing.
