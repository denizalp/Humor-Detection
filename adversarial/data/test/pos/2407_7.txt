I absolutely loved my crepe for lunch (spinach and mushroom, goat cheese on the side) with a side salad.   My husband gave the burger two thumbs up as well.  They were playing Wilco and the Avetts (I'm always biased towards places that play music that I enjoy).  Our server was genuinely friendly and attentive. Great little place in funky NoDa!
