Recently I gots the allergic to wheats and the soy (teh suck!)\n\nLast week was my birthday and Michelle, my wife, bought a cake (and some other nifty creations) from these guys. I have had so many different \"attempts\" at gluten free stuff over the last couple years and let me tell you, most of it all tastes like CRAP!\n\nNOT THESE GUYS!!!\n\nI was so relieved biting into my chocolate cake, doughnuts, and bagels. Oh my gosh! It tastes good and pretty darn close to the original. I can't tell you how amazing it has been to have \"good\" baked goods again. Big props to GFC Bakery. I love you guys and I'll be back OFTEN!
