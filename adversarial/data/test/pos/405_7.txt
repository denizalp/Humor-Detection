Very disappointing. I was in the area so I decided to swing by for a quick coffee. The cashier was not having a good day because she was crabby from the moment I stepped up to order. After enduring a few annoyed comments from her,  I just quickly ordered a flavored iced latte to get away. She made the drink and there was no flavor to it at all. There was barely any espresso. Rude service and bad quality? Pass.
