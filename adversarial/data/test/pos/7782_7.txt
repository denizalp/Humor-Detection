If I would have written this review on Saturday, it would have been for 4 stars. I decided to go with Wild Wild West because I got a smokin' deal for two nights at $52 each. Compare that with the Strip hotels at $200-$300 on a weekend and it just can't be beat.\n\nThere were some really great things about this hotel:\n1) our room was super clean. Absolutely no complaints here.\n2) the king size bed was perfectly supportive and comfy. No nasty mattress with wornout springs. Big enough to sleep 3 comfortably. *WINK* ;)\n3) close enough to walk to the strip during the day; we got a cab for at night. \n4) BEST DEAL for a hotel room that you're really not going to stay in anyways.\n5) free breakfast at Denny's (limited choice on menu, doesn't include drinks)\n\nHowever, on Sunday morning, around 8am when we were still hanging out at the Cosmopolitan (what dramatic change from WWW), we called to see what they would charge for a late check out. My friend called and spoke with Suzy and the conversation went like this: \n\n\"Hi, we have a room at WWW and we'd like to know how much extra you'll charge for a late check out.\"\n             \"uhhhh, I'm not sure. Check out is at noon.\"\n\"Yeah, we know that but see, we're still at the Cosmo and want to stay here for a bit. Can we check out at one with no charge?\"\n            \"I don't know. I'm not sure what time late checkout goes to.\"\n\"Can you check with someone for me? Housekeeping or your supervisor?\"\n*click* she, hangs up the phone. We call back:\n\"Hi, I think we must have gotten disconnected. We're interested in doing a late check out but want to know how much we'll be charged.\"\n            \"You can check out until one.\"\n\"Without charge?\"\n            \"Yeah.\"\n\"Is this a guarantee we won't be charged?\"\n            \"Uhh.... I think so. I don't know. I don't understand what you're asking.\"\n\"Do you speak English? You know what, let me talk with your manager.\"\n*click,* she hangs up again.\n\nMy friend was PISSED. I decided to be proactive about this whole thing and took a cab all the way back to WWW to check out at 8am (after not sleeping at all that night). Yeah, I was angry, but what are you going to do? You're paying rock-bottom price for a bed and a roof. You're not going to get customer service too. \n\nOther notables:\n-next to shady truck stop\n-across the street from In-n-Out, Jack in the Box and Wendy's\n-casino on site, but super grungy\n-security on site, actually legit. My friend lost her phone and they called us to retrieve it.\n-be prepared to wait ages for breakfast at Denny's... I really don't know that I felt it was worth it.\n-free WiFi ask for code at registration\n-requires exorbant security fee, which is reimbursed after check out, but seriously? for a Days Inn? I didn't expect to have so many service and security fees after I've already paid for the damn room....
