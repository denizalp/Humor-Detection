I've only been here once, so maybe I just came on an off day, or just got the \"wrong\" thing, but I won't be back. It wasn't good enough to justify driving even the short distance from my house (1 mile.) \n\nI tried Carnitas Burrito with beans and rice, and was not at all impressed. This is sad mexican food, bland and flavorless, but at least cheap. Rice and Beans were average. Horchata was good, but really, it takes special effort to screw up Horchata.
