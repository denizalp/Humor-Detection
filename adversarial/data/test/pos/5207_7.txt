Our room was beyond cool!  We booked it sorta last minute two weeks before our trip out there, but still got a great deal through BookIt.com.  Their parking lot or lack of directions to their front lobby in the parking structure needs improvement, but other than that, our entire experience was pretty awesomeish.\n\nWe checked in on a Friday afternoon and when we were greeted by Jose at the front desk, he asked if we were interested in upgrading to a one bedroom king-size bed suite for an extra $30\/night.  We said go for it and we're glad we did because the room was ginormous!\n\nFull size fridge, dining table for five guests, full size stove, microwave (which came in handy for us), coffee maker, blender, toaster, HOT TUB IN THE ROOM, FOUR TV's AND a projection screen that came down in the living room, full sectional sofa that had a pull-out bed, and a washer\/dryer in the bathroom?  Sheez, this all made for a comfy stay at Planet Hollywood!\n\nWe decided for our future trips, we're staying here.  Price wise it fit our budget and the amenities and location is perfect.  We got to walk around the Miracle Mile shops downstairs or simply cross the street to go to City Center for more dining\/shopping options.\n\nNote to future guests at Planet Hollywood Westgate Towers, park at 3A on the very south end, that's where the guest entrance is located.  You can enter through the mall, but to get quick access to the guest elevators, find 3A South!
