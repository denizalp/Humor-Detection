Yay! First to review! Not surprised though as this is in a very ghetto area. I only know of this place because the bank that I visit occasionally is right beside it.\n\nWhat's different about this place is that they do offer drinks made from real fruit. However, they still have the powder stuff for the other bubble tea flavours.\n\nI decided to try out their mango diamond slush with mango chunks and tapioca. I only got a small and it came out to $5.07. This is pretty expensive considering it's a size small. My drink tasted really good though! Although they really did skimp out on the tapioca . \n\nI took 1.5 stars out because of the SLOW service and the price..especially in such a run down mall. I went back two minutes later to order the same drink for my boyfriend and it took a ridiculous amount of time to even order. The customer in front was taking such a long time to decide if she wanted to use her SPC card (when she didn't even look like a student) or pay regular price in order to use her stamp card. They need to have more than one person working the shop so that one person can take the orders and the other is making the drinks. I did notice a hiring sign so hopefully the next time I visit there will be more than one person working the bubble tea shop.
