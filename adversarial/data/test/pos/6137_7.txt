ZOO!!!!!!!!!!!!! Dont feed the Pets! Get your goods & get out. They did some rearranging with the aisles. Looks like the shelves are bigger, which means more products & more customers! Not sure if its a good thing or a bad thing but yesterday once again the lines were outrageous. There were 3 cashiers opened with at least 15 people in line. Not to mention screaming kids running around ugh!!! I seen 1 older lady walking around barefoot wtf? The flip flops are only 99 cents! Buy some or get the hell out!!!! \n\nWill I go back to this location? Of course I will how could I resist a bargain BUT I have to be in a real care-free funky mood to do so. The Dollar Tree is another option & its across the street.
