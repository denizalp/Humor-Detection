The bottom line is that Millie's ice cream is really, really, really good.  So good that, in the summer, at least 3 nights a week my boyfriend and I consider making the trek from Lawrenceville to Shadyside just for Millie's.\n\nMillie's is housed in the former Oh Yeah! ice cream space. Unlike its predecessor, the ice cream is homemade (by Chad Townsend, former executive chef of Salt of the Earth). You can definitely tell the difference.\n\nThe decor and space are reminiscent of an old fashioned ice cream parlor, with scoop door handles, a logo the shade of pink that makes you think of the 50s, and some other vintage decor. Nevertheless there's a very clean, new feel to the space.\n\nThere is a constantly rotating collection of specialty flavors, along with some staples that seem to always be available (chocolate, vanilla, salted caramel).  Thai tea and Vietnamese coffee seem to be frequent repeats as well, though I'm not sure if that's a seasonal thing.\n\nThere is often a line outside the door.  They started offering pre-packed pints, though, and if you're just there to grab one of those, you can skip the line of flavor-tasters and head right to the cashier (pro tip).\n\nThank you, Millie's, for finally bringing Pittsburgh the delicious, high-quality local ice cream we have waited so long for!
