Things started off pretty good at this credit union, until I realized they're so much like a bank they should just call themselves one! I initially opened an account with CMCU because they had better auto loan rates than other comparable financial institutions. To get that rate, I was forced to open- and keep open- a savings account with a minimum $25.00\/balance. After dealing with over a year of medical illness and hospitalizations, I fell behind on that loan. I made prior arrangements to pay my auto loan (which I had never been late with before) on such a date and in the amount of xyz, and without so much as a notification from CMCU, when I got a sum of money deposited into my checking account from a relative trying to help out (but had plans on using it for groceries and other necessities), Charlotte Metro went ahead and helped themselves to MY MONEY to get me caught back up on the loan, when I had already made plans to pay the auto loan with an advisor from their loan department. Without that immediate cash, I was unable to buy groceries for my daughter and pet food for my two small dogs, let alone gas to get to work or food for myself. I'm sorry, but putting food into my 3-year-old's mouth is, and will always be, more important than a less-than-30-day delinquent auto payment. I've never heard of any financial institution going into an account (even if they see the money is there) and simply helping themselves to it! Not only did Charlotte Metro do this once, but TWICE! You would think I would have learned my lesson during that first struggle\/hardship that they caused me, but unfortunately it took me twice to learn. Never again! Readers, beware!
