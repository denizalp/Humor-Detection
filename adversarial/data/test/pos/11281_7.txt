Let's just get this out of the way, if you are looking for the REAL Din Tai Fung, this is NOT the same thing.  This is a knock off called Din(g) Tai Fung.  It's one thing to try to replicate another restaurant's success, but to try to trick customers with the same name is just wrong.  Unless there is some story behind this, they blatantly tried stealing the name of the original Din Tai Fung and I'm guessing because their name is off by one character they can somehow get away with it.\n\nWe were visiting Toronto for the first time.  I purposely drove an extra 30 minutes from Toronto in hopes of having the classic DTF experience.  When I drove up to the restaurant, I knew something seemed fishy.  If you've ever been to any real DTF, the overall appearance is definitely off.  If I hadn't already drove 30 minutes out of my way to come here, I probably would have left, but I decided to give them a chance.  Sure they have the guys at the window making the XLBs, but that's about it.  I tried convincing myself, maybe this was one of the original locations, so they went for a more old-fashioned\/authentic look and less like the other more commercialized locations in the US.  But once the food started coming out, it was obvious.  Everything was similar, but yet everything was slightly off plus with a lower quality.  IMO, the only thing that keeps this place alive is their XLBs are decent.  If I had to rate the XLBs by themselves, I would say maybe 3.5\/5 stars.  They weren't great, but good.  The skin wasn't too thick, which I like, but not DTF thin.  However the rest of the food was just like any average restaurant, some were OK and others weren't that great.\n\nIf this place had some other generic Chinese Restaurant name, I probably would have given them 3\/5 stars.  If I lived in the area and had an XLB craving, I would probably come back.  It would be an okay local place to eat.  However since they purposely chose to try trick customers into believing this is a real DTF, I have to lower their rating for that.  As a visitor, I could have gone to so many other good Chinese restaurants, but because of their name they got me.  So congratulations, at the end of the day you win because you got my money.  Shame on me for not digging a little deeper.  Sigh... hopefully others who read my review will at least know it's FAKE and can make their own decisions on whether they simply want some decent XLBs.
