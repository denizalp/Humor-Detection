I'm actually very shocked to see this place get so many positive reviews after what I experienced. The pho itself was quite bland to me and my group, the soup being very flavourless, although my friend's starter rice rolls was very decent. The menu was lacking, all the traditional dishes were lost and they had only the very basics, in one size only. Mind you they have a 15 percent gratuity on top of this which made it expensive for someone like me who normally eats a small to be paying 13 dollars for a bowl. My main issue was the server we had. He did not take our order for the first 20 minutes even though the place is quite small and they were not busy. When he did come, it was very obvious he had no idea what he was talking about and was giving attitude to some of us for not ordering a drink as well. He not only forgot my friends meal but began to lecture him for not speaking up earlier and did not offer a single apology. My friend was originally charged for the food anyways, and only after speaking to them did they try to remove it. When accepting my payment he was so impatient and rude, making comments like \"Ok I'm waiting\" even though we waited 20+ minutes for the bill. I would never return here or advise anyone else to if they want vietnamese food. \n\nedit: Pho Vistro reached out to me about the issue, which was very kind of them. While this does not change my opinion on the food it does make up for the terrible service I had.
