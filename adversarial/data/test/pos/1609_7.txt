A typical Thai restaurant. The decor was simple. The service was attentive and polite. \n\nMy wife & I ordered 2 typical dishes at medium spiciness level: Pad see ew with beef & red curry with chicken. However, both dishes came out very mild. \n\nThe beef pad see ew was delicious, in spite of its mildness. The meat was tender and tasty; the vegetables were cooked right and flavorful. We had to request additional red pepper powder to increase its spiciness. \n\nThe red curry with chicken had a rich and tasty broth. The pieces of chicken were moist, tender & tasty. So were the vegetables. \n\nWe will return to this restaurant to try other dishes, when we are in the neighborhood.
