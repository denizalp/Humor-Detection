Canadian Men's Clinic is an uptown medical clinic at Yonge\/Eglinton that deals with issues of male sexuality. I went there in December 2010. To balance privacy concerns and need for content out, I would like to state the following: \n\nPrivacy: \nThe clinic management is very concerned about privacy issues, that's why you get a unique patient number and you will not have your name associated with the file (as far as I understood the process). I liked that a lot and only for that the clinic would deserve at least four stars.\n\nAppointments:\nYou can get appointments there rather quickly, within 2 weeks.\n\nMedical personnel: \nI was there twice. \n* First visit, one of the doctors, Dr. Weisbrod (he must be older than 70 years), talked to me and I felt understood and appreciated. He addressed all my concerns with appropriate medication but he also \"warmly\" recommended a psychotherapist (\"if you really want to address this, start talking to her today!!\" - sic!) in the uptown neighbourhood, Ellen Starr who runs http:\/\/ellenstarrpsychotherapy.com for ages. I am super happy I met her and followed Dr. Weisbrod's advise. Again 4-5 stars for the clinic.\n* Second visit, I don't remember the name of the doctor. He said, he could not address this in this clinic, but gave me his personal number and promised, he could help me in another clinic. I was embarrassed as I thought he behaved not loyal to the clinic he works for.\n\nAltogether, my issues have been addressed, although I think this is very dependent on the doctor and on my courage to do something.
