In one of my last acts as a Scottsdale resident, I bought a box of chocolates for a very special friend of mine. I figure what better way to please a woman, than by giving her a box of chocolates, right?\n\nI popped into this location in Old Town (parking in rear...haha) and there was a VERY nice young lady who helped me. I explained the whole situation to her, and she helped me put together a very nice assortment of chocolates.\n\nThe thing that really made this all stand out, was the great customer service. Yeah, I was just buying a box of chocolates, but the person helping me went out of her way to get to know my situation, and put together something nice. It's the same experience you get when you go to your own personal florist, or tailor. \n\nIf you are buying chocolates for someone, this is a great option. Yeah, its a chain, but it's a good one. Plus for me, it brings back memories from my childhood.\n\nEach Christmas, my Dad and I used to make a trip to See's to purchase several boxes of chocolates for each of his clients and employees. And the sales clerk would always give me a sample.\n\nWithout even asking, at this very Scottsdale location, on this very trip, the lovely woman behind the counter brought back an old memory by asking me if I would like to try a sample of their Peppermint Patty. \n\nThank's for everything See's Candies. You made my day that day.
