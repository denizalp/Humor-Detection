HAD TO try it because of all these great reviews! \n\nSo my boyfriend and I were ecstatic! We go into the Cosmopolitan, look for \"Pizza\" or something like it on the directory, and NOTHING! No mention of anything regarding pizza. So we went to ask, and they said 3rd floor. We take the escalators, go through the Marquee stampede of people, and see nothing related to pizza! My boyfriend was pissed haha I asked a hostess from a restaurant and she took us right to the long hallway.\n\nLined on the walls with old vynil record art, a 20+ foot long hallway will lead you to a vintage arcade machine and VOILA! PIZZA! \n\nThe slices are pretty big, BUT the prices could be better considering how thin they are! \n\nSeating areas are very limited! They have bars where you can just stand at and then about 4 stools (first come first serve!)\n\nWe had slices from pies already made which were of mushrooms and one of tomato with ricotta.  Also ordered a diet coke, which was $4 yet came in one of those red plastic cups you buy for parties.\n\nThey were good, yes, pretty good!  How do you really judge a pizza? Hmm... I guess I like mine thicker and saucier and cheesier, so these were just alright and I probably won't go again :-(\n\nWomp womp wooooomp
