I've been to MANY AYCE sushi spots in town, and dined at Yama a few times. From my experiences, it seems like I've had a better time when we dine in the back room to the right. The wait staff is pretty attentive, food comes out at a steady pace.\n\nYama also has a wide variety of menu items which is a plus, if someone in your party isn't in the mood for sushi\/raw items. I'm more of a nigiri type person, so that's what I pretty much stick to, but a few of their side dishes are also worth getting.\n\nThis is one of the favorite AYCE spots among locals and can get very packed, so be prepared to wait if you plan on dining here. ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu  3.75
