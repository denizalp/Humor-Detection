Loved everything from the ownership, to the crowd, to the live music. LOVED how everyone seemed to actually be dancing, and not just standing and staring on the side lines. Did I mention that it was a live 10 person salsa band? Yes, yet another oxymoron: salsa and snow... Again.. Only in Pittsburgh!
