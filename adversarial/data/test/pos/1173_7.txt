Found an amazing hairdresser at Vincent's. Christina knew exactly what I wanted and I could not be happier. A true professional for sure.\nshe styled my hair with heir fingers and the results were amazing. I have been to so many salons since I moved here from NY and was never happy. I am now!!\nif you want a great haircut you must go to Vincent's and ask for Cristina.changed my mind. Forget about this review . Washed my hair the next day and found haircut was uneven . Had to go to another hairdresser who corrected this mess. Won't be going back after all.
