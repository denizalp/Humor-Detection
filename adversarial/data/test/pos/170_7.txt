â€‹\nLooking at these reviews, I have to ask myself what in the name of God do you people eat on a regular basis that elevates this garbage to the 4 star level?  \n\nI will start with the good, but don't worry it will be brief. The regular, no frills Bloody Mary I had while waiting at the bar was pretty good and I really liked the sitting area outside.  Ok, so that rounds out the good.  Let's move on to the drubbing Tupelo Honey deserves.\n\nI don't even know where to start other than to say this place is a beacon of mediocrity placed on a pedestal by the simpleminded masses.\n\n1. The Queen Mary.  This was really the crown jewel of the meal.  In the sense that it cost a kings ransom and then didn't deliver. On top of the terrible flavor it was so thick it was almost impossible to drink.\n\n2. The goat cheese grit's are a good idea in theory, but even the greatest grits in the world are not good cold.\n\n3. The Shoo Mercy Omelet was truly egregious.  Nothing like a crepe thin, flavorless egg mix crammed full of way too much, of way too many things.  It's supposed to be big and caloric and unwieldy, that's the whole point. However, instead of inserting entire fried green tomatoes and other intact chunks of filling, you have to break it up a little. Instead of using what was almost certainly 2 milk stretched eggs... you should be using at least 4-6 unmolested ones if you really want to do it right..and season them with something, please. It barely had any pimento cheese in it and what it did have was in one bite.  Run of the mill bacon and ham that had recently seen the likes of a peel-able plastic enclosure. It was incredibly disappointing and I only finished half of it, as I refuse to eat 2000+ calories of complete and utter crap.\n\n4.  The grilled cheese my girlfriend ordered literally did not have cheese on it.  Don't really know what else to say about that. \n\n5.  Everything tastes the same.\n\nTupelo Honey, to me, is an exemplar of paradoxical dining patterns and preferences in our society.  Bottom-line: it's big box, watered down southern BS with a smile, yall.  Something along the lines of Bubba Gump Shrimp Company having a bastard child with Bob Evans.
