Late night vegan pizza by the slice??! What more could you ask for?  Well, for starters, I'd like to be able to get a whole pie to go. And I'd love for them to actually get in the VEGAN SOFT SERVE that has been taunting me on their menu for months now.  But I'll let it slide because I love their pizza.  The vegan pie is straight up delicious, with a great crust, plenty of Daiya cheese, and lots of good veggies (even artichoke hearts!).  It's even great leftover straight out of the fridge.  At $4 a slice, it's pretty expensive, but late night vegan pizza on Fremont is pretty much priceless in my book.  Highly recommended.  Oh, and they have \"regular\" pizza too.
