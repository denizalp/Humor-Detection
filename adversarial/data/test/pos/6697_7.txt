when you work full time bar hours, go to school full time, and are 8 months pregnant and yet ONCE AGAIN get woken up by banging on your door by some random guy giving you a 5 day notice for non payment of rent BUT YOU PAID IT ON THE FIRST, get up and got dressed so fucking fast only for him to come back because he had the wrong apartment number, third time this has happened, one of the times maintenance actually walked in my house, IM FUCKING LIVID.
