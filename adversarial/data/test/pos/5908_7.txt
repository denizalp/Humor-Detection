FAQ\n\nQ: LOL. You stayed at the Imperial Palace?\nA: Guess what? It's cheap, it's right on the strip, they have a great karaoke bar, dollar ice cream hour, elevators that barely work, a shitty pool, and it's right on the strip. Did I say it was right on the strip? While you dropped money on a \"fancy\" hotel, I saved money and drank myself to near-death.\n\nQ: But c'mon, the Imperial Palace?\nA: Walking distance to everything you need on the Strip. Caesar's right across the street. Bellagio nearby. Sure, the carpet was still from 1973 (a poor year for carpet fashion). Sure, the weird dancers in the middle of the casino was a little odd. If by odd you mean, well, sad.\n\nQ: HA! THE IMPERIAL PALACE!!!!\nA: Listen, fucker. I had a blast in Vegas. I'm not a high-roller. The room was cheap. The towels were worthy of being stolen. I didn't feel bad about spilling Jack Daniels on the floor.\n\n\nFYI ... Find that ice cream parlor with the ice cream happy hour (from 1pm to 2pm?) and you will thank me later.
