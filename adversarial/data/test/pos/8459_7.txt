I finally visited the infamous, cash-only, no reservation neighbourhood brunch diner. And I didn't stand in line - suck it yelpers!\n\nI ordered the brie-aguacate-bacon eggs benedict dish. I loved the texture and taste of these ingredients against the toasted muffin. Obtaining fresh, ripe aguacate is key and they successfully did.\n\nThe dish also came with potatoes and a green salad. I would have much rather preferred fresh fruit instead of the salad.\n\nMy friend ordered the huevos rancheritos and she said it was good. I only saw a mess of frijoles and I would never order it.\n\nTheir coffee is quite fresh and ok.\n\nby the way, we arrived at 9:30am and were seated immediately.
