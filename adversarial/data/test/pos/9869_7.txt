This was my first time being at the Las Vegas location. I was on the hunt to find some modern cute pieces to add to my bedroom without cutting my budget and that's exactly what I found. I ended up getting a green leaf plant, a white lace container, and a candle lantern all for $10. I found these items on Amazon prior to my visit and that would have costed me $35 with shipping. I'm glad I decided to check this place out. It was clean, the staff were super nice, and the store wasn't as crowded as other IKEAs I've been to. I didn't get a chance to check out the cafe but I definitely plan to next time. I can't wait to go here when I get a new place!
