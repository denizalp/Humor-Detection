Fuck this place!!!!!!  \n\nI decided to sign up for a 3 day pass online because I recently moved to south Scottsdale and it's the closest gym to my place.  I know many people that are members and all seem to be pleased with the services\/size\/convenience etc...  \n\nI print out my pass, get ready for the gym and drive the few blocks.  When I arrive I am greeted by the receptionist and I let her know that I signed up for a 3 day pass online.  She immediately calls up one of the sales people to enter me into the system.  I'm not crazy about the whole \"entering me into the system\" thing because it's just a 3 day guest pass but whatever.  I just want to workout  and get on with my day so I comply.  He asks for my driver's license and types in my number.  He asks if I have been here in the past six months and I say no.  Then he says to me that he cannot give me a 3 day pass b\/c the system says that I have been here in the past 6 months.  I am completely confused because I have never been to any LA Fitness or even given my drivers license to this place to swipe.  Not even in another state.  He listens to me but looks at me like I am lying.  He then proceeds to try and sell me a membership and not only that he wants to up-sell me shit I don't even need.  I already told him I have no family and he keeps bringing up the family benefits!  What an ass!  I said I don't have kids you jerk off!\n\nAnyway, he keeps trying to show me all the different types of membership levels and I interrupt and say \"so I can't workout today without  signing up\"?  and he says \"no\".  What a load of shit.  I have not even seen the facilities!  What has happened to customer service?    What is so wrong with me getting a 3 day pass?  \n\nNo thanks LA Fitness!  You suck!
