When I go bowling on an early Sunday afternoon, I do not expect to pay an arm and a leg for a quick bowling trip.  However, Bowlmor's prices are so extravagant, that is exactly what happened.  For two of us to bowl 3 games, we paid $50.  Yes, you read that right......$50, Five-Oh, Fifty.  Seriously?!?! How does 3 games of bowling cost so much for 2 people?!?!  We were in and out of there within 45 minutes, so it couldn't be the time.  \n\nWhat's sneaky is that the way they have it set up, no matter what, you are bound to pay up the a$$ because they charge you per person\/per game; no exceptions.  So, if you and 3 friends want to pop in to play 2 rounds of bowling, expect to pay big time.  Truth be told, if I want to pay higher fees to bowl, I'd gladly go down to Lucky Strike in downtown Phoenix.  It's cleaner, has better atmosphere, and ironically, doesn't cost as much.\n\nSayonara Bowlmor!!
