I've only found myself here during off peak times, apparently. As I have never seen any big crowds here. I don't come here to frequently as it can get pricey throwing the tokens in those machines, especially when the wife GTA on the \"Deal or No Deal\" game. It is a fun time for everyone, even the kids. \n\nWe've never eaten here, at least not since I had a birthday here many moons ago, so we can not attest to the quality or taste of the food.
