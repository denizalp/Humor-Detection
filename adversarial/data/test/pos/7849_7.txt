I went in the store today for the 2nd time and customer experience was terrible.  They have the must unhappy angry people working there.  While I was picking out fabrics one employee said to another lady employee near me that a gentlemen needed a lot of help and could she help.  She frowned and then angrily said \"For What?\".  She was so bothered that she might have to actually talk to someone and help them out. Then once I went over to the cutting station the women helping me was so bothered there were kids in the store and just stared at them like she was going to kill them.  And if she had paid attention she would of seen that I'm 9 months pregnant (with my first child I might add) and that her attitude towards children only made me very uncomfortable as a pregnant women and customer.  She then began to complain about children and looked so unhappy just to be alive.  I'm writing this to let you know how angry I left the store when before I even entered I was just happy.  Good customer service really helps the company to shine and the customer to feel welcomed back and really I don't feel that way.
