I'm upgrading Seller's Networks from 1 star to 3. They have recently contacted me and agreed to refund half of my money as well as continue to run the adds for my motorcycle. I will say that the bike still has not sold but it was a fair effort on their part to make things right. So, going forward I would say they are not all bad, maybe I am just having some bad luck.
