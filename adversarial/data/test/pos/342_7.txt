I am the mother of a teen- need I say more? I do not miss the age at all, that's for sure. Hormones, moody, I've suddenly become uncool, and of course the breakouts. Unfortunately for her it's out of control. Our doctor referred us to AAD, and since they had a Gilbert office I figured why not (there are several throughout the valley).\n\nThe office is easy enough to find- it's right next to Gilbert Mercy Hospital and that building sticks out in the 202\/Val Vista area. The receptionist was pleasant enough, and the assistant who saw my teen was as well. Felt a little impersonal: Get in, quickly diagnose, get your prescription, get out. I wouldn't have minded a little more personal interaction to make my daughter feel more at ease. \n\nWe'll keep going to see them, it is convenient and they take the insurance, so I can overlook the small stuff. If you do try AAD out, be aware of one of the papers they ask you to sign. It's an ok for them to just automatically take unpaid balances right from your credit card.  When I asked them about it they told me it was optional, but it doesn't say that anywhere on the form. \n\nBoy I hope my teen doesn't read this! It's not going to score me any points in the \"cool\" department, that's for sure! ;-)
