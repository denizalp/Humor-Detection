I wish it were sans soucy. It was more like avec souci for us. See what I did there.\n\nNo one thing was that bad... it was a lot of little things. We thought there would be free parking, but that was only if you could find it on the street. We thought there would be a jacuzzi bathtub, but that was only if you brought your own air compressor.  And drain plug.\n\nThe bed wasn't super comfortable. The breakfast was fine (croissant and an omelet)... nothing life-changing.\n\nHowever, you cannot beat the location. And it is a charming building. So, not a total bust, but I don't think I would stay again.
