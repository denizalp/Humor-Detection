If you're a hipster with a Swiss Army knife keychain, a Northface tee, and a stand-up paddle boarding habit, this may be your favorite store. However, for those of us who merely entertain a seasonal interest in the outdoors, this place wasn't up to par.\n\nConsidering the price point and specialized nature of the products in this store, I expected more in the way of customer service. As in I expected to get some in general but received none. I love combining hiking with water, and was looking into whether it would be worth it to buy my own kayak.\n\nHung around the kayak section for nearly a half-hour, checked out prices, looked at straps to transport it, but was never asked if I needed help or had any questions. Kayaks, for those of us who didn't know, are generally about $400 here while stand-up paddleboards will apparently run you into the quadruple digits. Again, with prices like that, I shouldn't have to wonder if I can transport such a purchase on my own car, someone should have that info and be interested in sharing it with me.\n\nDid my own research here, and I'll likely continue to rent as needed rather than purchase, but even if I changed my mind I wouldn't be inclined to bring my business here.
