This is definitely a must go to place every time we're in Vegas. I mean the only down side of going here is that the wait time is ridiculous, but once you're seated at the bar you'll forget how long you were waiting for. The service is amazing and the food is just WOW!\n\nIf it's your first time here go for the lobster pan roast and the raw oysters. I tend to ask for extra bread as I like eating the bread with the pan roast, but they also give you rice. I would recommend to ask for the rice on the side. The price is also reasonable since seafood tends to be more on the higher end, but I can guarantee you that you can't go wrong with this place. Trust me it's definitely worth all the hype just as the other reviewers are saying!
