:) We adopted our li'l Scooby here (pic attached), and I'm so in love!!\n\nMaricopa Animal Shelter is a lot better than Arizona Humane Society in that I feel like the animals here are treated a lot better. There's also different buildings and it's pretty well-kept~ Inside the main building, you'll find cozy li'l kittens and cats. Once you walk out, the first 3-4 buildings are the adoptables, and the last 2 are strays. The strays become adoptables after 72 hours, I think. So, if you see a stray that you want, wait for 3 days or sign onto a waiting list, and you'll be able to get him\/her! \n\nI think prices range from $60-$150 depending on how many days the pet has been in the shelter. We got ours for $150 only because we got him 3 days after he was dropped off in the shelter. He's got all his shots, and he got neutered the next day. All services were included with the adoption fee. I almost wanted to adopt the whole shelter! If you want to adopt puppies, I think this shelter has more puppies. \n\nWhen you want to adopt them, they'll take you to a room where you can play with the dog and give you new toys for the dog when youre ready to adopt. Service was okay. The wait was extremely long the day I went (line went to the door). Fill out some paperwork and voila! \n\nemBARK on your adoption journey now :D
