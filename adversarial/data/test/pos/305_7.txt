Memento Mori is a very cool public art exhibit tucked away in an alley in Pittsburgh's Cultural District. The artist, Mary M. Mazziotti, explores a time honored tradition (Memento Mori translates to \"Remember your mortality\"), which dates back to ancient Rome, and was especially popular in the Middle Ages). The artist uses the contemporary format of the billboard and cartoons to playfully deal with the subject of death and the fragility of life. \n\nSponsored by the Cultural Trust, you will find this series of billboards in the same little side street as Cell Phone Disco, the provocative interactive art piece that is rather well promoted.
