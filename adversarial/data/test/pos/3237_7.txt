I honestly cried when I checked out. I spent my birthday weekend here. A staycation. I had done some work for the hotel, and got a room for two nights as pay. (This means I didn't pay $$ for it. It wouldn't have made a difference of my review, though. I would have paid for this!)\nI had arranged for a happy hour gathering with friends. I barely got out of my car at the valet, before I heard people telling me \"Happy birthday, Amy!\" (Some said \"Fab,\" too.) I got the cutest birthday card, too. Make sure you tell them if it's a special occasion! \nI was checked in promptly and when I walked into the room, it just felt really comfortable.\nThe decor and furnishings are masculine, but not overbearingly so. I had a leather wall!!!! The first thing I tested, of course, was the bed. Super comfy with tons of pillows. It was just me, so I drowned in pillows.\nThere's a nice working area as well, with wifi. It's $12\/day, which is what other hotels charge, too. I had no problems with the speed or connectivity, either.\nThe staff here is nothing short of amazing. As soon as I asked for something, I got it.\nI ate at both Marston's and the ICON lounge, and the food was amazing!  The chef uses some of his grandmother's recipes, and they've certainly stood the test of time.\nThe Renaissance also uses locally-produced food as much as possible. Tammie Coe, anyone? They are ambassadors to Downtown Phoenix, and out-of-towners will always get great advice on things to do while in the area.\nGo check it out. Spend some time there. Oh, and say hi to Rhonda in the ICON lounge. She's worked there for over 30 years!
