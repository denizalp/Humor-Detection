I called with two hours notice on a Saturday. I was pleasantly surprised Nadia picked up and I could make an appointment within hours. We continued communication by text, which was convenient because I had just landed an was dealing with baggage and catching a cab. She and her associate came to my room at the Palazzo. They were 15 minutes early so we could start right at 2:30p. We did a 90-minute couples massage: deep tissue and relax. Their tables are sturdy and stable. They played music during the session. The rates are reasonable and they are pleasant women.
