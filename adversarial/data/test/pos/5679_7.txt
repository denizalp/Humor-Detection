Let's start by saying that this place is fusion but done on a hyper level (it's a fusion of the Mediterranean) I've read up about Byblos before setting foot as researching what I'm about to devour is important to me; and I wasn't disappointed. \n\nA group of 5 of us sat down for a late dinner and opted for the servers to surprise us with the dishes they most loved which I think is a great way to go when you're dining for experience with good friends.\n\nThe first course was a selection of salads, olives, and nuts. A big stand out for me was the roasted, pickled beet salad on top of some house made labneh. BAD.ASS. \n\nSecond course included a series of sharable plates highlighted by incredible dukkah dusted lamb ribs and seared duck fat dripped cauliflower. This shit was on point; also an insane fried eggplant with basturma sliced on top.\n\nOh ya by this time I was a few cocktails in. They made me forget the pain.\n\nThird course was dominated by oxtail basmati rice, a whole boneless branzino (I usually hate fish but this was dope) some wonderfully downright delightful manti dumplings, and the dry aged ribeye that I wanted to get married to.\n\nWe were fat but still hungry so we ended the savory with crispy calamari and steak tartar. Mmmmmm\n\nDessert was..well everything. I think we had it all. The stand out was the yoghurt mousse but the trippiest thing was a pyramid dessert from the future that tasted like a floral bouquet. \n\nIf my spelling and grammar suck that's awesome.\n\nThe end.
