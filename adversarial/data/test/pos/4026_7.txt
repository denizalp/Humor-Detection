I came here for a UYE organized by fellow Yelper Ryan F.  \n\nMy order: beef brisket and 1\/4 rack of ribs plus a side of beans.  I thought the ribs were pretty good, but I've never been a huge ribs fan in general.  However, the BRISKET, wow, OMG! This was the best beef brisket I ever had. The sauce had a nice smokey\/bbq flavour to it.  I didn't have bread with my order, but when I finished the brisket and had so much sauce left, my friend was kind of enough to spare her bread.  Eating this white bread with sauce was absolutely delicious! It reminded me of an awesome sloppy joe.  \n\nI also tried some Mac N Cheese and some hush puppies (corn fritters).  The hush puppies were fried perfectly but the Mac N Cheese, this was delicious. I'm not sure what kind of cheese it was, but it seemed a lot tastier than cheddar.  It felt like fancy Mac N Cheese. \n\nOverall, I'd give the food a 4\/5, however the owner and the chef are super super nice and chill.  I literally felt like family there.  They were very patient with our big group as a few of us arrived at 6:45 and we didn't really order until 7:30.  Whenever we asked questions, they were happy to answer and also joked around with us.  \n\nIt was a great experience and because of the super chill owner, I'll boost it up to 5 stars. :-)
