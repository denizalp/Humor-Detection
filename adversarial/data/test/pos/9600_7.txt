Most horrifying experience I have ever had! I booked a Mercedes, they \"over booked\" my car and offered an inferior 2 door car or a van, other luxury category cars where parked outside yet the counter rep said \"keys are in the safe\", refused to call manager, refused to accommodate, when I insisted, he called security on me and threatened to arrest me, I was HUMILIATED and caused great damages!! NOT only I was not provided with the contractual obligation, I was never reimbursed my payment!\n\nMy legal team will be reviewing and suite to follow!
