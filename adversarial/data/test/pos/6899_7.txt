I wanted to re-pierce my horizontal hood and re-pierce my navel because I took them out 3 years ago. I read nothing but great reviews for Kevin Jump, the genital piercer at HTC. I then googled him and wow the reviews were wonderful. Kevin was so utterly professional I was so pleased with his way of explaining everything, showed me photos of different piercings and changed his gloves probably 10 times during our consult due to his fun personality.. A door knob or a stiletto touch and he changed his gloves automatically. Now that is very reassuring that this place is extremely sanitary.. I ended up getting a vertical hood ring. It is BEAUTIFUL!! I am so happy with it! I got the cubic zirconia with titanium. For a petite woman who wants my piercing to remain private when I am in a bikini this was the perfect choice. Highly highly recommend Kevin for piercings. A+ very happy customer!
