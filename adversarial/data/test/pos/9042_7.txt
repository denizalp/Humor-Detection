I only gave a star because after much thought I couldn't in good conscience give anymore. I went in for hair color and highlights. On sale, I still paid almost $100! When I got home and was able to really see the work I was so disappointed. I had asymmetric highlights. Huge chunks of  hair were  blonde, after I asked for natural ones due to the fact I use a flat iron everyday. We went through everything and I thought he understood. Needless to say I called him back and we were dealing with slipped foils, blonde patches in back. Cheetah spots on the crown. I did go back and just had him dye all one color, but he never offered a partial refund. I was there a total of about 4 hours. I went because of a review. Maybe it was by a friend. Don't want what happened to me to happen to anyone else. I guess that's why he works out of his home. :\/
