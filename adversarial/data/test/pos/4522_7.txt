Inconsumable garbage food.\n\nIf you are wondering if there is a hidden gem in the otherwise uneven Charlotte Mexican food world down in Indian Trail based on Yelp reviews, well, I have your answer: there absolutely is not.\n\nTake a better look at the reviews than I did, and notice that everyone mentions their love of the price. Maybe they use great ingredients, but I couldn't tell in either their disturbingly underseasoned carne asada tacos or their inedible vegetable fajitas.\n\nThe carne asada came in a big, uncut chunk of meat tucked in a piece of aluminum foil. If it wasn't for the aluminum foil, I would have assumed it was overcooked in the microwave with zero seasoning. They must have been saving it for the three vegetables in the vegetable fajitas. Did the cooks take prior terrorist interrogation experience to this job and waterboard these vegetables with seasoning? I guess those guys probably need jobs, too, but they should dial it back.\n\nSalsa was not good. Luckily that prevented me from buying (yes, there is a charge) for more chips and salsa. I should have followed my first impulse and left the laundromat-looking restaurant when I first pulled into the parking lot. I should have followed my second impulse and left after the other patrons looked most comfortable at a Golden Coral or some sort of bike fest in Myrtle Beach. No joke, multiple loud motorcycles went through the cramped parking lot in the 35 minutes between when I arrived and when I left for a different Mexican restaurant.\n\nOh, and this place does not have a liquor license. I have just about nothing positive to say about this restaurant, other than it wasn't the worst Mexican restaurant I've ever eaten at (it was the 2nd). \n\nYou can do better.
