This CubeSmart location is new, extremely clean, has very affordable monthly prices, and  a friendly staff!\n\nWhat more could you want from a self-storage facility?  No really, I mean it... what more could you want?\n\nSome interesting things to note about this facility...\n-Jefferson Street is a one-way street that heads East, so be sure to come from the West and use the far right lanes.\n-They charge more for a storage unit that is on the first floor than the second, but they have a large cargo elevator that quickly arrives and will easily fit all of your stuff in it.\n-The owner of the parking lot charges for parking spaces during Diamondbacks home games (because it is located so close to the stadium), so if you arrive before\/during a game, then just let the parking lot attendant know that you're heading to CubeSmart.\n-They don't want you parking by the main entry door because tires leave marks that are difficult to remove and they want to keep the place looking like new.\n-Each storage customer has a unique code to enter the facility.\n-Bring a lock with you when you go to rent your unit or else you will have to buy a lock there (and it will cost you way more than if you get one on Amazon beforehand).\n-You will need a discus-type padlock because they are harder to cut than traditional combo padlocks.\n-That's all I got for ya!\n\n*****FIVE STARS*****
