If you like bland food and bad customer service, this is your place!\n\nNothing special and nothing that stood out as great.  The price is good for mediocre food.  I guess for this price, you can't expect much. \n\nOur waiter was unpleasant and when we asked him for coffee, he acted as if we asked for a pint of his blood.  Then he brought the coffee with a nasty attitude.  \n\nNext time, I rather pay double at Bellagio than ever eat here again.
