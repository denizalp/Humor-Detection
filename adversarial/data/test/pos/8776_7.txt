I called ahead and asked if they had a noodle that was called something like \"fan\"   The girl answered no. So I ordered my normal shrimp lo mein and egg rolls. When I picked up I saw the daily special on the wall as chicken mei fun. I asked the girl why didn't you offer fun when I asked. She said you asked about fan not fun that'll be 26.50. Then proceeds to speak to other workers in her native language and dismissed me. Once I got home and tasted the egg rolls and fried noodles that came with the shrimp lo mein I tasted the same flavor old grease  I have been a customer of this restaurant for 5 years. I will not go back.
