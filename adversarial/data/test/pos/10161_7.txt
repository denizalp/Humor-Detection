Omg. I forgot to tell you that I went to Fiamma. And it's incredible. \n\nFiamma is tucked into a strip mall just off of Park Rd, by RuSan's, easy to miss. I came here with a friend for an early dinner, and was totally glad that we sought this place out. When we asked for a table, they offered us the upstairs section - this is a snug strange place. I was actually glad that we didn't go for it, because it looked cramped. \n\nThe atmosphere is cozy and dark. Perfect for a date night. The server came to the table with bread and pesto, and she said, \"this pesto is going to be one of the best things you eat all night.\" I thought, \"ok, lady. She'll probably say this about everything...\" but that pesto is NO JOKE. I could bathe in it. If I was stranded on a desert island, I would want this pesto with me. Its amazing. The bread is warm and fresh, and just keeps coming. My kind of place. They have a sweet little patio area out front that I'd love to sit on and sip wine - once the weather warms up again. \n\nThe menu is in Italian - leading me to just smile and point to what I want. I'm that girl, I know *eye roll*. I got the \"Tagliolini allo Scoglio - Homemade pasta saut√©ed w\/fresh seafood in a garlic, red pepper flake, white wine sauce\". I was pretty excited, as I had seen pictures on Yelp. In between the pesto and your main dish, they bring you GELATO to cleanse your palate!! I was very impressed and pleased with this. You're right, I am fancy. \n\nThen the Taglionlini all Scoglio came to the table, and my whole life changed. So. Much. Seafood. It was delicious. The sauce was perfect, not overpowering and the seafood and pasta was all cooked perfectly. AND - winner winner - I was full, and had enough to take home with me! YAY!! I would love to come back here for restaurant week and be able to test out the apps too. My meal was $20, and that seems to be about normal across the board. \n\nI love Fiamma. I will totally be back. Even if I don't have a fancy date. Its delicious!
