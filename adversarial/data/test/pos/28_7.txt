It blows my mind that it has taken me this long to write a review of The Common Market.  I have been frequenting this place for what feels like decades.  Truly the only place of its kind in Charlotte.  The Common Market is your eclectic home-away-from-home type of place.  I can't really decide if it falls into the category of coffee shop, delicatessen, acid trip, museum or bakery.  Maybe all of the above.  It is the perfect spot to grab a cup of joe with friends, split a bottle of wine after work, or stop for a quick business meeting with a lively environment.  \n\nThe Awkward & the Awesome:\n* Best coffee in Charlotte, hands down.  They have recently started creating their own!\n* The d√©cor.  Something out of Andy Warhol and the Drinking out of Cups youtube video.  Prepare to be amazed!\n* The employees.  These people are some of the best I have met in Charlotte.  Shout out to Sarah & Chuck (the owner).\n* I strongly believe the Common Market could have its own reality tv show. \n* A killer deli for breakfast\/lunch\/dinner + Vegan & Vegetarian options!  Chika chika yea!\n* The gag gifts.  Greeting Cards, Bacon flavored toothpaste, raunchy magnets, cupcake dental floss, Jesus mugs and much, much more...\n* Grape leaves.  Just do it.\n* Beer, wine, tea, coffee, and every soda flavor ever made.\n* The outside patio!  Dogs & smokers welcome.\n* After hours events on the weekends (wine nights, poetry readings, etc)\n* And so much more...\n\nIf you haven't visited The Common Market yet, I recommend getting over there as soon as humanly possible.  This place far surpasses anywhere else in the greater Charlotte area.  I would give it 10 stars if possible.
