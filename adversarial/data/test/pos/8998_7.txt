Two words: Fiery Mussels.\n\nI came here for happy hour yesterday evening. Wow, what a great crowd. I knew they must be doing something right when I saw how many people were there.\n\nThey have specials every night... but last night it was martini night. I hit for cycle on the martini menu. My personal fav was the Berry Martini.. and this is coming from a girl who lives and dies by a dirty martini. Yeah, the Berry was that tasty. The French was also great. Let's be honest, they were all pretty fantastic.\n\nMy friend and I got a variety of food. Fat kids, party of two. It was all amazing, but let's get back to those mussels. Peppers, onions and chorizo in a spicy sauce. I couldn't stop dunking pieces of bread in it. I may have went through a loaf. At one point, I was dipping fries in it. I would probably have taken shots of it if other people weren't around to judge me. \n\nI love oysters and they have a great variety here. So fresh and perfect with all the fixings. The butter poached lobster was another fav... served with potato gnocchi and black garlic beurre blanc. Little pillows of goodness.\n\nWe also had one of the steak dishes and the pan seared scallops. Both were cooked to perfection. The scallops had sweet corn puree, fava beans and smoky sauce. Great flavor combination.\n\nThe service was just tremendous. Our server Laura was on point. So friendly, professional and fantastic at her job. Every staff member and manager who came by were the same way.\n\nHats off to the chef and everyone here. I left full and happy. I can not wait to come back to this place again.
