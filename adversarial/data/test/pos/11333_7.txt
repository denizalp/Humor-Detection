The City of Madison continues to impress me with its food offerings; most recently, Madison Sourdough was added to my ever-expanding list of places to go while in this terrific town.\n\nWhether you're looking for a pastry, full-on breakfast, lunch, just a cup of coffee, or a crusty sourdough baguette to bring home, MS on Willy Street has you covered, and everything hits the sweet spot in your stomach.\n\nWe visited recently and had a delicious breakfast, and what a bonus that it happened to be a beautiful morning to sit outside on their patio. It felt like we were in Europe, mostly because of the adorable pooches lying obediently under the tables while their owners were enjoying their breakfast.\n\nStarted out with perfect cafe mochas. I am very picky about this drink--it has to have just the right ratio of espresso\/chocolate\/milk, and it's very easy for one to overpower the other, but theirs was spot-on.\n\nThe breakfast sandwich I had was a thing of beauty, and filled me up right up until dinner. Eggs (anyway you like 'em, I chose fried), cheddar cheese, and aioli, all served on a toasted croissant. Do yourself a favor and upgrade to add their house-smoked ham. It was so satisfying, and every component was delicious. Served with some lovely mixed greens on the side.\n\nOther breakfast items range from the traditional (eggs benedict, omelets, biscuits and gravy ) to the less conventional (huevos rancheros, sourdough french toast, potato hash with duck fat and farro), as well as a daily quiche and strata offering. You can't go wrong, and whether you're trying to be healthy or gluttonous, it's all outstanding.\n\nLunch is similarly diverse: opt for a cubano, veggie pesto sandwich, grilled cheese, chicken salad or braised beef cheeks.\n\nOn Wednesday mornings they do something called \"Coffee with Cops,\" which is a great way to engage the community and give and receive information in an informal setting.\n\nService is uber friendly. It goes without saying that their bread is fantastic, and it's served at many restaurants in Madison.\n\nI just love this place and plan to visit as much as I can when in Madison.
