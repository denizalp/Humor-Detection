This isn't the worst place I have ever been, but I really don't like the atmosphere. It is dark and dingy in here, and to top it off, it isn't really decorated like anything.\nI am really big on ambiance and I feel like The O2 Lounge doesn't have any whatsoever. The drinks are okay... but I have definitely seen better bars. It's nice if you're just looking for somewhere close on the westside.
