What a SCAM.  What do you expect when you send thousands of poker chips in the mail promising $5k in cash for just showing up and claiming a prize?  And I call just to make sure it's legit and the salesman is all buddy buddy saying yeah, this is real you won, what a joke. Thanks for wasting my Sunday afternoon and not offering me a water as you scam me out of your horse-crap of a marketing promotion.  Why don't I want to buy a Toyota?  Because they are microwaves, soulless beige appliances full of recalls....let me know when you guys make an exciting car again thx and don't scam my time.  Hope this promotion helps your yelp score!
