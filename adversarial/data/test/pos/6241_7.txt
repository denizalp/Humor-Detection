This is a great venue which is located in a great area (lots of nightlife and restaurants nearby to enjoy pre and post show). The front lobby where you wait is set-up like most of the bars in the area (drinks are reasonable), the lounge where comedians preform is in better shape than most of the comedy clubs I've ever seen. All of the staff were very friendly and accommodating. The \"green room\" is pimp.\n\nI met Howard briefly and unlike the overly dramatic bar rescue episode - he isn't the biggest asshole on the planet.
