Great place to shop if you're buying something for:\n\na) your mother-in-law that you don't know too well\nb) some girl at work that inexplicably invited you to her b-day party two days from now\nc) anyone really into animal print\n\nThe ladies that work here are beyond nice. The selection, to me, can best be summed up as \"corporatized quirky lady gear\" - wine stoppers in funny \"unexpected\" shapes, lots of frames (some really nice - reclaimed tin ceiling tiles and glass), kitchen doodads, beaded (and some forged) jewelry. Yoga mats. Fed up with men phrases on mugs. That sort of thing.\n\nHey, I'm grateful for GWE every time I have to get a gift, quickly, for a girly-girl I don't know too well. Oh yeah, and for their frames. They have a ton, in a variety of sizes, and some of them are really cool.
