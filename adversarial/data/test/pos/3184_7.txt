Honestly, when you call yourself \"King\", I expect a very good bowl of pho.   I can name quite a few restaurants off the top of my head with the ability to usurp the throne.  In fact, without the check-in discount for the grand opening, I cannot say there's much value here at all.\n\nThe pho dac biet\/combination pho I ordered seemed lacking.   The tendons were very small. \n They could have been more generous with their portioning of their flank steak and probably their noodles as well.  The broth did not stand out in any way. \n\nThe fresh spring rolls we had as an appetizer were okay.  Their accompanying peanut sauce was way too watery.  \n\nMy wife's pork chop dish was pretty good and better than the pho.   \n\nThey'll have to step up and prove to everyone in the future that they deserve the name 'Pho King'.   Right now, they're acting more like the 'Rook'ie.
