I just moved to the Phoenix area and was referred to the Gluch Group by a friend at work who had a good experience with them. All of the people I interacted with were professional, easy to get along with and generally had my best interests in mind. They have a network of trusted professionals to help with any repairs or projects during and after the home buying process and everyone who knows them speaks extremely highly of them. The other reviews speak for themselves and you won't go wrong working with this team.
