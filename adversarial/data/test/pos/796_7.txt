It's different... And it's delicious! Well deserved 5 stars on taste and the experience. \n\nThere aren't many tables though. It's a small, humble place.\n\nBut don't let that stop you from trying this spot. Just do how we do-- if it's full inside, grab your treat and eat outside like parking-lot-pimpin', a lรก 1998!
