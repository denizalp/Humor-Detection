Came here for the 2nd time today. Had the Triple Pacific the first time I came here, and today because it's really good. Unfortunately I am giving this place a one star due to the rude employee, Christina, who works here. Approaching the order window I was trying to explain to my friends who I brought here to try the place and she said \"may I help you\" three times in a short period as a way to tell me to hurry up and order. Ordered my food, and half way eating it my rice didn't have anymore sauce, and wanted a little more teriyaki sauce, so I politely ask for a little more sauce and she poured so much it was a teriyaki soup. Needless to say I couldn't finish my lunch since it was doused with teriyaki sauce. When she walked by while cleaning the area, I mentioned to her that I couldn't eat my lunch anymore since it was soaked with teriyaki sauce, she asked \"do you want more rice?\" without making any eye contact and continue to wipe around the drinking fountain area. I told her \"no thank you, you were rude.\" She said \"not really\". Then I explained the above on why she was rude, and she didn't say anything. \n\nI regret recommending this place to other people and for them to encounter such an unpleasant service as well.
