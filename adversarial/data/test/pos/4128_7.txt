I have been a Costco member for over a decade. This place never stops or slows down unless there's a power outage. The weekend is way too busy for me and there is always a traffic jam inside and out.\n\nThe meat is fresh and comes at a decent price compared if you would buy the same at a grocery store. The rotisserie chicken seems to be a popular item but I'm always finding new things for the home that I don't really need.\nThe snack bar offers great hot dogs, pizza and smoked meat plus drink for under $5.\n\nThe staff is pretty nice there but the customers can be fairly rude at times.\n\nThe only reason I give 4 out of 5 is because I can never leave without spending minimum $100. Everything is $14.99 or $19.99.\nGood tip is to go on a weekday and avoid the big crowds.
