Overall, the staff and dentist is nice which is the reason for my higher rating than a 1 star. \n\n Here are my complaints;\n\n1. Limited availability and mainly \"appointment required\" for anything. \n2. Always booked out months, but I assume this has to do with their limited availability with office hours and being open.\n3. First visit consists of X-rays (which is normal), but they require your medical and dental insurance because of their x ray machine and billing. Thus ultimately costing the patient more than necessary because they don't cover it. This results in two visits and an hour each visit.\n4. They aren't able to complete the X-Rays and cleaning on the same appointment and require a 2nd appt specifically for cleaning. \n5. Billing takes them a while to figure out what a patient owes because they are always waiting on the insurance company. I would think they would contact the insurance company in advance and have these amounts ready by the time the appointment is done so we as patients can pay at time of visit rather than getting an invoice that's a month or more later. \n6. Nickel and diming. I have worked with a couple dental companies and never received so many invoices where I owed money. I understand deductibles, etc; however for the past 7 years I have been to the dentist, I just have always paid the deductible at the time of my visit. If there's an item that an insurance company doesn't cover, I have never received invoices for that amount and I would assume the dental office just eats that. \n\n\nOverall, I just felt that this company didn't meet our needs overall which is unfortunate because they are conveniently close by and from the yelp reviews I read, I thought was a good fit. Unfortunately, that's not the case and I ended up taking my family's business to my previous dental office where I didn't feel that I was getting bills for everything, and nickel and dimed, as well as better availability.  They remain nice even to today with me being unhappy, but as I write this I just got a bill today from a visit back in the middle of May that they are still waiting on the insurance company, but they find it important to send me a bill with handwritten changes rather than getting the insurance company to figure out what they will cover and then bill the patient once for the correct and actual cost. \n\nI'm sorry, the Yelp reviews just didn't add up, or maybe I just have had far better experience at other offices than this one and so my expectations are a little better of what should have been happening with my experience. Let's just say that I ended up taking my family to another dental company that is further away, but better care, time available and not nickel and diming me for everything.
