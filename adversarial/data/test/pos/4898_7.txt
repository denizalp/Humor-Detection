Oh lord. How far have I fallen in life to be a first reviewer of burger king... The self loathe is almost too much to take right now.\n\nAll jokes aside (not really) Burger king is somewhat of a guilty pleurae for me. While the majority loves Mcdonalds, and some like wendy's or A and W, I'm a burger king man. It's my go to place for a greasy sloppy burger.\n\nWho cares about the decor, it's burger king. Who cares about the service, it's burger king! I do like their burgers though. As far as chain fast food places go, in my books BK is the best.\n\nVisit BK, if you are drunk, hungover, or just feel like a cheap greasy burger. I think they even have discounted prices at the 'drunk' time of night. Way to stay relevant in the eyes of the people BK.
