I know this place isn't huge like a casino on the strip but it still has the things us residential people want to do. I enjoy stopping in to see a movie or eat at the Mexican restaurant (they have great specials) or even play a few nickel machines. \nThey offer a players card.\nThere is a parking garage, valet and a private lot to choose for parking.\nThe inside is clean as well the restrooms.  It is nice to have a place where tourists are certainly welcome but seldom go and we can have a nice local spot!
