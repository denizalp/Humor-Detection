Man... people freak out over this place, but I'm not really sure why.  It wasn't bad. Just not much different from dozens of other places.  Think Denny's.  There you go.  I will say this, though... great service.  I had the corned beef hash.  They top it off with an egg.  I LOVE CBH, but I wouldn't order this again.  I was with three friends.  They had scrambled eggs, eggs benedict, and a chili cheese omelette.  Scrambled eggs are the same everywhere.  The eggs benedict had WAY too much hollandaise sauce.  The omelette, though, was killer.  In fact, we stopped eating our dishes and ate from her plate.  What?  Now... the banana nut muffin.  I didn't think it was all that.  Good flavor, but mine was kind of hard.  The girls, though... I swear they had an orgasm.
