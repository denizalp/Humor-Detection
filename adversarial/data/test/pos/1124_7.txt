Red Velvet pancakes!! nuff said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Okay okay I'll write more. The service is good and the food came out pretty fast. My gf had the Huntington Omelet(bacon,chedder,green peppers) avocado and salsa. Came w\/pancakes and seasoned potatoes. Her dad had the pork adobo fried rice omelet. Both were good but not as good as my red velvet pancakes!!!! Worth the drive just for that!
