Walking in here is like a time warp back to the 80's.  Polyester shirts, black gowns for the cocktail waitresses, fake cherry blossom trees, pink neon lights everywhere, flamingo stained glass lamps, permed hair, scrunchies, faded jeans, Reeboks.....\n\nCheap food and portions enough for two or three on one plate.  \n\nBartenders in the Fireside Lounge are rude imo.
