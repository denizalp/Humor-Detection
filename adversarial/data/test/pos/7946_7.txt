I'm not gonna lie. I wasn't really impressed. I just expected more from Mr. Thomas Keller of three-star Michelin French Laundry fame.\n\nMaybe it was brunch. Maybe it was Vegas. Or maybe it was just me--young, idealistic, demanding, and incapable of being blown away anymore. We began with a chocolate croissant, which was too flaky for my love for dough. Then the bakery was out of raspberry beignets at 11am on a Sunday.\n \nNext we had the Steak Frites and an Omelette with Homemade Sausage, Broccoli Rabe, and Cheese (a special). Yes, the steak and fries were enjoyable, but $33.50 for a flat iron and fries? Really? Yes, the omelette was fluffy, but $16 for beaten eggs? Really? Anthony Bourdain said restaurants mark up food by 300%--this was more like 600%.\n\nMr. Keller has fallen a little in my eyes but I'm sure a trip to the French Laundry will remedy that. I'm accepting dates there right now if anyone is interested.
