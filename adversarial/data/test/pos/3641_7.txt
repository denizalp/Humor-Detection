My name is Norma, and I have not reviewed Pizzeria Bianco yet.\n\nHi, Norma.\n\nI've lived in the Valley for my entire life and have eaten here just under 5 times, probably. I went last night for the first time in 2 + years. It was good! I mean, I won't take the weight of the hype and so forth, because the atmosphere is incredibly charming, the service is dependable and kind, and the food is fresh, mostly local, and very handcrafted. Quite frankly, there's not much in this town that brings so much local flavor and independence to cuisine as PB does. \n\nThat said, the menu doesn't offer much variety, probably for the same reason it's the champion of slow-cooking and primarily local-based. The wine list is fantastic, and, yes, you will be waiting. So don't bring your first date, don't bring the girlfriend you're trying to get rid of, bring your homies who you can talk shit with for hours on end, because it's very possible you're looking at a 3 hour experience, 2 of which are spent outside of the restaurant.
