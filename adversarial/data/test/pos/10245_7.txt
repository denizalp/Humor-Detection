If I could, this place would get NEGATIVE stars.\n\nThey would have received five stars... But I can't give them that rating now after what happened last night.\n\nMy boyfriend and I went there to get a massage on 4\/20\/2014 around 10:30pm. We were told there would be a 20 min wait time. We waited there, then were led back to our \"room\" in one of the middle open-air stalls. Mine was done by a man named Jason, and my boyfriend was some woman. Everything went fine, we both had our massages done well, and left, around 12am.\n\nAs we are heading home after dinner, my boyfriend realizes his phone is missing. I know he didn't leave his phone at the restaurant, because I would have saw it on the table, and my boyfriend would have heard it \"thunk\" had it dropped to the floor. Just to be safe, I called the restaurant and they said they have not seen it.\n\nThe next morning, my phone rings. I let it go to voicemail. When I check it a few minutes later, I see it's my boyfriends phone! The message is people speaking in Mandarin, which is odd, but my boyfriend speaks Mandarin. He figured out the people were laughing as they tried to figure out how to \"work the phone.\"  Mind you, my boyfriend's phone was locked with a password as well as a fingerprint. So they specifically looked up how to break into his phone and get access.\n\nImmediately, he calls the number back, they actually pick up and say \"Bali Foot Spa\" (and a bunch of other things my boyfriend couldn't understand because the guy was mumbling). OK, REALLY?!? He tells them that he's gonna pick up the phone today, and then the people hang up.\n\nSo my dude goes up there, and no one has his phone. No one has seen the phone, no one has any information at all. Yeah. Ohhhhh kaaayyyy.  I headed up there around 7, and all they can give me are shrugs, and \"let's pretend we don't know who took the phone\" kind of games. It has not even been 24 hours since he last had the phone. Unfortunately, he didn't have any phone tracking device installed either.\n\nThere is no way a customer had taken it, because we were one of the last people to leave because they close at midnight, and they don't take any more customers after 11:30, either. Plus, there were hardly any actual customers left in the place by the time we were walking out.\n\nSOOOOOOO, moral of the story here is:\n\nDO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, LEAVE YOUR PHONE OR ANY VALUABLES AT BALI FOOT SPA! SOMEONE WILL STEAL THEM. I have left things behind at restaurants, bars and retail stores before, and they have always been kind enough to set it aside for me. Honest and reputable places will not hire sleazy people who steal from the customers. \n\nYou have been warned.
