I am being kind when I say\" This place sucks\" As soon as you walk in, you realize your mistake. The rug is filthy, and the place looks dirty throughout. So I give it a chance anyway. After checking in we head for our table which is hard to find one without dirty dishes on it. The ones that have been supposedly cleaned haven't been wiped off. Once we find one we take our pops and set them down and put a napkin from the filthy holder over our drinks (so that no pest can get to them)  and we head for the food \" using the term lightly \" every one in there is there for the fried chicken,  but there are only a few dried pieces in the tray. How you let  anything run out is a mystery to me. So I walk around to see what else is there, trays are empty, what is left looks dry. Ohh yeah. The dishes are dirty with food on them. It looks like they just ran water on them and brought them back out. I end up eating a couple pieces of sausage and a little corn and that is all. You don't see the server until they see that you are preparing to leave, I guess so that they can collect a tip. My GF always wants to come here but I hate it so I don't tip but she always does. Some people are easily impressed, I guess that's how I got her haha. But anyway, don't waste your money on this place it is not worth it and should be closed down. Depending on how many people are with you, you would do better to put your money together and cook out.I give it one star only because I don't see a place for zero stars.
