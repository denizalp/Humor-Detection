My husband and I have been taking our English bulldogs to Dr Christina since they were 6 weeks old. She is the best vet I have ever had the pleasure of working with, my pups love her and she always has their best interest at heart. The staff is amazing and super personable. I honestly feel like this clinic works very hard to get to the root of any issues and doesn't nickel and dime you for things. We also board our dogs here when we leave town and our dogs get SO excited any time we pull into the parking lot(and are in their best behavior) I'm very thankful for AZ Animal Clinic
