Eh.... I just don't know.\n\nI come to this fry's all the time because it is the closest place to my house. Would I go somewhere else if it weren't so close? Yes. \n\nWhen I was living at home, it was only the finer grocery stores for me. However, now that I pay rent and all that good stuff, I find myself frequenting the cheaper places. Like Fry's. \n\nGross things that have happened to me at this fry's: One time I found a mealworm\/maggot type thing in my broccoli. Another time there were still feather remnants on my chicken. Some people say this could be considered normal - it still totally grossed me out and I took it back.\n\nGrossest thing about this location - the stench. I couldn't tell you WHAT in god's name it smells like, but its gross. Basically from about 10 feet before the entrance and througout almost the entire front half of the store (and produce section) it just..... stinks. We call it the \"Fry's aroma\". \n\nBasically if I can, I buy all of my produce and meat at sprout's. Then I go to Fry's for everything else. Rice, cereal, bread, ice cream, cheese, etc. \n\nIt's not that bad of a place, its just not that great of place either.
