I have an aversion to \"sit yourself\" and pay at counter joints. I also have an affinity to pancakes. A 4star is quite a feet when I should already be stripping a shop of their stars.\n\nStaff was great.... fantastic, I'd have to say best staff in breakfast joints in Vaughan.\n\nI got a coffee for $2.50, saw the boom all day and got that instead, free coffee plus other stuff for 6$...\n\nI look like a degenerate more so today then usual, but the staff was fast and friendly kept bringing refills asking if everything was ok, maybe they were worried I was homeless and was gonna dash??(probably not with an iPhone)\n\nWith every shop doing their spin on home fries, potatoes, hash browns they probably have the healthier alternative and 2nd tastiest spuds.\n\nCoffee was good and flavourful even after cream and sugar. Eggs were perfectly executed.\n\nThe pancakes, with chocolate sauce, it's 2016, everyone is using Nutella now, but even that stuff wouldn't be able to salvage the pancakes, the batter whatever healthy alternative that it might be just sucked, sorry.\n\nIf I had a group of people that needed to be happy with service I'd bring them here. Staff gave 110%\n\nJust me alone, can't say I'll be back again... maybe for lighter fare or just to sit drink coffee and read a paper
