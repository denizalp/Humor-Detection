What a great idea. A beer cafe right at the gates. Not only beer, but a full selection of your favorite adult beverages. I have hurried passed this little gem a few times and have never had enough time to stop. You see, I am what is called a procrastinator and always wait until the last minute to get to the airport, so I am always running to the gate. Not this time! I was actually early and had time to stop for a cold one. It wasn't even noon yet, but I wasn't going to pass up the oportunity to visit a beer \"cafe.\" \n\nThey serve up Stella and Bud Light on tap, coupled with a large selection of bottle beers. The bartender, Gabby, was as friendly as they come and kept everybody happy. It was amazing to see so many noontime drinkers. Quite a few people just grabbed a drink and headed for the slot machines, while others were content to sit and relax. The Belgian Beer Cafe displays two good sized TV's for your viewing pleasure and offers half-priced shots with every beer purchase.\n\nWorried about consuming on an empty stomach? There are plenty of places to grab some gub within the gate area. The drinks aren't cheap, but you're at the airport, right? I will say this though, the beer was nice and cold and Gabby was serving up some nice looking Bloody Mary's and other mixed drinks as well. \n\nNo more strolling to the other B Gates for libations while you wait. The Belgian Beer Cafe has got just what you need right near gate B 25. I will defintely allow myself plenty of time to \"catch my flights\" in the future.
