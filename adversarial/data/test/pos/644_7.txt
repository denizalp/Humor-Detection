Great show,3.5 stars! We were lucky enough the night we decided to go that LouLou D'vil,the 2013 Miss Exotic World was the guest star & she was hot ass hell. We got a great price on groupon & I felt I got my money's worth.\n\nThe theme of the show is obviously pin ups but in a calendar girl theme. A different performance for each month of the year. All the performers were great dancers & it was well choreographed. We enjoyed it & have been happy to suggest people check it out!
