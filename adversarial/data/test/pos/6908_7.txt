the food here is great, but the service extremely spotty.\n\none time a server implied my grandma was fat...yeahhh...awkward.\n\n\nthat 'incident' didn't keep us from returning, mostly because the server was not employed much longer. judging from her level of customer service, i'd imagine she works for giant eagle now.
