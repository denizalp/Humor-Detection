For over the last 2 1\/2 years I have been a tenant with Gavish. The people that work there are extremely helpful. When I first moved to Nevada I called the company to find a house for rent. I was sent Susan. Beautiful personality, patient and honest. She gave me 1000% of her attention. She was my angel. Then after I moved into the perfect house for me and my puppy the people who help me with issues is Joe and Amanda. They listen and try to do the best they can for you. If you need to rent or purchase I recommend Gavish.
