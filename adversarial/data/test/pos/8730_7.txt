I used to come here all the time, I would always look the other way when the place was not as clean as it should be, never said anything when the workers would rudely not stop chatting amongst themselves, but today was the last straw.  I went in and just stood there for minutes and was completely ignored. So rude. Think ill go elsewhere from now on.
