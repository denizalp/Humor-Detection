Yay!  I'm a fan!\n\nThe rating says it all.  I love seafood, so maybe I'm bias.  I'll say right off the bat, that the seafood isn't the BEST I've ever had (easy, Drake), but for what it is this place is pretty awesome.\n\nI had lunch here when I was in Vegas one time.  No crowd, no wait, walk right in and sit down.  First star goes to the staff.  Fun, full of energy, always on top of it, and they give you awesome bibs (haha!).\n\nNext star goes to the restaurant.  For a bar\/seafood pot restaurant, it's very clean!  The one in Henderson is fun like a sports bar mixed with a bubba gumps.  Just so many random things hung around on the walls, it's interesting.\n\nThe last two stars is for the food.  Between 3 of us, we had 2 pots and a couple appetizers.  The pots are full of flavor.  Every piece of seafood takes on whatever flavor you choose to have.  One of the pots we had was with the cajun flavor, SOOOOO GOOD!!  The other pot we had was your typical garlic butter flavor...also very good!  The apps that we ordered were the spinach dip and coconut shrimp.  Both dishes again were very tasty.  As mentioned, the seafood isn't the freshest ever, but it's still very flavorful.  When you get those pots, it's like opening a christmas present of food.  You're usually not disappointed with a christmas present.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend Joe's Crab Shack.  If you live in Hawaii, you ALWAYS see the commercials and for the most part, those commercials are true.  Great food, great place, great price!
