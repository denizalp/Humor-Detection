my wife: everything about here made me mad\n\nno happy hour, no to go bags for the food, servers who clearly don't want to be there - just part of the magical, family friendly dining experience you can expect from red lobster.\n\non the other hand you're eating at red lobster. I guess 2\/5 is still a 100% improvement over what you'd expect, but it still doesn't make the experience any better\n\nseriously no happy hour on a Wednesday at 5:30p? just because you're down the street from the grand poobah Mormon temple doesn't mean your business can't have fun
