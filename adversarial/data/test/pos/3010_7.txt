What can I say that's good..hmmmm I love our truck....ummmm they kinda made everything with the paperwork a nightmare we had just bought a house in Oregon we were relocating so our residence was Oregon we showed them the paperwork for the house and they needed an Oregon Id  we didn't have that yet we were just moving so of we went to our first trip of our move pulled in on a Friday at 330 got to dmv and guess what no testing after 3 of course!  So we call the dealership and they had written 2 contacts one from our old sold home in Nevada and one for Oregon (just incase you don't know Oregon has no taxes so if they push the Nevada contact we pay nevada taxes) which is illegal and refused to give us copies for that reason well or flight back to Vegas was Sunday so dmv was not an option we told them use our home contact and escrow papers but no they kept threaghting to push the Nevada contact. ..we made our final trip to Oregon a few days later got our Id sent it to them and done but what a stressful hassle they were very unprofessional oh I almost forgot lol and we dropped the truck off the day after we bought it to fix a broken light we came to check if they were done because they never called and we got on the lot to find the truck we just purchased on the lot with a for sale sign on it this place is very unprofessional and careless we will never do business with them again
