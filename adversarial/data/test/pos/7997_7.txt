I doubt it's changed since I last graduated from UIUC 5 years ago, but walk\/run\/crawl to Chicago than take this pos garbage. This junk of a company made trips back home to the burbs unbearable.\n\nWhy?\n-Customer service is nonexistent\n-Dilapidated buses (i.e., one only had the rear half of the overhead aisle lighting operable), which are essentially poorly refurbished 30yr old MCI coaches. The only time the ride was ever decent was when an Illini-Swallow Lines was contracted out (which unfortunately is now defunct)\n-Owner (not much more to say, just read the \"delightful\" comments here on this piece of work)\n-Late, unreliable, and unpredictable schedule. A typical 2 hr trip takes 4 due to undisclosed stops.\n-Overpriced. Since this organization has cornered the market in terms of campus-chicago transportation, prices are exaggerated at a minimum $50 roundtrip. For reference, here one can take an LA to Las Vegas trip (which is much further @ 250 miles)  on a weekend for only ~$40 rountrip!\n\nIf I could, I wouldn't even give them one star
