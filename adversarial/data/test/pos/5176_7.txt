TURNED MY HAIR FROM DARK  INTO A GOLDEN DIAHRREA COLOR!! Please save your time and money and go elsewhere. I came in here hoping to go lighter and the hair stylist, said that I will be able to go blonde in one try and two at most. To keep it short, she dumped bleach in my hair twice,put me under the dryer( with bleach in my hair), burnt my scalp with second degree burns, and left my hair into a color that resembled golden hershey squirts.  And in the end her and the salon still had the audacity to charge me almost $300.00 for completely messing up my hair. WASTE OF MONEY, WASTE OF HAIR GONE TO WASTE, WASTE OF TIME. AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST!
