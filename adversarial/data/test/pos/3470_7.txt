By far the best mechanic shop in town! I've followed Fred and Liberty automotive through all his locations in Phoenix. When you find an honest mechanic, you stick with them! Fred and his team make sure my car is running in tip top condition and don't try to up sell me for other services! Even when they are busy they always make sure to keep me posted on how long it will be and if I'm not able to wait, I can either leave the car there or schedule time with him another day. I've never been disappointed in the service I've received! I would recommend Fred and Liberty automotive to everyone like I already have. :)
