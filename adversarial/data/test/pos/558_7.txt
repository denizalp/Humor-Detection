I had a coupon from restaurant.com. we tried this restaurant. My husband had a filet mignon. They tried three times to cook this steak correct. The first two times. It was raw. The last time it was burnt. We never got refills on drinks or had the server ask about the meal. They gave us one free desert. But even that was burnt. We won't be back.
