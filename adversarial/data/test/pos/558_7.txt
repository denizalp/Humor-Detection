I can't remember when I started to love Noodlecat, then dislike it, now I'm just somewhere in the middle. \n\nThey seem to go through spurts with their flavor, menu, and service. Where sometimes its super awesome, and sometimes you're like...what is happening. I randomly visited on a late afternoon after a longggg time. They've changed their menu--everything is now \"build your own bowl\" - and many of the specials and long time favorites are gone.\n\nI also must mention this pet peeve. For how messy these slurpy noodles can be, the napkins in the table dispensers are quite tiny and very thin. I probably went through an absurd amount of napkins to equal one regular napkin. Just feels wasteful.  \n\nI built my own noodles and settled on the udon with Korean Short Rib and egg. I really loved the broth flavor. It was a little sweet and savory. The portion of short rib was also super generous, and you eat it right off the bone. However, I would have loved a plate for the bones, and since I didn't really see my server for a long time to ask, I ended up making a really awkward pile of short rib bones on the table between two napkins. Because of the depth of the bowl, dropping the bones back in made it too hard to get the noodles. She did come back eventually, but not until I was done. Le sigh.\n\nOverall, as far as food quality goes, I think Noodlecat has made some improvements. I left feeling more optimistic then my last visit! Hope they'll continue making improvements on the service side.
