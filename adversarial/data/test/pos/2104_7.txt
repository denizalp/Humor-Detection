Dunkin Donuts on Saturday mornings with mom and dad.  Dad complaining that bismarks are almost a dollar each and mom telling him to leave me alone because I had just had dance class so I needed the carbs and me, not knowing the value of a dollar at 8 years old, wanting two of them because I knew that I would not get another chance at one for two weeks.\n\nThose were my good old days of Dunkin Donuts. Fresh donuts rolling out all day in \"Time to Make the Donuts\" fashion. \n\nFast forward a few years and a few dance classes. What I have now is the Ann\/Simmons version of Dunkin Donuts and a  Saturday morning craving.   This location had been temoporarily closed.  Maybe the reason was the slow service, to many mouths behind the register or the stale donuts visibly delivered in a Ryder truck.\n\nWhat I experienced on my most recent visit back was a bit of dissaray behind the register, a friendly manager and support staff, and a better quality of donut but at 7 am they are still not fresh. \n\nAs for the cost of the donuts, maybe I should call dad and see how he feels about paying over a dollar for a donut and almost $4.00\/gallon for gas.  I see a lecture about how gas used to be 25 cents a gallon in my future.
