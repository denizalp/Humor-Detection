A chic, mod, posh looking place for AYCE? Can this be true? \n\nCame with a group of 10. Service could've been better as we were ignored a few times but it wasn't too bad overall. \n\nTHe food was delicious  and we ordered so much stuff.... from thai to jap dishes. We definitely can't wait to be back soon. A bit disappointed no desserts with the AYCE but i guess it's not biggie. \n\nEat till you drop :) Be sure to reserve a table to avoid any disappointments. I feel weekends here are crazy....
