This was my first time at this sushi place and I was actually surprised that it only has a 3 star rating. My usual sushi spot is JJANGA on either fort apache and sunset or twain and decatur where I go for all you can eat sushi. \n\nI generally can eat A LOT so when I only had 2 rolls here and couldn't even finish the two I was pretty amazed. Maybe I was a little off on my sushi game that day but the rolls tasted great and fresh and had a lot of fish in them! This place didn't skimp on their ingredients. \n\nThe rolls were a bit pricey considering they did not have an all you can eat option.\n\nIt was not busy at all when my party and I went and our service was very attentive. I will definitely have to take another stop here!
