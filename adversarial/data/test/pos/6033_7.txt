Come on Yelp Calgary, are you seriously going to let me have the FTR in the \"chinese finger trap\" bridge!? Laaaazzzzzzzyyyyy\n\nDespite all the controversies surrounding this bridge, I'm going to say this. I like it. Walking through makes me feel like I'm in a spaceship and I'm about to head over to the captain's cabin to make my briefing on the Borg's that I had to vaporize. Except it's a shitty spaceship because lets face it, in the future people don't walk, EVER.\n\nIt's well lit at night so the second time I walked through to get back to the Kensington area it was filled with gleeful photographers, gross couples dancing through their fornication rituals, and a dozen Zoey Deschanel's clopping through to make their way to either Oolong or Higher Ground. I have a friend that lives around the area and he loves this bridge too. Mind you, it seems like it's a little retarded for me that a cross walk doesn't exist right beside this bridge but whats wrong with a little jay walking here and there?\n\nWill I be coming back here in the future? Yes...why the hell not?\n\nUnderdog Challenge 13\/30
