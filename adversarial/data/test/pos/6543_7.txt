A good, decent but not spectacular casino.I didn't really get a good look at the outside of this casino because some idiot Uber drive dropped me off inside the dam parking garage. Once I got inside, nothing really impressed me. It kind of looks like an airport inside. The sportsbook looks Ok. Nothing special. The casino has more of a tourist vibe. I didn't like how the Palazzo is connected to it. It just gave me an airport feel. When I did  go outside, the place just looked confusing. The architecture was just weird. A bridge over there, another part of the building here, cars going here. It was so congested. It definitely wouldn't be the first casino I would show my folks. I would probably show them Caesars first.
