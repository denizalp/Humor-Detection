I was lucky enough to spend last Saturday evening with the beautiful Ebony K and friends. We started out with bruschetta to share with the table, then a salad (Emilia) two pizzas to share.  One of the pizza's was called Vegetariana and don't remember the other one.  The meal was fresh and flavorful.  The best thing about the resto is that the patio feels cozy and lovely.  I promise to bring cash on girls night out next time!  of course I did pay back the cash I owed the next day but felt bad that Ebony's friend took care of the entire bill.
