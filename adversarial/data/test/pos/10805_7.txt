Had to wait 30 minutes for my reservation. The environment is tacky; filled with gaudy crystals and golden peacocks on the wall. Extremely loud environment and the waiters whisper to you. Do not recommend. Our waiter was uneducated and couldn't hold a conversation. They say every dish takes \"40 minutes to cook\". Absolutely terrible experience.
