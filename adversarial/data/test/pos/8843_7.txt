Don't do it... trust me - you'll thank me later. \n\nBeing that my mother is Dominican and I've lived there, I can def say they should not advertise anything stating of Dominican ANYTHING. Period.\n\nThe chicken in the Chicharr√≥n de Pollo sin hues was disgusting! They used chicken that was just about to go bad... I\"m sure they figured if they fry it, they will cover up the gamey gross chicken. My god what an insult that was. \n\nHahaha what a joke their Pastelito's were.... Really? Come on now, those were just plain embarrassing.\n\nI'm still upset about my dining experience because I so wanted to like it, but I only two things I like about this establishment is the Presidente beer and leaving!
