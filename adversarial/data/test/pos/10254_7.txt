We went back there again about a week ago. \n\nThe same things that appealed to me the first time annoyed me the second time. \n\nWhy valet parking? Its like having valet parking at a Lone Star. It doesn't make sense. \n\nThe hostess is...weird. The atmosphere is odd. Why is the kitchen attached to the salad bar? \n\nWhy the stupid cartoon building wall paper? \n\nThe steak with tender but tasteless. \n\nBasically, it was a  bunch of blue collar workers who make less money than me acting like they were better than me. \n\nLame.
