Yes yes yes!! Go here and go all out! \n\nI was taken here by a client about 5 years ago and had the BEST lobster ever. I went back tonight for the first time since and again had ... the BEST lobster ever.\n\nTheir seafood is impeccably fresh and the staff delightful. Yes, it's pricey, but I've concluded that there are two types of food in Vegas: CRAP (cheap) and REALLY good (expensive). Splurge and go for it!\n\nI had the herb butter lettuce salad, 1\/2 dozen oysters (3 diff varieties), 1\/2 lobster (1 lb for $37 - they will say it's 2 lbs for $72 but ask for 1\/2!), side of mashed pots, side of grilled asparagus, sorbet platter (3 big scoops of different kinds), espresso, and a 1\/2 bottle of sauvignon ... everything was absolutely delightful and the crew (4 people??? Server, bus person, \"extension of the kitchen??\", and sommelier)  handling my table of one were top of the line service professionals.\n\nGO HERE.\n\nHave fun!
