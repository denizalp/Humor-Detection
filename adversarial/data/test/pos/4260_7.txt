Located off the actual strip. It's about 15 minutes away, located in the M hotel. The line is SUPER SUPER long...but I have to say this is the best buffet ever! $33 for weekends lunch\/dinner, which includes unlimited food & alcohol. \n\nMan...the buffet was SO big.. I had no idea where to START!!\n\n\nI am taking 1 star off for the almost 2 hour wait... DON'T COME HERE SUPER HUNGRY, because you will be pissed, starving and ready to kill someone.
