The hype is real. Is this worth a $20 cab ride from the strip? Come on, it's just a sandwich. Let's not go crazy here... That being said, if you have a car\/friend\/etc, this place is incredible. \n\nWhat makes it so special? You know that slimy deli turkey meat stuff they serve at subway and well almost everywhere? They don't use that here.. they use real turkey that tastes like leftovers from thanksgiving. As everyone says, the bobbie really is thanksgiving on a bun. I thought stuffing, cranberry, and turkey would be kind of sick, but honestly it's incredible and you must try it. If you're looking for a sandwich place that's different than your everyday deli meat place, try here. The Cran Slam Club is also incredible (if you have a fear of stuffing or feel it doesn't belong on a sandwich), as is the cheesesteak if you're some freak that doesn't like thanksgiving turkey.
