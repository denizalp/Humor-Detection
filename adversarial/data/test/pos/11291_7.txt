When you've been partying all night at a fancy shmancy club on the Las Vegas strip and all you want to do at the end of the night is burn your stilettos and grub because you're so dang hungry, Market Street Cafe is the place to be!\n\nIt's inside the California Hotel in old Las Vegas, but definitely worth the cab ride there.  I paid a $26 dollar cab fare to get there from the Hard Rock Hotel last summer when our total meal only cost us $14 bucks, lol!\n\nThey have a variety of late night eats available, the majority of our table of seven had tocino (sweet pork, a Filipino delight!), eggs and garlic rice.  The seventh friend got spam & eggs, it looked scrumptious!\n\nThere is a line to get seated at 2:00 a.m.  You might find yourself standing in the amusement park-line set up for a good 20 to 30 minutes, but like Reggie mentioned in his review, it's the perfect time to people watch and giggle about the drunkos nearby.\n\nI think going to Market Street Cafe will be part of our routine whenever we go to Vegas.  It's good and they're open 24 hours, plus I need to try this oxtail soup everyone is talkin' about!
