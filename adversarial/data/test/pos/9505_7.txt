Convenient wine and liquor store. The upstairs Signature boutique is pleasant and ritzy, and the downstairs SAQ Classique is like a clean mini-mart.\n\nPicked up a few bottles for dinner (not too expensive, credit cards accepted), then headed on our way. The cashier asked me if I wanted a bag (extra); next time I'll buy an SAQ wine tote!\n\nNeat trivia: This is the first SAQ I've ever walked into.
