Disappointed in the flavor and quality of the food. I've had amazing Mexican food and was spoiled by it back home in California. I've come to the conclusion that I'll never be blown away by Mexican food in Arizona. \n\nLike many of the places i have been to, there's a certain lack of authenticity and culture in the aiding of experience and overall preparation of the food.
