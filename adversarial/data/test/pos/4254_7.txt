The sign still says Paradise Bakery. I ordered pick 2 off the menu (ancient grain\/arugula salad and turkey BLT). Food came out super fast and they were very helpful. However, food was mediocre at best. They lost something when Panera took over Paradise. The only thing I really enjoyed here was the cookies.
