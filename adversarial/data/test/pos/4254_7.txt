I absolutely love Windsor! Is there anything Upward Projects does wrong? I have been here about a million times and it's amazing every time. I used to live in the neighborhood but even since I have moved I still go out of my way to come here for lunch. My go to lunch is the Fattoush salad with shrimp. This is probably the only salad I crave consistently and I haven't been able to perfect it at home yet. Another favorite menu item of mine is the loaded chips piled high with caramelized onion, bacon, and bleu cheese with chipotle crema, the only reason I don't get these every time is because I'm usually alone. The crab cake BLT and pastrami Reuben are also must haves. \n\nTrue to the Upward Project motif, Windsor offers happy hour $5 pitchers, cocktails, and glasses of wine until 5pm. I personally am partial to the No. 17 {Cucumber Vodka | Green Tea Syrup | Fresh Cucumber | Mint} served up, this drink is so refreshing and the perfect addition to my solo lunch. \n\nService here is always great. If I'm not mistaken they have a team approach to service where you have several different people helping you and they pool tips. This can make it harder to find your actual server, but it also means that everyone is there to help with what you need. \n\nI'll be coming here forever!
