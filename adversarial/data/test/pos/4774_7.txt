Annie's offers pretty legit Italian fare, just like your Italian mother makes (which I wouldn't know anything about, my mom's Okinawan)... Mangia bene, anyway \n\nLocated right off of Valle Verde and the 215, on the other side of the Smith's shopping center, Annie's Gourmet Italian offers up your standard pasta dishes, and I had heard the Tiramisu is made in-house! (My wife and I's favorite dessert...). The interior is dark and cozy, booths line the window front and far wall surrounding the dining room tables. On the tops of each booth, adding more privacy are illuminated photos of Annie's family history...adds to the ambience (as you listen to Sinatra's greatest hits in the background). There is also a hidden bar in the back and outside patio seating (which I'm told allows pets).\n\nWe've had been to Annie's once before, I had a Groupon...I had the Fettuccine Alfredo with Shrimp and the wife had the potato gnocchi, both were delicious. This time around we started with the antipasto platter. This thing was huge (probably meant for a party of four), fresh mozzarella, sliced prosciutto, salami, ham, roast beef, roasted peppers, green and black olives, artichoke hearts on top of a bed of greens and topped with a cross-hatch of thin breadsticks...it wuz amazing. This time around, I tried the Chicken Piccata. Lightly saut√©ed , pounded chicken breast in a buttery, lemony, white winey sauce with capers...soooo good. The wife had the Chicken Marsala, which she only had a couple bites...too much of the antipasto! Looked and smelled delicious, though. We were stuffed, but took the Tiramisu home for later.\n\nSo, what have we learned ...Annie's is legit Italian food, and my mom makes a mean taco-rice but always served her marinara out of a jar (sorry mom). Try Annie's Gourmet Italian...and save room for dessert.
