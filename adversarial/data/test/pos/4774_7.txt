Horrible,Awful,Horrid, -1 star is there an option for that? The haircut they gave me was absolutely unprofessional. The so called \"hair stylist\" dared to call me lazy for not shaving that is the most horrible customer service I have experienced in my life. The only thing lazy was the haircut she gave me and the prices they charge for her horrible job. Truly if your looking for a great haircut near buffalo its called House of Fades great hair cuts, friendly service, great atmosphere and prices for the work they do.\n\nHORRIBLE!!! NUFF SAID!!!
