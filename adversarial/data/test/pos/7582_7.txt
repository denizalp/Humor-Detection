Terrible applications of science. I got the tour guide to admit that she didn't know what a fossil even was. The museum claims to be able to create fossilized teddy bears in order to sustain the idea tjat fossils are not millions of years old but less than a few thousand. If you value your child's education DO NoT take him\/her here. Adults only.
