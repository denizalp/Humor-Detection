It's always a bad sign when the first girl you see when you walk in has a belly that sticks out further then her boobs do.  \n\nI showed up with some friends, and we paid the cover to get in.  The door guy took our tickets and then introduced us to another bouncer who said we had to pay additional to get a table.  I told him we didn't want a table but he said we had no choice and he charged us a few bucks a head to get seats.  When he walked us in there were no seats available so he put  us next to an empty stage.  I asked for our money back and he said no.  As the man was larger then me, as was his companion, and i was on foreign soil, i let it go.  A waitress then came over and told us we had to order drinks.  No one had mentioned that when we paid the cover charge of course.  We sat there for about 15 minutes and watched a procession of mostly fat and ugly girls come ask us if we would like lap dances.  That was all we really needed, and we headed for the door.\n\nWe didn't experience the lap dances so i can't comment there, but the place looked seedy, the girls were gross, and the drinks were watered down.  I would avoid this place like the plague.\n\nWorld famous?  I think not.  What a disappointment!
