The final chapter of my trilogy begins...\n\nThe previous two reviews were for the rides, a 10 star experience no doubt.  This one's for the prices and the food. \n\n$122.00 was the damage in total. The two tickets we bought at the door came to almost $74! The rest went to food. We avoided the games. \n\nTwo hoagies and two drinks at the Hoagie Haus stand cost over $17 alone! And they weren't very good. I've had better at Subway, honestly. \n\nIn fact, I can see why the Potato Patch Fries and lemonade are Kennywood's two most popular food items; they're the only things that are made fresh on the premises. \n\nHow hard is it to cut fries from potatoes and fry them? I ask because at every other stand in Kennywood aside from the Small Fry, which also sells them  Potato Patch-style, they're pre-cut, frozen, and come from a bag. It makes no sense. \n\nSo yeah, we tried the PP fries late in the day. The verdict?\n\nThey taste like every other steak fries you've ever had from any other diner you've been to; they are nothing special outside of Kennywood. We got them with cheese, bacon, and garlic salt. However, they were easily the best thing we munched on save for the plump franks we got at another booth as the rest was obviously yanked from a freezer. I saw frost on burger patties, which is never a good sign. I was even told their funnel cake mix is pre-made now, and it tasted like it. \n\nYes, there are lines for everything. You will spend 40 minutes waiting to ride a coaster that takes 90 seconds and another half hour waiting for a pretzel and a Pepsi.\n\nI really, really resent overpriced food, especially when it's not fresh and mediocre at the very best. But they got ya. You can't sneak out, get a bite somewhere else, and come back, unless you want to get gouged for a ticket again. \n\nNonetheless, there's something truly bewitching about the park after sunset, especially when the music plays. Small children run about with eyes as big as the moon. Teary, smiling teenage girls squeal about how awesome a ride was as their male peers chuckle and guffaw at their buddies for wimping out or getting nauseous. Young and old lovers stroll, holding hands, carrying gaudy stuffed animals...\n\nIf and when I go back, I'm looking for a special deal on the tickets. There has to be a way to save money here. Kennywood risks pricing themselves out of business in this crappy economy, and having that happen to a legendary old park would be a tragedy. Give your patrons a break, Kennywood and prepare some higher quality food while you're at it.\n\nP.S. I miss the Gold Rush also. That giant spider was kvlt!!!
