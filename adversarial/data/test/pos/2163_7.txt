Masarap ang lutong ni Nanay Gloria! (Nanay Gloria's cooking is good). \n\nThe food was pretty decent and nicely flavored. We were surprised at the selection- we were expecting to have maybe half the choices offered.\n\nFrom what I recall there was- \nmungo (mungbean with bittermelon and pork), - pretty okay, but I make it better since mine is very meaty\/savory\npaksiw baboy (pork slices in a sweet soy sauce), * - BF loved this. Sweet, sticky, but nice flavors. \nginesang pusit (sauteed squid w\/ chilies, and bellpepper), *- I really liked this. Right on with the flavors.\npancit (thin glass noodles),- was okay\n sisig (chopped pork with vinegar, chilies and onion), *- made with the lechon kawali, lots of chilies, added more vinegar for a kick\nginetaang baboy (pork in coconut &shrimp paste sauce), *- this was good. I love coconut milk based dishes\nlechon kawali (crispy fried or roasted pork belly), - good, crispy. Like always, big layer of fat, but at least you can pick it off it you're not a fat lover. \nlengua estofada (beef tongue slices in a tomato soy sauce)* - the tongue was really soft, but I like how they kept them in thick slices to keep it juicy inside. The sauce was good, but I scraped a lot off since I like tasting more of the lengua flavor\nafritada manok (chicken in a tomato sauce- has bellpepper, potatoes, carrot),- I didn't try\nginisang (squash, shrimps, green beans, bittermelon sautee)- grabbed only some green beans, okay\nginisang ampalaya (bittermelon sauteed with eggs)- didnt try\nseafood ginetaang (mixed seafood in coconut milk)- didnt try\ndiniguan (pork cooked in it's blood and spices)*- pretty decent for the standard style of doing diniguan. I do it in a different style which no restaurant makes and I feel is tons better\npalabok (thick rice noodles in a sortve \"gravy\" sauce)- mushy, didnt like\npork afritada (pork tomato sauce stew- has peas, potatoes, hotdog, bellpeppers)- had a small bite only, decent\nNilaga Baka (beef broth soup with chunks of beef and veggies like bokchoy, cabbage, potato)- didn't have\nkaldereta (beef stew)- pretty decent, but a bit more oily than I make it\nkare kare (oxtail, tripe, eggplants and green beans in a thick peanut sauce)- no oxtails to be found, way too oily, but the tripe was nice in it.\nbeef steak (sliced beef and onions in soy sauce)- this was okay...it was straight soy...lacking that signature sauce lemony\/soy\/beefy flavor \nfried salmon- didnt try\nfried bangus\/milkfish*- pretty good! my favorite fish and it was fresh. \npata na paksiw (pork leg\/hocks cooked in soy and banana flowers)- didnt try, I dont really like the fatty leg rims\nginetang (warm coconut milk dessert with sweet yams and tapioca)- too full to have dessert\nbanana que (bananas fried with sugar) - too full to have dessert\nfresh fruit bar- watermelon, oranges, pineapple, etc. - looked fresh\n\nThe * are some of our favorites. BF really loved the paksiw- tender and nice flavor, I love the lengua the best. \n\nThere are some extras you can buy but we were hella full to grab them. They have chicken empanadas, crispy pata (deep fried pork leg), sweets like polvoron (powdered milk \"cookie\"), pastillas (chewy milk candies), cashew tarts, tamarind candy, turon (fried banana and jackfruit \"eggroll\" cooked with a coating of sugar on the wrapper), kuchinta (steamed rice cake), pichi-pichi (rice and cassava cake rolled in grated coconut).  \n\nBTW- they are CASH ONLY. Lucky I had cash today, I normally don't roll with much more than a few bucks for tips and my cards. \n\nSimply put- compared to the Filipino a-la-carte places nearby, this is better in terms of quality and flavor and freshness (they have decent traffic so it doesn't sit forever). Add in the kicker that you can eat all you want for $7!. Some items were a miss like the palabok was mushy, but most were decent to good, spot on flavors. I can't complain since I can pick and choose what I want to eat and can skip out on the a-ok items and pig on the things I love. \n\nYes, there's a bit of fat, a bit of grease, but nothing that you can't scoop out. It's kinda part of the culture...Flipinos enjoy their fat. It's not  really more than say other greasy cuisines like diner food, chinese, soul food, etc.. It's why I don't eat out all the time though is so I can savor these when I do decide to eat something greasy and homey.  I think that's partly why MY mother's food is best to me- she tends to buy only higher end, leaner meats, but cooks with all the love and flavor. I got used to my moms health conscious, yet still flavorful Filipino, but she's no where close so I'll take something 2nd best to moms cooking....specially since I don't cook my own cultures food on a regular at home (for shame, I know and I call myself a \"cook\"). \n\nWill definitely be back!
