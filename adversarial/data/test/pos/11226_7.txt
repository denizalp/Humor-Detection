I have not been to this restaurant in a couple years but from what I can remember from it is that is was freaking amazing. The Parmesan Truffle fries were so fresh and delicious. The Russian roulette of jalapeno poppers with their own individual dipping sauces were incredible. The burgers were so good and cooked to perfection which to me is medium rare.I can't wait to come back to this spot next year. I highly recommend you stop by this place if you are in the Las Vegas area and you will not be disappointed at all.\n\nPS: It is very hard to choose a burger because everything looks good!
