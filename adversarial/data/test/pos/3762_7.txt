We stopped in here because the Mexican restaurant we wanted to go to was closed. First off, we waited about 10 minutes to even be seated. Then our waitress seemed as if she really didn't want to be there. Great. We ordered our food (I got a burger) and it seemed to take a while to show up and additions I had requested were missing. I asked for a side of ranch for the fries, no ranch when the food came, asked again, still 5 minutes later no ranch. By time I got the ranch the fries were cold. Great. I was absolutely appalled by the taste of the food, the service and the entire experience. Never again.
