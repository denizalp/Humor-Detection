I have not joined this club yet. Went shopping and comparing LVAC and this location since they are both near me. What greeted me at the entrance were far more laid back and friendlier people. Hate to say it but LVAC seemed dopier. I guess even Dopey has to leave the hut sometime and work somewhere. I introduced myself to the counter, told them what I and my friend were looking for and was promptly taken on a tour and then pricing. Since I know what I want in a gym, I perused the basics and bypassed the extraneous (Zumba room, squash [i am not even sure how to spell it to be honest] etc). All in all, the lady showing is around turned out to be the manager, Mina. Pleasant, no stress, and no need for me to escalate or calm the situation down.\n\nGo to LVAC and if you get Garland, you are liable to leave there with a used car as well as a multi year membership for you and your gimp legged buddy on their super glide treadmill. Ah yes, the hyperbole isn't Elon Musk's newest tube traveler wonder.
