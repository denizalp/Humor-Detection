Absolutely the BEST nail salon I have ever been to! I called before I went and the lady said come in about 10 minutes. I walked in very nice lady greeted me and offered me a seat as the lady that was suppose to be doing my nails was just finishing up with a client. I got a french acrylic set overall it took about an hour and a bit to complete. \n\nThe lady doing my nails was very polite and funny she spoke with me and we had lovely conversations. As well the owner asked if I was in a rush or not I said a little bit so the owner started doing my nails at the same time as the other lady. \n\nUsually when I get my nails done I am VERY PICKY! they have to be just the right length and the Polish has to be put on just right I found with this place if I said oh could you maybe make it a little shorter she said sure no problem and it didn't seem like I was asking too much which I really enjoyed. \n\n\nNear the end I was getting ready to leave and one of the lovely lady's helped me put on my coat and helped me do it up. \n\nOverall EXCELLENT customer service and I definitely recommend trying it!!:)
