Good heavens is this little sweet treat of a cafe hidden, but well worth the venture into the hotel, for its delicacies proved worthy of any possible confusion.\n\nWe did not come for dinner this evening, but instead, a rare occasion, simply dessert.  Sometimes that's the best way to do it though.  Generally you won't get dessert at places because you're too stuffed from dinner, so coming for dessert was a nice change of pace and BOY oh BOY did Cafe Bricco DELIVER!\n\nOur waiter was friendly, fun, not annoyed by the fact that we weren't ordering meals too, and just an all around pleasure.  He kept our water glasses full, which was key actually, because these desserts could certainly be rich.\n\nWe ordered tiramisu, pistachio gelato, I had an Espresso Martini with chocolate drizzle, and the boys had caramel apple cheesecake.\n\nIs your mouth salivating yet?  Because I'm about to pass out over here just reminiscing with my taste buds - overwhelming nostalgia.\n\nThe cheesecake was rich and creamy, yet not overkill with the topping, syrup not too thick, and a nice hint of apple.  My Espresso Martini was strong *good on ya, bartender* but not overpowering, and the perfect crisp cold temperature I need in a sweet alcoholic drink.  The chocolate drizzle swirled into the cocktail making it that much more enticing.  The pistachio gelato was MELT IN YOUR MOUTH delicious.  We almost didn't order it because I felt like we had enough, but the waiter recommended it and I am SO happy he did.  The tiramisu was UN-REAL.  Seriously.  I was in absolute love with every bite I took, but also had to limit myself from becoming so stuffed that my pants burst.  Okay okay, I was wearing leggings.  But you get the point.  Made fresh and you could tell!  Rich sweet mascarpone cheese hitting your lips with the exterior of nicely dipped espresso ladyfingers.  Unbelievably perfect.\n\nThe night was a huge hit all around and these desserts were, quite literally, the cherry on the cake.  No that's not true.  We didn't get any cherries!  How about chocolate drizzle on the latte, or the caramel on the cheesecake, instead.  You get the point  ;)
