I am going to have a plethora of reviews coming because I have been slacking for a month. So, lets get to it!\n\nSo my wife, daughter and I were at Hilldale and decided to try Cafe Porta Alba. First off I want to say the food was decent, I enjoyed my Pizza that was non-filling but was not a happy camper from the time I saw the menu.  I am a simple man with a pizza fetish and seriously all I want to do is order a Sausage and peperoni pizza.   Is that so hard?   Well, I got the Sausage at Cafe Porta Alba and yes...it was good.  So why the bad review?\n\nWELL, from the minute we sat down we felt unwelcome.   The waiter who waited on our table was snobby, unhelpful, and arrogant.   Seriously when I want to order a \"Sausage and Pepperoni\" pizza you do not have to respond with \"Ugh, we don't have Peperoni.\"  Ok, how about you say it without the attitude dude!  So I ask for a Sausage pizza and he responds by pointing at the menu, \"you mean a margherita pizza with sausage added to it.\"  Arrogant asshole.....just get my pizza!  Yes it was good but I am sorry you are an arrogant prick and that was just 1 example of it throughout the dinner.  \n\nBesides the ass who served us the closeness of our dining neighbors was like a piercing in my ears since they were like 1 foot away from us.  I now know that this guy Loves the Sopranos and his date (1st or 2nd date) hates his conversation so much that the needlepoint deer on her sweater even covered their ears.  Can we spread the tables out a bit so we can have our own convo without having to hear others and have them hear us? \n\nHonestly, the food was good but the experience was terrible.  Normally I would finish with some funny line here but I can't because \"ugh, I don't have one\"
