Was waiting for this place to finally opened and Now I understand the hold up. They really put a lot of thought into the design of the place.  Beautiful color scheme and colored light accents. Also the booth fabric is so pretty. So the place really had an amazing decor. \n\nThe food lived up to the decor, the bento box was huge and very good. I also got the dumplings which was soft and sweet. And a double crunch roll?? Which was warm and cheesy it was very good. \n\nFoodie scale: 3.5\nValue: 4 for the nice scenery \n\nI'll be back !!!
