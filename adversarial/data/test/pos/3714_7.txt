[Snoop Dogg]\nGreetings loved ones\nLet's take a journey\n\n[Katy Perry ]\nI know a place\nWhere the veal is really leaner\nWarm, wet and wild\nThere must be somethin' in the sauce\nSippin' pepsi or juice\nFood's layin' underneath the heating lamps (Undone)\nThe boys\nBreak their necks\nTry'na creep a little sneak peek (At us)\n\nYou could travel the world\nBut nothing comes close\nTo the Golden Coast\nOnce you party with us\nYou'll be falling in love\nOooooh oh oooooh\n\nCalifornia Sandwiches\nThey're a little forgettable\nVeal or Chicken\nOnions on top\nSun-roasted peppers\nSo hot\nThey'll melt your Popsicle\nOooooh oh oooooh \n\n-----\n\nSolid, messy, saucy sandwiches.. A little pricey for a Sausage Sandwich and pop for $11 no?\n\nGood, but I'd rather pick up something from woodbridge\/little italy or the Bistro Basillico in Scaborough.
