Run! Don't walk away from House 2 Home. \n\nOn Thursday, June 5, 2014, I went to the Henderson \"House 2 Home\" store to shop for flooring. When I went in, there was a man standing at a desk who didn't look up or say anything. I looked around, asked a few questions, and dragged out some answers from him and said I will be back tomorrow. \n\nThe next day, Friday, I went in with my fiancé and the same man was at the desk - again no greeting or help of any kind whatsoever. My fiancé and I looked around and found some flooring. We had to pull answers out of him so I asked for the manager since I didn't see anyone else around. He said he was the manager. Kevin Moradi was his name. I asked for flooring samples and his response was, \"We don't have any.\" \n\nHe said would have to come out to our new home and measure the rooms before we could get any prices and that there was a charge of $35.00 for the measurements, which would be credited back if we bought. I gave him my credit card for the $35.00 charge. I tried to set up an appointment time but he said the only time he could do it would be early the next morning, Saturday. I reluctantly gave him my house key since I was not going to be there at that time. Then, before we left the store, he asked for my Social Security number and other information he needed if I wanted one year free financing. Tired and frustrated, I reluctantly gave him all the info. \n\nSaturday afternoon, he called my fiancé and said he would call back in one hour with the quote for the flooring we wanted. Three hours later, he called back and told my fiancé to come in and pay for the order without even telling her how much it was going to cost and then he abruptly hung up. \n\nWe went into the store on Sunday.  No one was at the desk or anywhere within sight. We waited 10 minutes before I started looking for the office. The door to the office was open and I went in a few steps and saw no one, but I did see a computer, printers and copy machines. I went back to the front desk and noticed my report on the desk marked 'PAID' in large red letters. As soon as I picked it up from the desk, a new salesperson (I use that term quite loosely!) showed up - 15 minutes after we had arrived. I told him who I was and that this report was mine and showed him the large stamp marked 'PAID'. \n\nThere were no prices at all on the report. I asked what the prices were since it was not on my paid receipt. He said it was in the computer and he looked it up. He started to tell me but I said I would like to actually see it in order to make a decision on exactly what I wanted. He said he didn't have a printer but I saw at least three in their office. I said I was taking my report that I paid for and was putting it in my folder when he grabbed it out of my hand and said I could not have it. I asked him to make me a copy since I paid for it. He said he did not have a copy machine but I saw three copy machines in the office. \n\nHe said I couldn't have even the one paid copy that I paid for and grabbed it out of my hand, I grabbed it back and he pushed me so hard that it almost knocked me down but knocked my glasses off my head and my phone fell to the floor. My fiancé was freaking out, so we left and told him not only was I not going to do business with them, but that I was also calling my credit card company to cancel the $35.00 charge since I never got my report. I tried for three days to reach the company's president but to no avail. They never called back.\n\nThe next day I went to Fabulous Floors.  I was greeted at the door with a smile, taken care of promptly and got everything I needed, including FREE measurements.  John Archer, the Account Manager, was a gentleman and was very helpful and accommodating.  I got one year free financing and he didn't even need to see my SSN.  It was a pleasure doing business with Fabulous Floors.  What a difference!\nHarvey Sackett
