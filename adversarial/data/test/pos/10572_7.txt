As far as train stations go, Union Station is very typical - big black arrival\/departures board, clocks, hamburgers, a candy store, etc. \n\nHowever, the Go Train area is much uglier than the Via area.  If you have to head to the suburbs, you'll hop on the GO. It's in the basement, it's messy, there are no beautiful clocks, high ceilings or glass windows... it smells like cinnamon buns and McDonalds. There's a Dairy Queen right by the departure announcement board, so lots of grown men are always eating plain vanilla ice cream cones all year long - it's kind of bizarre. \n\nSome of my favourite parts of Union:\n\n1) Bagels - great bagel place by the ticket booth that sells every type of bagel you can imagine (my fav is pumpernickle toasted with peanut butter) and coffee for about $2. \n\n2) Coffee - There is a Second Cup kiosk AND a store, which is handy during rush hours - the kiosk usually has a shorter line. There is also a Starbucks hidden in the path beside the TTC, and one through the Via Station - at the exit facing Bremner Street. \n\n3) The convenience store beside McDonalds has lots of snacks to help you make it to dinner - fresh fruit, little handfuls of nuts wrapped up in saran wrap; granola bars; etc. \n\n4) LCBO - by stairs to Via trains. It's very  handy. \n\n5) Automated ticket booths -  these are much faster (usually) - they could use a few more of them though. \n\nAnd a few dislikes... \n\n1) Weird sales - there are always these little vendors set up selling random books, scarves, sheets, etc. It's always for the crappiest junk nobody wants - don't get excited, you're better to browse the magazine store instead.  \n\n2) Protests - whenever anyone in Toronto wants to make a statement, they choose to parade through Union Station during rush hour . \n\n3) Bathrooms - don't use them ever. They're probably the worst bathrooms in Toronto - always filthy; and the sinks are impossible to use... they lways soak your outfit, shooting water out for 10 seconds before shutting off... i've noticed alot of people don't want to use them, which means nobody at Union Station washes their hands after they go the washroom. \n\n4) Rush hour and winter - if there is a snow storm, good luck getting anywhere on time....
