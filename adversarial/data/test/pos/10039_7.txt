When you need an all-you-can-eat fix (AYCE F), this place will do it.  Easier than going to a hotel, it's a standalone building with fairly easy parking.  It's cheap, ahem, well-priced.  With Lunch $8.29 & Dinner $12.49 (drinks extra), a little goes a long way.\n\nInfluenced by Japanese and Chinese cooking, it has all the goodies you can expect.  A plethora of a selection that includes Sushi, Mussels, Fried Dumplings, BBQ Spareribs, noodles, and salad bar for lunch.  Add to that for dinner: Snow Crab, New Zealand Green Mussels, cocktail shrimp, and a small Mongolian section - yum.\n\nTake it from me whose dined here 5-6 times over the years, it's A-Okay in my book.\n\nPS.  They even have pizza!
