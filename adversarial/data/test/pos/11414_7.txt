i don't even want to give this craphole one star.  They sell sick puppies, and not just ours.  This is all a scam, they are in bed with the warranty company and the vet vca black mountain.  We love our puppy however it is very sick and no one, and i mean no one wants to step up to the plate to resolve this issue.  So much for the customer is always right, only here is the customer always wrong.  i am disgusted at the manager at this petland, all Mr Nice guy to your face and as any business manager would be after spending $4000.oo in one night in his store for not just the puppy but a conure also.  Our puppy has eye problems that are very serious and it just feels like no one cares, well, except Dr. bennett and Dr. fuentes.  Do not even walk into this store to \"play with puppies\", your heart strings will get pulled and the regrets many, except for the very fact that we love our little girl and always will, unlike the petland manager, pawsolutions (their sucky warranty company and the head of vca black mountain).  i won't stupe so low to say names, they know who they are, but shame on all of you for how you conduct your business.  this petland was closed down for issues in the past, i am hoping it gets shut down again.  \n\nIncidentally, when we had our puppy in for her eye issues, a young man had a bull dog that was 9 mos old also bought from petland, same one, and was more than likely going to lose his puppy.  He was having seizures and was in and out of consciousness.  I know we are not the only ones who have had to have such misfortunes and i say mis fortune very emphatically.  You will pay way too much for a dog that will only cost thousands more when all is said and done.  \n\nIn the end,Ii know we will be providing paperwork from a licensed veterinary opthamalogists very soon that will prove that what she has is obviously congenital, they will have to return our money, but nothing can ever return the stress, aggravation and such personal indifference we have received from those individuals i chose not to name.  \n\nkarma, karma, karma!!!!!!!!!  life will give you yours when it's time.\n\n keep treating people and dogs by looking the other way, when it means you may have to step up to the plate and you find a way out of it, it will make your wallet fat, but will be sure to curse you in the end.
