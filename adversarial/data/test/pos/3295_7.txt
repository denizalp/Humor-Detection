I had an expiring LivingSocial coupon so we stopped by and purchased 4 desserts - a pistachio macaroon plus slices of dream cake, katrin cake and chocolate mousse roll.  These were consumed over the following 3 days, but, with the exception of the delicious macaroon, each was exceptionally dry and not particularly good.
