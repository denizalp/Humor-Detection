Well, tied and last try with this establishment. I understand \"Bar Rescue\" did a show here. Sad thing is the service is worse than before. \n\nOrdered a Balvenie 12 year old with a splash of water. Waitress brought out a drink with water and ice. When I mentioned it wasn't what I ordered, she looked at me in disbelief. She really though Scotch comes on the rocks by default.\n\nReally doesn't matter. I'm not coming back. damn shame.
