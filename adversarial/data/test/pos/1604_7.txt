We met up with Regina, Debbie, and Earl for a \"Beauty Bash\" at this location. Located right across Bon Breads at Town Square.\n\nStarting out with the Aveda Stress-Fix Products we received a hand bath using the soaking salts, then we got a hand massage using the body lotion and also got to inhale the concentrate which really opened up your breathing. We also got to keep cool and refreshed with a nice Peppermint-Licorice Tea that was very good.\n\nWe were also evaluated on our skin with any questions and or concerns, and also learned(According to the Aveda beauticians) That breakouts on your face are categorized in three sections: The forehead area above your eyebrows are STRESS related...the area below the eyebrows  to right below your nose is DIGESTION related, and everything below your cheekbones to your chin is HORMONAL related......interesting! After filling out your evaluation, your were given a facial using a combination of Aveda products that would improve your skin condition and bring out that glow...\n\nThe guys were done and the ladies received a little make-up session, and that concluded our session. After purchasing products , we had worked up a hunger and were off for a quick snack. If you're ever in the area, drop by and see the ladies at The Aveda Experience Center. You'll be glad you did!   ALOHA!!!
