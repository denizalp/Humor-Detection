Tutti Frutti is the largest Self Served Frozen Yogurt Brand in the world! \n\nWelcome to Ontario! This Richmond Hill location is the first location that opens in Ontario!\n\nSimilar to Menchie's and Yogurty's where everything is self served and you pay by the weight. But why I am showing it all the love? \n\nTARO flavoured fro yo! I have yet to find that in any of the fro yo places I ever been to! And it is just so devilish good! \n\nHere at Tutti Frutti seems like most of the flavours are more fruit based: Watermelon, Coconut, Banana, Cantaloupe.. Maybe because of the 30+ temperature we are having now, light and fruity flavours are more refreshing!\n\nSoy based yogurt for special diet need or just what to feel specially healthy, perfectly Vegan friendly! \n\nTARO! Hopefully it will be available when I come back for my fro yo fix!
