Man, I miss living in NoDa. Count this place as one of the 59384759 reasons why.\n\nI use to live a few blocks away on Yadkin, so Smelly Cat became one of my second homes. You may have seen me riding around there as a passenger in Gman's golf cart. We are former roomies. Hi Greg.\n\nCoffee, hot chocolate, tea... hot, cold. Whatevs. It's all fantastic. I was excited to have a meeting with Nathan B. over there today and reunite with my coffee shop. We were successfully productive despite a whole lot of eye candy visiting Smelly Cat this morning. Meow. See what I did there.\n\nIn a hurry? Grab a cup to go. Looking for a place to post up and get some work done? Make yourself at home and fire up the laptop. Make sure to snag a baked good, too. \n\nThe workers at Smelly Cat are super friendly. They pretty much know everyone (if not actually everyone) in the 'hood. Plenty of parking in the SC lot and also on the street. Easily accessible. \n\nIf you're in or nearby NoDa, be sure to stop by and get your caffeine fix here.
