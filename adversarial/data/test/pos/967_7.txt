Get a slice.. or the whole pizza. Not pricey at all (for Vegas). Definitely overhyped but it does satisfy with its oily and greasy goodness. Especially good at 4am after you drag your drunken and danced-out bum out of Marquee and are in dire need of some savory carbs. A custom-made, pizza takes about twenty minutes to make. I give this place props for staying open til 5am because they have to deal with some intolerable drunks. Kudos to you guys.
