I'm so happy to see Grouchy John's on my side of town! I've been to the Henderson location a handful of times but it's clear across town and I can't really do coffee after about 11AM. Luckily, GJ finally moved into this great, under-utilized location that is right on my way to work. It's going to be hard not to treat myself to a morning cup of happiness when it's so convenient and the staff are so friendly. Bonus points for having a drive-thru so I can't get side tracked walking in and passing the pastry case!\n\nThe menu is easy to understand, with drinks divided by temperature and with clear descriptions of what they include. I personally favor the Chupacabra latte (dark chocolate and chili) for a kick in the pants, but they also have a decent variety of non-caffeinated options (Shirley Temple of Doom, various smoothies) and several teas. I have not yet tried their breakfast offerings but they're on my list when I finally get around to a dine-in visit. \n\nTIP: Grab a stamp card even if you don't think you'll be by often; they have several double-stamp promos (ie check in on social media) so your card fills up fast!
