How the hell do most places in Vegas get away with ending breakfast at 10:30 in the AM? Do they know they're in Vegas?!?! Blasphemy.\n\nbut....since most places end breakfast early....my friends and I ended up at Peppermill's....and I loved it. Breakfast all day and the joint is totally kitsch'd. I was in love.\n\nThe food is much better than a Denny's. I had an omelette with spinach, tomato, and feta cheese, which was too big, but delish. Jam tasted homemade and I got fresh fruit on the side instead of hash browns. Loved it.\n\nNext time I'm in Vegas, I'll hit this place up on the late night to see the show.....
