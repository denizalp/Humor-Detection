I Just love this place. Those who live close to this place know how I feel. This place is on par with my other favorite all you can sushi spots. You really can't beat $25. I usually eat close to $160 worth of sushi every time I go. Besides being good, they are also fast. \n\nI am also big on spots that are not crowded. I have been here like 10 times and never have I waited to be seated. \n\nFavorites -\nSalmon nigiri\nLobster Crunch roll\nLasagna roll
