My wife and I came here on a Friday evening. It was packed with a 25 minute wait. I saw several empty tables and booths. After 20 minutes we were seated and a big bowl of chips was dropped off at our table with 3 small containers of various salsa. After reviewing the menu, we decided to split a combo. My half was the burrito with ground beef. This came with black beans, and rice on a bed of lettuce. The burrito was made from an 8 inch flour tortilla filled with refried beans, ground beef, and cheese, covered in white sauce. The burrito was good, but not great. The sauce made it a little more special than Taco Bell, but other than that it tasted similar. I my return again, but not on a Friday night. I do want to try other items like the fajita or enchilada.
