City Center is definitely a must see for your out of town guests. Architecture is amazing!  If you have the kids with you you can start out at the Bellagio Conservatory, take the tram to City Center and walk around enjoying the great \"mall\" and do some window shopping. Kids love \"train\" rides!  \n\nIf you're rich then you're in luck, there's lots of high-end gorgeous shops to buy your latest designer handbags and bling to match.  \n\nKids will enjoy the artsy cyclone installation while you sit and rest your feet. Then go upstairs to Wolfgang Pucks and share a pizza. If you're sans kids please enjoy some cocktails at the various restaurants that you'll find-you can literally hotel hop too.   Lots of great upscale restaurants and bars to try out too.  I have my list and I'm starting with Beso!  Cheers!
