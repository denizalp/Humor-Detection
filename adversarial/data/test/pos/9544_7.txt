Took my son to get a haircut with the barber who goes by \"Rabbit.\" I took a photo, which showed the type of hairstyle I wanted my son to get. He said he could do it,  but seemed like he had no idea as to what he was doing. $17 later for a 10 year olds hair cut, we finally had to give up and accept the terrible job that he did. The following day my son didn't even want to go to school and we had to find another barber to try and salvage a decent haircut. Will not return or recommend.
