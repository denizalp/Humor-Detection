There should really be a Zero star option. Bizarre place. I really wanted to try this place out and like it. Little did I know this was going to be like a flea market. Granted it's valentines day, I wanted my food to go. Got there at 7:07pm, was told about 20 min wait. Ok fine - no problem, I understand it's a busy night. Fast forward - 7:55. No food. While I was waiting this is what I observed. Their iPad with reservations went dead. Now people are crawling in with and without reservations and have to wait the SAME time. It looked like an ant farm there. The hostess was hollering for names as if she was at the auction. Who needs loud speaker?! Her receipts where all over the place. She then decided to ask everyone for their name all over again. Wow that should be fun for the guests! At 815 I was no longer hungry, but irritated. When I came up to ask about the status of my order she asks: \"What did you have again?\" - and proceeds to take down my order all over again claiming that's just for her to put it together. Say what?!?! Another 10 min later I asked for a refund. And guess what?! My order magically arrived. I refused it politely. I mean how long has it been sitting there?! No thanks. (Scratching this spot off my list)
