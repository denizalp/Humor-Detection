This bowling ally has no wheelchair accessibility, no ramp, nothing. It's disrespectful to know I can't bring my grandmother to bowl with me because of her disability. It's ridiculous that it's not regulated to have accessibility, because in 2014, a lot of people bowl, who aren't fully able to stand, which is why they have handicap equipment to help them.\nWorst employment and building ever.\nVery rude desk management as well.
