You're sure not going to find a better patty anywhere near Montreal. Got that nice yellow-orange flaky action, well-seasoned (if maybe underspiced; I'm always looking for a little more heat than I can get up here). Really lovely people running the shop. This place is more like a 4 to me, but I'm spoiled from having grown up in the north Bronx, so 5 it is.
