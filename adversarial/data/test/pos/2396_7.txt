This hotel was convenient for us since it is short walk to the convention center. The lobby is large and nicely decorated. There is a Starbucks and and a large bar area. The staff was friendly and helpful in the few interactions I had with them.\n\nThe room was average sized. It was nicely appointed. The bed was comfortable. They had updated to the internet tv's so I could log into Netflix which is nice. The bathroom was nice too.\n\nOverall this is a nice hotel. It is in a good location and it has what you need for an easy stay.
