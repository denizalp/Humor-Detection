My experience with Asian-style western food has been mixed, from: the bad (attempt at Italian food), the okay (Malaysian snack burgers), to delicious (bakery). For purely anthropological purposes of exploration and understanding, I had to try the Taiwanese take on southern fried chicken.\n\nInside is nice, open, and colourful. Another reviewer mentioned that aspects of it are kitschy with non-nonsensical sayings on the wall. It kind've adds to the experience however.\n\nI was doing takeout, and the overhead menu only shows a few items - though there were clearly other more Taiwanese dishes on the tables. The combos are around $10-11, which puts it a couple bucks more than their spiritual father - the Colonel. However, it comes with a choice of around a dozen bubble teas. Moreover, the quality of the chicken - as I was about to find out, was superior.\n\nAs others have said, they're made to order; so expect to wait at least 15 minutes. However, I asked and a sever confirmed that one can call ahead. Duly noted for the future. Nice service too, I should add.\n\nThe order arrived and by the heat of the bag, it was apparent that this had been in the fryer only 30 Mississippi's earlier. They said they don't have a spicy variety, but they do provide two containers upon request. One is a salt\/pepper mix, and the other is a chilli power. I threw some in the bag, and *shake shake shake*, I have spicy chicken.\n\nI ordered the chicken 'steak', which is a nice sized breast (get your mind out of the gutter) diced into a few pieces. The colour of the battered skin is noticeably different from typical fried chicken. It's almost a greyish-white and you can see the seasoning. It's different, but it's not off-putting either. Chicken was cooked to a perfect level and still juicy. The oil was at the right temperature since the grease wasn't sponged in. There was a unique taste and seasoning that emerged. It's killing me that I can't identify it, but I'm sure you'll taste it if you try it. Fries were fairly average.\n\nTasty chicken, and will certainly come back (and call ahead) when in the area.
