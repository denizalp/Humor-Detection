Had a pretty major wiring issue with my car and was getting fed up with no one being able to fix it. Decided to try fiix as my car wasn't running and thought having someone come to my house would be convenient. They assured me over the chat they have on their site, that they had a VW specialist Peter, who they were pretty confident would be able to fix my car within 3 hours. I repeatedly told them it was a complicated issue but they assured me they could fix the problem. Well Peter came, left an hour later giving me a \"diagnosis\" that only stated that I had a wiring problem (obviously?) that was too complicated for him. He then told me to bring it to a mechanic or a VW dealership as he could not do anything for me. Charged me 355$ which I had to get rectified cause I was over charged. In the end they still charged me 200$. Extremely unprofessional and not knowledgable in anything more than changing your oil or tires.\n\nDefinitely not fun to be taken advantage of.
