In the heart of Caesar's Palace... Yes yes the REAL Caesar's Palace... in Las Vegas at least.\n\nAte here a few years ago, and I don't understand why I don't come back here more often! The fact I still remember what I had from there, shows how good it is. Two distinct things I remember is their appetizer flat Italian pizza. So so good! And I also got their REAL Kobe beef sliced... forgot what it was called, but it literally melted in my mouth. Both of these are not in their current Winter menu, so it must be their Summer menu since I went in May? Anyways both dishes highly recommended! If it still exists...
