A few friends of mine love the sandwiches from here. With \"sandwich\" as part of the business name they ought to have great sandwiches, right?\n\nThe meat to bread ratio is disproportionate. You're paying about $5 a sandwich and meat is pricey - you get what you pay for.\n\nWhat really bothers me is how cramped and dirty this place is. They open at 9am and I'd get here just a few minutes after they open and it's already messy? And nobody seems to care.\n\nSure, it's only across the street from UNLV but I'd rather drive a block away for better Vietnamese food.
