I was at Austin's many years ago--in excess of 10--so it's been awhile.  The rating is between a three and a four but I've rounded it to three.\n\nMy server was Shawn and he was excellent.  He gave me the menu and then explained three of the night's specials.  After pondering for some time, I ordered lobster chowder, the 22 ounce ribeye steak special, and a twice baked potato.  \n\nThe chowder is a cream based soup with corn, potatoes, bacon, and some lobster meat placed in the center of the bowl.  Great cream soup with a lack of lobster you'd normally get with lobster bisque.  The steak was ordered black and blue and while it was fairly rare inside, it could have been a little less done. The twice baked potato--almost a throwback on menus today--was very good.  A huge baker that had been mashed, seasoned, and put back into the shell of the potato--some now cut away--and loaded with cheese.\n\nDessert was a let down.  First, there were only 5 things from which to choose and second the carrot cake I got was a bit dry.\n\nI do like the room a lot.  There are no TVs, their bar is in the casino so the drinkers and noise makers are out there.  There is no door separating the room from the casino, but no sound from the casino could be heard.  I really liked having dinner without seeing a bar with multiple TVs--basically a sports bar-- and seeing people around the bar having happy hour small plates.  The room is nicely appointed.\n\nShawn was an excellent server.  He had good answers for my questions and he steered me correctly in deciding on some things to order.  A little work on the grilling and desserts and this would definitely be a four star steak house.\n\nThey also have free wifi!
