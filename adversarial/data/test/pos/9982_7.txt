It's official... that is the worst pizza in town.  I believe if you sold pizza like this in some cities like NY or Chicago you would be shot in a firing line or arrested.  When you even look at their pizza you know something is wrong... it even looks bad!  \n\nSorry guys... you have very friendly service but you DON'T know pizza.\n\ngo back to something you do well... get high.
