So happy this little gem is within walking distance from my apartment. I am a sufferer of Pokemon Go addiction and there's a Poke Stop right outside this place! Awesome! Honestly, I wouldn't have discovered this place if it wasn't for Pokemon Go...I have lived at Chuparosas Apartments for 2 years and have only recently discovered this place. Glad I did. They currently have two flavors sorbet that I love: pineapple and a pomegranate one. The toppings bar is good...wish they had more fresh fruit like raspberries. I do like the toasted coconut and the chopped almonds. \n\nI definitely recommend stopping in here...their regular yogurt flavors sound good and they boast their establishment as the healthiest frozen yogurt in the country.
