Yes I have seen your email but you are not fixing or helping anything because your attitude on the emails is lacking any true interest. \n\nYou think you know what you're doing but you have no idea.  \n\nPerhaps you have never had any professional dining experience. \n\nI'd be happy to train your staff for free because Donald is so amazing but you need to be fired or smart enough to hire someone to train the staff.  \n\nThere isn't one person who works there who displays any dining or serving experience.\n\n1. Dim the lights to what is suitable for the time of day.\n\n2. Train the waiters on how to approach a table, for instance, Stand straight up at the table. Say, \"Hi I'm Ann and I'm going to be taking care of you tonight .  Is this your first time here? We are a community based concept in that we use all local food and drink producers. blah blah whatever your spiel is.\n\n3. May I get you started with some drinks. These are our special ones blah blah blah\n\n4. GO GET THE DRINKS!\n\n5. USE A TRAY TO CARRY EVERY SINGLE DRINK AND THINGS you need to bring to the table, like chopsticks, cream, teapot, soy sauce, etc.\n\n6. When you return with the drinks, tell the guests about the menu. Give them a few more minutes to decide.\n\n7. Take a spin through your section with your tray and take a look at every table and see if they need anything.\n\n8. Go back to the new table and take the order and write it down. Don't memorize it unless you are very experienced.\n\n9. Put the apps in if applicable.\n\n10. Take a spin through your section and see if people need anything.\n\n11. If you see what appears to be finished dishes, say \"May I take this? or May I take your plate?\nDon't make a big insecure fuss (Like the busboy does)\n\n12. Bring whatever the freak any table that doesn't have their food yet needs, like chopsticks, soy sauce, sugar, ketchup, napkins, knives, whatever is necessary so that when you put food down, the customer can eat or drink it without waiting for the incompetent waiter to bring it.\n\n13. DON'T MAKE PEOPLE WAIT TO EAT ONCE YOU'VE BROUGHT THEIR FOOD. Have everything they need already on the table.\n\n14. Bring people apps THEN entrees.\n\n15. Refill drinks if necessary.\n\n16. Offer desserts.\n\n17. Bring check.\n\n18. Dont' make people wait to pay.\n\n19. Take the check and run the card or bring change.\n\n20. Say freaking thank you to them.\n\nSee Kelly, it's not that hard. \nYou just don't know how to do it.\nRead this to the staff.\n\nNow for the busboys or girls.\n1. Constantly cruise the sections and take away empty or dirty dishes.\n2. Refill waters.\n3. Say to people \"May I take your plate?\"  You don't have to use hand gestures and wave your hand all over the table.  Be discreet, people go out to dinner to enjoy themselves, not involve you.\n4. It's not that hard.\n\nYou should have one big staff meeting and clear this up immediately upon reading this.\n\nHostesses:\n1. Stand at the podium with a smile on your face.\n2. Say hello or good morning\/afternoon\/evening to guests.\n3. Ask how many and seat them with a smile.\n4. Stay off your phone, don't smoke, and keep smiling.\n5. Look people in the eye.\n\nThere you're welcome.\nGood luck now and stop making excuses for yourself.\nIt's downtown Vegas, not NYC.\n\nHere's a video of how a restaurant runs.\nWatch it.\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5MqvhMFV7BU
