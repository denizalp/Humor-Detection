This little gem is surrounded by fast food places galore in one big grocery store-Seafood City!  \n\nIt was a treat to see a Filipino ice cream parlor that's best known for Philippines national treasure \"the halo-halo!\"\n\nI was quickly greeted upon entering by two young and upbeat employees who made my experience that much easier. Place was clean and all!\n\nMagnolia ice cream is known for their out of this world Filipino flavors so if you haven't tried some, you'll have to treat yourself and indulge. They're mostly found in Asian supermarkets. \n\nI ordered the deluxe halo-halo for $7.19 comes with a scoop of ice cream and a free \"keiki\" (junior) size also. I actually put both scoops in the halo-halo. I got the ube (purple yam) and the buko pandan (coconut). It was delicious too. We also ordered a scoop of mais-queso which translates to corn and cheese, sounds weird but it actually works...might be an acquired taste but hey whatever floats your boat. \n\nI'll definitely visit this place the next time I'm out in Las Vegas!
