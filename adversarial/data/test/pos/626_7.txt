You probably already know all the big draws about Real Sports as this entire city revolves around anything that has even the slightest tangential relation to the Leafs. Here are the basics: This bar is filled with literally every TV ever made, shows every sports game that's ever been on, plays all the music you hate far too loud for literally no reason and is overpriced but is modestly priced when compared with any other MLSE food and beverage operation.\n\nSo if that's all you're looking for you can stop reading here. If you want my humorous anecdotes and personal musings...please continue on.\n\nSo Real Sports has been open for like 3ish seasons (I can't give you a reliable number on that because I would never step foot in this place unless it was before going to a Leafs game. Conversely, I've never stepped foot OUT of this place without being completely plastered. So that's nice) and for a long time was my go to spot for beers before Leaf games. I say was because I have since realized that I am a moron and that you may as well go to any of the other Sports MegaBar type places on the corner of York and Front. *BONUS POINTS* to all those other huge bars in the area in that they will usually get you out in time for the game while bringing you food that is actually hot.\n\nWhen Real Sports first opened the rule went that you had to call at 10am, 3 weeks in advance of your game if you wanted to get a table before the game you were attending. This rule is still a safe bet but honestly, you can call like a week in advance and still be good. I'm assuming this is the case because everyone has realized this bar is stupid.\n\nAt this point you're probably thinking:\nA) Why did you give this place 4 stars if you're just completely trashing the joint?\nB) Why do you continue to go if you hate this place so much?\n\nSimple Answer to those questions:\nA) This place is so big, so disorganized and has such a high turnover in staff that there is a very good chance your waitress will bring you another patron's beer before bringing you your correct beer. BOOM! Free drinks!! You can't fight with that fantastic, if not accidental, policy.\nB) The smokin' hot waitresses who just always seem to be in the worlds worst mood. I don't know what has happened to all of these people in all of their lives but I swear to god these are the most upset women I have ever met in my life and I love it! Call me old fashioned (or diseased) but there's nothing I love more than being served by someone that makes me feel like I'm in the later parts of the world's worst relationship.
