Beginning of last post, it was deleted some way. \nTo whom it may concern,\n  My name is Benjamin Stewart and on 5\/1\/15 my wife and I went to the sign and drive auto group in wilkinson blvd to purchase a car from a salesperson named Lessie. The day before my wife and Lessie met at the sign and drive on independence blvd and talked about me purchasing a car to drive for the company uber. We sat and talked with Lessie about which cars we were interested in and our stated purpose for it. We began the process of showing my information giving references and job history. I repeatedly asked to test drive a white Toyota Camry but was told I couldn't test drive any cars until I was approved for a car. So I questioned the entire approval process if I couldn't even see which car I liked while I waited. There was another salesperson adjacent to Lessie who once I left out of the building to talk to Angela the finance agent outside by phone, told my wife that \"maybe he shouldn't mention driving for uber anymore\" speaking of me. When I came back in he stated that his manager may not want to hear me saying I was doing that. When we questioned the down payment of the Toyota Camry we were told 900 down. But after I got of the phone with Angela and she called Lessie I was told 1200 down. So I decided to not get that one. She walked us outside to show us what we were \"approved\" for and none of the cars that she showed us were going to qualify for uber. As we were walking the lot my wife was on the uber website telling Lessie which of the cars we would want. When I inquired about a 2009 Saturn aura I was told I couldn't get that one unless I paid 1200 down even though it was listed at 900 down. So we left and was later called back by Angela and told that we could work something out for the Saturn. So I went back to the lot and began the process with Lessie again. After signing papers and paying the down payment I was assured by the lot mgr that as long as I made my payments I would have no issues with the warranty. I later returned on Monday to the \"service center\" to have a gps put on the car. The car has since then felt like it was going to stall out each time I turned a corner. On Wednesday 5\/6\/15 as I was taking my son to school the car cut off on me. In the middle of the road with cars behind me my car came to a complete stop with my child in the car!!! People had to get out and help me push it to the curb so they could continue to take their child to school and go to work, and I was not allowed that duty due to this car completely cutting off!! I waited until 9:10 and called the lot mgr. He stated that I had to call back when Lessie got in even though I stated I was going to miss a part of my shift as a result. He told me to \"walk to the nearest autozone or advance autoparts and buy fuel injector cleaner because it may be water in your tank\" I asked him \"why would it be water in my tank??\" And he stated that maybe \"you used cheap gas and it put water in your tank\" I don't just use any gas I actually buy my gas from a warehouse club that gives me a money back guarantee on the quality of my gas. He told me that if I wanted that warranty they offered honored I would have to pay for my own tow to my mechanic and have the mechanic called the finance company \"community credit\" on freedom drive. Then the two would have to work out payment of service. So if I have to do all of that why do you have a \"service center??\" I asked if I could call the finance company myself and he said no they can't help me I have to do what he said if I don't want a headache. I stated its already been a headache and now you're saying you won't honor or give consideration to a customer who just spent 1000$ with you guys less than five days ago!!! So after a back and forth with him he gave me the number to the \"finance company.\" I believe the girls name was Rachel or Roquelle but she spoke with an accent. She transferred me to the \"service center\" mgr and I left a voicemail. I them called her back and asked to speak to a finance mgr or my fianc√© agent and she again transferred me back to the voicemail of the service mgr. I finally got a call back and talked to I believe it was Phyllis but I'm not sure and she was quite helpful. I fe she did what she could to find a solution to the issue as much as she could from her respective position. She apologized for the lot mgr saying I had to pay out of pocket and assured me the car would get towed and looked at. I asked for a loaner or something to use and they stated they don't do loaners. So I went through my call history and found the number Angela called me from. I spoke to her about my situation and she stated that I would still be responsible for making my payment whether the car is running or not. I told her about the problem and how I have to have a reliable car for uber.
