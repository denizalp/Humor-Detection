TERRIBLE. I came here for treatment of my Anxiety, Depression, Bi-Polar and PTSD.  I need to get a psychiatrist right away and didn't like the fact that the other providers in the area have a 3-4 months wait for initial visit, so I chose this place. BIG MISTAKE. So I go in this morning at 8:00 am when they open. And I wait. And I wait. After my 2 1\/2 hour wait (with appointment), I got the rudest, nastiest, meanest psychiatrist I've ever met in my life. He must really hate the world, himself and his job or he gets off on treating people terribly. He was very dismissive of all my complaints, refused to allow me to go to their out-patient counseling either one-on-one or group (because he said I don't need it), refused to refill any of my medication (most important is klonopin 2mg which I take 3 times a day and have been doing so for 2 years; you can go into withdrawal seizures without this medication, especially at the highest dose and for as long as I've been taking it. I told him about this and he laughed and giggled and made a huge grin and said \"not my problem.\"), he laughed at the amount of times I've been to the E.R., out-patient and in-patient hospitalization, asked me and re-asked questions which were answered on the paperwork he was staring at, and basically did nothing but write me a prescription for Lamictal which I told him I've taken before for 6+ months and it did nothing. He didn't even tell me his name. I got Dr. Smith from the front desk when I described what he looked like when I checked out. This place is truly horrible. I feel deeply for the people who use their sliding scale program (people without insurance).
