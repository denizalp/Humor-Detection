We went the day after the Grand Opening. I looked at the menu online and was excited to try a couple items. We were given a menu with 5 items. Nothing on the menu I wanted to try. I asked where their full menu was and they said it would be a couple weeks before they had a menu. No French fries??!! Seriously?
