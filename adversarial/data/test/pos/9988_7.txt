Decent little hotel conveniently located on the outskirts of Pittsboygh right off the freeway. Here's the G,B&U\n\nGood:\n\n-Super cheap as we booked a room for ±$70 thru booking.com\n\n-Bed was actually pretty comfortable\n\n-Free WiFi that worked well\n\n-Fridge w\/freezer, microwave and coffee pot\n\n-USB charging ports on the lamps\n\n-Continental breakfast\n\n-Check-in lady was friendly―albeit a bit bizarre...\n\n-AC worked almost too good\n\n-Shower was nice and hot w\/ good water pressure\n\nThe Bad:\n\n-Located next to train tracks so be prepared to be woken up at least twice at night by freight trains passing thru. \n\n-Rooms are tiny\n\n-A lot of the room was in disrepair, such as the shower curtain rod was barely hanging on by a thread\n\n-Paper-thin walls and doors\n\nThe Ugly\n\n-The whole hotel had a funky odor and smelled of cigarettes\n\nOverall decent place for a great price. Would def recommend if someone is looking for somewhere comfortable and doesn't need a whole lot of frills.
