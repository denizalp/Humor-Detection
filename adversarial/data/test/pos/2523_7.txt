CPK is my favorite place for the past 25 years!\nThe menu is missing a lot of items!  No Tiramasou! \nAs for the wait..... There were clean tables available and they still made us wait....not very happy with our experience here...\nI know they did it so they won't  overwhelm the servers and kitchen....but you need to schedule service personnel according to your seating capacity  \nWe eat twice a week at CPK but will not come back to this one!\nI gave them 2 stars for the decor, not your typical CPK 90's decor.
