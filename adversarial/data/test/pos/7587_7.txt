This is a very focused restaurant with a very specific menu. There are many variations of filling and toppings but there are basically two main items: rice noodle rolls and congee. Both are done very well. \n\nThe congee is smooth and comes out piping hot. It takes approximately 10-15 mins for them to make it and bring it out to you. The rice noodle rolls are delicious, light and made to order. I've tried various fillings and would say that the one with the fried dough is probably my least favourite rice noodle role here. I wish it was better because it's typically my favourite filling. Beef, shrimp, pork variations are all good. I don't recommend adding the egg to the rice noodle as it takes away from the texture. Just as-is is perfect. \n\nService is typical of a low\/well priced Chinese restaurant. The wait times can be a bit long but worth it.
