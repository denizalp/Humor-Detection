HaHaHa....Hell YES!!!!!!\nI knew it couldn't be just me....EVERY last review of this piece of shit store has 1 star.\nSo, I walked in here about two weeks ago on a early morning weekend day...no one else was in the store and I said \"GOOD MORNING\" to the Middle Eastern old man who was at the register.... and not 1 word came out of his scraggly ass mouth. UGHH!!!! Reallyyyyy.\nSo glad I didn't spend a single penny in his store. So rude.\nAfter that I just walked out.... without looking around or anything.\n\nNEVER will I get gas here....or snacks...or drinks etc.\n\n***SAD***....for the Mexican Food spot inside towards the back...because you have to walk thru this store to get to them...and I sure nuff do not want to see his face ever again.
