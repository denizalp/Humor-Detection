Came here on NYE for a quick bite before heading to a house party. We were reservation-less so we couldn't have Mill Street's NYE menu, but ordering from the menu was just fine.\n\nThe ambiance is great. Found in the heart of the Distillery District, Mill Street brews their own beer ready to be served in the dining area. I found the service to be excellent. Our server was an Irish lad who was very efficient and extremely professional. He knew both the food and beer menu well.  All servers should be like this guy.\n\nTo start, we ordered the red pepper dip .... it was a-ok. Nothing out of this world, but I still enjoyed eating it. For my meal, I ordered the chicken pot pie accompanied by the Mill Street Lemon Tea Beer. Both of which I thoroughly enjoyed!!\n\nI want to try the pretzels ... I'll have to come back.
