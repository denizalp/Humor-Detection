A great trip for a Sunday during the Fall.\n\nThe warm apple cider is perfectly seasoned. The sliced up apple samples are a perfect way to decide that honeycrisp apples are so perfect they must be from the Tree of Knowledge. The apple fritters, if fresh, taste like a cross between mana and Johnny Appleseed's spit (this is a good thing).\n\nMassive pumpkins abound for sale, and the pick your own apples are always a fun experience.\n\nThe only downsides, and one that my date and I encountered today, was that they were sold out of the fritters, call ahead and make sure. Also they prices are a little high, but eh... the price you pay for the atmosphere and fun.
