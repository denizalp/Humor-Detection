This will be sweet, short, and to the point. \n\n1. Charged me for 5 sodas when I had 4 in the cart;\n2. Charged me for 2 Secret's when I had 1 in the cart;\n3. I caught 1 of the overages in the store and waited in line for 30 minutes at their \"Customer Service\" desk ...which was extremely slow;\n4. Just as with every Walmart, this one was a wreck!\n\nI hate Walmart. I will NOT stop and show my receipt upon exiting this hell hole. I will run over these retired people with my cart or walk right through them. Walmart CAN NOT do this...yet you fools who shop here gladly comply with their illegal request. \n\nThanks cashier for overcharging me. I only came here because Target was closed on Easter and I had to buy sundries & a carpet cleaner TODAY!  Now I have to go back & get the rest of my money...it's almost not worth it to have to stand in the line from hell to get it. \n\nUgh!
