Always a good sale going on here.  It's an outlet so there's a sale of some type all year long.  Sure the prices are marked up before you start calculating the discounts but it's fun to do and in the end you get a good deal.  For instance, on this last visit, it was 55-70% off, plus an additional 20% off.  I don't know what the additional 20% off was for but I'll take it.  And then when all that is figured, I had an email coupon (they can scan it right from your phone) I could have used for another 15% off, but bonus, they have a military discount!  Took that option which came out better.\n\nThis particular store stays neat and orderly - not an easy thing with the amount of product out on display.  \n\nGood quality shirts - everything from casual to dress - nice selection of ties and dress pants\n\nOh, they got stuff on the ladies side too
