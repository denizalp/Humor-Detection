I have been waiting for a Mexican market to open up in Spring Valley. It took forever to come, but as long as it came, I am happy with that. \n\nI have to admit that it felt pretty unique to me when I surveyed and explored the store. They have a bakery section with a variety of breads and pastries that I recommend taking a visit before exploring the rest of the store. Next to the bakery, they have a little cafe area where you can order Mexican fast food staples like tortas, tacos, burritos, combination plates, etc. It might be somewhat more normal in a Mexican supermarket for them to have those things, but all of these American supermarkets don't get too creative at all.\n\nThe one thing I love about La Bonita, are their prices. The prices of their food is really cheap compared to American supermarkets. They have super sales on Wednesdays and Thursdays, so look out for those! In general, the advertised items on their weekly ads are a lot cheaper than most of the sales at American supermarkets.\n\nDon't be freaked out that it's a store with a lot of Hispanic people in it. We live in a new day and age where we're all use to seeing different types of people in different places. Nobody really minds if you don't look like everyone else. Everyone there has a similar purpose of going there and that is to shop and buy some cheap groceries!
