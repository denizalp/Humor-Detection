I think we might have been a couple of jerks the day we wrote our first Yogurtland review. There's no doubt that there is big time market saturation with yogurt places in AZ, however we still need to give credit where credit is due. Since we first dissed Yogurtland (and all other yogurt places) a few months ago, we have been back there pretty much every other weekend or so, proving that not only are we jerks, but we are also hypocrites. To redeem ourselves, we're going to bump up Yogurtland from an okay three star rating, to a more appropriate rating of four stars. \n\nThe flavors are always tasty (good old tart is our personal favorite) with new variations every few weeks, the price is right (coming in at 30 cents per ounce) and the service is always good. This location always seems to be packed with yogurt lovers of all shapes and sizes, but the line moves quickly and it's fun to eavesdrop on peoples wacky conversations while you wait. It's so ironic that this place attracts yuppy Scottsdaliens, yet is so cheap...kind of messes with your head when you get the bill and it's something like $2.56. It's so ironic that some of the people getting Yogurt here probably just came from Barney's across the street...so yeah...what a dichotomy. \n\n...long story short...this place currently is winning the Arizona yogurt wars in our humble opinion. It just never gets old bathing in the superficiality of young Scottsdale hipsters while eating some tart yogurt...it's becoming a favorite past time of ours!
