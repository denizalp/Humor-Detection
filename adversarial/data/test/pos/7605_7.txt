I came here right after they opened. So new they weren't on Yelp yet. This is a nice restaurant with good food. They have traditional Chinese cuisine. There are seafood, pork, beef and chicken dishes typical of most takeout venues. There are combo specials which include an egg roll, fried rice, a crab puff and egg drop soup. They offer a few popular lunch specials at a smaller price.\n\nMy wife and I came here for dinner on a Sunday. As we were going in two ladies were going out with to go boxes. They gave us the thumbs up and said it was very good food.We were seated immediately. The waitress took our order. the food was up in just a few minutes. We ordered a large plate of garlic shrimp which we shared. this came with a good sized bowl of white rice. I found the garlic shrimp very good, my wife thought it was a little spicy. I asked if they delivered. They do not. They do have take out though. Just an FYI, they only take plastic or cash. No checks. \nI will be back to sample more of the menu.
