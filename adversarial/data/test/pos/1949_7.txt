Wow where to start...\nIf you decide to give this place a try based on their \"good\" ratings and reviews you're better off looking elsewhere.\nMe and my girlfriend were looking for ordinary tacos and when we noticed the awesome ratings and good reviews this place had achieved, we thought it would be at least decent.\nWhen we got there and ordered our drinks, I ordered the horchata because according to people on Yelp, they had the best one could taste.\nAs soon as I got mine, I noticed it had some kind of canned fruit on top, if had some sort of strawberry syrup and to top it off, it had a brownish color instead of the usual white.\nWhen I tried it, it was so sweet that one sip is all I could take before I decided to tell the waiter to take it back because I was not going to pay for that.\nMy girlfriend's Jamaica also had a purple color to it and she told me it tasted like grape Kool-aid.\nWhen we were attempting to order food, all I wanted from the start was a few simple tacos...\nTheir tacos were $2.97 each!!!  That is absolute madness!!!\nFor the size of the tortilla and the quality of the taco, the MOST those could have been worth anywhere else was $1.25.\nWhen everything was going bad and our night had been ruined, me and my girlfriend started looking around and we noticed that only white people were eating there.\nThen everything made sense; white people don't know REAL mexican food, so they assume this crap quality was the \"best they had ever tasted\" and thus very good review on yelp came from white people.\nIf you know what real mexican food tastes like and are looking for just simple tacos, DO NOT GO TO THIS UTTERLY AMERICANIZED MEXICAN JOINT!!!!\nYou will be sorely disappointed.\nANY cheap taco stand in Mexico can beat the taste of these so called \"street tacos\" AND FOR A THIRD OF THE PRICE!!!\nIf I could I would give this place 0 stars.
