Love Barros pizza  and all they do for the community as a local family business. \nBut today's 4th of July  pizza for the family was inedible. Ordered thin crust pepperoni with extra sauce. Didn't inspect it at pick up and got home for disappointment. Wow! \nThe staff was friendly and phone order was easy, just disappointed with the pizza and with quality check failed today.
