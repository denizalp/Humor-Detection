Paul's YER (Yelp Elite Rating): 3 Stars.\n\nWent here with my buddy Paul who raved about their Sunday brunch. Being part Salvadorean, he speaks Spanish so I felt like I had a crutch. Well thankfully I went with Paul because ENGLISH IS NOT SPOKEN IN THIS RESTAURANT!!! For all my fellow gringos out there bring a Spanish interpreter because you won't be able to order. I still am shocked about this but our waitress didn't speak a lick of English nor did I hear anyone else speaking any English except for me and my buddy Paul. I'm still quite shocked about this. So was Paul!\n\nDown to the food. Well, that pesky Language barrier again. I was VERY clear in what I wanted. In fact, I POINTED TO THE MENU and said \"aqui.\" I don't care if she only spoke Farsi pointing to WHAT I wanted should have done the trick. Well guess what? She brought something totally different. Was it good? YES! Very good actually. Then my dish was supposed to come with Chorizo. It didn't. Thankfully my buddy Paul TRIED to communicate to her what was going on and after about 30 minutes a Chorizo finally came out.\n\nWhat my friend Paul got was quite good as well. But he felt that his beef was over cooked. I tasted it and while I thought the flavors were excellent, it was clearly overdone.\n\nWe both enjoyed the food. But when nobody in the restaurant does NOT speak any ENGLISH in your own COUNTRY, then I do have an issue. I'm ALL for speaking another language. Both my parents \"Mother\" languages were not English either (Tagalog and Croatian). But they learned.\n\nI really am befuddled at HOW they expect to have a THRIVING business when NO English is spoken there? I mean, it's GREAT that they cater to the Latin community for sure. But NO English? At all? Really? WTF?\n\nThat's all I have to say.
