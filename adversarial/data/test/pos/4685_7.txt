Came here for the VIP soft opening with a friend for breakfast.\n\nService is fast, friendly, and courteous!\n\nWhen you first enter the buffet, there is a fountain drink station. 50 cents extra if you want a to-go cup. There are the standard sodas, fruit juices and teas, but also Jamaica & Horchata. \n\nWe quickly went in to seat ourselves and the servers leave a cute name-card on your table so you could know who they are. Nice touch!\n\nThere was a fresh fruit and salad bar, yogurt, cereal bowls and milk, a station where they prepare custom omelette, make your own waffles, and other standard breakfast foods: eggs, potatoes, hash browns, etc.\n\nI got 2 plates of food:\nHash browns, scrambled eggs, bacon, quiche (very light & creamy), ranch potatoes, breakfast pizza (no tomato sauce, just scrambled eggs, bacon, & sausage; pretty good!), deviled eggs, french toast, and apple turn over.\n\nFor pancakes (they have chocolate chip & blueberry too), waffles, french toast, w\/e you can add strawberries, peaches, more berries, powdered sugar, cinnamon, syrup, etc. \n\nAfter this we had dessert! For the chocolate fountain there were skewers to pick your own chocolate dip foods. There were: macaroons, strawberries, truffles, rice krispies,  a heart cookie, marshmallows,etc. I also swiped a red velvet cake cupcake!! Before I left, I also took cotton-candy stick to-go; I felt like a kid again!\n\nThere is also a to-go option. They give you a box & you can fill it as much as you want, & it's $4.59 a pound.\n\nWill definitely come back for lunch & try out the rest of the menu. Great for price & quality.
