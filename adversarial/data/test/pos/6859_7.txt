I wish there had been Yelp reviews of this place before I wasted my time and money here. \n\nLet me start by pointing out that the room you see in the photos with the two chairs and the vases with bamboo near the pretty window is a common area that leads to both the men's and women's locker rooms, the sauna and is also used for group yoga classes so there is a large mirror on the opposite wall. It is a lovely room, however, it is also the room that was used for my massage. They put up two folding screens with a large opening in the middle and between all panels and called it a massage room. \nIt was anything but relaxing to have the light from the window shining down on me while people were coming in and out of the sauna and locker rooms and talking about their laser hair removal and what they ate for breakfast. Not to mention the fact that I had to get undressed in a completely open area facing a mirror. I actually climbed onto the massage table and got under the sheet with my robe on to achieve any type of privacy. It was beyond awkward.\nThen, when my massage was over, there was an entire group waiting to start a yoga class just outside of the glass door, facing the mirror that was completely exposed to my makeshift room while I was changing. How is this professional or acceptable?! \n\nThen, for the manicure\/pedicure session, my husband and I were escorted to what appeared to be a closet that must double as a nail room. We were literally on top of each other and the equipment was horrible. I expressed my dissatisfaction to the staff who tried to apologize and said they had over\/booked the day but really did little to address my concerns.\n\nIf we hadn't already spent so much money and time in getting there, I would have bailed when I saw the \"massage room\". This was an absolute disaster and a tremendous disappointment. If you are even considering coming here, do yourself a favor and go to Massage Envy and then to Wal-Mart for your nails. You'll have a much better experience.
