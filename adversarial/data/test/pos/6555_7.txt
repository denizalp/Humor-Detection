This location is north of Windmill just off the east side of Eastern Avenue.\n\nThese guys are great! We just got back from our first visit here and this was the best Auto Zone experience I can ever remember having...ever! \n\nThe car started displaying signs that the battery was wearing down and would need to be replaced soon. The gentlemen working between 8pm-9pm tonight were rediculously friendly and helpful. He came out and tested the battery and let us know that it was the culprit. Checking out the system, it seems it was still under warranty. Sweet! \n\nI know alot of places frown upon you doing anything to your car on the premises(which I certainly understand), but they gave us the wrench so we could switch out the batteries real quick. He helped us yank it out, and once we bought the new battery, I slapped that one in and we were all set! Quick and freaking painless!\n\nThe staff was so friendly and personable. It was a stark contrast to some of the other Auto Zones I've been to here in Las Vegas, especially in North Las Vegas. In less than 15 minutes time, they helped us solve an annoying problem that certainly had the potential to become a bigger problem.\n\nFrom here on out, this will be the first place I think of for all my auto needs. Thanks again for all the help!\n\n5 stars.
