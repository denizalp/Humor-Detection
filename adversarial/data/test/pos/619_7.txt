French Onion Soup from Cornerstone, you call to me.  You whisper sweetness in my ear.  You cry out, \"Enjoy my oniony yumminess, let the gooey cheese melt in your mouth, wash me down with a craft beer from the tap, and if you were really good...you made it during happy hour when the great beer is even cheaper than usual.\"\nOk, so I love a good beer, and they've got it here.  The food is always good, even if it isn't what I'm looking for.  I come here mostly for the French Onion Soup (I know, you would have never thought...that girl must go there for the French Onion Soup.)  The house fries are delish.  \nThe servers always seem to be the same ladies, and even though one is a Steelers fan, I can't fault her when she pours me a nice cold draft.\nOn thing I'd like to see from Cornerstone is an updated menu...preferably one with nachos, and maybe a veg-chili.  But if you're in Berea, stop by, sit down, have a bowel of soup and enjoy your choice of beer.
