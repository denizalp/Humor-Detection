The Skinny: although not a fan of their cookies, I come back for their cake and challah (4) service is great and friendly(5)value is fair for the quality and quantity(4.5).\n\nIt's been a while since I've been back at Freed's but there are definitely reasons to love it.\n\nThe main reason to go is their Chocolate Parisian hands down. The cake crumb is light, moist and not overly bitter. The chocolate whipped cream (not frosting) matches perfectly with the cake and just the right amount to leave you satisfied. I like the fact that it is not too sweet or fudge-like which is common at most bakeries.\n\nTheir black forest cake is great too. I like that their cherry filling isn't too gummy and sports chunks of cherries. Yummy!\n\nAt $32 for a 9 inch cake for this quality, it is very reasonably priced. When we get one for other people to try, they are usually impressed.\n\nYou could get a singular slice of cake if you prefer but somehow when you purchase a whole cake it seems to hold up better than just a slice (The slices tend to dry out quickly... It is Vegas after all.). So don't be a wuss and pony up for the whole thing. Oh and FYI - make sure your car is cool when you transport the cake to your destination. Hot car and real whipped cream = no es bueno.\n\nTheir wedding cakes are delicious too. On my suggestion, my friend got her wedding cake here. They made her a beautiful cake that looked and tasted incredible.\n\nI also discover first Friday of the month Challah. OMG... So good. It had just the right texture - soft with a slight chew. The mildly sweet egg makes this a perfect snack plain or buttered toast or French toast. At $7 for a sizable loaf, it is well worth it.\n\nAlthough as a bakery they offer cookies and other baked goodies, those tend to be outshone by their cakes and Challah for me. Honestly, their Italian cookies are just okay in my book. But then again, I am not a huge fan of Italian cookies so it may just be a taste preference.\n\nService is friendly and the lady behind the counter was nice enough to help me with my cake to the car as I was carrying my little one into the store. \n\nFor the delicious cakes and Challah and reasonable prices, this place gets a 4 starred review.
