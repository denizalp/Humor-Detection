Although they have the typical paint and wine in the back of the studio (where you pay for an instructor to guide you through a step-by-step creation), the front is set up to have people buy blank canvases and paint whatever their hearts desire. Why doesn't Chicago have this yet?! It was awesome!\n\nThey have a range of canvas sizes and a multitude of different color paints that they are not stingy about! Cocktails are reasonably priced at about $8, wine for about $6 and beers for around $5. They also offer food and appetizers that smelled incredible!\n\nThis was a super low key way to catch up with friends and enjoy some time together. I would highly recommend!
