Perhaps I should be embarrassed to write this review, but I've reached the age where I dont care...much like the point where your dad is ok going out in sweat pants for dinner.  These things just happen.  That being said, I had a fabulous treatment at A Touch of Vegas Day Spa the other day.  Truly a 5 Star experience.  A massage you ask?  Not Quite.  A Facial?  Maybe next time.  So what did I have done?  Well a chest and back wax...some of us arent hairless Adonises!  Before you think Im some out of control swarthy disco owner, Ill let the record show its not that much but enough where i felt it might be a good idea to get rid of for the summer and hanging out at pools.  Im of Yugoslavian heritage...hair is as natural to us as stuffed cabbages!\n\nNow that we've cleared the air and can focus on the specifics, I found this spa to amazing for a little local place.  Booking was a cinch by phone and the check in process was easy.  Their relaxation room is minimal but its a small place so it fits with their concept.  The place is decorated very quaint and homely with homage paid to 1950's Americana.  My esthetician made me feel completely relaxed for my treatment (as much as you can when it feels like your heart is being ripped out) and in reality, it was over before I knew it.  Not only that, she continually checked with my comfort level and was thorough in her execution.  At the end, she spent about 5 or 10 minutes explaining what to do and not do for the next 48 hours and I never felt rushed.  \n\nIf I enjoyed pain this much there, I can only imagine how great relaxation is at A Touch of of Las Vegas!  That's why I'm already planning to come back for a massage down the road.  Now to enjoy my 6 weeks of swimming speed and efficiency before my return to Robin Williams territory.
