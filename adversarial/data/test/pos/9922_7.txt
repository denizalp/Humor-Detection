When dining in an airport, there are a few things I look for...\n\n1) A restaurant\/food stop that has tables with seating. Ain't nobody tryin' to hang out in those seats at the terminal for an hour.\n\n2) Either a TV for my viewing pleasure, or an outlet to charge my phone\/computer. Both would be great, but only one is necessary.\n\n3) Decent food that's not ridiculously bad for you!\n\nI'm happy to report that Pei Wei Asian Diner met all three of my requirements. Sure, our meals were way over priced, but that's airport dining for ya. The hubs and I grabbed a booth\/table combo with an outlet right underneath - perfect for charging our computers before our flight. Service was friendly and the food was pretty good.\n\nYou place your order up at the counter then they give you a buzzer to let you know when it's ready. I'd say our food took about 5 minutes to come out. Not too shabby. I got the egg and bacon fried rice which I really enjoyed. It was a large bowl of food. My husband and I honestly could have split it. \n\nA good place to keep in mind for a meal at the Las Vegas airport!
