Having been to Mexico a half dozen times myself, I can honestly say that La Tiendona Market has got it all just right.  \nI walked into the store to the opening strains of Guantanamera playing on the speakers.  In my eyes, all that was missing was the mariachi band and a cold Corona in hand.  Inside, their shelves are lined with all the Mexican delights you crave but are afraid to deal with bringing back into Canada through Customs.  Beans, tortillas, canned goods, moles, candies, spices, marinades, and much, much more!\nI myself picked up some Jarrito's soda and some premade chipotle marinade.  The prices were remarkably low, and as the kindly storekeeper said, he'll \"never get rich at these prices\".  Too bad for him, great for us - he deserves to win the lottery for the good job he does bringing all these authentic Mexican goods to us.\nSo, if you want to recreate those happy Mexican memories with delicious, magical Mexican delights, get to La Tiendona.  They've got everything you need!
