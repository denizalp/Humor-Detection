I got my Earl of Sandwich buy one, get one free sandwich offer for my birthday and had to come redeem it. My favorite sandwich there is the classic Earl of Sandwich, roast beef with cheese and horseradish. So tasty and fantastic. \n\nThe service was very friendly here and quite efficient as well. They were pretty busy, but they were still able to get everyone served in a good amount of time. When I finally got my order and headed out, the cashier shouted to me \"Happy Birthday.\" So nice of her to remember. This is a good addition to the Palms food court.
