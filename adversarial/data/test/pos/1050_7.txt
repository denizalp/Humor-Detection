There are some things you have a go to specialist for that you like, right? For me this is my go to, hands down, only office I go to for dental care. There is no other office I would let near my teeth lol honestly. \n\nI came to Dr. Staton' s office a couple of years ago, after not having been to the dentist in about 4yrs and not flossing correctly or taking care of my teeth. GROSS, I know. Lol but from day one of my first consultation to this week of my regular normal cleanings I can honestly say I enjoy going to my dentist office! \n\nIt took a lot of work from Dr. Staton and her whole staff to get my teeth and gums back on track but I was never once talked down to or made to feel bad about anything I needed. \n\nOne of the other amazing things I love about this office, apart from their quick check in and leave turn around time, is the cheerfulness of everyone there. John, Danielle, Krishna and Marleny- their dental hygienist, are absolutely amazing. (Shows you how much I was there to know their names!!)\n\nTake it from me, stop by! You wont regret it.
