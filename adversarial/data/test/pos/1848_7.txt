i'm doing 2 not 1 stars because the worker Jaime was so nice, ran to me with my missing bag and price matched everything I needed lowered. But I give a big FUCK YOU to the old indian man running the game section. As me and my friend went in the area he followed me and my friend and watched us standing there like a pedophile but did not ask if we needed help, creepy much? I asked to get grand theft auto 5 he was fine but needed my ID. I am 15 so I stated I didn't have one and asked to take the game around so I could bring it up front when my mom shows up. He refused but said he would bring it to register 15. After 25 minutes of shopping it was NOT up front, my mom had a headache so I rushed back to him to get the game and he said I had to come up there to purchase it because he wouldn't do any favors for a faggot. I don't know how he knew or if he assumed but I was upset and disgusted. I wanted him fired. So when I got home I called the store and the lady on the phone said she was about to go on lunch break and was to lazy to get the manager, who was I talking to...PRECIOUS? NEVER SHOPPING HERE AGAIN REGARDLESS ON THE ONE NICE EMPLOYEE! I am taking my business to target and amazon!!!
