I have been here number of times and the quality of food and service was great each time. The unique quality of this place is the authenticity of the pizza they produce. Having been to Naples, I believe that this place is the closest competitor of Neapolitan style pizza that you will find anywhere in Toronto.\n\nTheir pizzas are soft as a cloud, be gentle before you crush the delicate crust with your dull and coarse fingers. Slight charring over the pale crust gently reflects the metaphor of your current life versus your hopes and aspirations. Sauce is light and perfectly sweet; the charred bitter crust perfectly balances out the sweetness. The overall quality of food is great. Although price can be a little high, its fair in comparison to the food that you will be receiving.\n\nThis is the place you want to go if you are looking for an authentic Neapolitan pizza.
