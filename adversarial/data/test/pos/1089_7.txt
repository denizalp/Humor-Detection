I'm not sure why you haven't been here yet. \n\nTheir burgers are all like $3.00 and they're seriously bomba$$. (and LOLZ @ the reviewer that said they tasted \"leathery and like they were from Aldi's\" --- WUT????) \n\nI tried the fries this time -- fresh cut and they couldn't have been tastier. \n\nGet your ass to Stevenson's and have yourself a cheeseburger party.
