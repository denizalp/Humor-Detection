Was very excited to visit Ferraro's for the first time last night.  Although I've lived in Vegas for 17 years, I've never been to Ferraro's.\n\nA good friend was hosting a party there to celebrate the launch of his new company.  For hors d'oeuvre we were served slices of Cheese Pizza, Sausage Pizza, Risotto Balls, and Sausage w\/Marinara Sauce.....all of them were awesome.\n\nOnce we were seated, we were served Gnocchi w\/Marinara Sauce & Penne Pasta with Bolognese Sauce for Appetizers.  For a Salad we were served a salad w\/Heirloom Tomatoes, Mozzarella, Balsamic Vinegar, Avocado, and Red Onion.....this was soooo good too!  For an Entree, I chose the Filet w\/Wild Mushrooms in a Veal demi-glaze reduction while the Better Half chose the Fresh Seabass.....a couple of friends ordered Ferraro's World Famous Oso Buco......we loved them all!\n\nAnd to finish the dinner, we had Tiramisu & Cannolis....what!!!  I think I died and went to heaven!\n\nPlus the wine was free flowing all night long.....I can't remember how many glasses I put away.....ha!\n\nI hate to sound like such a Homer, but this was a really really good experience from beginning to end.\n\nWill I return?  F-U-H-G-E-T-T-A 'B-O-U-T I-T!
