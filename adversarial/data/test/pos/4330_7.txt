So far, my worst Chinese food experience ever! My mistake though, as I should have known better when I entered the restaurant. Atrocious decor, no one to greet me, and only a couple eating there. But I was craving for Asian food, and this place was right next to my hotel. I ordered egg rolls + Orange chicken (which came with steamed rice). The rolls were so greasy that I truly started to feel nauseous. The worst was the Orange chicken. In my book, the chicken has to be tender inside and crispy on the outside... Well, it was literally dried! I almost choked on it! When the waitress took away the half full dishes, she did not bother ask me if everything was fine... She knew better! Thank God for the fortune cookie as it was the only good food I had there!
