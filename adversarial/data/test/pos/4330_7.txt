Was in the area and stopped by for lunch.  It was around 1 pm and the restaurant was empty....perfect!  I ordered a 12\" BMT, toasted, on Italian Herbs and Cheese Bread ($6).\n\nThe Sandwich Artist made my sammie to order and it tasted very good.\n\nAnother great visit to Subway.  They're pretty consistent and that's why they're one of my favorite places to go when I want a quick, cheap meal.\n\nWill I return?  Sure.
