Stopped in for dinner and it was not very crowded probably due to location and a night early in the week.  Service was good.  We received some chips and salsa.  Really enjoyed.  The salsa had a little heat to it.  The chips appeared to be home made.  Ordered the Enchiladas Verdez that is 3 Green Sauce Chicken enchiladas with rice, lettuce, tomato, gauc and sour cream.  The green sauce was tasty but the chicken really lacked much flavor.
