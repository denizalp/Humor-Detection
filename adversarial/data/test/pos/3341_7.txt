can we have a moment of silence for the carnitas street tacos?\n\nlet's pay our respect for the carne asada. \n\nwhat is the secret ingredient in those beans?? i can't pin point it but those beans are something else. \n\nwe wanted to try it all, so naturally, it was the 3 item combo platter: 1 taco, 1 tamale, 1 enchilada. \n\nthe friendliest girl told us they were known for street tacos and we should have listened. everything on the plate was great but it was all about that taco. \n\ni thought i knew delicious but it reached a whole 'notha level after eating here. \n\nmy recommendation: street taco combo plate w carne asada and DEFINITELY carnitas. then drizzle on some of that green salsa they have. welcome to bliss.\n\nthey are a tad inconsistent but it's still really good, some days are just off the charts goods.
