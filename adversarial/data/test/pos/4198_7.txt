Alright, let's get personal. I was getting ready to wax *that* area: \n*mentally preparing because of how awful it usually is\n*telling it I'm sorry for what's about to come\n*grinding my teeth on the way to the salon \n\nI arrived at Urban Wax for the first time and immediately loved the atmosphere. It was clean, and approachable: believe it or not, the appearance of a salon can definitely alter the experience greatly (even if you don't immediately think so). I was waiting for only a short amount of time, and then was taken into the back where I would begin my waxing procedure. My technician's name was Caitlin (I think), and she made me feel so comfortable. I told her that it had been a while and I was scared for what's to come, so during the entire procedure she held a conversation with me (not just boring small talk). The best part of the whole appointment was that I got to try hard wax for the first time, and it was AMAZING. Nearly painless in most areas and very quick. \n\nFor those of you who choose the shaving route: stop. Get waxed, and if you're afraid, opt for the hard wax at this location and you'll see why I have changed my waxing preference. When my appointment was over, Caitlin brought me over to a set of drawers.... FULL OF PANTIES. Not even meh panties, but really cute ones that I was excited about. What better way to heal your hurt than a cute new pair of free panties?! After I selected the ones I wanted, I brought them to the front where they placed them in a bag for me to take home. I didn't know this initially, but on your first visit, you receive a major discount (pretty sure it was at least 40% off): you're welcome. \n\nIf you're looking to visit, make sure you call ahead of time and reserve an appointment. The availability here is usually slim to none because of how popular it is!
