I noticed this place was hot on Yelp so I wanted to check it out. I'm not sure what distinguishes New Mexican food from the other states, so I didn't know what to expect. When I ordered I was told they make everything fresh, from scratch and make their green chile with Hatch chiles, that excited me. I get Hatch chiles every year and love cooking with them for months to come. If I had to guess, I would say that they boil their chiles because their green chile wasn't as flavorful and tasty as the ones I roast. \n\nI ordered a green chile pork chimichanga. I was disappointed with the tortilla, definitely not made from scratch. As, I tore into the chimi I realized they gave me chicken instead of pork, no biggie. The chicken wasn't cooked together with the green chile, they were cooked separately and then combined into the chimi. I guess that's the New Mexican way? After I make my green chile I add the meat and let it simmer for an hour to let the meat absorb the flavor of the green chile. I was disappointed with my chimi. The beans were excellent and the rice was alright. \n\nThe restaurant itself is very small and I would prefer to take my food to go and eat the comfort of my own home. The woman taking the orders at the register was very nice and friendly. I will come back and try some other menu items, but not the green chile.
