Worst customer service ever. I cannot believe the way we were treated at this hotel. I stayed one night at this hotel on the 31st and checked out on the 1st on new years with my boyfriend. The hotel had signs all over the building notifying us to call in for a late check out so the next morning around 10, I called in asking for a late check out and they told me unless we paid $55, they would not give us a late check out. \n\nSo my boyfriend and I totally understood and thought \"Oh because its new years, I bet everyone is trying to check out late so thats why they are probably doing this. Lets just hurry up and check out by 11\" \nI decided to go take a quick shower but the hot water was not working. I left it on for 10 mins but still no hot water. I asked my boyfriend to call the desk and ask them to check it out for us. The lady at the desk merely accused us of lying and that noone else complained and we were just saying this to get a late check out. We complained and told her that we were NOT lying and to send us maintenance at least to the room if she did not believe us. She responded \"no other room has complained, how come your room is the only room with no hot water\" she proceeded to tell us that she was going to charge us 55 more dollars if we were not out of the room by 11. \n\nWe were extremely irritated by her tone of voice and her attitude. I got in the shower HOPING it would turn hot during the middle of my shower but NO HOT WATER. I showered in the cold, checked out at 10:30 and walked over to The Riviera Hotel right across where our other friends were staying and dried my hair there and got ready. \n\nI cannot believe the attitude the lady at the desk was giving us. We spent 300 dollars on the room for ONE night at the very least we expect HOT WATER. and if not, she should have sent maintenance us right away. We even asked to speak to the supervisor, and she told us that there was no point because she would tell me the same thing and AFTER we checked out my boyfriend called AGAIN to speak to the supervisor and FINALLY they connected us with the manager. We told her the story and she apologized and told us that that should not have happened the way it did and she would email us for a complimentary stay at the hotel. \n\nInstead, we got an email about a survey about our stay. It was really a horrific way to start the new year with the attitude from the customer service there and having to shower in the cold, and having to walk across to the other hotel in the cold. \n\nProps to Cheryl the manager who emailed us back with the complimentary room. Other than that worst customer service ever for Las Vegas hotel.
