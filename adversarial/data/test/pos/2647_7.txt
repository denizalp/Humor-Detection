Most ridiculous service, I'm trying to order 10 shots to my table and the server is saying that she is only doing bottles that I have to go to the bar. I talk to the bartender and he is saying that I have to order my shots thru the server.\nWhat kind of place is this? \nIf they don't want my money that's fine I'll spend it in other place that they want to do some business.
