I've had to downgrade my review of this place. My first visit there with my mother was pleasant enough but we both noticed that the prices for the portion sizes make this place pretty expensive. \n\nUpon further visits this:\n\nOne time I ordered the stroganoff. It was flavorless reheated slop that made me sick for two days. \n\nOn another recent visit, and my last visit, I had a burger that tasted like the inside of a freezer. Freezer burn, idk. It tasted old, stale, and dry. I took two bites and tossed it. \n\nI couldn't get a refill of my coke and I had to go to the counter to get someone to give me a check so I could leave. The place wasn't busy, myself and one whole other table. So I don't know what the problem was. \n\nIt's well known that Sysco food products supplies this restaurant, so, it's unclear to me why they call their food \"homemade\" when it isn't and why the prices are so high. \n\nI give two stars because, even though it's over done and prosaic, I enjoy coke and coke products.  and they have one of those fancy new coke machines.  Go there to get a coke but don't expect to get a refill. \n\nAdditionally:  the owner himself might want take some courses in manners. I've heard him argue with customers, venders, and staff in the past. Among other things I won't mention here. It's uncomfortable and unprofessional. \n\nAnd phils attitude \"if you don't like it, buy me out\" (printed on the menu) speaks volumes about the value he places on customers and the public.
