This is for the mens sections: \n\nSelections : 4 Stars\nThis means my skinny ass can find trousers in a size 30 and shirts in a medium! Yayy! You have no idea what this means coming from Indiana where suit sizes start st 42R ! Wish they had more selection of shoes though. \n\nService : 5 stars\nAwesome service in the mens dept. Love it.
