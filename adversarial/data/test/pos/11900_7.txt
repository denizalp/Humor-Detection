We used to live close to here and would come all the time. Heck we live close to galleria and still drive here because the water is that good. U can fill up outside but we always go in. They rinse the bottles before filling up the water. It's only 25 cents a gallon. They have an amazing filtration system here that is a reverse osmosis and more. I'm not sure what they do all I know is this water is my favorite that's close enough to home. It's kind of a drive but we don't mind.
