You should be ashamed. Why would you send a response claiming a miscommunication when that is a bold face lie!\nThere is no way there was any miscommunication! My calls were ignored period. You can't receive that many messages and have it be a miscommunication.  What you have is a need to teach people to respect customers. I respect my clients and treat them as I would want to be treated. A return call goes a long way.  \nI spoke directly to your used car manager and he lied, twice and dodged my calls the other times.\nDo not try and make light of the horrible customer service. No phone call will ever change my mind. You had your chance 4 separate times. Epic fail on your part.
