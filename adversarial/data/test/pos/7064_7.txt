I've been so excited to try Fez after all the reviews I have read and finally made it there last night along with JD and his parents. I was immediately impressed with the layout and decor. It was chic and modern without being fussy and overdone. I guess there was a lighting track above our table that was out so it was tough to see the menu but we managed with a little help from JD's mom's pocket light! The table next to us was using their candle. \nWe made it in time to score some $3 happy hour glasses of house chardonnay which was good! We started with a basket of sweet potato fries, which smelled divine and tasted incredible with the dipping sauce they came with. It was semi-sweet, garlicy and a bit tart at the same time and really complimented the cinnamon-y taste of the fries. The basket was huge too and we didnt come close to finishing them even between the four of us. \n\nFor the main course I had the go green pasta with chicken and I was utterly delighted by my choice! It was one of the best pesto sauces I have ever had and came with slices of zucchini, onions, red peppers and eggplant that, in my opinion, really made the dish. I was intrigued by the marinara pasta selection on the menu and how you could make it spicy, but ultimately my love of all things veggie led me to pick the go green. \n\nJD had the fez burger and I had to have a taste. It was really surprisingly yummy (I'm not a burger fan). I loved the fact that you really could taste the pear and it actually worked great with the barbecue sauce, a nice surprise. But my second favorite dish had to be JD's mom's shrimp kisra. It was so amazing! I loved the fresh spinich and tomatoes and the garlic sauce was finger lickin good (sorry to steal your trademark Colonel)! The shrimp was juicy and perfectly cooked also. \n\nThe only reason I am not giving Fez five stars is because of the club-like fist pumpin music that played quite loudly. It wasn't terrible, but it would have been an absolutely perfect experience if the volume had been a bit lower and the tempo a tad slower. It was a Sunday night after all. But I'm not going to dwell on it. \n\nWe left there with plenty of leftovers (which rarely happens with us) and everything tasted just as great for breakfast (yes breakfast) this morning. Thank you Fez, lets do it again sometime soon!!! Maybe i will just bring some earplugs.
