Shout out to the lovely Christie S. who told me about this restaurant! La Famiglia serves up some of the best NY style pizzas I've had so far in AZ. In addition to pizza, they also offer Italian favorites such as pasta, stromboli, and impressive looking arancini.\n\nI've been here a few times. The first time we had an 18\" \"The works\" pizza, signature thin crust style. When it came out it looked tantalizing and was a hefty sight to behold since it was such a large pizza. The toppings were plentiful and ingredients fresh. I liked the combination of flavors and the outer 1\/3 of the pizza was the best, just like NY style with a lightly crisp crust but still pliable enough to fold. The inner 2\/3 though was a little soggy and when I picked up my first slice my internal monologue was saying \"Nooooooooooo\" and like in a slow-mo disaster movie sequence, I saw the outer 2\/3 of the toppings cascading off like a saucy Italian avalanche, falling into a sad little clumpy pile on the pizza pan. When I looked at my pizza, I was left with a mostly naked slice devoid of ingredients except for crust. I've also had a 16\" pizza where I've run into the same problem with partial pizza nudity, except only the inner 1\/3 of the pizza toppings have fallen off.\n\nThe baked rice ball\/arancini appetizer and grandma pizza are great choices on their menu. The rice balls are amazing (Amazeballs)! They are softball size with a crispy breaded outer coating and filled with ground meat, peas, and cheese. The baked version is smothered with marinara sauce and more cheese. Apparently they are made fresh every Thursday and are usually gone a few days later for good reason! The grandma pizza is delicious as well. It's a Sicilian thin crust pizza, rectangularly shaped, with plum tomatoes, mozzarella, and garlic. When we ordered it the crust was perfect throughout each slice and the flavors combined harmoniously with each other. I'd definitely get this pizza again!\n\nService was very sweet and friendly. \n\nIf we get another thin crust pizza we'd probably get something with less toppings on it to avoid any future R rated meals (haha). We've had nice experiences overall though and we'll definitely be back for more delicious pizza and arancini!
