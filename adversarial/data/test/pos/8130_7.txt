ARGH. Recently went here on a Wednesday night for their industry event, Eclipse. \n\nCan I just tell you what a mess this line was?! \nWe had a comped table and it took almost half an hour and walking to various lines for them to check our name\/ID, etc and THEN, we move to 2 other lines to get in.....to just be informed that they sold our table bcuz we checked in too late.\n\nIn total, we waited 45 mins to get inside to a non-existent table...WHACK!!!!!!!!\n\nIf I didn't like the music so much, I wouldn't come back!
