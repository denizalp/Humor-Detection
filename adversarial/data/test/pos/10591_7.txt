This is my go to taco truck!  The only one that I frequent because they have tacos de tripa!  Yes, tripe!  And they are delicious!  The truck is clean, the service is friendly and fast and the food is made fresh to order, each and every time.  In addition to tripe tacos, I get the cabeza (head) taco and the sopes!  I've tried the burrito once and it was hearty and filling and reasonably priced.  Each taco order comes with grilled onions, a roasted jalapeno, a wedge of lime, radish and green and red hot sauce at about 2 bucks a pop.  Get your plate, squeeze some lime on your taco, pour the sauce of your choice, take a bite of taco, a bite of the jalapeno and partake in taco heaven.  I end my meal with the radish and a nice cold horchata (they sell that too)!  And when your done, go get gas because it's parked right at a gas station near the back.  They also have sheltered picnic tables so you don't even have to eat in your car.  And if you see those crispy, pinwheel looking things (Chicharoones de Harina\/rinds of flour) in the ziploc bag, BUY THEM!  Deep fried, light and crunchy!  Buy a bag, grab the bottle of hot sauce sitting there, shake, shake, shake it into the bag and eat these while you wait. So good!  My stomach is literally growling right now but I can't even go because I am on short term vegan adventure but when it's over....watch out!  Until then, have a taco(be adventurous and try tripa or cabeza), an horchata and some Chicharonnes de Harina with hot sauce and thank me later!\n\nFYI...Horchata is a ground rice drink that may include spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, ground cocoa, vanilla, etc..\n\nThat is all!
