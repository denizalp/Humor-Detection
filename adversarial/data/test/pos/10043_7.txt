This place sucks.  Keep in mind I'm very active in my child's life.  I visit the school and speak with every one.\nThe workers have the same reply when asking how your child is. The management is very passive on the concerns parents may have for their children and classes.\nWould not recommend this school based on the lack of communication and neglect\/abuse the children go thru. \nHad a few kids attending. Long story short one child has had two events of unexplained bruises.  No explanation from the school of any events taken place.\nWalked in on a room of yelling caregivers having aggressive tones towards the children. No patience from the caregivers towards the children.  Walked in on my child crying on the floor directly under a caregiver and a second caregiver was less then five feet away from them. Zero care given. No comfort or even talking with my child, just left crying.  \nI've also witnessed a caregiver pull a chair from under a child, the poor child flopped to the floor in her effort to get him out of the way. \nAnother red flag when a caregiver finally saw a child she favors and started yelling \"my boyfriend, my boyfriend!\"  She runs and hugs the child.  Very inappropriate, especially for children that don't even speak yet. \nCollectively these people do not care. I over hear the care givers moan as they leave for the day, making funny comments about wishing they did not have to come back for work.\nForgot to add that when watching the class rooms thru the camera surveillance system they provide you have to basically go into stealth mode. Hiding behind walls to block the caregivers from seeing that parents are watching them because it's obvious that they alert each other when they know that they are being observed.\n\nIf you don't care about your child this place is perfect for you.  If you regret having your child because you didn't realize how tough it would be and you couldn't commit to an abortion this place is perfect for you. \nThey won't teach your child anything more than what a labtop with YouTube nursery songs will teach them. \nPerfect place to drop your kids off to get a good yelling. Want to whip your kids into shape... Just drive them by this place.  Creative learning center?  More like prepare your kids for a harsh cruel world.  This place will mos def give them some tough skin they need. Never mind the love and care. This has to be the place the worlds bully's are manufactured.\nPoor kids
