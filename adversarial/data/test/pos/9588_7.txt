XS wasn't a prioritiy club for me to visit. I'm picky with music but in Las Vegas, you don't really go to the clubs to dance because most of the music played is really crappy mash-ups or the club is too packed and you can't C-walk or do the Dougie without getting booty bumped. Of course, you're usually too drunk to care about any of those things and you dance anyways. I digress.\n\nMy 3 stars are based on a 45 minute stay at XS. We got there on Monday at 1am, there was a small line but apparently some guy my boyfriend met in a bathroom was able to get us in ahead of the line for cheap, less than $20, and hey it worked! So we get in and it's packed, not packed like a weekend though. We found a spot to dance but it was too cramped. From where we were standing, it looked like the pool area wasn't open but we were too lazy to fight through the crowd to check out the situation. There was good hip hop playing for 30 minutes straight.\n\nI'm only 26 and already cantankerous. Crowds make me grumpy and I don't have the energy to club all night...lame. If you're lame like me but curious about this place, you should come on a Monday. If I return here, it will only be if I get bottle service, which I'm too poor for anyway. I'm just happy I'm able to say that I've been to XS. I will agree that it is very pretty inside.
