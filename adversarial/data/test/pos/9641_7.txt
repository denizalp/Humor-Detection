This place was fantastic! Finally came here with my boyfriend last Friday for dinner and it was sooo good!! You get to create your own personal pizza; sauce, cheese, meats, veggies, etc... I would definitely come back. It can get busy so if you're going for peak lunch or dinner times be prepared to wait. The line moved quickly though. Sorry this isn't a super long review but there isn't much more to say other than get over there and create your own slice of heaven! Ha get it!? lol  ;)
