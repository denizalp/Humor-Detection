There's only one reason to go to this gym - location. Oh, and it's cheap.\n\nIn all seriousness, this place looks massive... but only from the outside. Once you're inside, you realize that, \"Oh wait, this place is tiny.\" During the gym rush hours, there is a major lack of weights available. Luckily, they generally have enough cardio machines to keep up with demand, but I wouldn't be surprised if all the treadmills could be taken at one time.\n\nThe locker room is beat up, the cardio equipment is dirty and worn out, the basketball court has dead spots and the place has mediocre air circulation.\n\nThat being said, I still go here as much as I have to because I only paid 17\/month and it's the closest location. Yay.
