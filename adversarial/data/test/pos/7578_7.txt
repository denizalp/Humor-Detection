This place is fantastic. If you don't look closely you could miss it. This is your warning. Don't miss Hattie's!\n\nThey do live music, bingo and taco Tuesdays, and dogs! Yay for a dog friendly bar! They have an AWESOME draft list. We're talking good, local beer and real thought put into what will work and what won't - what's good and what's not. I came in with my dog, Thor, (mentioned in way too many previous Yelp posts and pictures...) and we loved it. My only concern was that once the front door opens, the friendly dogs have access to the parking lot. Thor is a door bolter - and because he's deaf he has no recall = Kel panic attack. Fret not - Jackie is installing an outside fence to be an extra safety barrier in the next few weeks. I love solutions. Also, most of the dogs are very well behaved, unfortunately I kept Thor leashed at the bar because of the open door bolting, but all of the other dogs were very good.\n\nThis place is a little divey - but in all the nicest ways. Beautiful murals line the walls, cement floors allow the dog friendliness, and good people. Dive bars can be a hit or miss crowd, and this was a total hit. Everyone was super nice and friendly. They do a ton of awesome events and themed nights. And bingo is serious - do not mistake this. They have bingo dabbers (not the Cam kind) and everything. Love it. I will definitely be back here to drink and hang out & probably play bingo, with Thor in tow.
