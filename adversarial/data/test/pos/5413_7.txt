In true Vegas style, the birthday girl found a high stakes poker champ to be our patron for the weekend. He made us (5girls) reservations at Todd's at 12:30 on the patio, just in time to see the watershow....how thoughtful! It was fabulous! We were by far the youngest people having lunch, but that didn't stop us form being overly obnoxious with the picture taking, loud giggling and inappropriate comments. \nWe started with the beef carpaccio, which was out of this world! The oysters were just eh...too big for my taste. I had the butternut squash pasta, which was delicious, but way too much food for my still drunk state. We also tried the scallops, which had huge potential, but tasted fishy...so I'd say a miss. The halibut was also fishy...another miss. Overall, I'd say Olive's is very hit or miss....I can't rave enough about the carpaccio, and the butternut squash was nothing to scoff at....however, everything else was lackluster...and dare I say too fishy smelling\/tasting. \nWith all the fine restaurants in Vegas, I don't think I'll be back to Olive's...for the price, nothing should have smelled or tasted fishy....that's just amateur!\nHowever, since it was all free, and we did have a good time, I'm going with 3 stars
