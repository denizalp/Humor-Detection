Excellent excellent work. I cannot say how pleased we are with our new flooring. So now thats out of the way, lets get down to the nitty gritty\n\n1- Price. - Beat the estimate given to me by Lumber Liquidators by a 100-75%. Now that alone saved us quiet a bit. Thats on labor alone. Scott even helped us source the wood from one of his proffered retailer whom we had visited earlier unknowingly and that dropped the price per sq ft by about 50%. It all adds up to quiet a bit. (We got engineered hardwood from the dealer, if that helps in anyway. )\n\n2-Time. Lumber Liquidators wanted 4-5 days, these guys were in and out in 2. He promised he would have it done in 3 days at the worst case, but the fact is he delivered on time that was very important to us. \n\n3-Flexibility - Was very flexible to work with as far as times and schedules go. We found it easy to accommodate them with the numerous options we were given \n\n4-Personable - Wonderful people to work with. The whole crew was just nice wonderful people. I dont know how you may make your decisions but that is a big big  deal maker\/breaker for me. \n\nI would highly recommend them to anyone and everyone. In fact one of our neighbors is on his way to hiring them toe work on his house !  \n\n5 star service thru and thru
