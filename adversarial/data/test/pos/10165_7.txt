OK PEOPLE...time for a REAL review.  The ONLY thing this restaurant has going for it is the wait time in a Sunday morning...walk in and get seated. That is because the place is not busy here is why:\n\n1) The place is FILTHY. From the end tails  and smears on the tables, to the seats with crumbs spots and food\/skid marks to the tops of the booths that have at least 1 month of dust, lint and dirt build up. \n\n2) The food was horrible!  For example the 5 minute rice was either cooked for 3 minutes or cooked the night before. The pork was approximately 50% fat and 50% meat which is being extremely generous in the meat allocation. The scrambled eggs were rubbery like they were pulled from the stay warm buffet. Ahh the buffet...leaves a lot to be desired for a buffet. They actually serve the end pieces of the toast...perhaps the owner likes them and so should everyone else. And finally the bacon...careful asking for crispy....it will be cooked and then deep fried to the point of turning to dust. \n\n3) Wanna be Village Inn pie concept sans pies with a sully's tavern kind of flair using furniture that makes things made in China sold by KMart and IKEA Look like high end quality furnishing. \n\n4) Service...well if you mess up the order...comp the meal, make it right, comp something else...don't server the end tails.  \n\nNever going back and neither should you. Recommend closing this place. THE END!
