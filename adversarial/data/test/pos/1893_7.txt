Used to be the best AYCE sushi In town but I won't refer anyone here anymore. Service obviously sucks (or I should say getting worse? The server here never smiled) and food quality is getting worse. They don't even care how to roll rice anymore. Oh yeah, the server was trying to charge me for rice I left on the plate....I understand the rule but come on, your rice sucks and bigger than the sushi...trust me, I did my best and no bitch I'm not paying for the leftover. Lychee sorbet is good tho lol
