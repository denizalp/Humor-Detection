Day 2 and onto our 2nd buffet, we all decided on coming to The Spice Market. This buffet is located down a set of escalators just inside the Miracle Mile entrance of Planet Hollywood. The cashier desk is located in the middle of the Buffet. Since we already bought a 24 hour pass all we had to do is show our ID's and our Total Rewards card and we were in!!\nLucky for us, that we were seated at a table that was close to the action. Large plasma tv's were hanging in different area's and had either MTV Hitlist or ESPN on.\nThis buffet is on the smaller side but make no mistake it holds alot of yummi foods!!\n\nHighlights of the action:\n\nTandoori chicken, hummus, couscous, stuffed tomatoes with ground lamb, Pita bread,lamb skewers,tabouleh, chicken in curry sauce\n\nCrepe-making station \n\nAll different kinds of salads\n\nTacos,Quesadillas,Tortillas, Guacamole and Salsa\n\nHam and Prime rib \n\nAll kinds of yummi breakfast foods:\nEggs, Bacon, French toast, Pancakes, Waffles, Hash browns and who can forget the made to order omelettes!!\n\nPizza, Lasagna, Garlic breadsticks and Pastas with different sauces\n\nShrimp Cocktail, Sushi (again i wouldnt recommend),Crab legs\n\nEggrolls, Noodles and Dim sum\n\nDessert:\nCotton Candy (heck yeah)\nIce Cream\nCookies\nPies\nCakes and the list keeps going and going!\n\nOur waiter was kind and our water glasses were always refilled when asked,plates were cleared after we were finished as well! Only beef i have is when i went to the carving station there was no one there. I waited along with a couple other hungry customers for about 2-3minutes till one of the servers noticed he had a line. Geez buddy, if you know its busy then stay out where we can see you!!!
