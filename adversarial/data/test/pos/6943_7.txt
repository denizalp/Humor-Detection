Secret Piiiiiiiizza, yeah... that's what you arrreeee. Trying so hard to hide the way we feel. 'Cause we both belong to someone else, but we can't let it go 'cause what we feel\nIs, oh so real, so real, so real.......\n\nYeah that's right I just remixed an old school Atlantic Star song (Secret Lovers), Google that sh*t.\n\nThe girlfriend and I ventured off for some dinner time enjoyment, I've had Secret Pizza once before, but she hasn't so it was definitely a treat for the both of us.\n\nLocated in the Cosmopolitan on the 3rd or 4th floor (I can't recall), there is a dark corridor with pictures that encase the walls. Upon entry down the hallway all you see is a pinball machine. As you make your way closer, you begin to smell the wonderful scents of dough being baked alongside the hint of pizza sauce.\n\nThere's not much to this place except that pizza will be pizza and regardless of how crappy it is, I think I will always eat it. For real though, I will eat it. Here's what the girlfriend and I had that evening:\n\n-sausage & cheese\n-pepperoni & cheese\n-white pie\n\nOut of the three slices, the white pie was our number one choice. That's all I really have to say about Secret Pizza. \n\nWhite pie, try it or die. Just kidding, don't die.
