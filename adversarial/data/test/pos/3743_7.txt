Located in what feels like the \"hood\" with gangbanger type cars going back and forth on the road to the east.  Gates are locked, so if your ball goes over you're screwed.  Courts have some of the most annoying backstops you've ever heard - if a serve goes long and makes it to the back fence\/backstop... then BAM.  Court lights are somewhat poor as well, with inconsistent visibility.  Being on the center of 3 courts is best, but otherwise there are blind spots and lobbing has an undeserved advantage here at night.
