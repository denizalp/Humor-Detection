I felt kind of weird deciding to go take a walk in a cemetery on a nice day, but I had heard about how cool Lake View Cemetery was so I figured it was worth a shot. I was definitely not disappointed.\n\nFirst of all it is freaking gorgeous. I couldn't believe how pretty everything was. There are also quite a few historical figures and local celebs buried here, so if you're into that kind of thing there's that. Go put a dime on the Rockefeller headstone and maybe you'll be as rich as him one day! \n\nThere are picnic tables around the Garfield Monument, so if you're looking to go on a walk and pack a lunch, go for it! I'm definitely going to in the near future!\n\nAlso, the owners obviously have a sense of humor. There was a sign that read \"We have LOTS to talk about!\" I remember thinking how weirdly out of place and fitting at the same time!
