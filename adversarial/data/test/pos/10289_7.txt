4.5 stars.\nI finally had a chance to check out more of Jeff's tres fantastique crepes at this \"new\" location this morning.  Jeff was his warm-hearted and most-generous self, as usual.  After exchanging pleasantries with both Jeff and the staff, and Jeff notifying me of a change in the way he formulates his buckwheat crepes (now a combo of buckwheat and AP flour, and not the whole buckwheat of old), I decided to try the ham and gruyere buckwheat crepe, with an egg on top (additional charge), as well as \"The First Time,\" filled with Nutella and sliced bananas and garnished with bruleed bananas, whole walnuts, and walnut shavings (!).  I chose a cup of CB's latest drip, the Burundi varietal Kiryama from Madcap Coffee.  (You may buy a 12 oz. bag from crepe bar for $16.99 plus tax, or from madcapcoffee.com for $15.50 plus tax and shipping.  Check out their FAQ link for two shipping options.)  It was such a lovely day that I elected to eat en plein air.\n\nWhile I waited for my crepes to arrive, a delightful surprise was in store for me*, courtesy of the chef (didn't I say he is a generous soul?).  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/crêpe-bar-tempe?select=6VW790O-IRvw2gs_gb5VUg#6VW790O-IRvw2gs_gb5VUg  This was Jeff's take on the strawberry shortcake.  Oh la la!  This dish was nothing short of a gift sent from above!  :)  The combination of the caramelized crunch of the sponge cake, charred in some spots, but not too much that I hastened to trim it off**, cream (my guess is a rustic mix of ricotta and mascarpone, but I'm sure I am wrong, for it was very light, and mascarpone can sometimes be a little too rich.  Not for me, personally, but for some...), fresh, sliced strawberries, a strawberry reduction (on the right), and a magnificent, and you're-such-a-tease tiny serving of a peanut butter reduction on the left (miracle!) left me speechless and dancing as I almost inhaled the plate!  Here's another vision of une beaute.  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/crêpe-bar-tempe?select=CPdR8dECvp6oK6EyUSzkjQ#CPdR8dECvp6oK6EyUSzkjQ\n\nBut enough on the free stuff!  Let's get on with the stars of the show, the crepes!  I was originally ordering only a sweet crepe, but Jeff mentioned buckwheat, so I agreed, and it came with ham and gruyere, so I just rolled with it.  I can be loose like that, sometimes.  :)  I know that the use of mustard is very popular in recent years (and while I love mustard, it doesn't love me), so I asked if mustard was in the crepe's composition and was told that the crepe makeup itself didn't  contain mustard, but the vinaigrette dressing on the greens did, so Jeff said he'd omit it.  Instead, Jeff added pickled fennel.  I LOVE fennel!  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/crêpe-bar-tempe?select=vhNkSUc1XmH-OwgrP899VA#vhNkSUc1XmH-OwgrP899VA  Oh, and since I was going with the flow this morning, I went with Jeff's suggestion of an egg on top.  If you love buckwheat, ham, and gruyere, then you must order this crepe NOW!  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/crêpe-bar-tempe?select=QcNdkQMEQXf1U1YcdRRfmA#QcNdkQMEQXf1U1YcdRRfmA  My server came by to check on my progress of crepe consumption, estimating that I should be ready for the second crepe in a few minutes, but there's no way I'd finish this and have room for another, so I asked for a box.  She soon obliged with a sheet of aluminum foil and said she'd have the kitchen fire off The First Time.  Sacrebleu!  While the photo did not do it justice, the crepe's flavors and textures were extraordinaire!  Must. Try. Soon.  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/crêpe-bar-tempe?select=DqpP0rGwFH6OPqU6jbh82A#DqpP0rGwFH6OPqU6jbh82A  Again, I couldn't finish the crepe, nor had I wanted to- not after the \"amuse bouche\" of a strawberry shortcake, half of a savory crepe and most of the egg (I don't eat charred edges), almost two cups of coffee***, and now half of this sweet not-so-little number, I was finished, and happy.  Very happy.  :)\n\nIt was a gorgeous addition to my happy memories of perfect breakfasts- thank you, Jeff and company!\n\n*Jeff actually sent out teasers of the strawberry confection to other tables, not just mine.\n**The metabolism of charred food releases free radicals, which in turn may be hazardous to your health if you don't counteract with antioxidants- beware!\n***I had to call my server back after her third, or fourth checkup to request for a coffee refill.  My coffee had grown cold, and not once was I asked if I needed more.  Otherwise, I'd have rated this experience five stars!
