After a long and hot day of playing in the pool at a friends house our group bbq'ed but now long for more. Swimming and sitting pool side really brings out the hunger in someone when the novelty of the sun wares down. Pizza is one of the  best ways to aid in those cravings and delivery is the only means. Dominos pizza was the choice of the majority since they were open on this Memorial Day holiday and continue to have great pizza at competitive prices.\n\nI ordered for us all online which was such a simple means of ordering. The Dominoes tracker allows the customer to track their pizza order in somewhat really time. One can change the tracker to one of many different types, but my favorite is the island parrot that produced sounds of waves and cocktails while it tracks the progress of your pizza order. \n\nThe pizza was superior and delicious. We ordered two thin crust and two regular crust pizzas to feed everyone. I took advantage of the deal they offered on line of $5.99 with the purchase of three or more items each is this great sale price. We ordered just pizzas and our fourth pizza with two toppings was $5.99 too. With combinations of bacon and pepperoni or feta and mozzarella these are some of the topping choice we mixed it up with. Now with the tracker telling me that pizza is here it is time for eating.
