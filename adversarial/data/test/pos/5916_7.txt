God awful exepriance here today. Long time customer who was screamed at by a waitress to never come back because I chose not to leave a tip. Came here many times  usually decent enough  service unitll today. I feel like every other industry the food service industry is performance based. To treat a customer like that is wrong we were even followed out the door and told to never come back. Needless to say Thai house ahas lost a customer . I would encourage folks to co sided the moltirude of other fantastic Thai options on Scottsdale and not offer their patronage to the likes of the folks working here .
