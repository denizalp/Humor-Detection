I'm giving this place a 1 star because of their horrible lost and found services. Customer service was very rude when I had questions regarding my lost item.\n\nMy husband and I returned the rental vehicle and went to take the shuttle to the airport. We turned right back around as soon as I got onto the shuttle because I had left my daughters birth certificate in the rental car. This had taken less than 30 minutes of leaving the rental car, getting on the shuttle bus to the airport, and taking the shuttle right back to enterprise. As soon as we got back to enterprise, we were told that they could not locate the vehicle. In their words, \"they couldn't find the car.\"\n\nI How do you loose a car in less than 30 minutes of us dropping it off. I figured all we had to do was go straight to the vehicle since we had JUST dropped it off and pick up my forgotten item. I'm very disappointed in the way it was handled. I recognize that it was my mistake to leave my item but please enterprise, be more professional. Warning: don't leave anything in the rental vehicles or you will never get it back!
