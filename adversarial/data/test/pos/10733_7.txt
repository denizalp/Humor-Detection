I've been to My Buddies THREE times.  Each time I wanted to like it, each time I was severely let down.\n\nThe only pro is: the food is good.\nMy boyfriend and I live right up the street so the convenience of location could've made us regulars. But we aren't.\n\nOur first trip there was for a late lunch and to watch some football.  My boyfriends a packers fan and I'm a bears fan (boo, I know).  Anyway.  Our first waitress was good, she checked up on us regularly and understood we were there to watch the game.  Unfortunately her shift ended before the game was over so we closed our lunch bill with her and she handed us off to waitress #2.  With waitress #2 I ordered a beer.  About 15 minutes into her shift she was \"cut\" and asked if we'd close our bill with her and our next waiter or waitress would be over in a minute. REALLY?!  You want me to close my tab on ONE BEER.  I know they do this mostly so they can get their tip, but you're that desperate for a $1 tip?  The bill was $3.75 and I put a $5 in with the bill.  At this point I'm slightly irritated that I'm closing a second tab.  She comes back and says \"do you need change?\".. I said yes.  I don't like being asked, you're that lazy and ready to go that you can't walk an extra 10 steps to drop the change off?  I left her the $1.25 on the table.\nSo we left immediately after the game and didn't bother opening a third tab.\n\nThe second time was for a brewers game and packers game.  We headed down at the end of the baseball game (it's less than a minute away from us) probably around the 7th inning.  The packers game started at 3:15 that day.  Our waiter was good, he forgot our waters for about 15 minutes but no biggie he eventually remembered and he was extremely personable.  The brewers game ended at around 3.. and shortly after 3pm my boyfriend asked if they'd have the packers game on.  Whoever works the monitors clearly isn't trained well.  It wasn't until 3:20 that they finally got the packers game up.  I thought this was a sports bar? .. shouldn't they be on time with games?  He wasn't the only packers fan irritated by that.  Unfortunately again our good waiter was cut before half time.  We closed our tab with him and he said our new waitress would help us out.  This waitress happened to be waitress #2 for our first visit.  Let me say, she's the worst waitress ever.  She NOT ONCE checked on us.  She chatted it up with the table on our left for about 10 minutes, checked on the table to the right and never stopped to check on us.  In the mean time, I'm assuming it was a manager, yells across the dining room to the host \"Hey KYLE!  you aren't scheduled on Tuesday but could you be here for the meeting?\"  Seriously?  you're that lazy you cant get up and walk across the room to ask him?  WOW.  Needless to say, we left at the half.\n\nThe third time we went it was just for drinks somewhere around 930pm (maybe) on a saturday night.  We sat down at the pretty vacant bar.  The bartender was busy chatting with other employees who were off duty having a drink.  Once she finally noticed us she was nice, got us our beer and went back to her conversation.  The bar was dead.  They played poorly functioning music videos and went from 80's rock to really bad hip-hop.. weird choices.  They still had espn on one TV though.  We stayed for 3 beers each I believe and than decided the really annoying douchebag hitting on the off duty waitress & bartender was too irritating to listen to anymore.\n\nBut like I said, they have good food... however, we won't be back.
