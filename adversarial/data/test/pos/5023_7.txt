I traveled to Vegas with friends to celebrate our birthdays. So of course a spa day was on the agenda. We stayed at the Venetian which has a spa, but we balked at the prices. So we searched for other spas in Vegas but off the strip. We came across Serenity Spa and made appointments with Richie, who scheduled 4 of us to get spa treatments. On the same day! And he let us add enhancements to our treatments when we arrived. I had a hot stone massage and a scalp massage, both were very relaxing, and a wonderful facial that was so relaxing I fell asleep :).\n\nWe caught a cab to the WorldMark and that was about a 15-20 minute ride. But instead of catching a cab the WorldMark has a FREE shuttle that drops you off on the strip. \n\nOn top of the great spa experience, Richie recommended classy nightclubs and added us to the VIP list for one club. So if you're looking for an affordable\/enjoyable spa experience and hook-ups for great nightlife, Serenity Spa is the place to go.
