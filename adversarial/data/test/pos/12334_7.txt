So this was my first Cirque du Soleil. And since I was running the RnR Las Vegas Marathon, they had a pretty sweet deal and had tickets to the KA at 2 for $99. Since I went solo, I think I paid $64, which was still pretty good and with a pretty good seat too.\n\nI really didn't know what to expect walking in the theater; but it seemed  that you are expecting all of the theater would be part of the show with the giant towers, and dangling ropes so I was thinking to myself...this is gonna be cool.\n\nSo I was told that KA has a lot of acrobatic performances and a really great story line. I can totally see the acrobatic performances but I didn't get the story line. Maybe it was just me, but there seemed to be some good guys, then some bad guys taking over, then the good guys take over at the end. There were Asians, blacks and some Eskimos? so I couldn't figure it out...oh well.\n\nBut the performances by the artists were definitely top notch. With the super high tech stage that kept the audience guessing on what is going to happen made it more special. Lots of gravity defying stunts did make me go \"wow\" but it wasn't enough to compensate for the unknown story line.\n\nI guess this is a good intro to the Cirque du Soleil shows. I can't wait to see the next one. I guess they have a no photography policy, only at the end it is ok.
