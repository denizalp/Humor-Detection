Yay! I'm a fan. I had never eaten \nChick-Fil-A before and I have to say it was pretty damn good for some chikN. They close at 10 and it was almost 9:30 when we got there, but they were still really busy. The inside looked packed so we hit the drive thru. It was about 20 cars deep, but everyone told me it would go quick and they were not wrong! There were workers standing outside and taking orders and collecting payment so that definitely helped move things along. We waited about 10 minutes to get our food after ordering, but that's because we ordered well done fries. We ordered a regular chicken sandwich, spicy chicken sandwich, 2 large waffle fries, 2 sweet teas, a 12 piece nuggets and a large cookies n cream shake. Total for everything was $26. \n\nThe regular chicken sandwich was tasty, but a bit dry. I didn't realize it came with no sauce. The chicken is a real breast and it's a decent size. The bun was soft and buttery. It wasn't until I ate the nuggets that I tried the liquid crack AKA Chick-Fil-A sauce, and I thought they should put that on the sandwich. Whyyy they don't do that is beyond me. A buttery bun, juicy breast and crack sauce? Bomb! What are they waiting for??\n\nThe waffle fries I had asked to be well done, but they weren't at all. Still tasty though! I plan to eat more chikN here whenever I get the chance.
