definitely saved us from the disappointing playboy club. a few of us went up here to check out the deck and ended up bringing up the rest of our friends for the remainder of the night.\n\nthe retractable roof was cool, and the view of the strip awesome. i feel this place is mediocre most nights, but for us it was a perfect place to chill and have fun during our last night in vegas.\n\nthe following story has nothing to do with my review, but needs to be told:\n\na guy walked by my girl friend, slapped her ass - and proceeded to give her a dollar for the said slapping of ass. he later came back and asked for change (wow). the girls were obviously amused\/offended by this, but i kinda wanted to shake this guys hand for being so awesomely lame.
