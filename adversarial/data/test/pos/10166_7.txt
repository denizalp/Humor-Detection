First off it was hard to find. It's in front of Planet Hollywood and you can see the balcony of the upstairs bar from LV Blvd. but it was puzzling how to get to the main attraction from the street, you have to go up an escalator from the outside and then walk inside of like this souvenir mall. very strange. But once you see it you get excited. They have scary guys and zombie chicks walking around scaring people. \n\nThere's Bloody Mary's bar which had tasty drinks, overpriced, but what do you expect at a Vegas attraction BUT the one thing that reeeeeeally pissed me off is the $5 added tip! WTF?! I thought tipping was optional. Tipping is meant for someone doing a good job and earned it, not for a girl taking bottle caps off of 2 Bud bottles. ABSOLUTELY ridiculous.\n\nI honestly don't know how much the actual attraction costs, I got to go for free because my boyfriend's work gave them tickets, but from reading other people's reviews i cannot believe spending that much money to walk through a scary maze for 15 minutes.  I will say that I did enjoy it, it was fun, I got scared. It was more than just people popping out scaring you, there were actual murdering scenes and gross things going on, there seemed to be some interactive areas too.  I wish I had taken more time in each room to really appreciate more of it.  \n\nThe maze exits to the upstairs bar which had a $10 cover, AGAIN: RIDICULOUS but our friends wanted to sit out there so we did. They were replaying Hostel over and over again, which was cool i guess but the music out there... UGH! horrible trance\/dubstep remixes.. WTF?! play some scary music or something that relates to horror or at least some metal. really? Did Eli approve this? headache. \n\nWhen you leave the bar you walk back downstairs to the merch area which was decorated really cool and gory. I liked all the merch except there were no prices on anything.  They should fix that. I think people hate to have to ask how much everything is.\n\nOverall, pretty cool if you're willing to spend the cash or if you're just a big Eli fan.
