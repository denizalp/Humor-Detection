First time at this place as I participated in the CMYE event hosted by Kris for the Yelp GTA event, and I was pretty impressed. Usually bar and grills give me the impression that it is extremely loud, rowdy, and even a bit unclean, but this place was quite the opposite. It looked pretty classy and although the TV and music was on, it wasn't too loud that it would distract me from talking with others.\n\nService was very attentive, they were really quick in getting drinks and refills as well as giving us new clean plates halfway through. I liked their appetizers, none were too greasy, and was a fan of their sweet potato fries as well as their dips. Would definitely consider going back to this bar if I was in the area.\n\nSide note: They had pretty good music choices.
