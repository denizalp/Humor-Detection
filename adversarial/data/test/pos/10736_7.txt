Took advantage of the 7 for $27 underwear sale yesterday (which is awesome) but was never greeted, assisted while in the store, or thanked as I left. The cashier was really friendly though and even apologized when she asked who assisted me and I told her nobody. The store wasn't that busy, and since it was my first time in I was having a hard time figuring out where I should go. Lots of great products, but kind of average service at this location.
