Seems like everytime that I visit family in Montreal, we go to this Chinese restaurant.  This is our relatives favorite spot, and they always get plenty of food!  Got to admit that I do not know the names of most of the dishes.  I never get to order anything cause the family orders everything.  I just pig out!   Also, I can say that everything has been tasting really good!  Service has been great as well!\n\nI always look forward to family taking us here!  Clean restaurant, delicious food, and good service adds up to 4 stars!  Yes, I am a fan.
