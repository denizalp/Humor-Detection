I consider myself a god of chains... chain in the restaurant sense...  I really really like PF Changs.\n\nDid you know PF stands for Paul Fleming?\n\nDid you know the food is all gluten free??\n\nDid you know that PF Changs is the parent company of Pei Wei?  Hmmmmm????\n\nI Wikipedia'd 2 of those facts, I'm not that awesome.\n\n\nKung Pao Shrimp is the best I've ever had.  Service always fantastic.\n\nSea bass also very underrated dish.\n\n4 stars why?????  Because I think it's a tad over priced, just a tad.
