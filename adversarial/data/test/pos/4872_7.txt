While still recovering from the sheer chaos that was EDC 2014, the GF and I decided to do some trendy window shopping, which inevitably led us over to Gucci. What I hadn't expected was to be exiting this boutique with a brand-new pair of sneakers - and some fond recollections of one of the more satisfying experiences that I've ever had with high-end shopping.\n\nAll too often, many designer boutiques express an unwillingness to help customers who don't exhibit a certain look - unfortunately, while this \"cooler-than-you\" attitude can sometimes be subtle, sometimes it just isn't! Thankfully, the Via Bellagio Gucci doesn't suffer from this same drawback. \n\nMy girlfriend and I were greeted almost instantly after walking in the store, and we were free to window shop as we pleased, not having to worry about salespeople tracing our steps like vultures circling over a fresh kill. \n\nAfter briefly taking a look at Gucci's menswear selection, I made my way to the shoe collection - where I had the immensely good fortune of stumbling upon a pair of nubuck and calfskin mid-tops. Conveniently enough, I had been eyeing these kicks for some time - having seen them at several department stores in and around the LA area.\n\nEven more conveniently, they were being offered at 50% off at this boutique! I guess it just happened to be my lucky day. \n\nI requested to try on my size from a very helpful sales associate (her name was either Blanca or Bianca, can't quite recall), who brought out two different sizes for me - and in two different colorways. \n\nAfter quickly learning that Gucci sizing doesn't bear all that much similarity to Vans sizing (goes to show what I know, I guess), Blanca brought out some additional sizes for me, and even helped lace the shoes up, as well - I know, I know, I'm helpless. \n\nWith these adjustments, the items fit absolutely perfectly - but I still wasn't quite sure as to whether I'd be pulling the trigger just yet. I politely asked if I'd be able to fetch a pair of jeans out of my car in valet (as I had already begun forming some looks up in my mind), and the staff at Gucci obliged with no problem whatsoever. \n\nHaving made a couple quick adjustments to my outfit just a couple of minutes later, I came back, tried on the shoes, and knew that I was sold. The entire process was seamless, easy, and refreshingly unpretentious. Checkout was similarly effortless (although I guess you can't really expect a line of customers to build up at a Gucci boutique), and I felt particularly badass strolling through the Bellagio casino with a new brown shopping bag in tow...a feeling which quickly died out after seeing a lady with massive LV shopping bags on both arms.\n\nAll jokes aside, the overall level of quality with Vegas Gucci boutiques seems to be distinctly high (having recently had similar experiences at the Crystals branch). I'd gladly bring my business to this particular Gucci boutique in the future. \n\n*Tip:* This boutique doesn't have a changing room on-hand. While this may present a problem for female customers, I was thankfully given the opportunity to change my outfit in the back of the store - again, with no hassle at all!
