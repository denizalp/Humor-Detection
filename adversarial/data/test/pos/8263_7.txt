This was my first time here, I have a friend who loves this place and always brags about how great it is.  Another friend told me they had a Corned Beef special for St. Patrick's day and since we go on a quest every year to find the best places in town for Corned Beef and Cabbage, we decided to give them a shot.\n\nWe ordered a shrimp appetizer, crab cakes, and of course the Corned Beef Special.  Lets start with the Cajun style food, the shrimp dish was true to the Cajun style of spicy but was really good.  The Crab Cakes, WOW, the best I have ever had.  With all that being said there was no way the corned beef could not be good and it was better then good it was GREAT....very tender and tasty and really ranked among the best we have had.  There is only one other place out of the 7 we went to that added a really cool gravy to theirs, but overall it was amazing.  \n\nThe food here was so good we will be back not only for the food but for the friendliness of the staff as well.  Andy was our waiter and he was very patient knowing this was our first time here and was very helpful with suggestions.\n\nKendra the manager, one of the sweetest and kindest people I have ever met.  She was warm, friendly and just really showed me why this place has a staff with such a great attitude, it starts from her leadership.\n\nThis is a place we will come back to for the Cajun food and the prices are really fair.  I would highly recommend this place.....
