This place feels more like a mini-university than it does like a community college.  The range of classes offered is really amazing.  I know 2 generations of folks who've graduated from here (W\/ Associates before ASU) and someone who's a teacher here.  They have such a great class list.  Personally, it's their campus that does it for me.  It has a sense of history that the other stucco campuses will just never be able to capture.  And it is just me or didn't we all dream about going to some old ivy league school with brick walls and cool crisp breezes while we carried our books from class to class?  Ok, maybe it was just me.  But this place totally fits the bill - as much as any Phoenix community college can.
