A few years ago, there was a place here called Taiga serving up Thai and Japanese. Then they closed and were replaced by what we have now.\n\nTonight, I finally tried Table Thai Bar & Bistro, the \"new\" restaurant at this spot. They're much more focused on Thai food, with a little overlap into Chinese cuisine and possibly Vietnamese, and they seem to have impressed several of my Yelp friends. One of my friends from the Taiga era pulled up the listing when I said that I wanted to go somewhere new to write a review, although I probably would've insisted on something a bit fancier if I'd realized this would be my milestone 700th.\n\nThen again, I've always liked the more affordable and approachable restaurants, which Table Thai definitely is. They have two televisions that were set to Monday Night Football on ESPN, which tonight so happened to feature my hometown and favorite team the 49ers. The music is quiet piano\/instrumental stuff, which is relaxing and not at all bothersome. The servers were good and kept refilling our water.\n\nSince I was aware of the lunch specials, I deliberately avoided ordering items on that menu in anticipation of getting better value on possible future visits.\n\nFor an appetizer, we shared Duck Rolls ($8), which is basically two fresh-tasting spring rolls w\/ duck meat and a delicious sauce.\n\nFor my entree, I picked Pad See Eiw with beef ($10), which is definitely among the better renditions of that dish and has plentiful beef, some egg, and... wait, normal broccoli instead of Chinese broccoli? Well, it still gives the right veggie crunch, so it's not a terrible substitution, just an inexplicable one. My chosen spicy level of 1 (out of 5) was fairly subtle, and heat-tolerant eaters probably won't detect anything.\n\nMy friend ordered Crab Fried Rice ($15), which had tasty crab meat and fresh cherry tomato among other ingredients. He got it with a spicy level of 2, which was very noticeable but not sweat-inducing for me. It's not too greasy as far as fried rice goes, and I could see myself ordering it again after having had just a couple of bites.\n\nWe also shared a dessert, namely the seasonal Mango Sticky Rice ($7). Fresh, sweet mango and hot, sweet, glazed rice balls with a slightly crunchy topping (plus a couple of maraschino cherries for garnish) definitely hit the spot.\n\nYes, there will be future visits to Table Thai Bar & Bistro. It's a good (albeit very dim at night) restaurant with plenty of menu left to be explored. And yes, there will (hopefully) be 700 more reviews to come.
