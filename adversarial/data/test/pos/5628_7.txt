The street that I live on is sandwiched between two main drags in the city - one is mostly condominiums and apartments and the other is full of shops and restaurants.  \n\nScaramouche - snuck its way into one of the high-rises on the non-retail side of the sandwich in the early nineties - according to its d√©cor - and has not moved, or changed since.  This upscale, frozen in time restaurant, whose patrons seem to have aged (perhaps having undergone a few more facelifts than Scaramouche itself) with the establishment, has quality on its side.  The food is expensive but wonderful and the crowd is classic (and by that I mean old) Toronto snobbery at its best.  If you are young, yearning to spend money on excellent food and seeking to stick your nose up at those who are classically trained in proboscis promotion, then Scaramouche gives you that rare but lovely chance.
