It's a very nice, upscale gift shop that is open 24 hours for whatever you need while you're staying in the hotel.  Candy, Soda, Water, T-Shirts, Smokes, Shot Glasses, Bottle Openers, you know the standard tchotchky\/convenience store you find in a resort.  \n\nThis one is no different......useless stuff, high prices.....you know you're as guilty as me and buy stuff from these places from time to time.....that's when you kick yourself for forgetting the toothpaste and spend $7 for a tube the size of your thumb that will last 1 trip.  Gotta love it!\n\nReturn Factor - 80%
