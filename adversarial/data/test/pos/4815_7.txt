Wonderful! Splendid! Spectacular!\n\nI know the big Yelp 2018 party is only a week a way, but as of writing this review the event at Eddie V's last night stands as my all time favorite Yelp Elite Event. \n\nWalking in you immediately get a sense for just how nice Eddie V's is. A fine dining establishment to be sure, it used to be a bank before they moved in this past spring, but you probably wouldn't know from looking. A multi-tier dining room with a bar upstairs and private rooms downstairs you'd think it was designed custom just for them. Clean table settings, exquisite wait staff and a wonderful sense of style throughout the restaurant all added to the experience.  \n\nDownstairs to one of the private rooms we went  and the whirlwind of flavor began.\n\n A refreshing drink to begin the evening, the bartender said it was their version of \"The Bees Knees\" made with ginger, honey and gin. Slightly sweet with a little bite, I enjoyed it so much I had two by the end of the evening. Hors d'oeuvres were next with cheese and crackers, tiny crisps topped with fresh tuna and bruschetta with fresh tomato. Light bites to wet appetites. Then waiters started bringing out the real stars. \n\nTwo massive pieces of meat came out and a waiter began to slice off the most tender Prime Rib I've ever seen. \n\nThen there were the crispy, sweet and spicy Kung Pao Fried Shrimp. \n\nThen we have what I'm calling \"The Big 2\". The last two items were easily my favorite foods of the evening, some of the best things I've ever eaten and I honestly don't know if I could pick a winner between them. One was the Filet Mignon Slider, the other was the Crab Cake. \n\nThe Filet Slider was beyond excellent. Never in my life have I eaten a piece of meat that thick that was so damn tender. People say an expertly cooked steak melts in your mouth, but this was the first time I can say I've actually experienced that phenomenon. The meat was perfectly seasoned and was accompanied by what I believe was a tiny piece of arugula and a small bit of blue cheese, sandwiched between a toasted, buttered bun. If all of that wasn't amazing enough, even though this was called a slider there was almost enough meat to call it a filet mignon burger. Might be the best steak I've ever eaten. \n\nThen the Crab Cake. Splendid. These were mini versions of the giant crab cakes on the main menu, but they were still almost two inches across and an inch thick. The waitress who brought them around said there was no filler in them at all. They were 100% crab meat (presumably with a little something to bind it together) with just the tiniest panko crust on the edge and a little drop of spiced tartar sauce on top. incredibly well seasoned, flaky not chewy, just a bit of crisp on the outside. I can confidently say it was the best crab cake I've ever eaten. \n\nEddie's knocked it out of the park. Every single thing I tasted was delicious and the restaurant looked fabulous and unique. The staff gave us a hell of an experience and that was all while scrambling from a gas leak taking out their kitchen. Huge thank you to Nikki for setting things up and to everyone at Eddie V's for a phenomenal evening!
