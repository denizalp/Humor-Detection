Ever since I was a food judge at the Culinary Festival and tasted the frozen yogurt from Yogurtology, I've been waiting for the day they opened a location in Old Town. Now that they have, what do I have to say? \"The snosberries taste like snosberries!\" Yes, I definitely felt like I was acting out a scene from Super Troopers when I ate this frozen yogurt. Why? Because the yogurt here actually tastes exactly like the flavor they claim it is. I'm not talking about these flavors tasting like the \"frozen yogurt version\" of the flavor, I'm talking about the \"close your eyes and you would never know the different from the real thing\" frozen yogurt flavors. \n\nAs I describe the following tastes, I note a disclaimer: It reads silly that I say the flavor tastes like the flavor, but just go and taste this fro yo yourself and you'll see what I'm talking about. \n\nThe oatmeal cookie tastes like you're biting into a cookie. Not frozen yogurt, an actual cookie. \n\nThe peanut butter tastes like you took a spoonful of peanut butter and put it in your mouth. \n\nThe rootbeer tastes like you took a sip of rootbeer from a straw. \n\nYou get the picture. \n\nIn addition, the toppings here are some of the most massive ones I've seen anywhere...and I have seen my fair share! They have full twix bars, chunks of Snickers, S'mores size marshmallows, jumbo gumballs, sour gummy straws ... the list goes on and on and on!
