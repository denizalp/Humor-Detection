I have always wanted to check this place out and FINALLY got to do it this morning! \n\nProbably shouldn't have chosen a Sunday morning to finally come here, but it's my birthday today and I wanted to do it! We walked thru the door and were quoted a 20 minute wait. It was more like 25, but thats okay. It gave us time to take in the place and let our appetite swell.\n\nThe inside is very retro(which if you know me at all, you know I LOVE!) They have the purple and pink tubing running all thru the interior, with some artificial trees hanging over the boothes. It was pretty frickin cool! They have TV's set about the place with some screen shots of different locations around the world. This was a bit wierd as it went from Bahamas(sweet!) to weeds in Beatty, Nv (???). Didn't exactly make sense, but still kinda cool.\n\nWe are seated in our booth and a guy comes to get our drink order. I order a Sierra Mist and my friend a water. They very promptly bring us 2 waters.lol okay. The waitress chuckled when I told her this and brought out my soda. No harm, no foul. Waitress is very nice and very attentive, which is especially appreciated considering how slammed they are during this time.\n\nI ordered the Masarati Omelette(12.95) and my friend ordered the Peppermill Omelette(also 12.95). Those things were freaking huge! lol They both came with an order of hash browns and toast. Damn, they were really tasty! Mine had ham and musrooms and tons of american and peperjack cheese in it with some Marinara sauce on the top. It was very different from any kind of omelette I had ever tried before and I must say it was scrumptious! \n\nThis was such a great experience and I can't wait to come back and try different things on the menu and check out the Fireside Lounge one of these days!\n\n4 solid stars.
