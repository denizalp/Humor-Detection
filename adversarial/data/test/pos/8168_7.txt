Great, knowledgeable and friendly service: first the nice manboy (not sure how old he is... looked like a baby, acted like a polite adult) was awesome in making sure I was buying the best helmets for my kids.  He went in and out of their stock room several times to get it all correct.  Secondly, he asked if I needed boxes (I didn't have to arm wrestle him for them!) and he was genuinely excited when he found out I was Santa(they loaded all my Christmas loot into my sleigh that looks like a Suburban).   They also have the cutest chocolate lab that is in here on occasion.  Seriously, who does not love the beautiful face and aggressive wagging of the tail of a lab?    This place has all the snow and skateboard gear one might need.  Great priced helmets for skating and skiing, great penny board selection.  \n\nThe Tom's, Ugg, Sanuk and Rainbow shoe selection is insane.  Seriously, blows Nordstrom out of the water... kids and adult sizes!  And Sanuks are hard to find... my husband loves them and so does my brother in law (who is a surgeon and on his feet all day).  They are also hip without being hipster :)  But, with skinny jeans could def fall into the hipster category!
