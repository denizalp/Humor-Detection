Firstly I want to mention that we 2 daughters and we've frequented this store a lot over the past few years because we like to stop in when we go to Trader Joe's. The staff there is  friendly except for \"grandma\" who works there-- she has an attitude and has been curt to both my wife and daughter (maybe she just doesn't want to be there?). Regardless, the prices are reasonable, and the selection is good, and that is why we return. However, several times we taken in items for trade they have give us very little in trade amount, even though they claim to give 1\/2 of the resales price. This is not true, a LIE. Recently I brought in 9 items (in which they took all): 3 pairs of shoes (that were like new), and a NWT Gymboree skirt, a toddler dress with matching cape, 2 T-shirts, a new swimsuit, and a baby sling. They gave me $12 in trade for everything (which is $24.00 selling price). Ok fine, I took it... in retrospect I wish I hadn't. I returned a few weeks later and saw the skirt on the sales floor priced at $8.00, and one pair of shoes priced at $12. I did not see any of the other items, but don't tell me they priced the 7 other items for a combined total of $4. I was (and am) absolutely furious. I always take in beautiful, practically unworn items to this store and this was not the first time I felt they had gypped me on the trade (I am doing the math here). I will not be bring my items for trade here anymore, instead I will take them to Once Upon a Child or Kid to Kid instead. I don't even know if I will even do much shopping here anymore. I will use my $12 store credit but them I don't think I'll be patronizing this business any longer. Too bad for you Love Child, we have been faithful and loyal customers but you should be honest to your customers because we keep you in business and believe me people are not stupid, no one likes to be swindled.
