I have eaten a lot of vegetarian food (being veg myself), and a lot of Thai\/\"Asian fusion\", and this is among the best of the best. Sure, it may be a bit pricier than most Chinatown fare, but dishes are always prepared fresh from scratch (so yes, you might have to wait a bit for your food - it's not fast food, people!) and the portions are generous. \n\nI've probably eaten here about 30-odd times, along with my meat-eating bf and friends. I loved 668 when it was in its dingier digs years ago, and I still love it in its fancier abode. Quality is always amazing and dishes are consistent - we definitely have our favourites. Best to dine in with a friend or small group so you can share a couple of dishes, or if you prefer take-out, you'll definitely have enough for leftover lunch the next day. \n\nI can't comment on the entire menu, as it's pretty extensive, though I wouldn't fault them for having a few less-than-stellar items. I generally prefer the non-mock-meat dishes (though I'm generally not a fan of fake meat anywhere), though they do the mock-meat pretty well. Best of the best: fried eggplant (with coconut curry or black bean sauce), coconut ginger soup, café 668 salad, spicy fried coconut tofu, coconut fried tofu (there might be a theme here!) and curry delight noodles. Personally, I don't find any of their \"spicy\"-indicated dishes spicy, though I do have a bit of a spicy tooth (is that a thing?). \n\nI also have a soft spot for the owner\/server (husband of the chef, who co-runs the place) who may be a bit rough around the edges, but is really quite sweet and funny. The couple have clearly invested a lot into the restaurant, and I hope that they stay in business for another 20 years. A tip for people finding the service gruff: try being friendly :) \n\nFinally, I really can't fathom the negative reviews on here (and question people who've admittedly never eaten here giving 1-star reviews - it's not really fair to the restaurant or to people looking for legit reviews). Café 668 is the real deal - I highly recommend it!
