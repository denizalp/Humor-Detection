BEWARE. TATTOO artist TOMMY GUNZ is a FRAUD. He only knows how to do cheap childrens tattoos. Tommy will tell you what you want to hear so he can take your $. He will even say it will look better than your design. Tommy will also do everything he can so you do not know the truth, until he has finished. He does not tell you that he has to change your design because he does not know how to do it. He does not let you approve his changes before he starts because he does not let you know the truth that he is a fraud. What Tommy will do, is get mad if you ask him about his outline. He does this so you do not know he is a fraud. He does not ask you where you want your tattoo placed either. Even if the tattoo is in the picture in a certain place, he still places it where he wants. He does not even have your design with him when he does your tattoo, so he can try to do the design you have given him. After he is finished you have to check it because he will forget to put all the coloring in until you tell him. He does not communicate with his customers on anything. And after he is done he does not tell you what to do to protect it, unless you ask him and his aftercare advise is not correct either. DO NOT LET TOMMY GUNZ GIVE YOU A TATTOO. Beware of TOMMY GUNZ.
