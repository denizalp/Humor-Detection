Overall review notes: Don't bother.\n\nThere are several choices at the Container Park when it comes to food, we happened to pick this one. The place smelled amazing! The line was forever long, that's a good sign right? ... how could this place only have a 2.5 star rating?!? That's what I kept telling myself as I stood in line for what felt like a lifetime. When the bf got to the counter we realized what was causing the wait. The one, count them one person working the register was a young girl who was seriously either high as a kite or hung over. She was forever slow and had no enthusiasm or urgency to place the order.\n\nOnce we placed our order the food came out relatively fast, but it was awful! I can honestly say it's the worst BBQ I've ever had - including my own burnt BBQ at home. It was such a disappointment because it all looked so good!\n\nThe Pulled Pork Sandwich ($8.95 with 1 side) - the bun was wet and soggy on the bottom, from i don't know what, probably being frozen at some point. There was almost no BBQ sauce on it, definitely not enough to cover the meat. I didn't even eat the bun, and had only 1\/2 of the pork.\n\nThe Baked Beans - looked amazing, but were not sweet or smoky at all. I can't put my finger on what they tasted like, cardboard maybe??\n\nThe Potato Salad - bland, almost no flavor.\n\nThe Mac and Cheese - not creamy, not very cheesy, mostly just tasted like noodles. Bleh.\n\nThe BF ordered the 2 meat plate with Beef Brisket and Chicken. his meat had almost no BBQ either. We got extra on the side and had to keep pouring it on. But even the BBQ sauce is just meh. \n\nReally, just don't bother. It's not worth the time or the money, or the calories. we didn't eat half of any single item.
