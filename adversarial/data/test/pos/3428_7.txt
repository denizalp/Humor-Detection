Wow! This was the absolute most underwhelming tour I have ever had the displeasure to pay for. The actual size of this place is small, and the number of signs was not very impressive. The tour guides can't even act like they enjoy giving the tour. And don't get me started on the location. There is nothing even remotely close to the this place. Not even a freaking McDonalds. I do not recommend this place for tourists.
