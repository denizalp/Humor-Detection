I experienced better buffet, especially at Wicked. The variety was very limited in my opinion. The dessert was not as much as Wicked. I don't see why this is the best buffet, as it cost almost $40 for dinner, it's just a dollar cheaper on Sun-Thur vs Fri-Sat. \n\nThe only good thing I liked was the veggies, but other than that, carving station was small, barely any chinese food, indian or greek. There was italian, but very very little. I think this buffet is more of a healthy buffet because they had a lot of veggies like salads.\n\nDessert was snot great, it was either super sweet or just not good. I only liked the passion fruit tapioca, but discarded the passion fruit because it was too sweet. The raspberry cheesecake in a cup jar was good because it was light. \n\nI don't think you should come here if you're expecting larger variety. The flavor wasn't bad, but go to Wicked instead.
