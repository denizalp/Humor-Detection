YO ADRIAN!    Coming from the SF Bay, I have high standards when it comes to my hair. I have really thick \"Asian Boy\" hair which resembles that of Mogli from the Jungle Book.  \n\nI took for granted the art of a good haircut until I moved to AZ and got JACKED UP by countless barbers. \n\nJust as I was about to give up and go all  \"Miley Cirus\" on my hair , I found Adrian on a total fluke. \n\nAdrian was welcoming and listened really well to what I wanted and executed the haircut flawlessly. Needless to say, I have been a regular of his ever since. Adrian is hands down, the best in Phoenix.\n\n\nPS. \nThe owner is super cool and the folks working the front desk always welcome you with a beautiful smile!
