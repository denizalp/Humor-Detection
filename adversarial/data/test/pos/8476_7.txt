Always purchase more then I attended.\n\n\nI shop at Sprouts Farmers Market occasionally for seasonal or specialty items, but always walk out with more than I intended to purchase. \n\nSprouts offers  a variety of specialty products, and  has a wide selection of everday grocery needs. The prices at Sprouts are competitive to what you would pay at your local chain grocery store. What I like most about Sprouts is their selection of organic, and gluten-free items.  \n\nI am always impressed by the freshness and quality of the produce department. As well as the meat and deli departments. I also like the prepared foods department, it's hard to resist when you go by.\n\nThe staff at Sprouts  are all very friendly, and more then happy to  help you find what you are looking for.
