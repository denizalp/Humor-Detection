Allyoucaneat wings!! Ok, now that I have your attention. I wasn't kidding about AYCE. It's about 12 bucks per person. And the wings must've came from baby turkeys, because they're unbelievably huge!! So, if you ever felt like you weren't getting enough.. Try chicken bonz. \n\nIt's kinda hidden in the industrial area of south Decatur. So keep an eye out for it.\nI only give it four stars because some of the wings were dry inside. At least they have those shoestring fries. But they do charge extra for more ranch -__-\n\nOverall I await the day to take all my big guy cousins who are madly in love with anything wings.
