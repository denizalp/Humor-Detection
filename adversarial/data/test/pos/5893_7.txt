Waste of money.   Pay $$$$ to wait in lines for everything and pay prices higher than in the clubs on the strip. \n\nGot there on Friday night for the first night of rock.  No line to get in, Nice.   Went to the bathroom first,  30 min line,  then went to put money on the stupid rf chip bracelet,  waited another 30 min,  then went to get food,  waited another 15-20 for a $9 slice of pizza.   Beer was $9 but I was so fed up with waiting I didn't want to stand in another line for that.  So mad I left and went to the strip without seeing the concert.   On the strip,  $3 drinks in the stores,  no line.  Now I'm just waiting for rock on Rio to charge me $3.50 to refund the $100 I was going to spend there but decided not too after it took me 2 hours to use the bathroom and get a slice of pizza without even seeing much of the concert.
