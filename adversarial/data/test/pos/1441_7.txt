Probably my favorite breakfast spot. Depending on my mood, this is how it's done, eggs are either over easy or poached:\nShrimp enchiladas -- red and green chile\nHuevos Rancheros  -- red and green chile\nCarne Adovada  -- red only \n\nLately, it's been a lot of enchilada, though I feel the huevos rancheros starting a resurgence!\n\nBreakfast entrees are about $10 -12 and worth every penny.
