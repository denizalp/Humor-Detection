Yelps 365 Review Challenge - Los Angeles #1 - #365\n\n\nThe Henry is just another one of those 24\/7 strip cafés  with an upscale modern feel. \n\nI was staying at the Cosmopolitan and was craving some a juicy hamburger and thought about , \"The Henry.\" Having a 24\/7 café is crucial in your Vegas hotel, if you want to avoid walking outside looking for a Denny's or some other late night diner.  \n\nBut anyways, like other reviews has pointed out, this restaurant is always packed and the service was outstanding! \n\nItems I've ordered here:\n\n+ $19: Signature Short Rib Benedict - braised short ribs, hollandaise, crispy potatoe cakes = Phenomenona!\n\n+ $18: The Henry Breakfast - ham, sunny side eggs, breakfast potato, toast = Delish!\n \nThey're located right next to the strip across from Bond, Chandelier Bar and just a few steps away from the strip. I'd eat here again if I'm staying in the Cosmopolitan or nearby with a empty stomach. Also, charge it to the room, so you can earn points for your Identity player's card.
