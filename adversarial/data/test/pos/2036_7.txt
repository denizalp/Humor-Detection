This was the right decision when it comes to brick oven pizza in Arizona. The wait was only 30 minutes and the pizza was so much better than the well known and televised local competition (let's just call them pizza B). The ambiance was fantastic and it was the perfect date spot for the wife and I to sit back and relax. They even had a local musician playing live music to even better the mood for dinner. Service was fantastic and every part of our dinner made the wife and I happy about our dinner choice.\n\nLet me start by saying everything I ordered was perfect.\n\nThe ostra salad was plenty as a starter for the wife and I and it was fresh with fantastic tasting ingredients.\nThe diavola spicy pizza with ricotta added was the best pizza I have ever had.\nMy wife's white pizza was fantastic as well it had mushrooms greens and pork I believe on it\nThe banana creepes with Nutella and ice cream was oh so yummy.\nThe fresh made iced tea was also unique and fantastic.\n\nWe left with a 3 course meal for around $60 which is not bad at all for the experience and food we received\n\nI would most defiantly recommend this restaurant to anyone.
