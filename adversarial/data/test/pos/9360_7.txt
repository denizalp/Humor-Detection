Stepping inside you would notice the shine, gloss and dark lighting as with any high end Thai place. I felt a little claustrophobic as the restaurant was tiny. There were few waitress running around but no one was taking care of the front table. The waitress handling the bar had to come down the long around way to come to me waiting at the door. Not so good to make your customers waiting. I was too tired that day to eat at the restaurant so I ordered by phone and the person on he other said my order would be ready in 20 mins. I reached the restaurant after 25 minutes and ended up waiting 25 more minutes till they cooked up my batch. No one offered me a table or chair to sit while I wait, so I invited myself over to an empty table and sat down.\n\nThe food finally came and I took home the red curry and fried rice. It wasn't so great - the fried rice seemed like brown rice but what I actually wanted was White rice. The Red curry was okay but not the best. After all my experience with Hibiscus didn't go well.\n\nMay be the dine in customers would hold a different opinion owing to the incredible star rating it has now!
