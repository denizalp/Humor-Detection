There are two Burger King's that I generally visit when I'm at the Airport in Vegas.....one in the C Gates area and the other is in the A\/B Gate area.  This review is for both of them......\n\nThey're always busy, so it's not always guaranteed that you can \"grab n go\" with the food.  The seating area in the C Gate area can also get very busy.....the seating at the other location is usually open because the customers at the A\/B Gate location usually get their food and go to their gate since it's at a fork between the 2 gate areas and there's still a 2-3 minute walk to the actual gate.  Keep that in mind if you're planning to grab a bite before your flight.\n\nThe food is.....well, it's fast food and doesn't taste any different than the locations outside of the airport, just realize the cost is 50% higher.  The service level is decent, not great.\n\nOverall, it's a solid place to grab a quick bite and deserves the 3 Star rating in my book.\n\nReturn Factor - 70%
