About every other day on my way into work I have a choice to make. Do I make a right and go to Mickey D's for a sausage mcmuffin with egg, then have to wait at the light to cross over the traffic at Deer Valley. Or do I make a left on 23rd then right into the Wendy's parking lot for a new Artisan Sausage sandwich? The first time I made that decision I felt like going to catholic confession. \"Dear Father, forgive me for I have sinned. It has been 24 years since my last confession. I cheated on my favorite fast food breakfast today...\" After that day, I always drive by and wave at the relationship with McDonalds that I kicked to the curb for the hotter better breakfast fast food. The sandwich is awesome, soft artisan bread with fresh cracked egg (yoke still intact) asiago cheese and a \"not greasy\" sausage patty and hollandaise sauce. The potatoes are country style wedges with the skin still on them. The coffee rivals' dunkin doughnuts and the drive through is super efficient. Can you believe that they actually take the time to look at my CC and thank me by name? Before you go out to your local Wendy's in search of breakfast bliss, check to see if they serve the new menu items. I have driven 15 miles off course and to three restaurants looking for the new menu items in the east valley. Not all restaurants carry the new breakfast menu. \n\nMcDonalds I am filing for divorce and I want alimony for all those years that you could have provided me a healthier better tasting breakfast sandwich. My breakfast lawyer will be contacting you soon.
