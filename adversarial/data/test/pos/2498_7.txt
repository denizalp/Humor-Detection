I picked them because I've dealt with plenty of a$%h@#$@ car rental companies and didn't want to deal with anymore and was willing to pay more to avoid the hassle of being up-sold stuff I didn't want.\n\nGuess what?\n\nI still got the talk and got convinced to upgrade my car because they thought my small suitcases wouldn't fit into an economy.\n\nI hate big cars.  Like if they offered me a BMW to drive for the same price, I'd be like \"No, I want the small car, I'm terrible at parallel parking and I would like to not returned a dinged up BMW.\"\n\nBut if it's a matter of fitting in luggage, I need my luggage (which is pretty minimal since it's a hiking trip and I'm only from CA for a few days), so I was like fine, give me an upgrade.\n\nI went into the pick up area and surprise!  There wasn't even an economy car left.  I went back and was like \"Reverse this upgrade charge, there's no economy car so I would have had to upgrade for free anyways.\"\n\nIt's a three stars because they did reverse the charge and I didn't have problems after.  I checked out the economy cars of the competitors too and guess what else?  There was plenty of space for my carry-on luggage with an economy.  Even if there was just a backseat area, I would have been fine.  They made it seem like I was getting a tiny SmartCar with economy.
