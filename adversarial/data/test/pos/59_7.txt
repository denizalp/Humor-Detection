Not one, but TWO oyster happy hours. Insert slow clap here. That's right, $1 oysters (from Sea Level, NC) Monday through Saturday from 4-7pm AND 10pm to midnight. I love to come here after Hornets games for oysters and ros√®. I make sporting events classy, y'all. \n\nI primarily come here for oysters, but if I'm looking for more I usually get the corn fritters or the lobster roll. I'm a sucker for lobster rolls and this one is fresh and delicious. Again, shout out to Kseniya M for the corn fritters rec. I would've never thought to order those here and they are so good. The catfish reuben is pretty unique and tasty. You can also place orders online to pick up. \n\nThe patio is a nice spot to people watch. I personally enjoy sitting in front of the raw bar so I can watch them prep the oysters. I find it fascinating. How on earth are they able to crank through so many and not cut themselves?!\n\nFree parking alert: Sea Level validates for the Hearst Tower deck, so make sure you bring your parking ticket in with you.
