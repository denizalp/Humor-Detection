This place used to be Wadi Foods Lebanese supermarket but they revamped it and made it into a huge restaurant. I pass by this place on the road everyday going home from work and have seen the construction progress.\n\nAfter work one day, I parked and went inside to get a flyer so my co-workers could order Friday. There was so much space in there with a playground gym for kids. The flyer had an extensive menu with lots of full colour pictures and selection.\n\nThis morning I called 5 minutes after opening, 11:05 AM and the person on the other line picked up. This was for delivery and there were 11 different orders for lunch take-out delivery. The duration of the call was 15 mins. It was long and I had to repeat my order several times, which was okay because they are a new establishment and wanted to give them a chance.\n\nUnfortunately, they only took cash for deliveries at the moment and had to call me back in a few minutes to find out the full price of the order and asked how long it would take. I think they take credit card if you are eating there.\n\nIt had been an hour. The delivery man called my cell phone and was lost. Our building was hard to find so I directed him to it. When he came to the building he had a smile and was trying his best to get the food to us quickly. We paid him the money and we proceeded on.\n\nHe called us back stating that they forgot the garlic sauce and hummus and would be back to our office in 7 minutes. I called him back because they forgot one order of wings. He arrived and he gave his sincere apologies on missing the orders.\n\nEverybody had their food (pizza, shawarma, stromboli) and really, they all said the same thing. The food was alright\/okay. Nothing out of this world. Some said, \"meh\". I had a chicken shawarma sandwich and poutine which as okay. The poutine tasted like something from Costco which I did not mind much.\n\nAfter it was all said and done, I went to calculate the total. They had a primitive receipt system and there were only prices on it and not descriptions. I had to manually cross reference the totals with each order which was time consuming.\n\nThere seems to be extra charges not accounted for. I am going to go to the place after work to see how the totals were calculated.\n\nThis place is brand-spanking new. We will probably give it a little more time to pick up and get better. Who knows? It has a lot of potential. Go head and try it and see what you think!
