Mirage made a huge mistake by closing kokomos and opening this place.. hostess was an air head..steak was cooked wrong, the server was rude and too pushy. I know this place is new, but it seems now a days, management is more concerned on the look, than the actual service and quality. Way over priced. Can ge a better meal for half the price without the aragence.
