I just found a gem of a restaurant hidden in plain sight, and it is McCall's Heartland Grill.  Comfortable and appealing to look at in a contemporary dining room, and at the lower end of Strip restaurant prices, the food was well executed and delicious.  A complimentary Bread Basket contained a variety of baked goods, including a cute miniature roll, cheesy cracker-style bread, and a spicy breadstick, along with both regular butter and a tin of wonderful sweet butter.  An ordered appetizer of very good hot Bacon-wrapped Prawns furnished something else tasty to eat.\n\nA very good small ceramic vat of French Onion Soup Gratinee au Gratin featuring well-caramelized onions and an ample topping of well-melted Gruyere Cheese was next up for me, while Diane loved her cup of Potato Soup, the soup du jour.  A service error resulted in presentation of a rather large Chopped Salad to me and one of my table mates, although we had both requested a Garden Salad, which was $4.00 cheaper and I assume less bountiful.  Plus, I had requested Orange Miso Dressing, and just before arrival of our entrees our server apologetically informed me that he was informed that no such dressing was available this night, and neglected to tell me earlier because of waiting on another table.  So, quite belatedly I selected Bleu Cheese Dressing instead.  But now, as a direct result of the delay in alerting me about the need to select a different salad dressing, a Chopped Salad was laid before me only about 2 minutes ahead of the entree, and I had to eat my salad concurrently with a Loaded Baked Potato and an 8 oz. Charred Filet Mignon.  Moreover, because no one in my party had ever eaten here before, we did not know what the restaurant's version of a Garden Salad looked like.\n\nBut the more complex Chopped Salad that I was served was impressive, including thin Potato Sticks, wedges of avocado, Black Olive halves, pieces of tomato, mushrooms, mixed greens, and a creamy Bleu Cheese Dressing.  And my Baked Potato with butter, chives, and pieces of actual bacon was well prepared.\n\nAs for my Charred Filet, I asked that it be only lightly charred and cooked medium rare, and my wishes were fulfilled on both counts.  With a deep-fried mushroom on top and deep-fried Onion Ring on the bottom, the steak was buttery and excellent in all respects, and further enhanced by an off-menu specially requested drinkable Bearnaise Sauce, Mushroom Sauce, and Red Wine Reduction Sauce.\n\nWhen the checks came, they each listed a Chopped Salad rather than the less expensive Garden Salad, but the manager changed the charges to reflect what we had actually ordered instead of what we unwittingly ate, which was a nice but probably appropriate gesture.  Service was otherwise sound and attentive.\n\nI will definitely return here--sooner rather than later.  4-1\/2 earned stars overall!
