Schmear-licious.\n\nI come here just to buy their schmears. Love the whipped ones and all the different flavors. My favorite has to be the herb, the second being the sun dried tomato. \n\nTheir sandwiches are pretty tasty as well. Good amount of meat. Lots of schmear. Perfect size.\n\nBeware if you come in the morning give yourself some time to get your bagels because it can be really packed.
