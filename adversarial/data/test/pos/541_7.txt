Shhhh!  Can you please not tell anyone about this mall?  It is one of my favourites in Calgary because no one seems to know about it.  While it does feature a lot of big box stores (winners, future shop, best buy, walmart), it has a long of smaller business in it too. The best part is of course that it is never, ever busy.   Seriously, have come here a week before Christmas and it is still empty!\n\nIf the tweens of Chinook and the strollers of Market Mall are too much to handle, then you should check out Northland.  But just don't tell anyone!
