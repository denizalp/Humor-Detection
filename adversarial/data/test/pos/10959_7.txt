I've been twice already and truth be told, I will probably go back this weekend.\nAnd if I am being even more honest, this will probably be a local spot for me this summer.\n\nLet's talk about texture. It's somewhere between ice cream and shaved ice.Yes, some of it is a little bit icy and not as smooth as I anticipated but I found that if I let it sit for a minute and relax and enjoy what I was eating that it slowly all came together and I truly did get a smooth and creamy ice.\n\nI did not have any problems with it becoming a pool of melted goodness either. Upon my first visit, I took my order to go and drove back to work (Tropicana & Russell) with no AC on and it survived. Slightly melted, and I mean slightly.\n\nMy first visit I thought I thought I could handle a Sumo but my belly looked like a sumo when I was done eating it. I was full, full, full!!! But it was so delicious I couldn't stop. I had bought a taro with red bean paste, rainbow mochi, and popping pearl. \n\nMy second visit, I brought my man and kiddo so they could experience the goodness for them self. My man was instantly hooked and hasn't stopped talking about this place. \n\nThis time I knew better so I ordered the ninja sizes. He went with the Bruce Tea (#4) on their menu - green tea snow cream with mochi, red bean paste, popping pearls and condensed milk. I enjoyed the taro so much I ordered it again. This time with red bean, green apple jelly, popping pearl and condensed milk. I know, I know, I didn't change it up much. But why fix something if it is not broken?\n\nWe ended up switching because he liked my combo of toppings more. I also really enjoyed the green tea flavor. It truly tasted like green tea. Nice.
