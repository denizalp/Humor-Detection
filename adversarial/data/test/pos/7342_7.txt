Resting above the valley on the 6th floor of the Palms Place down at the farthest reaches of the seemingly endless Sky Tube, Cafe 6 is a lonely place.  My friend and I went one Tuesday evening a couple of weeks ago.  I was shocked to see the restaurant completely empty.  There wasn't even a hostess.  Just a sign inviting us to seat ourselves.  Why did I even make a reservation?  It seems it was all in vain.\n\nBesides being completely devoid of customers, aside from my friend and myself, this restaurant has space that is being horribly under utilized. From what I understand, there used to be another establishment here. One that offered a greater variety. As for Cafe 6, it is a faux high end place selling gourmet pub fare at gourmet prices. This space is not suited for such a menu. A nice, albeit secluded, location with a beautiful crystal clear pool just on the other side of a thin pane of glass does not deserve waffle fries and overloaded messy burgers which are served in an undersized basket that does nothing to keep the tables clean.\n\nIt is these very burgers that I am a fan of at Cafe 6.  I eat a lot of burgers and the one I had here was one of the best in three consecutive days of a burger binge.  I ordered the Dr. Pepper Shroom Burger.  The pattie was thick and fresh and cooked to a perfect medium.  The portabello pieces were in absolutely every bite and some even fell out into the basket below where they waited patiently for me to rescue them.  The cheese was gooey and oh so good.  I could have done without the dijon mustard but that is just a taste preference rather than a criticism of what Cafe 6 has created.  And the waffle fries on the side were the perfect vehicle to break up the richness of the burger.  They were served with a house made spicy ketchup.  It was not unlike a cocktail sauce though it was a different spice than from horseradish.  I enjoyed it so thoroughly I asked for more.\n\nWhat is a once-in-a-blue moon dinner without dessert?  I ordered the banana split on this night (which was coincidentaly a few days after a blue moon).  Vanilla, strawberry and chocolate ice creams were hidden beneath heaps of whipped cream, wafer sticks, chocolate swizzles and a cherry.  On the sides were two halves of a banana that had been coated with sugar and bruleed to caramelize them into a crispy sweet treat.  I was reminded of bananas foster without the booze (tear).  Eating this pushed me over the edge and I decided it was time to call it a night.\n\nI want to like Cafe 6 but I just don't know if it is going to last.  If a Tuesday evening between 6:00 and 8:00 is any indication, they likely wont make it too long.  I hope I'm wrong because the staff is friendly and the food is amazing.  They don't deserve to be tossed aside and overlooked.
