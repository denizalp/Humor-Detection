OMG! THE MUSIC IS SO LOUD! NO REALLY! YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T HEAR ME OVER THE LOUD MUSIC SO I'LL SAY IT AGAIN-- THE MUSIC IS SO LOUD!!! \n\nWHAT? WHAT DID YOU SAY? WHAT DID I ORDER? IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE THE WAITRESS COULDN'T HEAR ME OVER THE LOUD MUSIC!\n\nSeriously. Had a reservation, got seated, and quite literally the waitress had a hard time taking our party of four orders BECAUSE THE MUSIC WAS SO LOUD. Worse we couldn't understand a thing she said\/asked either BECAUSE THE MUSIC WAS SO LOUD. Each of our four orders  went something like this.\n\nCustomer, \"I'll have the _____ burger.\" \nWaitress, \"Which one?\"\nCustomer, \"The _____ burger.\"\nWaitress, now pointing to the menu, \"Which one?\"\nCustomer now also points to the burger on the menu.\nWaitress, \"The _____ burger? How would you like that cooked?\"\nCustomer, \"What?\"\nWaitress, now shouting very slowly, \"HOW ... WOULD ... YOU ... LIKE ... THAT ... COOKED?\"\nCustomer, now also shouting very slowly, \"MEE ... DEE ... UMM ... RARE!\"\nWaitress, \"WHAT KIND OF FRIES WOULD YOU LIKE?!\"\nCustomer, \"WHAT?!\"\nWaitress, sighs. \nCustomer, sighs.\n\nAs noted in other reviews the food is prepared well and is quite tasty but not sizeable. Burgers are about the size of a regular fast food burger. You get choice of fries, either steak or shoestring. Again, the amount is the size of a standard fast food fry. The shakes are also good but, again, not sizeable. On average 1 burger & fry + 1 shake = $30 with tax and tip.\n\nSo using the taste vs. cost vs. size vs. uncomfortable ambiance equation we arrive at a mere 1 star.\n\nWHAT? \nI SAID ONE STAR! \nWHAT?!\nsigh.
