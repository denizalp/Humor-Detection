Excellent service deserves 5 stars. From opening the door for you to taking away your empty beers and plates right away. Food is deliciously amazing although I've only had the chicken chimichanga lol Found this place on Yelp while craving and searching for Vegas' best michelada to cure my hangover and get me back in the game for the night 0:-) Anyway, you won't be disappointed coming here, the complimentary chips come with bean dip and delicious salsa as well !
