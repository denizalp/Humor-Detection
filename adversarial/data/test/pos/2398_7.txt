While I was totally blown away by how perfectly crispy, spicy, fresh and amazing their wings were, it's one of those places where if you're not a regular they all sort of look at you like you don't belong, which is sort of off putting. \n\nIt's tiny, it's not a good place if you really want to sit down and eat and it kinda sucks having to work your way through the crowds to order food and, again, I feel like if they don't know you they don't pay as much attention to you.  Like, when you walk in they all look at you like maybe you have AIDS (and maybe you do man but so what).\n\nI've only been here once so maybe it's odd to write a review BUT man, the wings, seriously, top notch some of the best I've had in the valley.  Great flavor, cooked really god damn well and served perfectly crispy.  I would come back strictly for the wings despite my overall discomfort there.  But then, I'm on anti-anxiety meds and hate crowds so I'm probably mostly just retarded.
