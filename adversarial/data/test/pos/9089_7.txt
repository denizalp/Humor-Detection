I loved their spicy mango habanero wings. They were actually so spicy that I only ate 3. The menu rates the the flavors from mild to hottest, which I appreciate. Nikki H. and I also tried the fried pickles which were delicious. Definitely would get those again. \n\nThe only issue I had was that when I attempted to add a little sprinkle salt it dumped out onto my food as though it had no lid at all. I suspect someone accidently put the pepper shaker's lid on the salt shaker. Our waitress offered to replace it. Yay! The manager brought it out and wandered around the dining room, looking awfully confused. When I waved him over he apologized and told me the waitress had told him it was for a child, not a child sized adult.. Not quite so yay, but I'll take it as a compliment.... Btw, I'm 32.. At least the mac and cheese was good! \n\nThe menu doesn't indicate how many wings you get, so here it is. \n\nYou can get traditional or boneless fried wings. Snack is 5, small is 10, you get the idea. It's all in increments of 5. Your wings do not include a side, which I found a little annoying.
