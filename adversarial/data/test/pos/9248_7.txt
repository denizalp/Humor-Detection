Oh my goodness. If you take a quick glance at my photos, you'll see there are quite a few sweet treats I indulge in. I'm a victim to my sweet tooth. I am very much a cake and cupcake lover. Doughnuts are okay to me, after many years of eating Dunkin Donuts in NYC before heading to the subway- their selection of occasionally soft, typically hard and harder, I could never get enthused. They look good behind the counter, then you bite into them and it's like a rock. Yuck! I gave up. \n\nWhen my daughter became old enough to exercise her preference in what snacks she wanted, I began making mental notes of places around town for her to try. Your Moms Donuts was the fourth bakery I have been to on my donut quest. I walked in the shop as others were walking out with their boxes. There was less than an hour to closing, and I hoped there would be a good selection for me to present to her. I was relieved to see there was. The lady behind the counter apologized for enjoying a donut of her own off to the side, and I laughed and told her I don't blame her at all.\n\nI asked questions about what the frosting was, and she gave me a sample of the icing from one I seemed ambivalent about. I was sold! It was delicious. I bought half dozen and went home.\n\nMy daughter got home from school and was happy to know there was doughnuts in the kitchen from a new place. She grabbed the vanilla frosted, paused and asked if I had taken my pictures yet. I told her yes- she took a bite and her eyes closed. YMD became her favorite, usurping previous #1 spot holders Sugar and Duck Donuts. She couldn't say much more because she was eating. I took my own bite of the milk chocolate and agreed the donuts were amazing.\n\nIn other reviews I wondered why the heck people struggled to eat just one. Hey, I'm greedy- what can I say? I see why it's that way, after trying my own. Soft, yet firm and dense. I definitely wouldn't be shoveling these in my mouth like I did with Dunkin Donuts of my youth. Certainly will be eating them all, but slowly and enjoying every bite. \n\nFive freaking stars from her, a donut addict, and from me, a cupcake addict, who usually looks at donuts and passes on them.
