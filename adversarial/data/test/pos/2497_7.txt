I am happy they opened this location which is close to my home so very convenient for quick stops.\n\nI come here for their meats and produce and that is it because everything else is priced way higher than at your standard grocery store.\n\nThey have a great Panaderia\/Bakery with yummy Mexican baked goods and an eatery where you can sit and eat food such as tacos, burritos, albondigas soup etc hot and fresh.\n\nThis is a fun store and I really liked their fresh pina and juices they make daily.\n\nI just loaded up last night for $13 bucks and got all of my produce.\n\n5 lbs jalapenos for $1\n6 lbs of yellow onions $1\n2 lbs of nectarines for $1\n2 lbs green bell pepper $1\n8 avocados for $1\n\nI also like their meats because I make a lot of tacos, burritos, fajitas, etc and they have marinated meats which have great flavor.\n\nMeats and produce at this store is the way to go!\n\nThe store staff will speak to you in Spanish, I thought that was odd but funny. I speak a little Spanish so is OK for me however will suck to communicate if you don't.
