The only reason this place would be worth the price is for its half off after 9 PM on Monday-Thursday. Although the setting and atmosphere is actually really nice, the pizza is not that great for its price. A lot of times, the food can be too salty and not that great. So you're more paying for cheap food in a good atmosphere. Recommend if hungry at night with some friends.
