not quite sure what all the big hype was about.\n\nThe event was fun, but I guess I just expected more.\n\nThe pool and the pool scene seemed as if it were just some regular casino pool...didnt really look cool...it just looked like an ordinary pool!\n\nThere was only ONE BAR? or maybe I just couldnt find the other bar\n\nThe DJs were awesome.\n\nI think this place COULD POTENTIALLY be something awesome, but it was definitely slacking for grand opening week for MDW\n\nUNTIL THEN!! ^-^
