Wife and I had lunch there today at 11:50 AM.  It was crowded and we had to sit at the sushi bar.  The counters were a bit too high to be very comfortable and I bumped elbows with a fellow diner.  We ordered the lunch bento box.  I had teriyaki salmon and shrimp tempura and the wife had the salmon and California roll, crunchy, both included rice, green salad, and miso soup. My wife ordered some iced tea, I drank water. Staff was very friendly and patient and the countertop was clean.  Portions were small but the food was tasty.  We spent almost $33 without the tip and were still a bit hungry.  Don't think we will return at these prices.  What we ate was pleasant, perhaps we might be used to eating too much!  We both have a normal body weight.
