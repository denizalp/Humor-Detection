I went here to get my hair done for a wedding with the bridal party. There were 7 girls including the bride...so there were ALOT of us. You would think they would have anticipated that we would need attention and time, but it was utter chaos. It's like they hadn't known for months we were coming on that particular Saturday morning to get our hair done. It was so rushed and chaotic that none of us, including the bride, enjoyed the experience. \n\nI had even helped them a great deal by straightening my hair beforehand. My hair is really curly and I figured it would be easier to manage and style if I straightened it. I did warn them that I straightened it and not to put any water on it b\/c the curls would spring up like perennials in Spring. Now to their credit, the woman who was styling my hair didn't put any water on it, but she was using hairspray and a curling iron (which I told her may not be necessary) and she made a comment, \"wow you weren't kidding when you said your hair was curly\". b\/c as she was spraying the hairspray on the \"death by fumes\" setting and curling the hair (fire hazard anyone?) my hair was holding on to the curls made by the curling iron with such intensity that the hair spray wasn't even needed. Umm, did I stutter when I said that my hair is very curly. \n\nPerhaps I'm being too hard on them, but I had so wanted and expected it to be a good experience (not even great) and I was so disappointed. They didn't do anything that I couldn't have managed on my own with a curling iron and a large can of Aquanet and a few bobby pins.
