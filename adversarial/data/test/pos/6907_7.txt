Halfpenny just served me the creamiest, chocolaty-iest chocolate ice cream I've had in like, forever!\n\nWorking out of our Charlotte location this week, I missed my office's Cookie Wednesday.....but not to cry b\/c this location has Ice Cream Wednesdays\n\nStopped by the previous morning to stock up on water & the lady was super-friendly.  She chatted up my coworker (he was a local) and there were yummy looking bagels & pastries - prepackaged but still looked yummy\n\nSo when this super-decadent, ultra-creamy ice cream is given to me, one bite was all it took for me to be in luv.  Others got Strawberry & Vanilla & I gotta say that Strawberry looked homemade w\/ its huge hunks of fresh berries\n\nThen I'm told it came from the very same place I'd been to, just the day before??\n\nMy coworker also said they make a mean milkshake!  Will totally be back!!
