This place is terrible... Keep away! I honestly don't know how this place has a 4.5 stars. Very misleading!! \n\nI came here with high hopes and I was very disappointed! Both the food and service sucks! I ordered a miso soup and she gave it to be along with the check. I went off yelp reviewed on what to order and the fish was not fresh. The meat was flavor less. The soft shell carb was edible. \n\nWe spent 300 dollars here and I'm still hungry...
