Note:  Review placed by my husband:  \n\nPlace is a joke. Work ethic is atrocious. I called to see if they could fit me in for a simple beard trim. They said \"sure come by.\" I showed up at 6:15 and their doors were locked when they advertise on their door they are open until 7:00. There were people in there and the barber just looked at me. They are obviously doing so well they don't need my business.
