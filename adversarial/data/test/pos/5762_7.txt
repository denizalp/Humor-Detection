I'll just get right to it. By far the worst $17 veggie Burger I have ever had. It came with no fries or sides whatsoever, but at $17 for what is also a very small burger, a side of any sort would have been atleast a decent thing to include.\nAs if that was not disappointing enough, I opened the burger to find the thickest cross-section slice of an onion... Not one or two onion rings but the entire cross-section of an onion (I've attached a pic)... I was horrified... Complete trash.\nAs if it couldn't get worse, I look in the bag for ketchup, but it was in vain, no ketchup in sight.... but hey, why would I need ketchup? Not like I have fries or anything to eat...just a dry Onion Burger.\n\nAlso, a \"side\" of Avocado was $2.50 for 4 slices, just no comment at this point \n\nNever again....next time i'll just throw my $17 out the window!
