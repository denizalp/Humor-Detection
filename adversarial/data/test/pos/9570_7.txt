Expansive menu, decent food, sub-par service, reasonable prices. \n\nYou'll probably think its ok. \n\nIf you go after midnight, the menu is less expansive, but you probably won't notice, because you'll be drunk. I won't be, and I won't notice, for two reasons: 1) I don't drink, and 2) I probably wouldn't go back to this place. There are many more compelling dining choices on the strip.
