That couldn't have been a more underwhelming experience.\n\nFirst, let me say the service was fine. Our server was cute, bubbly and attentive enough. \n\nThe meal, however, was less than what I expected. I ordered the coconut curry rice bowl. It tasted like neither coconut nor curry, although there was some kind of milky liquid swimming around the extra large chunks of red onion.\n\nThe onion -- and large growths of cilantro -- dominated the bowl. After scooping out the grass and the onion, the bowl was edible but tasteless. \n\nI let our server know and she was kind enough to offer to take it back for something else but I really didn't want to wait for something else to be made, only to have it fall short of expectations (which by now were low anyway). She ultimately gave me a 15% discount on my meal which I very much appreciate.\n\nIt was, however, my mistake to tempt fate and have seafood. I added prawns instead of chicken to my rice bowl and now I sit here with the telltale warning signs setting in -- disoriented feeling, searing stomach pains and deadly gas (worse than the dog). I'll be full out sick inside of an hour or so. \n\nThus, I can now cross prawns\/shrimp off my safe list for seafood handled in Calgary restaurants. It was the last item on the damn list.\n\nPlease note: I am not allergic to seafood. I am a born and raised Nova Scotian who went directly from sucking on a bottle to a lobster claw. \n\nOne other note for the manager: it's all well and fine to have rowdy sports fans yelling at the TV and having fun. After all, I love sports. But when a guy is repeatedly 'motherfucker' at the top of his lungs, it might be time to settle the place down a bit ... you know, for the sake of your other patrons.
