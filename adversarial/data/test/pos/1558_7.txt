If you could see me, I'm raising my hand as the newest member of the Masa Casa Fan Club. \n\nWhen I first approached the cart, it took a few seconds to put two and two together. Aha! These were the infamous tamale makers I had heard so much about. I asked what types they had, you know, beef or chicken. That's when the term \"Vegan\" came up. As a meatatarian, my heart did sink a little bit but I kept an open mind -\"One of each please\".\n\n Okay, are Vegans secretly eating all the good stuff behind our carnivore backs? Did I just eat vegan cheese substitute? The tamales were incredible! The \"House Party\" was my favorite - loaded with roasted poblanos and garlic masa. The \"Kimi Chimi Y'all\" was highlighted with kale, cabbage and apple kimchi. Such beautiful, rustic packages of tasty goodness! Add to that, their delicious homemade sauces. Can't wait to bump into these guys again! Believe the hype!
