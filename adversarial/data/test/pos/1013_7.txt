The plasma center overall is good. The reason for a low rating is due to their restrooms. I'm not a guy so I don't know how the mens restroom looks. The womems restroom on the other hand is absolutely horrible.  There are never seat covers available.  The toilet tissue is always out smh. And  one of the bathroom doors does not lock. I hate using the restroom when im there but sometimes I just have to go. Also ladies be careful with your boyfriends 1 of the female employees literally stalks my bf when he's up there.  She even went as far as getting his contact info from some information he filled out. He tells her not to call. We had to threaten to get her fired to stop the calls. Very unprofessional.
