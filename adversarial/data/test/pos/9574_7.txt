My favorite new drinks\/snacks place! I actually never heard of this place before they came to Vegas. I'm glad that they did! I've been here a couple of time, and I was more satisfied each time of the food and services. \n\nSince it's still brand new, I would suggest you go on a off hour or a weekday. Although I had to wait in line(inside of store, not wrapped around the building), the line moved quickly on Thursday night: The food came out faster than last time I was here even though the line was longer this time. It only took them 15-20 mins to make the food as opposed to 30\/40 mins. It seems like they are working out the kinks well.\n\nYesterday, I was not happy that my popcorn chicken was all tiny crumbs with breading and skin unlike the first time when I had it. I took it back to the counter. The girl apologized and was able to get kitchen to replace it in a timely manner. I was happy that they did that because now I can keep going back without worrying about the customer services. \n\nSome of the things I've tried so far.\n\nDrinks:\n\n1. mangonada(5\/5): I always like chamango. I enjoy how they make it here. However, I would ask for extra tajin on your drink to make it more flavorful. \n\n2 Spicy watermelon (5\/5): this will probably be my go to drink now in the summer. So refreshing! Ask for extra tajin on this drink too! \n\n3. Ube milkshake (4\/5): IG worthy drink. It is so cute with marshmallows and candies. If you like taro and sweet drinks, you should give it a try. The boba was perfectly cooked. \n\n4. Thai tea (4\/5): it's Thai tea, so not much to say about it. It tasted fine and it was just Thai tea. Can't really do it wrong. \n\n5. Sea salt green tea (4\/5): it was good but the boba was a bit overly cooked this time. \n\nFood:\n\n1. Hot Cheetos elotes (5\/5): loved it! I crave for it so often now I don't know if I can have just regular elotes. It's so flavorful with hot cheeto and cheese. I would ask for extra lime though. \n\n2 Popcorn Chicken (4\/5): I got the salt and pepper twice. I really liked it the first time but the second time, like I mentioned earlier, it was all crumbs. Make sure you tell you if you only get the breading. \n\n3. Hot Cheetos Cheese Fries(5\/5): loved it as well. It's a genius idea to add hot Cheetos to anything . It was so yummy! \n\nI have been recommending all my friends to come try it out. I'm gonna try more signature drinks and get my elote fix soon!
