I was a patient of Sarah's years ago and really liked her a lot. My mom also goes to her regularly too. Well I needed to get into a dermatologist for some odd red skin issue I'm having. I called to make an appointment today and they didn't have any openings until October. Umm its June...yeah that is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard! If you have that many patients maybe you should extend some of your hours. Patients shouldn't have to wait 5 months just to see a physician. Unacceptable. I called another reputable dermatologist in the area with better reviews then this skin center and I have an appointment tomorrow.
