Had the brunch buffet here and there was a live Jazz session going on!  Loved the music but the food selection was small unfortunately.  They had your typical breakfast food items, minus an eggs benedict :( \n\nThe service was good and attentive.  Our server always cleared the table as soon as we were about done and ready to get up for 2nds or 3rds.  I had a pounding headache from hugging my water bottle the night before so I helped clear it up by ordering a champagne and mimosa, $5 each.  \n\nThere was also a line cook at the egg station.  I ordered an omelet and freshly made waffles, mini waffles.  Take advantage of that!  Thanks to Amanda for hosting a brunch UYE at this location because I never would have tries this place on my own for brunch.\n\nIf you want a safe brunch to go to then Ceres is your spot, come and try it!  I was a bit confused on how to get here, I had to walk through a wall of bees then over some grass then through some huge glass doors then ask for directions at the lobby then down a empty hallway and finally arrived.
