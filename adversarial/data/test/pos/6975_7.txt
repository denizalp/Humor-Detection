BurgerGASM!\nI literally just drank down my burger, it was that juicy! In fact, I had a burger bath. \nThey grind their own hamburger from locally sourced beef, carefully selected to support small Quebec farms. They make their own gravy on-site and fries don't even know what hit them. They have got this burger thing seriously figured out and I will never, ever be satisfied with another burger again. And, dear God, preserve me from those chocolate chip cookies. Tabersnack!! \n\nQuick service, friendly vibes all around and who even cares with juicy, juicy, juicy patties like that? Mmmm, these burgers will bring you to your knees. You think the Big Boss burger is named just for you, right, but then you realize after one bite that it is the boss of you!
