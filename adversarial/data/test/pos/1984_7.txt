The staff all HATE their jobs here. They refuse to cooperate with one another and have no respect for each other, for the customers, or for their jobs. The guy at the cash register was taking the money and asking for help while customers were waiting for their food and everyone was standing around ignoring him as the line grew and he tried to take the money and make the food. Desperately in need of training and a manager. The crepe was not made properly either. Very disapp
