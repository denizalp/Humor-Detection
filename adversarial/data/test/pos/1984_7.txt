Believe it or not, I returned from Las Vegas relaxed and well-rested.  WTF?  I owe it all to the wondrous Ritz-Carlton (and of course, their spa).  We came out to Vegas for a wedding and since the hubs likes to hit the greens (that's greens, not green), we needed to find a resort with a golf\/spa package.  We opted for the Ritz-Carlton over the Montelago (right next door) because:\n\n1.  The Montelago only offered 1 round\/spa treatment per person for the entire stay.\n2.  It would cost MORE to stay at the Montelago and get additional rounds\/treatments to match what the Ritz-Carlton offered.\n3.  It's the freaking Ritz-Carlton.\n\nAll told, we paid $399\/night for the room, a 50-minute spa treatment, and unlimited rounds of golf.  Also included were the spa gratuity and resort fee.  We were more than happy with everything we got in our package - and of course, the service is top notch.  We were upgraded to a lake-view room with a balcony because we opted to pay for \"club lounge use\" - which basically means unlimited wine, champagne, sodas, cookies, candies, and several light meals offered a day.  Basically I ate like I was on a cruise ship, only it was the wine making me rock and not a boat!\n\nI really can't wait to go back.  It's not the typical Vegas experience, but it's a great alternative if you're a bit tired of that scene.
