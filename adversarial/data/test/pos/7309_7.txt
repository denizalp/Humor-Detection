Wow, what a disappointing affair (2014).\n\nThey spread it out over 2 days and even with the living social discount my friends and I felt cheated at least compared to the year before and compared to any other Las Vegas food and wine event (of which there are plenty).\n\nThe amount of restaurants participating were about 50% of what they had the prior year and the food was cheap and nothing special. Nothing stood out. Meatballs and pork sliders...no thanks. The first wine and food event I've attended where I walked out completely unfilled. \n\nBy the way, hooters was there with wings. If you are having a wine and food event where the retail price of a ticket to the event is around $100...and you have to invite hooters to put out wings and cold fries...you had a problem attracting participants. \n\nI was looking forward to this event as it was excellent in 2013, but I'll erase this from my list next year. \n\nA shame.
