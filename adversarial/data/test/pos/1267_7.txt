Save yourself, your children and your loved ones.  If you have a dog, stay home and eat dog s*#t.  Seriously.  The \"sushi\" here literally looked like sushi someone s*#t out and put on a platter.  Even the two suspicious men making them were LOLing the whole time, probably mumbling \"hahah these f_ck#?s think this is sushi, I put my poo in here.\"  \n\nDon't eat here. SERIOUSLY DONT DO IT!!\n\nWorst food experience of my life.
