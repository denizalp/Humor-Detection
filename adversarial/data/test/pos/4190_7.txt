I'm sorry, I can't not comment on my latest experience here. I brought a date here recently because the food is killer and I'd been talking it up for some time. We had a seat at the bar and were promptly served waters. Ok good start. Then we waited, and waited, and waited. I'm not joking we both finished our waters before we had to flag down one of the bartenders who had been walking in front of us several times ignoring us. We had to ask for a menu and to get any kind of service. I ordered my drink and my date ordered a beer. The drink took forever and the bartender completely forgot the beer altogether and had to be reminded. Annoying. When they finally asked what we wanted to order he literally WALKED AWAY from us when we were in the middle of ordering and didn't come back for a few minutes. We eventually ordered an appetizer and entrees. Our entrees came out first, then the appetizers about 10 minutes later. Ugh. We were never checked on, and generally were made to feel like an inconvenience. I truly do not know how you get such bad service at the bar when the bartenders are literally confined to the space in front of you, but somehow it happened. The only reason for the two stars is because the food was perfect as always. Otherwise I was horribly embarrassed to have chosen Clever Koi as a date night spot. I probably won't be back anytime soon.
