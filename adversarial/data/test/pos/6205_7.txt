It's rare to be able to talk about Canadian healthcare and expediency in the same breath. My experience at Appletree this morning was a real shocker.\n\nThe Appletree Medical Centre is located in the Village by the Grange plaza. It is most easily accessed via the entrance at Dundas and St. Patrick (look for a Baskin Robbins). Their frosted-glass entrance advertises a litany of medical offerings: radiology, counselling, travel medicine, pap exams, vaccines, etc. As with all first-time visits, I had to provide some information about my medical history, but in this twenty-first century clinic you simply walk over to a touch-screen, swipe your health card, and punch in your information. It's fast and easy, and don't worry: there is hand sanitizer for those concerned.\n\nI didn't even sit for a moment in the waiting room; I immediately was whisked away to see a doctor. A nurse quickly jotted down some notes and vitals on a tablet computer (!) and within minutes I was meeting with the amiable Dr Stendardo. He was polite and listened to my concerns. The entire process took less than 20 minutes. In other walk-in clinics I've waited twice as long just to be called -- expediency!\n\nObligatory Title Pun: How do you like them APPLES?\n\nMenu Readability: Their website provides wait-times in realtime and lets you know what clinics are open when. Top notch.\n\nNeed to mention: They are not currently open on weekends.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: I'm wowed when a medical centre in Canada uses technology younger than I am.
