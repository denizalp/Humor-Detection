This place is honestly one of my favorite places! Anyone interested in any form of spirtituality whether its as basic as simply yoga, or as complex as new age esoteric metaphysics this is your place. All the ladys that work here are very knowledgeable on most things in the store and beyond. They have on of the best crystal selections in the valley for sure. I love just hanging out here, because i know everone that goes in and that works there is just like me! Great place. Namaste~
