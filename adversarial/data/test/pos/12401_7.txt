I am SO GLAD my boyfriend and I chose to go here. I'm still smiling because of how great everything was! This is my new favorite vegan place in Las Vegas and I feel like this place sets the bar for other vegan restaurants in the future.\n\nWhen we first walked in, there were a few other people there and a sign to seat yourself. We walked over to a table close to the bookshelf and immediately went over to it. I saw all sorts of vegan books and cookbooks and some coloring books so I grabbed the Care Bear coloring book and a handful of crayons out of the bucket they had. My boyfriend grabbed the Uno game (which still looked brand new, yay!).\n\nWe forgot to grab menus at the front so our server brought them over and we started looking. She brought water over to us within a minute or two of sitting down. \n\nWe had no idea what to get because we hadn't looked over the menu before but I had seen pictures on the yelp page. They were out of a couple of things so I asked our server about it. How hard it is to get everything organic and not trying to buy too much so that it spoils. Totally makes sense to me and I'd rather go to a place that serves quality ingredients instead of somewhere that might be using old, rotten produce! \n\nSo we ended up ordering the nachos and Mac n cheese as kind of an appetizer.... Wrong!! Wrong move! We should have known better! The pictures of the nachos didn't really do them justice... at all. They are stacked at least 6 inches high and are enough for two people to share for dinner! I didn't want to take them home (you know how nachos get after being in the fridge for a day) so I tried to eat as many as possible, as did my boyfriend. I loved the vegan cheese sauce and there was so much guac (my favorite) we couldn't stop eating because they were so addicting! The Mac n cheese didn't help at all, with how thick and rich it was. Heavenly but so filling!\n\nUsually I say \"No Ragrets\" but there were... There were.\n\nOne of the other employees checked on us when we were almost done with the nachos and asked if they could get us anything else and we just laughed and said we were waiting on our sandwiches. The look we got was hilarious!! It was like, \"no way are you going to each eat a sandwich after all of that food\". I doubt many people do order anything else after those nachos!! xD\n\nRight after we said we were waiting on our sandwiches, we heard the bell 'ding' to let her know they were ready. She grabs them and comes out saying \" I hope your guys are hungry\". Lol no.. Not even a tiny bit.\n\nBut we both stuffed as much in as we could because it's not every day you find amazing vegan food at such a great cost. Really! Everything was SO affordable and it made me so happy!! We still each had half of a sandwich left and our sides so we got some to-go containers and shoved it all in there the best we could.\n\nThe nachos held up alright when I ate the remainder that night and the sandwiches are in the fridge, ready to be devoured. I would definitely recommend the Backyard BBQ sandwich! It was on point. The club wasn't my favorite because I didn't much care for the herb tofu but it was still scrumptious. \n\nI can't wait to come back and try the eggplant parm. This place is great! The service was perfect, the food was perfect, the prices were what I dream of, and I loved the atmosphere. I wish I wasn't a broke btch so I could come here every week.\n\nTotal, for our nachos, Mac n cheese, two sandwiches with sides, and giant slice of cake, it came to $38. Two appetizers, two main courses, and desert for less than $50? With enough leftovers to take home and do it all again? HECK YEAH! I love you guys!\n\nK, I'm getting creepy. Thanks for the amazing service and food! :D
