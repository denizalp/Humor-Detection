Midwood was good for the most part. I absolutely loved the mac and cheese, baked beans and brisket. If I go back, those are likely the items I would order. They were really good! I ordered a four meat choice sampler, but was told that they were out of ribs. One star docked for that. BBQ places cannot run out of ribs!!
