This office was recommended to me by AT Still Dental School because I needed a surgeon for tooth removal. The office is very nice looking and the staff seemed friendly to me. One assistant in particular tried to comfort me during the removal by offering to play music I enjoy during the procedure to calm me. Dr. Wilson is very nice and I thought he was very knowledgeable. He offered me discounts on multiple visits because I lack insurance and came to him per the recommendation of the dental school.\n\nI have a strong, good opinion of this office and wish I had gone to them when I had my wisdom teeth removed last year. It probably would have been easier on me and cheaper. The actual removal time for one molar took pretty much ten minutes at most and was painless. They even cared enough to have to come back for free to make sure everything was healing right. \n\nI highly recommend this dental surgeon.
