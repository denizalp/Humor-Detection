I really like Highlander - it's a great spot to pick up your wine and spirits. This location is actually a good size, despite being in a strip mall. They've got it very well laid out, in my opinion. There are always sales going on - especially on wine. I like browsing the wine every time I go in.\n\nTonnes of parking in this strip mall and it's easily accessible from Richmond Rd (although it's a bit awkward to get back out since they made the first turn-off one-way only, but I do think it works better now). The employees are really friendly and knowledgeable. And they have some sort of points\/discount system based on your phone number - I'm not exactly sure how it works but if it gets me a few bucks off here and there, I'm okay with that!\n\nReview #30 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012
