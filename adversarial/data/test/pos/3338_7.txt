We made tons of jokes about whether or not you'd get screamed at when you walked in. Well, you won't. And then I realized when someone said \"cause it's icecream...\" I still don't 100% get the pun but the icecream was alright. \n\nPros?\nHuge interior \nQuite a few options \nLocal-ish ingredients\n\nCons?\nWasn't super memorable icecream
