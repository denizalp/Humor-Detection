Good place for a Pre-dinner Noodle if you're Ridin' Solo(DeRulo style).  Closes early so most of my attempts at coming here before was always SHOT down, as I come after 7 pm or so.  Simple place, straightforward Menu, friendly Cantonese\/English speaking service, self-service Tea.\n\nFYI, they will attempt Mandarin but it's as FUNNY as how I sound.\n\nAs Cook \"Wah\" makes my Wonton in Noodle Soup($4.50) in the OPEN kitchen, I looked at the menu which is pretty much a handful of items only.  Noodle with Oyster Sauce or Noodle Soup, then your choice of up to 3 items(Wonton, Beef, Fish Balls, Beef Brisket, Meat Sauce, etc...)  With only these few items, you can make quite a few different combinations that cater to your preference.\n\nThe Bowl comes out FAST with 4 big Wontons and normal portion of Noodle in a standard stock.  The Wontons are packed with Shrimp and pretty tasty and most people like to dip it in condiments such as the Red Vinegar or add Chili Oil for added flavour.  Bowls can cost up to $7.00 and you can even add extra Noodles for $1.50 for those big consumers.
