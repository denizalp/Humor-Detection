Located in a quiet part of Centennial Hills, this quaint breakfast, brunch and lunch joint is a new favorite! We never find ourselves in this part of town since it's further north from all of our weekend activities, but I'm so glad we went out of our way this past weekend to try this spot! The café is rustic and charming with an old school, classic vibe to it. \n\nThe employees all seemed very eager to help and sweet. After we looked through the menu, we went to the counter to place our order. The lady running the register was the manager; she was quite the character, very enthusiastic and called us baby throughout the process (with a sweet, but animated southern charm.)\n\nWe decided to get an iced chai latte and requested that it be \"extra spicy.\" We saw the manager\/cashier make it in front of us from of a liquid\/syrup blend and not from powder. We also had it topped off with whipped cream and cinnamon. It was very sweet at first, but as the ice melted, it was tasty! My fiancé and I enjoyed it. Rated: 4\/5\n\nWe also shared the Benicio del Porko - Corn bread topped with succulent pulled pork, BBQ & hollandaise sauce, poached eggs and a sprinkle of more sweet corn! Wowza! One of the tastiest & creative benedicts I have ever had. The portion was generous and definitely stuffed the two of us. The corn bread was not too dense and slightly crisp on the bottoms, like they had tossed it on the grill for a bit. Also, the pulled pork was wonderfully moist! A slight complaint was the BBQ sauce overwhelmed the overall flavor of the hollandaise, but when eaten sparingly in the \"perfect bite\" it adds a nice pop of flavor, complementing the dish! Rated: 4\/5 \n\nI also saw some menu items and pastries that looked fantastic and unique. I'm looking forward to coming back to try their creative sandwiches as well!
