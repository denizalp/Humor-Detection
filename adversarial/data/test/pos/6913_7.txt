Went here Saturday night for a birthday celebration. There were 3 options, the Takumi $150, the Waza $120, and the Shun $100. There was also an optional add-on of Wagyu Beef for approx $70. We all ordered the Takumi set and a bottle of unfiltered sake.\n\nSo.. wow! I would never think that something with small courses and not very carb heavy could fill me up the way that it did. Every time we thought we had our last serving of sushi, they would bring us some more! I have not been a fan of sashimi in the past but it's probably because I hadn't had good quality. Every thing here was amazing, and I like how they tell you which pieces of sushi\/sashimi you don't need to dip in soy sauce. The chef was saying they fly their fish fresh from Japan!\n\nService was really good - a little bit slow compared to what others on here are saying. They made a really nice bouquet of flowers out of fresh vegetables for the birthday girl which was really cool!\n\nAtmosphere is not fancy, despite the hefty price tag. It's pretty casual and friendly.\n\nMy favourites were the: tempura, the tuna and the wasabi macaron. YUM! \n\nDefinitely too expensive to go on a regular basis, but a nice treat. \n\nTips: I would suggest keeping the menu so you can keep track of where you are\/what you're eating, I couldn't always understand what the server was saying. Also, sitting at the sushi bar is a must to see them prepare everything. Make sure to reserve well in advance!
