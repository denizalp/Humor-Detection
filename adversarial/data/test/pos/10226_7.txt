Ice cream so fresh, it can only be fresher if you pour liquid nitrogen on the udder!\n\nSo yes, it's another ice cream joint where the hype is all about how they pour liquid nitrogen over your ingredients and ice cream mix but hey, the end product speaks for itself!  Creamy, luscious, rich, dense, and never is there freezer burn. I had the Cookie Butter and it was bliss. Creamistry was just what we needed after eating at Lou Malnati's next door!\n\nThe staff is friendly, the place is clean for the amount of traffic this place gets, and the ice cream is fantastic. I'm a fan! Welcome to Uptown, Creamistry!
