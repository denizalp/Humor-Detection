If you're staying at Bally's, had a long, but exciting night, and in dire need some some food to munch on without table service, Nosh is there for the rescue!\n\nIt was my last night during my last visit to Vegas and by that time I really wasn't in the mood to go to a sit-down restaurant, nor travel far to grab some food elsewhere.  I was tired but luckily Nosh was there thanks to them being open 24 hours a day.  They have some really good specials like their $3 Hot Dogs and $12 Foot Long Sandwiches.   \n\nI ordered their Large Italian Sandwich and as you can see, this sandwich was loaded!! (http:\/\/bit.ly\/1yLBvZS).  The bread was good and they definitely piled in the meat.  It definitely hit the spot for me before calling it a night.\n\nFor being open 24 hours and offering a nice selection of sandwiches and snacks, Nosh is a dependable spot if you're staying at Bally's.
