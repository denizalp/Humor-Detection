The absolute worst customer service ever and the best part is it was from the owner.... My fiance ordered a laarge white chicken pizza for dinner to be delivered one evening while I was doing computer work. She was never given a total when they hung up so i asked her to call back so i could get out the appropriate cash. she called right back and was told $32! I about threw up in my mouth. She asked why and was told because she was adding chicken to a specialty pizza. Regardless of the fact that is still obscene, she didnt want a specialty pizza she just wanted a white pizza with chicken. I told her to cancel the order and we would simply go elsewhere. The owner then informed her \"she would be blacklisted and never allowed to order from there again\" if she canceled.... WHAT A JOKE!
