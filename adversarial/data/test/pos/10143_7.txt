Already been stated, Bent Crayon is your home for electronic music and its subgenres in the Cleveland area. I haven't found anything else with this selection of electronic in the area yet. \nDuring my only visit there, its stock was nearly all electronic and its forms: acid, house, dubstep, drone, blip-hop, ambient, idm, techno [detroit], trip-hop, etc..  \nTheir collection looked to be split between vinyl and CD. Most CDs were new, all priced at least $13, not cheap [and probably cheaper online], but some of these were imports to be sure and this stuff does have a relatively limited audience. [It was difficult for me to walk out of there empty-handed..] Alas, there wasn't a bargain bin either. \nAlthough since I've looked on the website and found it, I didn't find any hip-hop in the store during my only visit [however, I browsed only about half of their CD section]. \nThe guy behind the counter was nice. He spoke up to a regular customer of something that they may like, he and some customers were having spirited conversations about some shows, same that I'd imagine High Fidelity had, both with a tad slice of pretension. If you're looking for something you heard on the radio, move along: you won't find here at Bent Crayon [unless you heard it on college radio]. \n\nOtherwise, come here and find something with the perfect beat.
