A couple years ago, my BF treated me to a massage at Massage Envy, she had a coupon for a discount.  When we booked the appointment, I requested a female masseuse.  When we arrived, I was told I would have a male masseuse instead.  I take daily injections for a medical condition, and I happen to bruise very easily.  Prior to the massage, I had hit a vein and caused a dark bruise on my stomach.  I warned the masseuse about the bruise, but English was apparently not his first language.  When I flipped over, the masseuse saw the bruise and asked if my husband was abusive.  I then had to re-explain the bruise a couple of times before he understood.  Also, the masseuse was quite chatty which I don't care for at all.  Needless to say, this was not a relaxing massage at all, I would rate it as my all time worst massage.
