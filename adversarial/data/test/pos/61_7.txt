We went here at the start of the Harry Potter pub crawl so all I can only comment on is the fast and attentive waitress who was able to get all our drinks to us quickly and correctly and the great beer.\nThe pub has a good variety of draft beers.\nThe food looks good but I didn't eat any this time. Next time, when I have a craving for a scotch egg I'll be here in a heart beat.
