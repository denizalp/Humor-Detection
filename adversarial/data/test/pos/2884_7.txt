I was pleasantly surprised with the place. I expected some barebones environment from a place with a cheesy name like this but they actually tried to create a spa-like atmosphere.\n\n60 min massage really equals 50 min massage with 10 min \"prep\" so it felt short. My therapist was overall great, went with light pressure just like I asked and overall the massage was very good.\n\nI am taking one star off for the obnoxious front desk person who kept on acting like I was signing up for a 10-year-commitment not a 50-min massage. She was nice but overly excited and nosy with her questionnaire of how frequently I would like to get a massage.\n\nAnd also the star is taken out for my boyfriend's therapist who got into this obsessive discussion about how my boyfriend needs to buy some ionic blanket and get \"good ions\" from earth. We literally could not get away from this dude, he kept on talking about it, my boyfriend was trying not to look at me trying to contain his giggles.\n\nSo try to pretend that you are deaf to avoid obnoxious people but other than that the price per service is worth it.
