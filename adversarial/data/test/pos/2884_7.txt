I honestly don't know what I was thinking going to this outdoors event in 100 degree weather. Our group went when the sun was down and it was still miserable. I can't believe they charged $10 admission for essentially standing in a parking lot and waiting in line for expensive food truck food. There weren't any discounts or specials.\n\nReminder to self: don't go to an outdoor event unless it's in December in Arizona \n\nOverall, it was a huge disappointment. Expensive food and didn't really showcase any interesting tacos.
