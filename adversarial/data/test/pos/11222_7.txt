Namaste!\n\nI absolutely love this grocery store.  When you're eating clean and free of any preservatives or additives, this is the place to get whatever you need.  For the record, I do not have candida...seriously.\n\nThe produce section is always very neatly stacked and fresh.  Seasonal seafood offerings are smoked or alive.  In fact, the live wild black mussels are only $4.99 lb, compared to the place I usually go to which sells New Zealand frozen green for almost the same price.  They will also cook however you want your seafood before you take home like a whole dungeness crab.  Shucked fresh oysters?  Hola!  \n\nDuring lunch hour, the cooked food stations can be pretty busy.  I hit the salad bar on $2 off Wednesdays.  My little cutie pie loves the cheese pizza or fish and chips.  Don't forget that Saturdays are $4 wine and beer day hubby pairs with grass fed, bison burger or steak.\n\nWhen I pick up some facial and body products here, there are no ugly machines to help me.  I want to know what percentage of ugliness I am so I can improve.  Is that contraption a myth?\n\nEat the samples offered first before you blow your whole paycheck...never shop hungry!  \n\nLast but not least, I do not drive a Prius, so I will not be able to sneak up on you like a panther in the parking lot.  \n\nNamaste anyway.
