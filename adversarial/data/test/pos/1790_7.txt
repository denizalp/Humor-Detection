After finding a line in almost every place in this hotel, we found this restaurant to have no wait! We came at around 3:30pm and we were able to order off the lunch & happy hour menu, even though it was a holiday!\n\nWe ordered a few appetizers off the happy hour menu- truffle fries, onion rings, pub spot, and wings. The truffle fries and onions rings were yummy and crispy. I was happy that I could taste the truffle oil! The pub spot is basically a mini burger which I enjoyed! The wings were a huge portion but a bit dry. \n\nFor the menu, I ordered a few small items and when it came, they arranged it all together on a plate for me! It is super thoughtful of them! I had the mini mac n cheese and the brussels sprouts side. Mac n cheese was yummy, I had the garlic flavor. The brussels sprouts were seasoned so well but a little too oily.  Even though this place is quite big, the food comes our relatively fast. My family also enjoyed their meals. The fish and chips ($30) were good, but the portion is tiny for the price. \n\nOverall- friendly service, loud ambiance, and food came out fast. Our waters were constantly refilled, server always checking up on us, and the food was tasty. I would recommend during happy hour if you're looking for a quick bite!
