You've had the chicken I'm sure.. \n\nIn this review I want to mention to a new item on the Popeyes Value Menu called the Chicken Biscuit - it's damn delicious, cheap and fulfils your sinful cravings. \n\nThe sandwich is made with slices of fried chicken tenders (white meat) and sandwiched between a buttermilk biscuit,  Voila!  There you have it  the Popeye's Chicken Biscuit for $1.99! Genius, pop a couple of these back and you're good to go. \n\n\nOh an honourable mention if you're feeling for dessert..\n\nPopeyes is one of the few places that offers a fried apple pie.  So good if you hadn't had one before.. the apple sauce is ooey gooey but bite carefully because the hot apple sauce can burn your mouth.. it's very hot out of the frier..  the crust of the pie is crisp to perfection& tastes nothing like a baked pie. Back in the day they used to coat it with sugar and cinnamon for extra goodness. Not any more.. guess they are getting soft. \n\nI give props to Popeyes for sticking to their heritage of offering tasty and delicious fatty fast foods that don't give a flying f**k about your health.
