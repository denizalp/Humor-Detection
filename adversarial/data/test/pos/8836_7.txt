MABU GENERATION. Dun,dunnn, dunnnnnnnn. (Now picture something coming out on a pedestal in a movie with shining light). I came here for lunch on a weekday around 1:00pm, and man, this place is pretty packed. I was lucky enough to come when there wasn't anyone waiting for seats and there were still empty tables, or else, the last time I wanted to try this place out for dinner, the waitress said we needed to wait an hour.\n\nThe decor definitely had a Taiwanese style to it. It had beautiful antique posters of famous Taiwanese female artistes on them and a large wall painting. The lights were dim, the seats were quite low, but large and comfy. We were seated right away and the waitress asked us if we came here before, which we said no to, and she nicely explained how it worked at MABU. They leave you with a piece of paper and you write what it is you want to eat, and there's an option box for what you want (drink, appetizer or dessert). The waitress served us very interesting cups to hold our water-it had a handle that didn't really do much.\n\nThe lunch special is $10.99. On the menu, it says it comes with an appetizer, drink (green, milk, or green and milk bubble tea, hot\/cold), or dessert. I'm not sure if that was the old deal, or I'm just reading it wrong, but I think you only get one of the three choices! \n\nWe decided to try the Taiwanese Style BBQ sausage and minced pork on rice and the Taiwanese Style Stewed Beef Noodle in Soup. The bowl of Taiwanese Style BBQ sausage and minced pork on rice was mediocre - I think Papa Chang's definitely has it a little better. I really quite enjoyed the stewed beef noodle in soup, it was natural and rich in flavour of it's own! The food came a little slower than usual, and I could tell the waiters and waitresses were all worked out - there were 2 waitresses and 1 waiter who was walking in an out of the bar area making drinks etc, and one more for cash!\n\nAfter reading the menu, I think I would come back for the hotpot - it looks big enough to share between two people and it's $15.99 for a pot!
