Musical Instrument Museum (MIM) accomplished its goal with me. It brought musical instruments from lands far far away into one well thought-out and planned collection. They even had a Paul Reed Smith dragon guitar evolution exhibition in conjunction with an Abolone exhibit. The museum had the standard headphone self-guided tour that was informative but not overly detailed. I'd return.
