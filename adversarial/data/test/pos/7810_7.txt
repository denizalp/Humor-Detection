Four stars for the cheeseburger. It had been a long while since I had a Johnny Rockets burger. In fact, the last time I had Johnny Rockets was in college! However, during a recent shopping trip and movie night at the mall, we stopped by for burgers before the show. This is a delicious burger! It is juicy and has the special sauce and is just fatty goodness. It's definitely worth the visit if you're in the mood for a juicy burger on the go.
