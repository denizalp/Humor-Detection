I'm glad that the Yelp ratings properly acknowledge the Full worth of this store.\n\nAwesome locally-owned grocery store, with an excellent range of products. One of many, many local grocery places in this part of town, which has a massive and amazing array of ethnic restaurants. But this is one of the very best. The cashier was nice and helpful, and the products, while a little overpriced, are nowhere near as marked-up, out of date, and poor quality as a lot of the little convenience stores around here. You could actually shop at Fullworth instead of a brand name grocery store, and do fine. If I lived around here, I absolutely would.
