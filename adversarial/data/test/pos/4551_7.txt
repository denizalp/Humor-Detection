Still very clean and very comfortable place to see a moving picture. Nice seating and the picture\/sound is always good.\n\nI don't know what's changed in the last five years, but the parking situation has deteriorated. On the busier weekend nights when there's a big movie opening, expect to have to make a good hike. And the line to buy tickets can be a bit too long for me.
