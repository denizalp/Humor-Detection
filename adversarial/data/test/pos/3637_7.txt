The first time I went to Brentwood, I loved it!  The prices are reasonable, the food is amazing (totally recommend the pizza) and they allow pets on the outside terrace while you eat.\n\nThe second time I went to Brentwood, the food was just ok and the service was subpar, but that's hardly a reason to stop going, in my book.\n\nThe third time I went to Brentwood, I ordered an appetizer of Mozzarella Sticks to share with the person I was with.  After a very long wait, they finally came out, completely overdone and only a shell of fried batter.  Nobody's perfect, so I flagged the waiter, pointed out the food and asked to take them away and not to worry about bringing a replacement.  His response?  \"Do I have to take this off your check?\"  I just about walked out at that moment.  Excuse me?  Do you have to take something that I didn't eat off of my bill?!  Common sense, please.\n\nI have yet to go back.
