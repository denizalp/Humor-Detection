It wasn't very busy on our Saturday evening visit.  That should've been my clue.  \n\nWe weren't extremely hungry so my better half and I decided to share a few appetizers.  Our first choice was the Green Chili Chicken Nachos.  Pretty decent coverage of toppings including cheese, black beans and jalape√±os.  The menu says it's supposed to be spicy cheese but I didn't catch any of the zing.  \n\nWe also shared the Beer-brined Crispy Chicken Sliders.  I would not order these again.  Very very dry and lacking any flavor.  The IPA sauce was non existent.  There was maybe a dab which you couldn't taste.  It's unfortunate.  \n\nOur service from Rachel was really good.  She was very attentive and friendly.  Although the service was good, the food needs some improvement.
