\"Three times a charm!\" - isn't that what they say?  It's tax season, so I just wanted to give my accountant a little Yelp love with an update...\n\nThis was the third year in a row I went to see Michael Morrison for my taxes, and once again...  I'm so happy and relieved to be done.  This year, I did it before April too!  Yay me!\n\nMike walked me through the process asking me every relative question and went through all of the paperwork I brought in... during the process, he was personable as well, telling me about his latest 1\/2 marathon and about becoming a grandfather.  The office cat payed a visit as well - be forewarned if you have pet allergies.  About an hour later, Mike slid a piece of paper in front of me to show me the outcome of our meeting...\n\nI took in a deep breath and looked down to see... A REFUND!\n\nThank goodness - I need that $$!\n\nIf you haven't done your taxes yet, call asap - I'm sure it's crazier than ever as April 15th approaches.
