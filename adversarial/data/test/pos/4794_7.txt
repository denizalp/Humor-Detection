When I knew I was going to Vegas this was the first place I wanted to try. Watching emeril on the food network for so many years I was excited to try one of his restaurants. The wait was so worth it. Going through the MGM on the way to emrils it was all that I could think of. Especially the banana cream pie! I mean if it's a dessert Wolfgang Puck dreams about, it must be good right?! We finally get to the restaurant and the hostess says the table isn't ready yet for our reservation! At this point its so close, yet so far away! Thirty minutes later they are finally ready for us, YaY! First at the table they give you a corn bread basket with butter. The corn bread was warm & toasty. Then with the butter, wow! We ordered the lunch steak and cheese a cheese burger. The steak was cooked perfectly and was tender. It was great! The burger was pretty good as well, but the steak was better! Now, for what I have been waiting for! The famous banana cream pie! If I could I would eat this every day! Its thebomb.com! I even asked the waitress if they would ship a pie to NY! We all laughed but I was crying a little on the inside because I was serious! Another great place to try if you dont mind waiting!
