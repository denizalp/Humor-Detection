Tried another round at the Vine - was Sunday brunch and was lucky enough to have a lady bug cooked right into my omelette. Waitress took it away and said \"so sorry, I'll speak with my manager\" - after nearly 5 minutes, it was apparent the manager wanted to stay away from a conflict so the waitress popped over and said \"they're making you a new omelette\" (I found it rather presumptuous to assume I'd want another after seeing a baked in lady bug in my first attempted omelette)! No thanks. Waitress dodged us like the plague after that but ran by saying the manager would be over to apologize. Manager did come over and gave a gift card to make it right. I wasn't angry or disgruntled, but when she asked if there was anything else she could get us, I simply responded, \"our check\" - 5 minutes after that, the waitress said we had no check - (again, good effort in making it right). I really WANT to like the Vine, but it's a done deal for me. No more and I'm really quite disappointed that I can't win there.
