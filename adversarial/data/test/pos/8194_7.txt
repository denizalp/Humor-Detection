After reading Chris P's review - and - listening to my Nissan Pathfinder's ever louder \"voice\", I had to do something.\n\nOff to Thruway I went. No appointment, no calls, just drive up and pray.\n\nThe guy, (d00d), behind the counter took my information, gave me a general idea of what it could cost and told me he'd call me before noon with an estimate, (around $450). \n\nJust for fun, I showed him Yelp on my iPhone and read him Chris P's review.... he said, \"oh, the guy with the Honda\".  (Chris, now we know what you drive).\n\nWhat actually happened: The guy called me an hour after I dropped off the car and said that it was a simple problem, easy to fix and the only charge is for labour as no parts were used. Total paid: $60\n\nIf every service provider was like this, it would be a better world.\n\nI'd give them six stars if I could, honestly.
