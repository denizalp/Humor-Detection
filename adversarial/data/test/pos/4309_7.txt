I feel bad about writing this review....it was great for to have this get together tonight (and it definitely wasn't our host's fault), but there were so many things wrong with this place.\n\nFirst of all, I will say the positive....AWESOME time with the girls and boys.\n\nNow...I have no idea how I ate my plate of french fries (with feta and olive oil...which I had to tell the waitress about...not her fault)  because the whole place smelled like a nasty dirty diaper.  Also...could it get an hotter in there?  We asked to turn the heat down or air conditioning up...and it just kept on getting hotter and hotter...I was sweating profusely.\n\nService was meh and my drink had NO VODKA in it....pure grapefruit juice I tell you.  And the parking lot?  If it was full (there were like 8 parking spots) I would have left.\n\nIt was strange seeing a Greek themed restaurant as a Sports Grill.  Somehow those two things just don't go together at all.
