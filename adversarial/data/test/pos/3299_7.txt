The first time I went to Milk Tiger, I didnt particularly like it. It smelled funny and everything seemed dreary. But the second time was very enjoyable. \n\nI'll admit it, I'm not a cocktail person. Maybe some mojitos once in a while, but majority of the time I like sipping on wine. And occasionally beer or an aperitif, depending on my mood.\n\nSo the huge cocktail list at Milk Tiger is never a draw for me. But the atmosphere is really nice. It is always packed, usually with good-looking, well-dressed people. (Seriously Calgary, it wont hurt to dress up when heading out for a change!) So I feel at ease when I walk in in a dress or heels or anything fancy. \n\nLast time I went, I was very particular and asked for an amontillado sherry. They didnt have anything like that on their drinks list but the bartender found an Alvear sherry for me and I highly enjoyed it. The cheese plate was a very good accompaniment too. \n\nVery chill, trendy place for drinks in Calgary. The tiny, almost non-existent signage outside makes it hard to find and that adds a touch of cool.
