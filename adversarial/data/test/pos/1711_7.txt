This is probably the worst demetres that I have EVER been to. \nI went there with 6 of my friends and when we sat down, we immediately found out that the table they have given to us was filthy. Apparently they have cleaned the table but somehow forgotten the sides of the table. We told our waitress if she could clean the table again and she seemed very displeased but did it anyway and obviously, didn't wipe it well enough. We even took our napkin and a little bit of water and cleaned the table ourselves and the napkin turned grey-ish which is disgusting!!\nThe waffle that I ordered was undercooked and soggy, the hot drink I had wasn't hot at all (more like room temperature) and some of us got our order way earlier than others so some of us has to wait longer for our desserts. \nOverall, don't bother with this demetres. The one located in Courtney Park is probably the best one and the cleanest!k
