Funtimes.\n\n\nWe had a groupon and a friend of mine that has kids too wanted to try this as an activity day .So we piled our kids into the car and off we went.\n\nFirst the staff is super helpful. We got all the supplies we needed and started by painting. Even with young children it was so relaxing. \n\nIts a little more expensive than I hoped but you can't put a price on a good day. And thats exactly what we had.\n\nEach piece we had was slightly under 20.00
