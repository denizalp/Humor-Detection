I love the yard house, but this branch not so much. I like it primarily cuz I can get Gardein everything and thats a major plus. Unfortunately the last time I was there, I was given actual meat in place of the Gardein like I had ordered. The service was excellent and all that jazz, but that left me with a unpleasant feeling and there was nothing they could do to recoup from that.
