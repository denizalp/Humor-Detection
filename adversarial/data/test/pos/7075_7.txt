I wait for the bus by this Razzy Fresh all of the time, but I have never been in here until a few days ago.  My adviser and I decided that we needed a break from life and decided to grade things here, which was such a good idea.  So bonus points to this Razzy Fresh for being so close to CMU.  \n\nThe Razzy Fresh in Squirrel Hill is way smaller than this one, and there were probably twice as many flavors here.  I think there were about 12 flavors.  I think I tried cheesecake, raspberry, and lemon?  All of the flavors were really good and didn't have any kind of artificial taste.  \n\nThe toppings station was pretty good as well.  The kiwi and strawberries were very fresh, and they had fruit poppers, which are my favorite.  The cheesecake bites were yummy, and I topped this all of with rainbow sprinkles.  YAY!  Other toppings included a variety of fruits, candies, cereal, and sprinkles.\n\nPrices were super reasonable, and if you are going to come here regularly get a punch-card.  10 punches gets you $5 off of your next FroYo!
