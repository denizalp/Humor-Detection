Amazing burgers!!!\nWe were looking for a place to eat in the area and saw this new place. Turns out they were open just a few days ago. We were welcomed right away from the counter \"welcome to hero burger\"  which I have to say doesn't happen anymore. As it was our first time they kindly explained that we could pick from one of their signature burgers or we could build our own. I took the 8 ounce and the sweet potato fries. It's  other your typical fast food place. It took less than 10 minutes for the kitchen to prepare the food which is a great sign as I'm sure this meant that it was cooked fresh and not reheated. I easy blown away by the taste. You can tell they only use fresh ingredients and honestly for the price compared to the other handful of other burger shops and artisanal burger restaurants in the area this blows the rest out of the water. I highly recommend that you give this place a try you will not be disappointed.
