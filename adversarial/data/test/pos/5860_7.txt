3.5 Stars.\n\nLocated inside the Hilton Tudor Arms. The Canopy Mediterranean Grill is an Oasis in a desert of Food choices. As in there aint many places around if your hungry at night.\n\nBonus points for open late. The people here were so chill that we arrived 10 minutes before closing and still served us with smiles.....that is great.\n\nFood is pretty good: Pita sandwiches are the kind you would get from a food truck. Fries were great. Prices are reasonable.\n\nYelp tip: Use your yelp app to check in and receive 15% off your total bill. Good job Yelp!!!
