We have always loved the Sand Bar. It's great. We love the sand on the large outdoor seating area & the colorful lights hanging overhead. The place is so casual. I like taking my shoes off & walking in the sand :-) Their food has always been good. There is always a great crowd of customers there. We went to the new one at Desert Ridge...I like it much better than the location near Shea (they moved). It's like a little vacation to the beach just down the street :-)
