Once again, this is a chain, so you know what you're getting when you walk in the door.\n\nThis particular location isn't my favorite, and I cant really quantify why.  Maybe its because the place is usually packed when I decide to show up.  Maybe I was just bloated and irritated each of the two times that I creased their cushions.\n\nAnyway, I like wings, and I LOVE the BWW (not BBW) Asian Zing.  Its sweet, its spicy... kind of like Charo on the Surreal Life.  You gotta admit, she's pretty hot for being what... 89 years old.\n\nHey you wacky vegetarians... check out their garden burger.  This omnivore says: \"Pretty darn good\".\n\n-Swoop
