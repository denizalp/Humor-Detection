This was one of the worst meals we have ever had in a restaurant and that includes fast food and the ubiquitous chain restaurants.  Paid $120 for a chicken dinner, some raviolis, appetizer and a very average $30 dollar bottle of wine.  I had chicken piccata that was a pallid, poached, old chicken breast covered in a mucus-like lemon sauce.  It is advertised as a oven roasted chicken breast, which still would have given it some color.  Any cook knows that chicken piccata is supposed to be saut√©d giving it rich golden brown color and buttery flavor. My husband had Ravioli al Vin Santo a ravioli filled with spinach and cheese and topped with a sun dried tomato cream sauce.  Most likely from Sam's Club.  It was at least edible, but definitely not worth the price.  You could have a better meal at ANY Denny's, Applebee's, Olive Garden etc. at 1\/3 of the price and it would have been better.  I am a fan of family owned restaurants. What I cant't understand is how they have stayed in business.  The decor is something you would expect to find in the North Woods.  At our table there was a leatherette banquet style chair, a wooden captain style chair that looks like it is  from someone's basement and two rattan chairs.The rest of the decor is a strange mix of items including a weird pair of antlers on the 1970's paneled wall.\n\nWould have to say if we had paid $60 for this meal, I probably wouldn't be writing such a review.  I think if you charge $$$ for a $ meal you deserve the truth.  I could have eaten at Papavero or Francesca's and paid less for a much more enjoyable experience.
