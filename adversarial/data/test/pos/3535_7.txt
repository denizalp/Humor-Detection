The view is everything here! Definitely worth the drive down the strip (and it's ALL the way down the strip).  The vibe is low-key. The food and drinks were good. The music was easy going.  This is a good spot to have a mellow (or even romantic?) night and take in the atmosphere of the Las Vegas city lights.  Keep in mind that ANY night in Vegas can be one cocktail away from being NOT-mellow! Lol so go enjoy and do something different!
