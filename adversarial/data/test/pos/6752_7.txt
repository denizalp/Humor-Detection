First of all, I'm totally guilty of chuckling at the innuendos. You bastards really bring out my inner 8th grader. I came here during happy hour with a group of around 15, and I'm always pleased to see my large group accommodated. I was informed that during happy hour, all mini pizzas were 1\/2 off. I wasn't that hungry, and I'm always hyped for new foods, so I snatched up a menu and looked at the options. I stuck with the BJ's favorite (pretty much the works) and even paired it with their recommended red ale.\n\nThe pizza was just so-so. I loved the buttery, deep dish crust, but the toppings were just warm or room temperature, like half of them were thrown on after the pie was already done. Dislike. The beer was spot on, but subsequent requests for adult beverages were met with a suspicious delay...and then the manager came out to make sure all was well. She seems very reluctant to serve alcoholic beverages, as opposed to other restaurants in the same price range that encourage you to let loose. Maybe they think they're classy?\n\nIn any case, I had the blonde hefeweizen and the Grand Cruz, which came in a small goblet and packed a whopping 10% ABV. Not that you would guess that by tasting it! You may want to be picky about the mixed drinks, however, as my mojito was pretty bland.\n\nI'll come here again and try more pizzas and of course, more of their delicious beer. I won't stay too long, however, unless I finally come across something enticing on the list of traditional entrees.
