My regular hairdresser was out of town for several weeks, but I needed some partial highlights and lowlights really badly.  I was quoted $109 for this, which was pricey, but I decided to take a chance on this new hair salon based on other reviews.\n\nThe Redken color turned out just fine, which was a relief.  However, after my shampoo, I was told that the $109 for my partial highlights did not include a blow out!  Since I felt I was already paying plenty for a partial highlight and lowlight, I didn't even ask about the price of the blow out, especially since I was quoted $54 for a blunt 3\/4\" haircut.  \n\nThis was a huge surprise, because the website doesn't tell you that a blow out is an additional charge.  It was also embarrassing to go about my other Saturday errands looking like I had just stepped out of the shower.  My hair was extremely frizzy and unattractive in the Charlotte humidity.\n\nI also used the Yelp coupon, which allows $75 worth of services for $50 for a first-time customer.  The person who took my payment was completely unfamiliar with this coupon.  Although she initially took it, another woman came running out the door after me to say that there was a problem with the coupon, even though I printed it directly off of this website after making the $50 payment.  After about 10 seconds, she changed her mind and said everything was fine.  Yikes!  This was really embarrassing!\n\nI intend to go back to my regular hairdresser who does a fantastic job of full highlights and lowlights (plus a great blow out) for $100.
