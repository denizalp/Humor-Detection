Average fish, not so great chips. This is one example where size and style might not equal substance - at least for us, at the time we visited, anyway! \n\nWe visited on a weekday evening around 7:00 PM, and it was relatively busy. Admittedly, I found out about this place after seeing pictures of massive onion rings on social media - so obviously, Onion Rings being my middle name, I had to come here and check it out for myself. \n\nWe ordered: a) cod and chips, b) haddock and chips, with a side order of c) onion rings. The fish was fine - crispy, not overtly fishy, and not too much batter. It was perfectly average, and nothing really stood out. The onion rings and chips, on the other hand, were soggier than we were expecting. Not crispy at all, with the moisture from the onion rings seeping into the batter and making more than slightly mushy (you can imagine my tragic disappointment!!). The chips were also quite soggy and weren't the crispy kind some might anticipate from a meal like this.\n\nAmbiance has a very traditional, English-pub, let's-go-back-to-80's-London vibe, which I don't mind and still found very engaging. Service was average; lighting is dim but still family-friendly.\n\nFor two people, with tax and tip, we paid around $40. Not sure we'll be back - the place is charming, but not sure if the food warrants a repeat visit. Note that parking was a bit difficult to find; street parking was pretty limited - we ended up parking at a plaza not too far away instead.
