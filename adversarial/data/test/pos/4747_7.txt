HAHAHA~! \nThis show was great! Full of hot guys, laughs, and sexy bodies ;D \n\nWe purchased tickets online and got seats close to the front stage. Purchasing online is great because you can pick your seats in advance! \n\nThe show its self was very entertaining. I love seeing hot guys dance around and strip for me ;D They even go into the audience and pull people up on stage! Unfortunately I wasn't one of those lucky girls to get pulled up on stage for that extra attention :P lol.\n\nAfter the show, they encourage us ladies to line up and take pictures with the hot guys. But don't be fooled! To take a picture with these hot Aussie's it cost $20 :P
