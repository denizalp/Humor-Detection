I come here often and I've never had a problem, except for this one time; bad breath from the masseuse. Not only did their breath stench from Asian cuisine but so did their hands which were rubbing my face and body. The constant breathing in my face and knowing they were making me smell of their cuisine had me green.\n\nI was gagging and before you know it, I just had to leave. Assure your masseuse chews gum and washes their hands before your massage.
