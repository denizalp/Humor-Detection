Needing to start the day off with something other than a coffee, I rolled into the drive-thru to pick up a McGriddle sandwich. Taking the long approach down the parking lot of the nearby indoor mall, there did not appear to be that much activity, three cars max.  \"Hold on\"...this was the wonderful morning salutation I was met with at the squawk box.  So I waited. Then there was a curt taking of the order.  And so I waited again.  Window...waited and then the dreaded pull around to the front because there was no hash browns. So I did but not before I thought about canceling the order...Waited and waited a little more, then out came the order with a curt \"sorry about the wait.\"  Science and food prep technology pretty much make F'ing a McDonald's impossible.  The only thing that F' up a McDonald's experience is.....the people.
