Best place to go in Old Town in my opinion!  Love going here, it's a great layout, always packed but never too crowded.  The DJs they have come in are what I've been waiting for since I moved here four years ago, they get in great acts. And contrary to popular believe, this place houses the lowest level of scottsdale douchebags that I've seen.\n\nSide note - drink before you get there or stick to beer.  $10 mixed drinks and shots are the cheapest liquor you'll get, but $5 a beer aren't bad.
