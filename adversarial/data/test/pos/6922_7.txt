The beer is excellent, but there are a few drawbacks to visiting the brewery. \n\n1. There is no flight options, just pint or half-pint options of beer. It is my belief that breweries and flights are like peas and carrots (whatever FGump meant by that)\n\n2. You can't purchase mix-n-match 6 packs. I don't understand the logic behind this. \n\n3. The food is average. You are running a brewery, not a restaurant, so focus on what is best and brew and serve great beer. \n\n4. It is rather dark in spots of the venue, not a huge negative, but good napping ambiance. \n\n\nAs a whole, staff is friendly and beer is great. They have Madison classics (Nut Brown and Ambergeddon) and also hop-tastic beers (Hopalicious and Jackson double ipa). \n\nVisit, enjoy the beer, avoid the food, and ask for a flight even though it's not available.
