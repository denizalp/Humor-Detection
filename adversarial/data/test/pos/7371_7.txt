Hole in the wall that truly maintains a hole in the wall feeling. It looks like an old milkshake shop that never got renovated. It has an air of dirty slimeballism and some hipster overtones, not surprising being so close to ossington. The seats look grandma nostalgic and are kept purposely dirty or looking dirty to let everyone feel the rundown vibe. A bit like the old Avro from Queen East without the eclectic side.\n\nThe washrooms downstairs remind me of 1990s china town with exposed wiring on the stairs. Shocking I know.\n\nDark and dingy, 3 button open office space shirt bartender. Dare to go and feel grungy.\n\nIn short a must see 5*\n\nAnd yah they serve drinks.
