I am a complete sucker for freshly popped popcorn, and Pittsburgh Popcorn takes the crown. They are never short of incredible flavors to choose from. For your adventurers, they have some unique flavors like pickle and deep dish pizza, but they can keep it classic with the plain buttered. I dropped by to grab a variety pack for my family, and they devoured it in about a day (we are clearly related). My favorite is the chocolate drizzle and is great for anyone with a strong sweet tooth like me, but the Wisconsin Cheddar is the best for a savory option. \n\nThe employees at this location are so friendly and patient when I ask to sample literally every flavor they have (oops!). Always fast and efficient even during busier hours.
