Location, style, exactly what I was looking for!  Classy but with gay twist.  It is one of the best places to stay in Phoenix.  Except they could have had a better more comfortable bed.  Maybe it was just our bed?  Maybe room 324 is the last room due for a new bed.  \n\nI'll go back and stay here again for sure.  Crossing my fingers about the bed.
