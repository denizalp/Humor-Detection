San Gennaro Feast had fair food, carnival games, prize toys, & carnies -- some of them seemingly drunk. We won a plush purple cow, which we've named Georgettina, through 1 of these inebriated carnies.\n\nThe game was simple enough: out of a bunch of slimy rubber duckies in a small basin, you're to pick 2 (out of 3) that have the same letter written at the bottom. There are only 3 letters in all: S (small), M (medium) & L (large). My 1st pick was \"S\". Great.\n\n\"Do I need to pick these 2 letters consecutively?\" I asked. It wasn't a tactic, but it seemed to work: it looked like the word \"consecutive\" flew right over her head, & she appeared stunned & contemplative for a while. I may have won, but to this day, I'm still not 100% sure. After picking 3 rubber duckies, I just kept saying, \"Purple cow. I want the purple cow. That 1.\"\n\nAs the carnie reached for the purple cow, she explained that she kept hitting her head on the rod, & that the cow served as her cushion. \"If I take 1, I gotta put 1 back, know what I mean?\" she said with slurred speech. As for Georgettina, she's gradually turned into a footstool.. True story.\n\nMost of the fare seemed overpriced. We bought a couple of teeny orders of lobster thingies from some food truck. 17 bucks. That was probably not even mostly lobster, but lobster molecules mixed with lobster-like mystery meat & extenders. I really don't know. The funnel cake was good, but nothing extraordinary.
