SO MUCH ENERGY!\n\n**2016 Yelp 100 LV Challenge #6**\n\nSeriously have to say Dr. Holly Nguyen is one of the Happiest doctor I have ever met..... ahahahah\n\nCame in to get my ear cleaned because it feels like it's just all stuffed in there... but the moment I walked in she checked my ear & said it's CLEAR! so the cleaning wasn't necessary, but she educated me in all my possibilities like allergy making it congested feeling or my ear drums retracting.... \n\nAll in all she is a breath of fresh air when it comes to doctors!
