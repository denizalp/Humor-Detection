I don't get the appeal of this place. \nIt's AYCE; I guess that explains it.\nBut the beef is such low quality that it's virtually like eating pieces of wet cardboard.\n \nI take that back: wet cardboard has more flavor.\n\nThere are much better Korean BBQ restaurants in chinatown like Hobak, and even in the \"Twilight Zone\" Commercial Center.
