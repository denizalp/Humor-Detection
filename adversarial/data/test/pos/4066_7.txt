To have Pierre Gagnaire's only US location just minutes away from home is a gift and the current seasonal \"Grand Tasting\" menu only solidified that sentiment dish by dish, bite after bite.  Our group opted for the 6 course dinner with wine pairing, because if you're gonna do it, do it right.  \n\nThe \"Frog Legs with Morel Mushrooms with Veal Mousseline and Watercress Foam\" was outfuckingstanding.  Perhaps the meatiest pair of amphibian legs I've ever eaten; these fried \"drumettes\" from heaven twirled through the watercress foam provided an unbelievable bite I could have enjoyed 100 times over. The flesh was very much like the love child of a chicken thigh and lobster.   \n\nLife got even better with the \"Roasted Canadian Buffalo Tenderloin infused with Juniper berries, mixed vegetables, bone marrow, pea purée and violin sauce\".  I am uncertain on the merits of \"violin sauce\", but sign me the hell up for more if that's what made it so enchanting!  Such a savory piece of red meat that was perfectly cooked and beautifully plated.  The greens were straight out of Alice in Wonderland with the micro roots and rich, pronounced pea purée.  Making the moment even more magnifique was the \"Pomme Fondante\" side dish that I'd describe as dry potato gratin cooked with a lot of Normandy butter.\n\nService was impeccable throughout with our head server, Sunday, and his staff doing a splendid job.  He was charming, full of knowledge and if he wasn't married with two kids, I'd fix him up with some single friends.     \n\nAdmittedly pretty buzzed at this stage of the meal, we concluded with not one, but five freakin desserts per person, which felt like a trip to Spoiled Kid City.  A couple of memorable sweets included the beautifully made \"Pinot Grigio Cake\", finally granting me the opportunity to eat alcohol, and the wonderful roasted apple dessert with ice cream.\n\nWith excellent company (David V and Suki K) in tow, I was surprised dinner clocked in at around 3 hours.  The flow of the evening and variety of taste was five stars all the way and something I'd definitely be down with doing again and again.
