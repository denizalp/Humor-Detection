Located on Eastern Avenue, south of Silverado Ranch and north of St Rose Parkway, you will find this Chick Fil A near the Lowe's Hardware Store.\n\nThis is pretty much a standard Chick Fil A location like most others I've been to. Not that that is a bad thing. I've always gotten tasty food at decent prices with very friendly service. This location was certainly no exception. \n\nI always love getting my regular order here....a Chick Fil A Deluxe combo (they add on  slice of American cheese and tomato and lettuce to the sandwich) with those luscious waffle fries! The restaurant was clean and every employee was always so happy and friendly. \n\nThis is about as good as fast food can possibly get! I greatly enjoy their food and their service so I can pretty much guarantee that I will continue to be a loyal patron and enjoy their sandwiches whenever the opportunity arises! I just wish there was a location closer to me! Build one on the SW side, dammit!! :P\n\n\n4 stars. Easy.
