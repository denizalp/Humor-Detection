This place is so cute whimsical and sweet tooth lovers dream! It was like a real life Candy Land! My daughter was so excited but because I'm the worlds most ok-ist mom I said no to ice cream AND candy...one or the other...she picked ice cream! As for the ice cream there weren't many options but most of the choices were really good. But the coolest part was the homemade fluff that they torched right in front of u!!
