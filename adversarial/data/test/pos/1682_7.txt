After waiting about 20 minutes for someone to come take our empty bowls and give us our bill, they came after us out the restaurant for a tip. Absolutely ridiculous. Why should I leave a tip for unsatisfying service? Never returning.\n\nUpdate: We returned for a desperate meal and found hair in the pho AND an ALIVE fly in the bean sprout that comes with the pho. Disgusting and disappointed, AGAIN.
