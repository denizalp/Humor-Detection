Ever notice how many poke spots or Hawaiian themed restaurants started popping up in hte last year or two? While most spots have trendy and instagram worthy decor, most places don't really have amazing quality food for the price you pay. Enter Sushi Sama...\n\nGood: Trust the reviews. I was originally downtown and looking to settle for some mediocre downtown place that has poke, but after consulting Yelp, the promising reviews of Sushi Sama had me sold. The restaurant is a bit dated looking, but the food is very fresh. Each bowl is perfectly portioned and doesn't leave you feeling bloated. The ratio of fish to greens and rice is PERFECT. I can't get over how amazing this place is. While sitting down, the take out orders were non stop coming and going, so you know this place has an established clientele.\n\nBad: I wasn't a fan of the tuna in my bowl, it was a bit too salty for my liking so I just ordered the salmon poke bowl next time I went. \n\nBottom Line: For the same price as other poke bowls, this one by far exceeds all my expectations. The food tastes as good as it looks. I mean, I drove from downtown to the east end to purposely eat here...10\/10 would recommend,
