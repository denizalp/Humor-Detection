The food was decently priced, the portions were crazy huge!!!\nMy hubby got a hot dog... **that was funny to watch him eat**\nI had a liquid dinner which consisted of a pill jar full of rum with my name on it [came with a great slushie] 2 jello shots that were in syringes... i stole fries from my mother in law and a piece of her burger. i wasn't too fond of the bacon... and that is always a deal breaker for me **i'm a hardcore bacon addict.**\n\noh!!!!!!!!!! they have spanking sessions there && make you wear a gown. lol.
