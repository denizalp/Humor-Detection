I try to avoid fast food chains in general but once in a while I make an exception for Harvey's and the reason is: Chili peppers!\n\nYes, one of my universal rule in life is \"Everything is better with hot peppers\" and this certainly applies to fast food chain's burgers!\n\nWhat I like at Harvey's is that they have their customization station where you can tell what you want and don't want in it. I always insist on \"lots of peppers\" and ask them to put more if there is not enough. Chili peppers do wonder in masking the cheap meat taste!\n\nThis location is small but convenient for a quick stop along the A-40! It was clean and quick when we visited.
