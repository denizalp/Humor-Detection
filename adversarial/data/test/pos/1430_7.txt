Went here for dinner with a friend when we were shopping in the area.\nThe servers were so friendly and attentive and the restaurant was clean and nicely decorated.  Very elegant and relaxing\nThe food however was just average as far as the maki we ordered.  The rice was slightly too hard and the rolls were really nothing special.\nBut against the usual sub-par sushi joints lining the dt core this place is far better.
