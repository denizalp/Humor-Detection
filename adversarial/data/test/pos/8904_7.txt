I had the pleasure of taking a coworker to Mert's for her first time today. We had an amazing lunch! The place was packed but we didn't have to wait. The waitresses were super busy with big parties who were there for their Sunday afternoon meals but were no less charming and friendly.\n\nI've been once before and I highly recommend the Fried Green Tomato appetizer that I had last time. The chicken is excellent as is the cornbread. I had Salmon Cakes today and they were out of this world! The mac and cheese is delicious as are the greens and green beans. I could have drank a gallon of their sweet tea but I'm glad I stuck with two. We shared a piece of German Chocolate Cake for dessert. I was good and the whipped cream on the side just melted in my mouth.\n\nI don't know why I waited so long to make a return visit but trust me, I'm going to make it a priority to get back there soon!
