Let's say you need a clandestine meeting spot.\nThis is the place.\nIt's a fairly decent sized saloon tucked away in the corner of a small retail plaza. In short, it's off the beaten path and not easy to find unless you know it's there.\n\nWhy is this important?\nBecause when it's time to break anything - from your wedding vows - to fourteen violations of the RICO act, (save for counterfeiting) here's where you want to do it.\n\nThe place is busy, full of locals, noisy in some areas, quiet in the back room, and, here's the best part, FBI wire taps are virtually impossible here due to the noise level.\n\nOr, let's say you're here on the off-chance to humiliate your concubine with 8 x 11 images  of her doing it with her neighbor kid, again, this is the place. \n\nIf you go, try the Sirloin Steak Cobb salad for around twelve bucks. The IPA selection is lame so don't expect a decent beer buzz. In the absence of a nice braciole and a good chianti (and fed's listening devices) Tavern Grille is the next best thing to mama's table.\n\nAnd when you're done here, if it's not too late you can walk next door to Andreoli's Italian Grocery for a nice cannoli and a Yoo-Hoo. \nI can't guarantee there are no bugs in Adreoli's.\nAnd no large crowd of people with which to display pictures of your mistress b'jing little what's-his-nuts next door.
