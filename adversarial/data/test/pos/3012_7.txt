My friend and I were hungry as hell, and after driving by Two Hippies on multiple occasions, but only ever entertaining the prospect of stopping by for a bite, we finally decided to give the place a shot: good f***ing call!\n\nImmediately upon entering the restaurant, Brandon--the young man behind the counter--greets us with a smile, some helpful suggestions, and a candid candor which is all too often absent in the service industry. \n\nWith a smile, he says, \"We run two damn specials, every damn day!\" and he went on to say that a bacon cheeseburger with fries and a drink would only set me back $5.\n\n...WHAT??! \n\nFurthermore, upgrading to double meat, double bacon, double cheese would only cost $1 more.\n\n(SOLD!) \n\nI give Brandon six bucks, and about six minutes later, he brings out my fries and a burger which I can only describe as MONSTROUS... and I chose the VEGETARIAN option! \n\nWhen I say monstrous, I mean this thing was literally so goddamn big that Brandon had to loan me a butcher's knife to cut through the bastard!! I'm 6'5\", and I can palm a basketball, and this burger was TWICE the size of my hand: and it only cost six bucks!!!\n\nNeedless to say, the burger was f***ing excellent! Roasted Hatch chilis and guacamole was overflowing from this masterpiece, and the breaded--that's right, F***ING breaded--portabello patties were nothing short of amazing.\n\nI'm not a religious guy, but if Brandon sold these burgers in a church, I'd be singing Hallelujah every goddamn day!\n\nBottom line: the food is superb, the customer service is spectacular, and the price is AMAZING.  If you haven't given this place a try, I STRONGLY suggest that you do.
