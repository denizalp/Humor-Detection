if you really love Knock Kneed think twice before you continue to read!!!!! \n\n\ni went in today for the usual good food. That wasn't the case today... I sat down waiting for our order to be called and what do you know-in the corner of my eye i see something running. A MOUSE!! No thank you i went up to the cashier and asked for my money back and they all acted surprise \"a mouse? really? that's never happened before!\". My last visit there and i will not be back.
