Charged me $400 to replace a spark plug. I picked my car up the next day, it seemed to be running fine until a week went by. The car went back to how it was before the \"repair\" so I had to bring it in to another shop. My usual mechanic told me that Island Auto did absolutely nothing, didn't change one single thing on the car. \n\nCompletely untrustworthy company, who obviously takes advantage of the little knowledge women have about cars. $400 down the drain.
