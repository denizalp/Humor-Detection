I visited Wing Stop again after 9 months or so. It was as good as I remembered only less so as in it wasn't that good last time and was less good this time I tried the Cajun sauce and I don't really know what it is supposed to be but it was kind of hot and kind of buffalo sauce and kind of jerk-herby and hard to pin down like this sentence it was a little aimless in it's flavor and just didn't do much for me so this was probably my last visit to Wing Stop.  Yup.
