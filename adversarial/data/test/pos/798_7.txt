Pho nho? Pho YES. \n\nVIBE: \nIf you have ever dreamed of a day that your favourite Asian joint would merge with your favourite dive bar--and if you haven't, we'll never be friends-- allow me to present to you a dream come true. The menu is fat, they offer several beers on tap and have bottle list as well. I had:\n\nPINT O' STELLA: \nIt wasn't served in the special Stella glass that makes it clear to everyone around that you are indeed superior to them and their Bud Lite. But it was cold and it was $6. Terribly reasonable. \n\nPORK SRING ROLLS: \nJeese Louise. They bread and deep fry these puppies to artery-clogging perfection and then submerge them in crushed peanuts-- not for the faint of heart, the allergic or the body-conscious. The coating is thick and crusty, and the pork filling is soft and delicious, and the sauces they serve them with are delish. A-MAH-ZING.\n\nRARE BEEF PHO: \nThe phact that I haph nepher eaten pho bepho this is phoking ridiculous. Hot, tasty, massive bowl of noodles. By the time the dish gets to your table the beef is cooked, so I would definitely reccomend this over their cooked beef option. They serve with 'fresh veggies' to toss in, which is basically a plate heaped with bean sprouts. It was like $7, fully yummo, I didn't come close to finishing it, and I think it cured my cold. NICE!
