Synopsis: Want a respite from the Strip? Here's a cozy place that serves up generous portions of Italian food. Menu is all inclusive and the prices are just as hearty as the dishes you're eating.\n\nUnabridged:\"Hole in the Plaza\" would be a more appropriate title, but who cares when their front door is made from a huge wine barrel? There are several signs advising reservations but our party of two was seated within five minutes on a weekday night. \n\nPick your entree from the many menus posted on the walls. Just because you went a block off the strip doesn't mean prices are cheaper, but they do include their well-known bottomless wine. One sip of the red (or white) wine will tell you that it is not choice but you can drink copious amounts of it. Get into the Vegas spirit and try to finish your carafe, you could even pour it over your head for a wine shower. It's bottomless so they'll bring you another. \n\nGarlic bread - our first basket was a bit stale but the second one was fresh, warm, and delicious. I went with the minestrone as my appy, my companion went for the salad. The salad was a bit of a let-down, iceberg lettuce and a bit of sliced veggies on top. The soup was hot and while it wasn't astounding, it was a nice starter. My eggplant parm was a huge slab of eggplant\/cheesy goodness on a plate. Perhaps it's because I had skipped lunch that day but I was satisfied with my meal. My dining partner got about 2\/3 through her lasagna, then threw in the towel. \n\nI don't care for coffee, but I passed my cappuccino to my companion who happily polished off two. She said they were very good.  \n\nTaste-wise Battista's is like a hybrid of Olive Garden and Bucca. Decor-wise it's a bit like a time capsule: signed pics framed on the walls, memorabilia, and the friendly booths that are comfortably broken in from patrons over the years. Our server was cordial and down-to-earth which was refreshing after dealing with aspiring showgirl\/gold-digger waitresses earlier in the day. There was an accordion player who we found slightly annoying but the regulars kept requesting him to play bits of songs sprinkled with corny jokes. (I know, I know, I'm heartless cause I didn't find this elderly man's vocation engaging, but I'm trying to chat with my fam while stuffing my face. Accordion's gotta go.)\n\nFor a memorable experience and laid back surroundings, this is it. For mind-blowing Italian cuisine, you may want to look elsewhere. Vegetarians - you're limited to several pasta choices and the eggplant parm. Vegans - pasta pomodoro: that's it.
