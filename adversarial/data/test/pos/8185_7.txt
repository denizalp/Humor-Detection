Best buffet I've ever been to.  Yet! :) I'm surprised by the low rating, but maybe people missed out on the dinner buffet?  In an hour I consumed:\n\nTwo different types of crab legs\nShrimp\nSushi\nFresh fruit\nVeal\nChicken 8 ways\nRoast\nFish\nSalads\nPasta\nSpinach dumplings\nPizza\nPlus all the fixings...\n\nThe ONLY thing that was lacking was the dessert section.  I wasn't impressed with any of the offerings, though they were all very cutely displayed.  Then again, I was too full of crabs to really care.  \n\nThe best, by far, has to be the crab.  Oh, the crab!  I must have consumed my body weight in crab, the number of empty legs that were left on my plate!  Someone get me a towel to wipe the drool off my keyboard...
