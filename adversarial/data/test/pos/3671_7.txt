Pay attention people, this place is the real deal. I'm in AZ for work and doing my typical thing when traveling and alone for dinner. I tend to look for Chinese take-out to eat in my hotel room. I feel too pathetic to sit in a restaurant all alone eating so would rather work while I eat. \n\nFound this place with the help of Arizona local on Yelp. I was really not prepared for what I found since as I was driving to it, it seemed to be a largely Hispanic area I was driving through. I was worried I was going to find a place specializing in Chung King Chow Mein or another Westernized equivalent. Much to my surprise, I found a strip mall small restaurant with good parking and a hodge-podge of visual food images on the wall with some really authentic stuff. This, coupled with a fairly busy kitchen and wait staff hustling to chop tofu and serve tea in a dining room that really had no decor but was full of Chinese people and my interest radar went up immediately. Panda Express this is not. \n\nThe first few pages of the menu do have all the standard Western favorites but towards the end, you are rewarded with a \"Hong Kong\" style menu and it has a lot of great stuff on it. Scrambled eggs and Bitter Melon, Chicken Fried Rice with Salted Fish, and great looking seafood dishes too! Upon placing an order, I sat and waited and could hear the kitchen staff yelling things at each other in Chinese (just like in Hong Kong) and knew that things were going to turn out all right. \n\nThis is a great little find with affordable prices and large portions. In addition, the authenticity is awesome for being in the middle of the desert southwest! The staff was very friendly and clearly hard-working. It is now on my list of definite recommendations when in the PHX area!
