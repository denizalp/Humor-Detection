Coming back from EDC I really dont want to be rude and irritable, but in this situation its impossible not to be. Having Vegas weather be unbearingly be in the 100s I wanted our room to be iceberg cold. Putting the AC to the lowest setting of 60 and turning the fan high, the room was still stuffy and warm. We called house services a total of 3 times and even left because they were taking so long. We waited a total of 6 hours and called once more when we came back from eating (the room still stuffy and groggy). An engineer finally came in 5-10 minutes and I really tried to express how thankful I was for him to come. When he told me the AC was actually blowing out 59 degree air, he told me he'd ask house services for a fan, agreeing that the room was indeed stuffy (was probably because we were on the 28th level. But he never came back and there was no follow up call.\n\nTldr: We called house services 4 times, waited 6 hours, room was still shitty and hot and house services can SUCK MY DICK
