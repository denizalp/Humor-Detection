The atmosphere at Civello is so pleasant! I get my hair done once a year mostly because I've never had any great or stellar experiences with my haircuts. I tried Civello because of all the stellar reviews on Yelp and it did not disappoint. \nFor my haircut, I told Kenedi two inches off and a lot of layers- she gave me exactly what I wanted. :) \nGreat service and great location... prices are higher.If you're like me and get your hair done once a year I think the price is justifiable.
