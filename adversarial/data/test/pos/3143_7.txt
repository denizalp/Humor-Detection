Since Wolfie is one of my favorite chefs, I have been jonesing to come here for quite a while. \n\nInitially, I wanted to check out their all day happy hour menu served at the bar area only, but our group was starving and wanted a meal.\n\nWe decided to order the chef's tasting menu for the table.  They did not tell us what would be on the menu and that it would be a surprise.  \n\nWhere do we start on this buffet of disappointment?\n\nIt was utterly the most worst meal that I have had in Vegas. I have never left so much food on my plate in a restaurant in my ENTIRE life.  Even the guys could barely finish their plates.  \n\nWe started off with complimentary bread, a mixed greens caesar salad and 2 mini bite-size crab cakes, calamari, then pesto gnocchi, flank steak, concluded by a shareable dessert plate.\n\nPesto gnocchi was just not good.  Not sure where it fell flat but it did.  It was a lifeless glob of mediocrity.  The pesto was muted by the heavy cream and the gnocchi's texture was just completely off.  We literally sampled maybe 2 to 3 pieces of the gnocchi.\n\nFlank steak - this could arguably be the worst dish.  The meat came very rare, which we did not mind.  The meat quality was very poor which translated into a very poor decision made by the chef.  Cooking the meat rare made it so rubbery and chewy and difficult to swallow.  You would think that if the meat quality isn't great or if you are trying to get rid of inventory in the kitchen by pawning it off in the chef's tasting menu - then at least make it edible and cook the meat through.  Faulty execution.\n\nIt is highly concerning when the best part of the meal was the salad and the bread bowl.  \n\nThe dessert was an epic fail as well.  We barely touched the rubbery STALE cakes which were almost tasteless.  It was almost an anomaly because it appeared to be look like it would have some flavor or richness but it tasted like bad buffet desserts that have been sitting out for a long time. \n\nService was okay but disjointed - the one thing they were excellent on was refreshing the water. \n\nI'm so pissed that I forgot to apply the 20% off to our $300 \"dinner\".  It was a waste of food and money and time.  Honestly, I wish my meal was just comped.  Ugh - beyond annoyed.\n\nIt was so late and we were the last table of the night so we didn't bother to complain.  Plus, how awkward is it to report to the server, uhh your chef sucks and this is his menu?\n\nIf you do go here, my recommendation is to order from the regular menu or happy hour menu - that is probably the better way to go.\n\nLocation: Crystals at Aria on the 2nd floor
