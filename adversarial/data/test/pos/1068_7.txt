For a Sushi place off the strip. It's pretty damn good! Plus I've lagged on this review when they deserved it the day of.. or after. Whatnot.\n\nThey have lunch special rolls here. And I'll say.. its BOMBDOTCOM. Simply Delicious. Get the Salmon Roll and definitely the Lobster.\n\nLUNCH TIME. Remember. Also... these people are Korean not Japanese. Don't get confused.\n\nThey also have neat little names for their rolls... the \"Heart attack\" roll.. and \"kiss me\" haha.\n\nI can't say much other than.... EAT HERE! Its a pretty good price. And delicious.\n\n\nI feel like a fatty...
