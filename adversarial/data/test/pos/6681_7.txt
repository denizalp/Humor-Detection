My boyfriend and I went to see the Color Purple at the Smith Center. Unfortunately we could only get balcony seats. My boyfriend who is scared of heights almost freaked out when he seen how high we had to sit. The seats were close together and most people had to constantly stand when someone wanted in or out. Don't even think about going to the restroom!\nThe stage was so far, it could have been my next door neighbor with a wig on playing multiple characters and I wouldn't have known since you could not make out faces. I also noticed people sitting in the box seats on the left side had to hunch over to look down at the play, it looked uncomfortable. A few fortunate people brought binoculars, lucky them. Since this was out first time there we learned a lesson. My daughter and I are going to see Wicked and you better believe we got some of the best seats. \nThe place is nice and the staff is great but the balcony seats are not worth paying for.
