Nine of us came here to celebrate my wife's birthday. When my mother-in-law called, they told her that they don't take reservations, but when we got there they said they had two large parties already scheduled for that night, so I'm still not clear as to whether they actually would have accepted a reservation if they had known the size of our group.\n\nBecause we didn't have a reservation they told us it would be an hour wait if we wanted to be split into two tables or a two hour wait to sit as one group at the high top tables. We opted for the hour wait and agreed to split into two groups. After nearly an hour had passed, and watching the Yelp app showing that we were nearly next on the list, we checked on our table. At that point they started to claim that it would be another hour before we could get in. It appeared that they were trying to wait for two tables to clear at the same time, rather than hold one open until a second one cleared. As a result, it seemed to me that other people were being sat before us. We almost left, but decided to give it a few more minutes. I don't know if they could that we were going to leave, but within 20 minutes we were notified that our tables were ready, although it still took another 10 minutes before we were actually seated. So, nearly 90 minutes after arriving we were finally ready to begin ordering.\n\nThe concept itself is fairly straightforward. There's a burner\/hotplate\/grill in the middle of the table, you order from the menu of 38 items, cook the items you order on the grill, and eat. The cost is $25 per person and it is all-you-can-eat. To ensure that you're eyes aren't bigger than your stomach, they will only allow you to order 4 items at a time, there is a two-hour time limit on how long you can stay at a table, and they charge you $5 for any items not eaten (basically a restocking charge).\n\nAs for the food, there are many options and it's fun to try new things. Among the more common items we tried were the garlic chicken, Korean Fried Chicken, pork belly, and calamari. The more exotic items included baby octopus, shrimp (with heads and tails still attached), and beef tongue. The expressions on my kids face were priceless as they put an octopus on the grill or learned to devein a shrimp, but they soldiered on actually really liked the food. My 12-year-old said his favorite was the spiced pork bulgogi while I enjoyed the beef tongue the best, although it was sliced so thin it didn't really have the typical tongue flavor.\n\nFood service was fast although my one complaint was that every time you asked for a refill on your drink they took the entire glass and actually refilled and returned it which took a while. Come on, plastic glasses aren't that pricey and a restaurant should have enough so that your server can get you a new soda and remove your old one at the same time.\n\nAlso, they should really take reservations as they almost lost our entire business and we likely won't ever return because of the wait. Once we were in though, we did enjoy the food and the experience so if you don't mind waiting or just want to plan to do some shopping at Tempe Marketplace first, you may want to check it out.
