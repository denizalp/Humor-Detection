I went through tons of reviews and couldn't find anything helpful about where to sit, so let me focus on that for a minute.  The very front row is tables 1 through 8 and they are more expensive and considered VIP for no other reason than because they are the first row.  You won't get any interaction with the guys AT ALL.  I think all of us in the first row were disappointed that we had paid more and the guys always went to the tables behind us.\n\nMy sister-in-law and I were at table 8, seats 1 and 2 (1 and 2 are the front seats at the table) and the only time a guy came to the front row was when he stood on table 7 and poured beer all over himself.  This may have been exciting for everyone in the audience but not for those of us at tables 6, 7, and 8, who had to turn away to not get beer in our faces but it still got all over our hair and clothes.  Thankfully a worker gave us towels. (The beer was planted.  We saw a worker place it there beforehand, so don't worry that your drink will be wasted!)\n\nThe theater is tiny, about the size of two classrooms, so even if you are in the last row, you are still very close.  Behind the VIP tables is the next row and this is where you SHOULD sit, tables 9-15. They guys were always going in that area.  Behind this is the back row which wraps around to the sides of the theater.  Sitting here is also better than VIP because they got lots of interaction too.  \n\nThe show itself was lots of fun.  The guys certainly aren't the best dancers but they are very nice to look at!  They dressed in costumes and striped them off to only thongs.  They never showed the naked front but always turned around and showed their naked butts. \n\nThey pulled a grandma on stage which was hilarious and also, three ladies were chosen to participate in a fake orgasm contest.  I read that if you want to be selected for these things to wear a sash or veil, but only one girl with a veil was chosen to go on stage.\n\nAfter the show a sofa was brought out on stage and ladies lined up for a picture with them for $20 each.  Also, I don't know if this happened to everyone who attended the show, but my sister-in-law and I were stamped on our wrists on our way into the show for free entrance to LAX night club and free drinks until 12.  It's easy to get to using the indoor walkway.  We showed up after the show and pretty much had the dance floor to ourselves and they give you free vodka cranberries.  After midnight it was so crowded you couldn't even dance so we left.\n\nAnyway, it was a fun show and I'd recommend it for a girls night but just remember not to sit in VIP (first 8 tables) because there is NO interaction with the guys.
