I expected a beach. I was not expecting this. Tempe Beach Park has playgrounds, skating, boats for rent, and yes, a beach. It's hot as hot here, even in September. So be warned. I don't know if you can actually go into the water and swim. I didn't try.\n\nFree parking, at least where I was.\n\nYep, lots of people Pokehunting too.
