I can't believe people haven't tried this place yet, especially after janelle's great review!\n\nSo let me do a refresher of this place.  \n\nWhen approaching it one should be very cautious to not let first impressions fool you.  The sign is very colorful but in one of the most dreary areas, let alone strip malls.  I'll be honest I would probably not even stop at the nearest light anytime after 5 pm ( yes that sketchy) but again first impressions are deceiving!!!!\n\nBut don't let second impressions fool you either, because on entering you will literally think \" what happened to harvey's!!!\". The seating and layout are a perfect emulation of any local harvey's!\n\nAnd if you are hoping the staff will impress you..... They won't.  They aren't the most happy people but they are quick and efficient about getting you your food.\n\nSo after all these impressions its really the final but most important impression that should blow you away... the food!\n\n I had the jerk chicken combo and at first i wasn't impressed with my rice and chicken until I put it in my mouth and WOW! The spices are just amazing and the chicken is so soft!  I ve tried jerk chicken before and haven't been a fan, but this dish definitely made me want to try more jerk.  \n\nI dont know about the roti or the other dishes, but if janelle is right and this is the real jamacian food....I think I know where my next vacation is going to be!\n\nAnd to top it off everything is around 7$ so it's not a bad deal to taste a little caribbean, west of the 410.
