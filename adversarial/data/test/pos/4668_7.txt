First impression?  Spectacular and gorgeous!  We decided to dine here during convention upon rec from my parents.  Since I adore Italian cuisine I was definitely game.\n\nI wish I could remember the name of the cocktail I ordered because it was really tasty.  I do remember that it had blueberry vodka and sage and was really refreshing.  They were featuring a special app with squash blossoms and zucchini.  Yes please!  Fried squash blossoms are such a treat during the summer for my family that I had to try LAVO's version.  I must confess that my Italian Great-Grandmother's recipe is better, but I did enjoy having them in a restaurant.  \n\nFor my entree I selected the ravioli.  It was stuffed with cheese and so much better than what you purchase in the grocery store.  The filling was a little salty for my taste, but it could have been the cheese since some varieties can be a little on the salty side.  Other than that, they were good.\n\nOur server was as sweet as she could be and gave good recs as far as what to order.  I always appreciate that info.  I would have loved to have ordered dessert, but I was waaaay to full to indulge.  Next time...
