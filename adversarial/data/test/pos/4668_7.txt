I have never been to Kiku Sushi personally, but I am now working all day Saturday instead of having the day off because my employee who was supposed to be here went to Kiku last night and now he, his girlfriend, and her daughter are all puking their guts out.  STAY AWAY!! I wish zero stars were possible ...
