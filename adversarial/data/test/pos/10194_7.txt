This is our go-to after dinner drink spot! It is super classy, there is usually live music on the weekends, and all in all, it is just a great place to sit back, relax and sip on great classic cocktails while mingling with your significant other or friends. To the guys: If you want to impress a date, bring her here after dinner! Their cocktails have unique ingredients that you can't just get anywhere. My favorite is the French which has gin, fresh lemon, and champagne. Specialty cocktails are $12 but they're worth it, especially when there is live music. We'll be back soon!
