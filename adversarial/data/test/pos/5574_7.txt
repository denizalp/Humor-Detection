Let's get it all out on the table up front, I like chicken, I mean really like the yard bird. I'm certain that I may be a chicken aficionado based on the countless times I've enjoyed the bird as my main meal.  Therefore, one can understand the excitement and Joy I experienced when I saw the Hoffman's Homemade Chicken sign being erected on a main thoroughfare near my home.  My mind raced 'homemade chicken 5 minutes from my home!' Tonight was the night, my family and I decided to go out for dinner. When the restaurant discussion began they unanimously voted Fleming's  for a nice juicy steak, they were all so excited! While driving to Fleming's I took a left turn as once again I saw the regal chicken on the newly constructed Hoffman's sign.  At that point I announced my veto rights to the restaurant as the financier of the venture and let the family know we are going to the chicken dinner of our young hot lives and the Hoffman's sign was so cool it has to be great!  \n\nThey didn't buy it, but we all got out of the car in anticipation of a great family dinner with dads favorite meal, chicken.  When we went to the door it was locked.  There were people in there it was just locked.  As we turned to leave a woman opened the door and and said 'oh I'm sorry we are closing early tonight!' I led my family back to the car hat in hand and headed to Fleming's.   As I ate my perfectly prepared steak with brussel sprouts I pondered, that must be some goooooood chicken if they can afford that cool sign and to close early too!' I'll never look at the Hoffman's chicken sign the same way ever again.
