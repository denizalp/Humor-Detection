I'll sum this restaurant up with bullet points. \n\nA Latino chef doing hibachi. Called me Bro and openly complained how tired he was and how he couldn't wait to leave. \n\nAsked four times if I wanted rice. Said no all four times. Still given rice. \n\nBathroom was a wreck. Needs repairs but also needs the vulgarity etched into the mens stall i. E.  Ethnic slurs removed, Pronto. Keep it classy, Osaka. \n\nWoman at the door obviously could not be bothered. Hated her job. Could not smile. \n\nThey charged our group of five for the entire table at hibachi. Didn't track of two different families, just slapped the whole bill at us so gratuity would be forced on us. \n\nWater and tea needed to be refilled often, just sat there for five to ten minutes. \n\nThe hibachi chef's oil squirt bottle was a naked kid looking like he was urinating all over the table. \n\nNever. Ever. Returning.
