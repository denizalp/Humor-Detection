-A nice, variety of Chinese food, plus some salad bar fixins, jello, desserts, and some American food.\n\n-Seven buffet islands, plus the Sushi area = eight total areas of food to choose from.\n\n-Clean restaurant. Pleasant decor.\n\n-VERY friendly, coridial staff.\n\n-Food was really good & fresh for a Chinese buffet. Tasty & delicious!\n\n-Drinking water did not taste filtered (usually from the soda machine), it tasted like Phoenix tap.\n\n-Convenient parking.\n\n-The ladies restroom smelled like sewer (not like someone who just made a stinky in the stall, but the foul aroma of a sewage drain)...\n\n-Despite the smelly restroom, I would definately eat here again!
