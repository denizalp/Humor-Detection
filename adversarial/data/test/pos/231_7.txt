Oh god I hate this place so much.\n\nI used to think it was impossible to ruin the simple art of the hamburger.\n\nYou can cover it in oil, douse it in sauce, slice it in quarters, replace the bun with lettuce, even make it out of unicorn meat.     It does not change the simple fact that this is as close as you can come to a perfect food.\n\nThen why does M:BRGR fail so miserably?\n\nIt's a multifaceted problem.   \n\nBeing in the heart of King West is usually a mood-kill in itself, but other burger joints like Craft are able to make the most of being an oasis of meat on a street full of meat-beaters.     M:BRGR takes a different approach altogether, actually ratcheting up the douchebag quotient by coating the decor in faux sophistication, dark interior and date-rape aesthetic.   You want to shower before you've had a single bite.\n\nThe hamburger is supposed to be the most simple of foods.   The sure-fire bet on a gamble of a menu.   M:BRGR decides to remove this ease by making the ordering process the most complex endeavor in the history of the restaurant business.     Half of the ingredients offered you cannot pronounce.  The other half you do not want.    All of them you cannot afford.   You need to use calculus to decide what you're eventually going to order.   You still fail the final exam.   You feel stupid and want to drop the class.  \n\nThe restaurant makes the massive mistake of buying into the idea that \"price\" is the most important variable on a menu.    They even name one of their concoctions \"the hundred dollar burger\".  The last place to name a burger after a price point was Carl's Junior with the \"Six Dollar Burger\"... and that was an ironic piece of fast-food art that actually cost $3.39.    The hundred dollar burger actually costs one hundred dollars.  It's just plain stupid.      It's not that expensive burgers are not good...  Bymark's is one of the best plates in town.  Mildred's Temple has a wonderfully delicious burger, Oddfellows had a city classic on it's hands...  it's that the goodness of a burger has nothing to do with the price, or with what they say the price should be.  \n\nAll of this criticism would be rendered moot if the burgers were truly a cut above all other food items in the city.
