I cant believe people flock to this stand just cuz it was on a frickin TV show..  I have friends who have owned stands in the Market for years and know for a fact this guy has had health code issues.  Before that show aired this stand was a joke.  If ya wana see something fun check out when dudes daughter and her friends are getting hammered and acting sloppy in the Market Cafe bar.  Now thats a sight to see.  Cmon people, dont be sheep...there are better gyro places in Cleveland!
