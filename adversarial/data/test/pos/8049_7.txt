What piece of my soul Vegas took the night before, Stripburger returned...\n\nI have to admit expectations were low, as was my will to live the afternoon I visited Stripburger. But was very happily surprised upon entering the open-air burger bar.\n\nNow, before I could really take this place in, I ordered a beer - because that is the only thing to do when you are hunger over. Then, I looked at the menu. Firstly, 'Adult Shakes' I mean, ice-cream + alcohol, this place could be heaven.\n\nThen, the burgers. From classic to Mexican, they had it all. My fianc√© went the Bacon Cheese Burger. Because Bacon. Under the recommendation of our server, I ordered the Blue Cheese Burger with Crispy Onion. Now, I don't want to alarm you. BUT, also bacon. Yes, our server recommended adding bacon to the Blue Cheese burger. I'll note here in my review that I am 99.9% sure she was an angel, but I digress. Because ginormous burgers are never enough we also ordered the sweet potato fries.\n\nSpoiler alert. I died. \n\nThese burgers were insanely good. While Vegas isn't known for 'real' these burgers were the exception. Juicy medium cooked beef, perfect toppings (they didn't skimp at all) and better buns than you see at a Vegas review... (well, maybe). \n\nI love you Stripburger. Vegas, while my liver cannot handle you, my stomach is ready to come back here.
