Less than stellar BDubs in Champaign. On a Monday night with not much going on in sports we waited a few minutes to even be acknowledged at the Host stand for service. Others who entered later also had to wait for any acknowledgement. \n\nRestaurant was dirty, many tables needed bussing. Server was inattentive, didn't refill waters, so we had to flag down a coworker. The wings were good, but subpar experience overall.
