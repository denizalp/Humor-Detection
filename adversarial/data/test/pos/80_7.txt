So one last time\nI need to be the one who takes you home\nOne more time\nI promise after that, I'll let you go at..Hell's Kitchen! - Ariana Grande (one last time)\n\nFull disclosure - I'm not a fanboy of his show but who hasn't heard of it and it's hard to ignore the hype when you see it from the outside at night. It really attracts people to want and try. I walked in on a weekday without a reservation thinking it wouldn't be difficult and to my surprise, they told me if I didn't have reservation for the day, they can make a reservation for me the next day. I took a quick scan around the restaurant in disbelief and while it was busy, it wasn't full. Note to self - marketing ploy. It wasn't a big deal because there's so many options to choose from and I'm a sucker for hype so we went to Bacchanal instead and returned here the next day. \n\nIt was the same the next day when we returned - quite busy but enough empty tables that they could definitely accommodate more. We took some pictures since it was an open kitchen and decor is still new since they opened in January. \n\nFood wise, I had to order the Hell's Kitchen burger for obvious reasons. The waitress said it was really spicy but I've been eating more spicy foods recently so I was up for the challenge. It had a kick to the burger but wasn't as bad as she made it out to be. Pretty good size and filled me up. I wouldn't say it was memorable but the decor of the restaurant I'm sure would please the fans of the show. Overall it was a pleasant meal - I had no expectations since I don't watch the show but it's good to have a place like this in Vegas.
