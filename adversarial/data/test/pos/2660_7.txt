First time here....my daughter recommended it as she comes here often.   So glad we came!\n\nOZZIE provided EXCELLENT service!  Prompt, courteous and he even laughed with me when I asked him if his parents were Ozzie Osborne fans.\n\nThank you Ozzie for a wonderful experience!  Will definitely visit when we're in Vegas again!!
