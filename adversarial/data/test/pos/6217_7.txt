Am I glad I left STADIUM. CLUB....no good TVs to watch the game on (most are way too small) and there is no where to sit! They don't even have the volume on to hear the game! The only people in front of the big TVs are the cliquey fan club members, Who RUDELY hoard all the chairs for themselves.... when there were plenty to share!\n\nThe service is terrible, the glasses are dirty, and there was an instance where they just took my money right from my table without asking! I guess the waitress thought it was her tip! WOW!!!!! (When I told the bartender what had happened she didn't give me my money back. I was still going to tip, but she REFUSED TO GIVE ME BACK MY MONEY THAT HER WAITRESS STOLE FROM ME!!! (So watch your money in that place!)  Instead, she just said \"Sorry\" and choose to do NOTHING! She didn't even care that her waitress took my money without my permission! \n\nAs for the people running the \"fan-club\" well they are rude, cliquey, and complete DORKS!!!....Nothing like REAL Packer fans from Green Bay! They claim to know Green Bay and they don't know anything about it! I'm never going back there! What a bunch of MORONS and wanna-be's! (Even thought it was cool that a FAN, name St. Vincent, came and visited their bar.  Who cares!?!?  He's just a fan who is not a player...hahaha!!! What a dumb thing to be bragging about!)\n\nBefore the game starts this guy named Jim who gets up on a stage and dressed like a clown!  He likes to hear himself yell,  so nobody can hear the pregame show or even WATCH THE KICK OFF!!! (WTH-?) He seems to think that people are there to see him, instead of the Packers..... nobody cares about this guy! He's a NOBODY....who by-the-way, tried to steal the identity of an original Packer fan club... Shady!!!!  Get a clue!!! \n\nYeah they give out prizes, but it overlaps the game and it interferes with interviews at the half time show!!! (Duh!) Packer fans are not there for shenanigans. They are there to watch the game. Shenanigans are fine, if that's what you're into, but do it at an appropriate time, NOT DURING THE GAME!\n\nSo I went to a different bar with the huge TV and they have the volume turned up so you can CLEARLY HEAR AND SEE the game, watch the kick off, and even hear interviews at halftime...(WOW, there's a concept...watching the ACTUAL Packers... instead of watching the Packer-fan-club-dorky-members boast about themselves, while yelling and then running up and down aisles as if they're hot or something ...when they're not....)   \n\nBest yet, other bars don't charge for iced tea (like bars are supposed to)....so get a clue so-called Arizona \"Packer Bar.\"....you SUCK.....no, you SUPER-SUCK!!!
