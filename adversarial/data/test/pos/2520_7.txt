Want to be up sold? Me either.  \n\nApparently cars with 41,000km on it should have their engine flushed? a total 4 additional costs were attempted on me by this place. \n\nIf you want weird little kids punching around your car and up selling shamelessly (doing what they're told clearly) then stop in here. \n\nAvoid this place,  go to your usual spot.  Being pressed for time will cost you in the long run.
