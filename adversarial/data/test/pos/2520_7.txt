Disclaimer- The food is definitely four stars, but the service is one to two stars depending on the day. Therefore, I'm giving Pho Saigon 8 an overall rating of three stars.\n\nMy mom and I have been coming to Pho Saigon 8 since my family first moved to the valley, almost four years ago, and the customer service over the years has just gotten progressively worse. The staff was great when we first started coming here and then as of lately, the staff has just been rude and unpleasant to be served by. Although this restaurant is not close to home, we still drive the distance when we have that craving! We used to come at least once a week, but now every other month or so.\n\nWe usually come for lunch on the weekend, so it's always busy during that time. The wait time can be a hit or miss.\n\nI am a creature of habit and order the same exact thing every time. I order the #11 (Pho Tái) which is the broth, noodles, and rare eye round. As far as the pho goes, the broth is always hot and never warm like other Vietnamese restaurants I have been to. It's rich in flavor and there is a good amount of rice noodles in the soup. I love the rare eye round because it's not fatty. A plate of garnishes are provided for the table to share. The traditional Thai basil, jalapeños, lime, and my favorite, crunchy bean sprouts. I love my pho with extra lime, and if more garnishes are needed, you can always ask for more! You might have to ask more than once though because they can be quite forgetful. Also, condiments are a must! A nice squeeze of Sriracha and Hoisin always go into my pho.\n\nIf I'm hungrier than usual, I'll order a plate of the crispy fried egg rolls to share. The crispy fried spring rolls are a favorite amongst my family! There are four per order and it comes with four leaves of fresh lettuce as well as the dipping sauce. I'm not too sure what the dipping sauce is made of, but it's delicious! The spring rolls are filled with pork and a variety of veggies.\n\nOverall, the best place for pho in the Henderson area! The food is great and satisfies my craving every time. The service isn't the best, but it'll do.
