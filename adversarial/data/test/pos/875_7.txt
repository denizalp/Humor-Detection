Dig n Save is a perfect 5 if you go into with the following assumptions:\n\n- It won't be terribly clean or organized (Although the bathrooms are actually fine, so no need to fret there)\n- You need to visit there for a long time (over 2 hours) if you're planning on leaving with a good haul\n- Don't go into it looking for anything in particular\n- You're going to encounter both kooky items and kooky people while there.\n- You'll likely end up buying something that you can't really use (i.e I always end up buying clothes that're actually for women by mistake), but since everything is so cheap, it doesn't matter much.\n\nRemember all of that when you enter dig n save, and you'll leave with a heckuva experience and loads of cheap goods. Shopping here certainly won't be for everyone, but it's worth trying at least once.
