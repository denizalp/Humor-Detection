What a friendly, clean, and tasty selection of olive oil and vinegar. \n\nI visited this place last week and bought a large \"Tuscan Herbed\" olive oil and large \"Black Mission Fig\" vinegar so that I could make some healthy salads. They bottle your selection right there for you while you wait.\n\nI've since tried the combination of fig vinegar and herbed olive oil on my salads over the past week, and I am very impressed! \n\nI will definitely go back for more when I am done.
