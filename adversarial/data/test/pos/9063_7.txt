I've been to this place so many times, it's awesome.\n\nEverything is totally customizable. The servers are soo nice.\n\nThey've put up with me almost throwing up before.\n\n(Not because of the drink, but because I usually come here super hungover if I'm staying at the Met before hand)\n\nAlso, they have a stamp card!! WOOT WOOT :)
