\"Thai\" offers so many great pun opportunities for naming a restaurant, and it's great to see an establishment take advantage of it. Wild Thaiger is a top 5 use of \"Thai\" in a pun for a restaurant.\n\nOther contenders:\n\n\"Thaired Elephant\" - for a slow paced dining experience that you will remember\n\"Thai-Died\" - for a restaurant inherited by hippies\n\"My Thaip of Food\" - to cast a wide net\n\"Thair Cuts\" - to draw in confused people who want to get their hair cut but might buy Thai food if you get them in the restaurant\n\n\"Wild Thaiger\" is a pretty good name for this place though. It serves Thai food, which is pretty important for a restaurant to do if it's going to have \"Thai\" in its name. No feral waitresses or staff appeared during our visit, which led me to believe the \"Wild\" element is probably just stylistic.\n\nSo 5 stars.\n\nGood for: people who appreciate puns in restaurant names.\nBad for: people who want to see wild animals. I would recommend a zoo for that.
