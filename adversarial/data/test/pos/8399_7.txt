I have stumbled across JC's on FB because the Harry McGraw band was playing on a Saturday night, I am a HUGE fan of this local musician. Luckly JC's is right down the street for me. Sat night me and my daughter decide to go down and listen for an hour maybe have a few appetizers. \nI rather eat off an appetizer menu, than order a full meal....anywhere, especially if they have good apps,........no cheese sticks, chicken wings, basket of fries, nothing fried.\nWhen I saw the bar menu, I totally got excited. This is my type of place.\nFirst, the charcuterie board was great. Meats, cheeses, pickles, it was great. I think it could of used some crustinie's, or some type of bread with it.....but still it was great.\nPrime rib sliders.....off the hook. I could of ate 12 of them, so good.\nDaughter had the Big Mac Martini.....Mac & Cheese, bacon and jalape√±o in a martini glass.......HOLY F**)$ that was great. Forget this tiny martini glass.....GIVE ME A BUCKET OF THIS!!! So nice to see my daughter's eyes light up when she took that first bite.\n\nNeedless to say Harry McGraw and awesome bar appetizers, I have now found my Saturday night spot.......See you next Saturday!!
