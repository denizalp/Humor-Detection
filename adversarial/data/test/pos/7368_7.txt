Really helpful handyman who has helped me clean and caulk my bathtub.  He thoroughly cleaned the mould from my tub using bleach, dried it and re-caulked it for $120.  He even offered to clean a dust vent while he was at it.  Superb service.\n\nIf you're like me and you have identified small home improvement ideas but you are not handy then this is a service you really should consider.  I'm tired of waiting around for a friend to help.  I've once waited 3 years for a hook to be installed!  \n\nMy tip is to combine all your small tasks and have him come by to help you in one shot.  His hourly rate is $60\/hour.  I've had him help me build some new furniture and move out the old stuff.  I can say for certain that my life has significantly improved now that I have a handyman.
