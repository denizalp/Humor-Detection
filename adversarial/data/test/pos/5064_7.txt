I had no clue what I was getting into...\n\nFloating? Relaxing? Quiet time? Solitude? Why not give this kind of thing a try?\n\nSo I built up the courage to finally go and I have to say that I really enjoyed the entire experience. \n\nThey say it takes a few times to really get into and be able to relax and I can understand because that's how the salt caves have been for me. It took me three sessions to actually fall asleep! This place also has a salt room if the floating wasn't relaxing enough.\n\nHere's how it all went down ~\n\nI was greeted by a very friendly girl who explained everything to me.\nEveryone gets a private room that comes with a beautiful shower, water, flip flops, earbuds, shampoo & body wash along with towels. Prepare to take a shower and get in there all nice & clean. After you get into your bath chamber the experience really begins and you control your lights. The soft music plays in the beginning to help you relax and then it gets completely quiet. Honestly, I didn't know what to do with myself and it was all a little weird. Before your session is over the music comes back on intended to wake people up. \n\nI need to go back to see if I am really able to let go of everything. Salt rooms work for me so this should as well. \n\nAfterwards you take another shower and I can say that my skin & hair have never felt better. I was so relaxed I just wanted to go home & crawl into bed.
