I would rate zero stars if I was allowed. I had a clogged toilet and had a coupon to use Plumbing Medic to \"unclog any clog for $65.00.\" First technician was two hours late for the job. Without hesitation, took the toilet off and tried to snake it. Immediately said that this was a big problem and needed to get his supervisor out with a camera for a better inspection. After sending the camera down the sewer line they were convinced it was roots in the line, which they believed were located under my son's closet. Within 5 minutes I had a typed, emailed estimate for $3280.00 to jackhammer, dig, cut out, replace main sewer line, etc, and they could start working immediately. I asked if there were any other ways to go about this and was told no, we see this all the time, we know what we are doing, our work is guaranteed, etc. \nGot another opinion and they came out and went through our clean out in the front of our house, something Plumbing Medic did not even think of doing. They found a clog, which was a plumbers snake tool in the line and they were able to fish it out and removed some other debris that had built up in the line. There were no evidence whatsoever of roots in the line. They charged me $500.00 and now everything works perfectly. \nI'm really just angry that they wouldn't consider any other alternatives to our problem, and went straight to the \"big job.\" Proceed with caution.
