I actually quite liked him, probably because I expected a lot worse after reading his reviews on ratemds.com. He definitely likes to joke, so you have to like that but he was prompt to diagnose and then remove what was bothering me.\n\nThe only issue I had was that they're only taking cash or cheque! And I obvously had neither. \n\nStaff was very friendly until I told them that I won't be able to pay that day, I ended up coming back with a cheque the next day. :) Who carries $170 in cash?\n\nAlso, it was not easy to reach them by phone. I wanted to reschedule the appointment my family doctor gave me and it took me two days for someone to actually pick up. Lady on the phone was super rude and told me that I absolutely can't get an earlier appointment because they're full.\n\nAll in all I'd probably go there again.
