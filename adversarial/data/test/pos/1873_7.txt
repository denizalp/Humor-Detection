From what I've read from all the other reviews here on yelp, this particular Starbucks seems to be exactly what everyone else is saying. They are slow as hell, customer service sucks, and from my experience, they hardly get your order right. And its not like it was my first time having a bad experience with them. No, I go here often because I'm all about second chances. In my case twelfth. Not once have I left feeling good about my experience there. I've been to so many Starbucks but not one has lead me to write a bad review about them. This is by far the worst Starbucks I've been to. And I've been to a lot. But if you love getting the wrong drink an hour later with shitty service then by all means come to this Starbucks.
