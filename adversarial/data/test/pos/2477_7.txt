Great drinks (although I will still give a bigger nod to Velvet Tango Room).  Kinda odd environment.  Can't quite put my finger on it.  Maybe it is the odor of fresh carpet ( weird because it isn't carpeted) but it is super dark in there.  Society feels like it is trying too hard and trying to be something it is not.  If I want a classic cocktail in a comfortable environment, I will head to Velvet Tango every time.  It feels like Society is trying to attract a younger crowd... Which I fear this place will become douchebag central in a few months.  But then again, douchebags probably won't pay $12 for a cocktail...remains to be seen I guess...
