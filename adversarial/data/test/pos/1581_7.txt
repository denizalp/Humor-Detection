So every once in a while you will find a club that not only you like, but other yelpers like too... Do you know how hard it is to please an eclectic group of people (all ages, all music tastes, all crowd types)? Let me tell you, when it comes to a club, that is damn near impossible.\n\nBut Moon had every wow factor that would make any club goer satisfied. They had killer views of the entire strip from every window and on the terrace. Outside on the terrace, even though you were 52 floors up it was still warm, comfortable, and not windy. Perfection meets glamor. They were playing a wide variety of music nonstop with a great light show to accent the spacious dance floor. There was even a retractable roof so that you could see the moon...Every area of the club from the main room right down to the bathroom or the elevator was tailor made to look like a fierce \"it\" place to be.\n\nThough the Palms is off the strip, this club is well worth the trek. There are three other clubs in the hotel if you feel the need to club hop, so don't nix this one off your list due to its locale.
