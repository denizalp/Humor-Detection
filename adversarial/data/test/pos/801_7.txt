Road this once in the summer of 2007 when we were staying at Mandalay Bay and this ride was some surreal trippy 2AM ride when we were walking the strip a couple hours before our plane ride back home and it was still like 80 degrees outside.\n\nI felt like I was Keanu Reeves in Scanner Darkly that night after we ate at some McDonalds at some plaza on the strip.  Bright lights everywhere...Flashing lights...Everything was moving...Everyone was looking at me...I could see everyones next move before they even made it...I could see into the future...Everything was so vivid...No detail gone to waste...OMG...I AM TRIPPING!!!  OMG...I WAS TRIPPING!!!\n\nI probably should've gambled that night.  Maybe I would've been able to know what cards were before they were even dealt.\n\nThank you for helping me not walk the strip much longer that night.  T'was an experience not to forget.  T'was an experience not to relive.
