I love Vietnamese food, so I just had to try this place. \n\nI was pleased with this restaurant. They had great food and offered lots of variety in the menu, including rice dishes, pho, buns, and more. I never tried quail but it was surprisingly good (it tastes like a saltier\/chewier\/bonier version of chicken if you're curious). The sauce on top of the quail topped off the appetizer - I would recommend it. We had another appetizer - the tofu spring rolls. It tasted very healthy and clean, and I liked the peanut sauce that came with it. \n\nI ordered the chicken \"bun\" noodles, which had rice noodles, lettuce, chicken smothered in sauce and a side of fish sauce. My friend got the vegetarian pho, which she enjoyed. \n\nThe server checked in pretty often and were very polite and helpful with our order. While we were unfamiliar with some of the menu items (like the quail), she provided us a detailed explanation of what the appetizer would entail. I'm glad that she did, because it convinced us to get the order. Yum yum!\n\nI went to dinner on a Thursday evening and there were quite a large amount of people in there - Pho Da Lat has good business which shows that customers regularly go to this restaurant.
