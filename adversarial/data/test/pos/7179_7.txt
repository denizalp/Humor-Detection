The optometrist himself was very knowledgable and helpful. He made some suggestions and gave some product recommendations to me regarding contact wear. I had just moved here from a more moist area so I had to adjust to wearing contacts in a more dry climate. The office itself is very clean and nice. They don't have the largest selection of eyewear but I am sure they can accommodate your needs.\n\nI deducted three stars because the girl at the front desk was 'politely' rude and had quite a snobbish and unfriendly demeanor. She seemed to have an upper hand over her coworkers who were all older so I will assume she is his daughter because there was a digital photo frame up front with tons of photos of her modeling frames and trying to look sexy. How awkward, seriously get over yourself. If not for her standoffish demeanor, I would rate them 5 stars.\n\nIf you read their reply notes to low rating reviews on here you will notice that they are all not very nice! It is kind of intimidating to write a poor review, but oh well...everyone is entitled to their own opinion. REGARDLESS of when the review is written an experience does not change over time. Its called DRAFTED reviews. A review is a review, NO NEED TO STALK YOUR CLIENTS. Accept it and move on.
