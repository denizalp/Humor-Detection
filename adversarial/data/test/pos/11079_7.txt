Ameerah A. recently opened my eye and stomach to the delicious treat of dim sum at the Golden Buddha. I have been wanting to try the restaurants in COFCO for the longest time. \n\nThe dim sum gals push carts around the floor and you get to pick and choose to your heart and stomachs content. It was super delicious, but for 3 people we got a $36 bill, and that isn't cool. I had heard how cheap this place was for dim sum so I was disappointed. I have gone back twice because there are always more unique things to try, but I am more careful about what I order so I don't walk out spending that kind of money on veggies and noodles.\n\nIf you are going for dim sum, go before 3 PM.
