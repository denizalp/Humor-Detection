Since the Monte Carlo is one of those resorts that isn't quite catering to families with kids (using a theme, like Luxor or Excalibur), but it also isn't quite an upscale & adult-centric, the pools tend to be a mix of screaming, annoying children and adults who are here to get some sun and drink in the scorching, oppressive desert heat. \n\nI suggest you get down here a little after noon, grab a few towels, maybe rent an innertube ($10 before 2pm, $5 after), and find a nice sunny spot. Then go to the bar and get a mojito or a rum runner (they'll do it even though it's only listed under 'pitchers'). Then, plunk down in the lazy river and float around, drinking your drink. \n\nExit, sun yourself, repeat.
