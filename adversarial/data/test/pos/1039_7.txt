I would rather swan dive into a pool of razor blades than ever fly them again. I am a loyal customer (former) that flew over 30K miles a year and will NEVER fly them again.  They tried to charge me $269 to switch from a round trip to a one-way flight by only cancelling the out leg of the trip. I was essentially giving them 2 additional seats to sell and they were going to charge me so that they could double up on the profit. I'm embarrassed for how long I was loyal to them. Said good things about them to friends and family and this is the thanks I get.\n\nNEVER AGAIN.
