Canaletto; next to the mini canal of Venetian hotel. \n\nYou feel the Italian aura right at the door, when one of the waiters yells, \"ciao bella, come estai? \" and some other hot italian phrases (Italian just sounds too hot *hot flashes*) \n\n*puts some cold water on her face and comes back to review*\n\n First thing is the great service; one greats you, one seats you, and one takes care of your food and you ....*ahem*  (romantic Italian music for soundtrack...)\n\nI had very delicious dining experience at Canaletto because they have simply good food that smells great under the \"fake\" sky of the Venetian hotel. \n\nThey have their own baked bread, crunchy, and tastes great with virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Our appetizer was Prosciutto and melon and parmigiano cheese. Good starter with rich smoked flavor of prosciutto and parmesan cheese with that golden melon, was very refreshing and prepares you well for the entrees.\n\nWe got proseccos. I have to confess; I love proseccos more than champaign, there! I said it. It's such a refreshing and pleasant wine-type that makes you love Italy even more. Doesn't have the bitterness of champaign, leaves a pleasant aftertaste and nice buzz for LV.\n\nMy main dish was seafood Pastizzio. Very drooling and very flavorful. Pink creamy sauce, with the seafood smell all over, baby clams, baby shrimps, mussels, and  scallops.\n\nIt's a great place to try as one of your restaurant explorations by being in LV and walking around the Venetian shoppe area, under that fake sky. (Which I can't get over it).\n\nArrivederci!\n\n\np.s. My group loved their food as well. I have picture to prove them.
