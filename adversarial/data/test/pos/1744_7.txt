Although our server and the atmosphere were fantastic, the food was just... I'm sorry... eh. The place is bicycle themed, and there are pictures of bicycles everywhere. There is a bicycle that greets you as soon as you walk in. Our server was great, although I cannot remember her name. She was accommodating and sweet. We ordered wings with buffalo sauce. They were good, but they weren't anything special. A few of the wings actually came to us dry; without the buffalo sauce on it. I did like the plate for the wings, though. It had a built-in dipping bowl for ranch. We also ordered a shrimp po' boy and sweet potato fries. The fries were good and were waffle cut. Unfortunately, the shrimp po' boy didn't have enough flavor. It was decent generic bar food, but that wasn't was I was looking for and hoping for at this place.
