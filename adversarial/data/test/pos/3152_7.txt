Meh. I've experienced better. That's an accurate assessment of our experience and it's the kindest way to say this place sucks on just about every level.\n\nWe have stayed at either Wynn or Encore each time we have visited Vegas together and obviously the bar is set pretty high. For some odd reason, I decided to switch it up and try some place new. Terrible mistake. Upon arrival and after waiting an hour on line to check in, we were informed that the rate was significantly higher than the promotional rate I used to book the reservation. When I asked to speak with someone about this, I should have been more specific and asked to speak with someone in person because I was handed a telephone receiver. 400 people checking in, a very loud lobby area and I can't hear a word. Not good. What I did hear was the regurgitation of the terrible news I had already been given and that \"the last person to visit your account was you sir.\" That's rich. \n\nFast forward to the next morning when we attempt to shower and I attempt to shave. The shower is backed up with 7 inches of water (nasty) and of course, the sink is backed up as well. Can't shower and can't shave under these conditions!! Of course, they are going to send someone to fix it ASAP. Off we go to our brunch reservation with half a shower and looking like a couple of hobo's!!\n\nWhen I checked back with the front desk to ensure the plumbing issues had been addressed, the wonderful agent (April needs a promotion and a raise) I was given a wonderful bit of news. April saw my angry check in outburst the day before and decided to double check my reservation now that I was standing before her. Turns out, the promotional offer wasn't given, as I mentioned before and she was able to give us the correct promo rate. Awesome on her, but that's not cool. This should have been the experience upon check in, not the day after when reporting a problem. Come on folks!!\n\nExperiences like this further emphasis my often neurotic and narcissistic approach to travel. I like what I like and I know that, but every now and again, I test the water and get burned. Such is life as an Elite Yelper who's endgame is to improve the experience of others.
