We had 7:45 dinner reservations for 6 people on a Saturday night. We arrived at 7:35 and checked in. Finally at 8:15 we got seated with only slight apologies from the hostess, but no offers of compensations of any kind. Bad first impression, hence the missing fifth star. \n\nThe drinks were pricey but good. French onion soup was amazing! Mac & cheese waffles are exceptional! We saw some local celebrities hanging out at the bar and I ran into some clients seated a few tables over. \n\nMy advice? Dress to impress. When you are here, you feel like this is a place to see and be seen.
