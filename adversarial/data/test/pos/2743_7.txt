Not a fan. Over priced and over rated. Wont be back. Service was good but the food was not exceptional. I would rather eat grocery store sushi. 15.00 for one specialty roll? Come on! I can get way better rolls for under 10.00. I don't know how they got this many stars obviously friends and family must be reviewing! Some of the worst sushi I have ever eaten. Btw I used to live in Hawaii. I know my sushi!
