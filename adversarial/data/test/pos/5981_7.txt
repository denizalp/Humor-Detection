\"Quite possibly the best pie I've had in my life!\", said my friend after eating here (OK it was actually my internal monologue, but my friend did agree that the pie was delicious ;D).\n\nI'll admit, I'm new to the concept of pies as a meal, I've always associated pies with dessert.  Ta Pies make delectable meal-pies (I don't know if that's a thing but I'm going to run with it) in many varieties, for omnivores and vegetarians alike.  I really enjoyed the spinach, mushroom, tomato, and Ricotta cheese pie, as well as the curried vegetable pie.  I ordered some meat pies for some friends from work, the steak and mushroom, and the steak, bacon, and mushroom, and they raved about them.  Even I was tempted, based on the pies I had.\n\nThis spot isn't limited to only pies, though, they also make a variety of desserts, salads, and most importantly milkshakes!  They even have a special one called a \"thickshake\" which they make with extra scoops of ice cream and a thickening agent.  The regular milkshake was good but damn was the thickshake fine!\n\nTa Pies make single-serving as well as family size pies, and the pies are available hot, refrigerated, or frozen.  If you want to eat in or pick up a hot pie, it's best to call ahead because it takes 20 minutes to heat up, which they will do for you, so you can arrive and the pie will be ready to eat.  Mmmmmmm :D\n\nWhat are you waiting for?
