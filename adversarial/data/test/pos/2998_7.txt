I was so excited when I got the mail today to find that UPS had dropped off my order. I ordered over the phone with the Carolina Rustica staff. I was very impressed not only by the selection but also by the knowledge of the staff. \n\nEven though my needs for this purchase were small I will be back soon to purchase more. I have my eye on some new living room and bedroom furniture and can't wait to place my order. The shipping on my item was fast and arrived in perfect condition. Now if only I could get my husband to hang it as quickly! Thanks Carolina Rustica!
