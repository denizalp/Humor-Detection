Expensive train you take to and from the airport to your hotel. Here's what we learned:\n\n-The metro\/subway is cheaper way to get to where you want to go\n-This express is comfortable, free WIFI, takes 25 minutes to get to downtown, comfortable seating and ample space\n-You can buy a card for $6 and roundtrip for you to get to and from your hotel by Union Station for $50. The card is extra so there's a $6 charge for it.\n-You tap your card before you enter the train and after you get off. If you don't tap your ticket once you get off, they will charge you to the end of the stop. \n-Don't lose your card because if you have money on it, people can use it.\n-Keep your card even after you're a tourist that's done with it, because once you get on the train, they'll still check for your card or ticket. \n\nOverall, it depends on what suits you, if you had a long flight and just want to relax, this train will be it for you. If you don't have much to carry and don't mind crowded spaces, take the metro\/subway.
