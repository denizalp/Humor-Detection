Love the authenticity and the great people who work here!  The kalbi dish is excellent as is the teriyaki chicken!!  I had them cater and event and everybody asked me where I got the food from.  Every piece of food was eaten!!  My kids demolish the spam musabi from here and they would eat it every night if I let them!  If you miss Hawaii, be sure to stop in here!
