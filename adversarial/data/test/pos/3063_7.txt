Went here today and got the charbroiled chicken burrito. On the menu it says there is pico and avocado\/guacamole. All that was in there was chicken and that's it. Vey bland. I make better burritos than this!\n\nIt was busy as it was lunch time, but the girl behind the counter had a \"I have no idea what you're talking about\" look on her face when I placed my order. I don't know if it was too loud or if she just wasn't listening. \n\n3 hours later my stomach starts to hurt...you do the math. \n\nI'm not going back there. Not worth it.
