This review is based on a single order of Fried Pickles at the Las Vegas Foodie Fest.\n\nThe pickles were served as sliced discs lightly battered in likely cornmeal, and at the time I found them to be excellent-tasting when dipped in the mild, smooth pink remoulade provided.  But I was disappointed that no tomato ketchup was available as a second dip, so had to apply barbecue sauce instead.  A goodly amount of pickle slices was supplied, and it took me awhile to finish them all--which was a good thing, because I could savor each disc while I waited for my sandwich to be prepared at the Devilicious food truck nearby.  I thought the price for this appetizer was also fair for a lip-smackin' starter (based on food truck fare never seeming to be low in cost).
