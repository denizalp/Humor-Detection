Nice room, but it looks like the whole resort is slowly going downhill. On their website  they say they have wi-fi, when you get there you find out it is just in the lobby (that sucks). They have one of the worst fold out beds I have ever slept upon. \n\nIt could be really nice if they would just step it up a little.
