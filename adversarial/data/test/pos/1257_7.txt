I love sitting on the Patio, Sipping a Margarita, eating one of the best cheesebugers ever, listening to Jimmy and watching the masses of people on The Strip!  This is not a place to go if you are in a hurry or on a schedule.  This is a place to go to enjoy your time, have a few(or more) drinks and remember: \"It's 5 O'Clock Somewhere!\"
