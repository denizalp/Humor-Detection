Magical isn't a word uttered from my lips too often, but in the case of Cavalia's Odysseo it's a fitting description for something this otherwordly.  Think Cirque du Soleil meets horsemanship along with acrobatic stunts, less clowns and more choreography.\n\nThe size of the Cavalia's big top is gargantuan!!  I can easily say the stage area is twice to three times that of a usual cirque show!  As usual the concessions are priced at a King's ransom as two bottled waters and a large popcorn came to over $15!!!  We attended a matinee show which means there were tonnes of kids and seniors so if you decide to take in a matinee, be prepared to wait a loong time to use the facilities!\n\nThe main draw of the show of course are the horses, which were stunning and of every breed and stripe from the fiery wide eyed Arabians (my favorite!) to the athletic Argentinian Criollo to the sturdy draft breed of French Percherons. Could there be a more beautiful creature than the noble horse?  You can really sense a genuine and respectful bond between the horses and the performers.  According to Cavalia the horses are trained in a manner that is slower and at leisure whereby the horses themselves enjoy the learning and performance experience.  There were moments during the show when you knew a horse just didn't want to co-operate as Cavalia's horses are allowed to have their improvisations humoured, much to the audience's delight.\n\nHubby remarked that he preferred Cirque shows for their comically maniacal pace filled with action while laced with clownish humour but I imagine having this same pace would be problematic while incorporating horses.  Odysseo by comparison is more so about grace and beauty, but it's no snoozefest as there are some incredible feats of gasp inducing stunt and acrobatic work that certainly got my pulse going!  Every last detail from the artistic direction, set design, lighting, live music, choreography and equestrian direction synthesize in a tour de force of awe inspiring amazement.  I don't want to give too much away but the ending sequence involves water and is so breathtaking, it profoundy struck something within me to the point that it almost made me cry!\n\nAs a whole the experience at Cavalia Odysseo was pure excellence.  My only complaint is that the parking was really a mess! Thankfully hubby got impatient with the lot attendant's lack of direction and decided to park nearby on Villiers street instead of the lot which was a success as we were able to avoid the usual chaotic queues that usually ensue after a big top show finishes.\n\nTickets for Odysseo range from  $29.50 - $134.50 for regular seating, we were seated in the Gold section and had a pretty fantastic view.  For $100-$170  there's the \"Horse Lover\" package, whereby one gets to visit with the horses after the show and for those who want the full experience including a meal, dessert buffet and a horse tour it's $140 - $230 for VIP.  The show is divided in 2 one hour blocks with a half hour intermission.\n\nIf you are a fan of ethereal spectacle and of the theatre then Odysseo is THE show of all shows!  It certainly is one of the most visually stunning live performances I've ever had the pleasure to see.  It will transport you to a world of picturesque splendour illuminating the beauty and majesty of these incredible creatures.  Any lover of horses and the theatre will be in for a visual feast for the eyes and soul.
