Hi my name is Hotchy and I am a kicksaholic.\n\nThe first time I went to High Point was at its old location in The Mix and I  got my first man crush on the store (not the workers, the STORE ITSELF!).  It sounds kinda stupid but I now understand girls who have a love for shoes!\n\nBefore I found High Point I had maybe 5 pairs of shoes: 2 Dress (brown & black), 1 pair of Bluchers (yes I still wear them and no I don't do the little tie thing with the laces) a pair of sneakers for working out and a pair of flip flops. That was it no more.\n\nAfter I found High Point...I am a shoe whore! I have bought 5 pairs of shoes there, one I have yet to wear cause the look so damn good, a really cool pair of 100% recycled Adidas Gazelles, another pair of Adidas Gazelles, a cool pair of Nike's and another pair of Adidas that I wear to Roller Derby bouts cause they are the only thing I have with Pink in them.\n\nAfter my last trip I had to tell my roommate not to let me go there on payday. Bad Bad Juju.\n\nGo to High Point, the store is great, the guys there are awesome, the clothes are great and the shoes even better.\n\nSo I close as I began...Hi, my name is Hotchy and I am a kicksaholic.
