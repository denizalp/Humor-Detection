Alright, I love this place. Glad it's in Brampton.. Finally!!! New location, the only problem I found is this place has limited parking out front, but the back of Burrito Boyz has far more parking. My friend actually told me that this place just opened and we sped over. When we parked and walked inside, it was busy but the staff was ripping through orders like they usually do and were doing a great job picking up the pace. I grabbed the small chicken and shrimp burrito on brown and had two dots of hot sauce ( Some burrito assemblers have a heavy hand you know what I mean lol). Anyway I told the lady who was making my burrito for some extra guacamole and I forgot to pay for it. She was kind enough to say, \" I will try my best to put on a little extra for you\". I had that moment... \"Now that ladies and gentlemen is the real MVP.\" My friend and I grabbed two pops and waited for roughly 10-15 minutes. The inside of this place is spacious and there's a lot of seating for all group sizes. Burrito Boyz uses a numbering system which matches your receipt so when you hear your number, you jump up for joy. Now, when I took the first bite, it was perfection and that lady totally hooked it up with the guac *tear rolls down cheek. When eating, towards the end, the burrito always gets messy, the sauces and juices start leaking through the foil wrap but that doesn't stop me, I just throw everything in my mouth in the most unattractive way possible. All I can say is, if you want something filling, flavourful and fast (if you call in first) .. this is the place to be. Great location close to home!
