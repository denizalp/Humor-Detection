These people almost killed me and billed me for their mistakes.\n\nIn 2013 I showed up to the ER with stage iv cancer, which neither they nor I knew, but when I told them I was in severe pain, a nurse came out and said, \"We don't give anyone who comes in off the street pain killers,\" and accused me of being a drug seeker.\n\nI left, and went to the county hospital, where they actually did scans, and found over 10 tumors and stage iv lymphoma. Phoenix Baptist sent me a bill of $350 for ER SERVICES which has since gone to collections. I won't pay for them trying to kill me.
