I visited this place during my weekend trip to Toronto, and I was definitely excited because the pictures of the cone reminded me of a churro ice cream. I liked it so much that I visited it twice during my trip. \n\nWhen we got to the place, the line was about 5-6 people, which wasn't terrible. We had to wait around 7 minutes to get served, and I got a chimney, which was called the OG mini. The soft serve was amazing, and it surprised me when I first bit into it. It was just the right amount of creamy, and it tasted high quality. The cone itself was also great. It tasted like a churro, but harder in texture which was great because you'd get a satisfying crunch every time you bite it. \n\nThe OG mini, although smaller than the regular size, was enough to make me very full after a regular sized dinner. There was also a chocolate ball at the end of the cone, which admittedly was my least favorite part of the cone. The chocolate did not seem like it was high quality. \n\nThe second time I tried it, I got a regular sized raspberry chimney. This was also great, and very flavorful. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who would want great, innovative ice cream in Toronto!
