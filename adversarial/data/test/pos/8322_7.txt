I've taken approx five classes or so at joyful and I was super impressed with this place. it's a great place to go if you are just starting out. I took my first zumba and kickboxing class here.  It's a low key spot and the instructors are all energetic and fun. I no longer take classes here because I found a new place closer to home with flexible class times. my only complaint is that the studio smells weird.
