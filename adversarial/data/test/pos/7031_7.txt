I include this in my semi-comprehensive list of Toronto pools because the pool is, frankly, its centrepiece. \n\nNumber one strange bonus of this pool is that one time I got to swim behind Sarah from Much Music. \n\n*Her legs are like beautiful saplings.*\n\nBesides that, the staff are friendly, The Price is Right (spay and neuter your pets!), and the pool is decent sized with plenty of sunlight and a pretty mosaic on the wall. \n\nThe changing rooms are COLD which is a deal breaker for my lizard blood during winter, but at pocketchange-per-swim it's a great pool to drop into. \n\n(Because people drop into pools.)
