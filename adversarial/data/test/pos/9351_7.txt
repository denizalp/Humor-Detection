Cafe Rico is a great fair-trade cafe with its own roasting operation, and makes a great cup of coffee. \n\nThe space is long and narrow, but never feels too cramped. Still, the atmosphere isn't always the most conducive for working or a long chat with an old friend; the bean grinders can amp up the noise level quite a lot, and there can be surprising drafts from the front and back doors. That said, the decor is lovely, and I'd take a hand-pulled latte here over the generic competition up the block any day.\n\nAlso, urban parents take note: In the back, there is a cute little toy kitchen and other toys (bead maze, etc.), where kids can play and let mom and dad caffeinate. Much appreciated.
