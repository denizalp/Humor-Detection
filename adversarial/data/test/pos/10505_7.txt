As long as I can get coffee... How bad can things be.\n\n\nCoffee is one of the best things that happened in the world.  Greater Than Coffee has a great team of baristas , they are so efficient and very friendly. Greater Than Coffee how a warm and relaxing atmosphere.  \n\nGreater then coffee has a large selection of coffees, teas, and snacks.  I've never been disappointed with any item on the menu.
