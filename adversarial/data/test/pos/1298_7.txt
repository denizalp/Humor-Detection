Kay was desiring Teutonic treats last night after work, her passion for German food neverending...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nkkrOTr3_Ck\n\nPatterned after the 4 centuries-old parent restaurant in Munich, Hofbrauhaus sits proudly in the South Side Works and has been doing brisk business for some time now. Valets are available to park your car for a fee, and colossal, shining beer tanks stand guard outside. \n\nWhen we finally got through the door, we were greeted by a group of young, female employees in attire straight from the famous parade scene in the film \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off.\" Having typed that, having read some of the reviews, AND having been to the much sleazier and far more exploitative Tilted Kilt, neither Kay nor I minded the mildly cleavage-baring outfits the frauleins had on. Their hemlines were not overly short, either. \n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gry_42uFZ74\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7p2b2eYMIx8\n\nOne blonde gal took us past the bustling, clamorous beer hall and into the much quieter, less-populated dining room, one that resembled the interiors of an old schoolhouse with its wooden tables and vaulted ceilings. Traditional, jolly German music played on in the background while I thought of Accept, Scorpions, Helloween, and Blind Guardian among many other bands from that part of Europe. Once seated, Miranda, our charming and smashing server, soon greeted us with twinkling eyes...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BP49gxxBCzU\n\nKay saw the Sauerkraut Balls on the fairly vast menu and would consider nothing else as an appetizer. Served with a glorious honey mustard, the golden globes were riddled with bits of ham, splendidly conjuring arancini in crispy, creamy, tangy, savory fashion...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=w_QpeID9SyU\n\nThe two of us were suffering from delusions of grandeur, our minds rolling down the same track, something that seldom happens when dining out together. From the depths of a slow-burning oven came...Oktoberfest Schweinshaxe...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qU_jBBmNDaE\n\nThe pork shank was substantial enough to fool the gullible fantasist into thinking it had come from the hindquarter of a lindwurm due to its hide of cracklings. The brackish rind was made flavorful via its fatty underside, which acted as a preview to the lush, long-roasted meat that lay within. The shank itself was imperious, imposing to behold, particularly when presented with steak knife of machete proportions jutting out from it, those ivory bones scraped clean...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LtaH2yllusU\n\nA mound of tart, tangled sauerkraut and a fluffy potato dumpling rounded out the plate, and as acceptably tasty as they were, the gargantuan serving of protein clearly overshadowed all else. Sadly, the servings proved too insurmountable for us to finish...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0Z7bsRvylGs\n\nSaving the pig for tomorrow's leftovers, we attacked the dessert tandem of the Cinnamon Pretzel and Apple Strudel. The pretzel came with a cream cheese frosting, making for quite the twisted danish or coffee cake...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bR-ZRDZAPug\n\nFlaky, saccharine, and arcane of spice, the volcanic, powdered apple strudel was seconded and subdued by a densely decadent glob of vanilla bean ice cream...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pE0BYvQEO_k\n\nCarrying doggy bags, we bid Miranda adieu and fetched the car, narrowly avoiding the nightmarishly obnoxious Friday night festivities on Carson Street. Today, we enjoyed the remainder of our pork on a rainy, chilled afternoon, reflecting on our dining experience fondly. I think you'll be fond of Hofrbrahaus also, even if you're a non-drinker like me. Hey, just as it's been with Penn Brewery and Church Brew Works, I'm only here for the, err...food, man. \n\nP.S. Our tab, including a Prince Ludwig beer Kay happily downed, was over 80 smackers!!!\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lSf8bE1UP-8
