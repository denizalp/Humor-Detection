A friend originally from East Coast recommended this restaurant as the best Chinese in Scottsdale, and it is what he is used to eat in east coast.\n\nSo far I tried chicken Egg Foo Young, fried rice, and orange chicken. \n\nEgg Foo Young is a real Egg Foo Young. I realized what I've been eating around here was Egg Foo Youngish.  Not a real one like they  make here.\n\nFried rice and orange chicken was really good as well.  Very fast service, located on my way home form work, very reasonable price.  I can see myself becoming a regular here.
