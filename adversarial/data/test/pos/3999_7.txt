I am rounding up because of the setting.  We were doing a parents night out with my group and the organizer chose this place.  They had reserved one of the high top tables near the entrance for us.  I was a little concerned when I saw that they only had this metal stools with a small square of vinyl in the middle.  As I expected, they were so painful.  We had people of every size and all out butts were hurting, as a matter of fact my friend ended up standing most of the time, because she couldn't take it anymore, yes, she had to eat standing up.  Now to the food, that was a royal disappointment.  I ordered the Islander pizza (8\"), my hubby had the butcher with added mushrooms and jalapeños. My friends were sharing the caesar salad and a larger Islander pizza and the other couple at the end had the entrees.  When the pizzas arrived, they were plopped in front of us and we were forgotten. No plates to put our slices.  We asked one of the servers, but she said dismissively, \"I'll get your server\".  My friend's husband got up, and pick them up, the plates were next to her.  Then noticed my hubby's pizza did not have the jalapeños.  Our server showed up and he said he would have them add it and put the pizza back in the oven for a minute.  I told him no thank you, and that was a good thing, the pizza crust was so tough, not a good thing.  For dessert we ordered the D\"Estate, which is described as butter cake, with lime\/pineapple jam and coconut gelato.  There were 5 croutons and a small scoop of gelato, I don't mind if it is small, I try to limit my calories, but that poor excuse of a cake was terrible, we left the croutons there, not worth the calories.  On top of that we got our bill before we even got the dessert delivered.  My hubby mentioned that we had never been at a place where we would get the check before we got to the end of our meal.  We all paid our checks, before we got our desserts, who does that. By the way, when we arrived home the leftover pizza went straight into the trash can.\nNow, the place is beautiful and the only reason I would go back is to have a beer (I don't think they can screw that up) in the patio area by the greens.
