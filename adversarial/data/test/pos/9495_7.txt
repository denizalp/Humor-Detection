My first time on Las Vegas, flight landed in the afternoon and as we came from the sky, you could see this large Ferris Wheel. Asked our Uber driver about it and he started.. 1st, don't call it a Ferris Wheel (but it is) it's The High Roller. It's about a 30 mins, you can choose to bring a drink or opt for the open bar cart and make sure you go to the bathroom before getting on. Best time to get on would be right when the sun is about to set. You able to see the city with and without lights. \n\nTrying to take the Uber's advice to go at sunset was a fail for us. We weren't able to get on at sunset due to other plans and this was my last night so we just went with it. As you are getting ready to enter, you go through the High Roller lounge where you can seat down, purchase snacks and drinks, use the restroom until you're ready to go. Honestly if you're going to purchase a drink, you might as well do the open bar. I believe 1 drink in the lounge was $12 and it's about an extra $15 for the open bar. I could be wrong on the pricing but it's worth to do the open bar. On our way to the cart, we took there pictures by the employees and was given a ticket to view and\/or purchase them after our ride. We purchased 4 pictures for $40. \n\nThe carts seem to move extremely slow when your looking at it but when you're about to get on, you realize it's not moving as slow as you imagined. Of course we opted for the open bar. Why not?!? Our Bartender was awesome! I feel bad for her because we did have some itty-bitty young bopper 21 yr olds being rude to her. But she kept herself together. She made anything you wanted, my drink was rum, pineapple and a splash of cranberry juice. I believe I had about 5 in the 30 mins we were in the cart. \n\nThe view is awesome even during the day. Looking past the building, you can see the beautiful mountains. This is should be a requirement for to ride at least once. The view was just breathtaking! \n\n\nAt the end of the day... Yes, I would definitely do it again when in Vegas!
