I never would've imagined that I'd write a review based on a salad! I don't even like lettuce! Yet, here I am...writing about the world's best chopped salad!\n\n1) Occassion: \nFor my first birthday weekend in AZ, Ryan made a reservation for us here. As soon as we walked in, we were seated at a very cozy and romantic table(it had a candle, that's romantic right?!). \n\n2) Service:\nOur server (also named Ryan) was the sweetest guy we've ever met! He had the warmest smile and treated us like we were the only customers there! Although he was servicing several tables by us, we felt he was there the second we needed him! \n\n3) Food:\nThe chopped salad is to die for. When it's brought out, the ingredients are layered vertically. Our server mixed it up for us with the dressing and I think that's the best way to eat it. I saw a table near us eat one section at a time and I think that's missing the point! (Who watches others eat..this weirdo) \nThe salad consists of lettuce, salmon, sunflower seeds, corn, and some sort of green dressing. It is super good! I want the recipe so I can make it every day!\n\n*Seared scallops: Also to die for! \n\n4) Ambience: \nIt's a fairly small restaurant with cozy seating. There is a bar in the middle. Although we were here for a birthday, it seems pretty awesome for happy hours etc.\n\nWe'll be back regularly!
