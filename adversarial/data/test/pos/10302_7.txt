This was the club chosen for our first night in Vegas.  We didn't get on any guest list, so we just hopped into the girls' line.  We were inside in less than 5 minutes with no cover!\n\nI've been here before when it was super packed.  The night we went was still pretty crowded, but not as bad as I've seen it.  We started out at the bar on the far right side of the main room.  It was easy to get drinks here, and not too crowded.  \n\nAs the night went on, the dance floor got packed.  I was constantly getting bumped around and stepped on...ouch!  And every now and then I'd feel someone grinding up on me from behind.  Why do guys think they can be obnoxious a-holes just because they're in Vegas???  \n\nThe bathroom is in the back corner of the main room, so you have to navigate your way through a crowd of drunk people before you can relieve yourself.  There's a bathroom located on the rooftop that was much easier to get to.  On a hot Vegas night, the rooftop is the place to be.  You can get fresh air and get away from the sweaty people on the dance floor.\n\nOverall, Pure is an ok place to party.  Its easy to get in if you have a group of girls.  No cover is always a plus.
