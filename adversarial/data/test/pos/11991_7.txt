If you work at PSC, or you have some decision making power at this place, you really should read this review.\n\nI went last night. Keep in mind this is on a Tuesday. It might be the Tuesday before the fourth of July, but it's not that busy. I've seen WAY busier. I hit this spot on most weekends, actually. They really do have great sandwiches, if this review was for the food alone, I would be giving them 5-stars. But this review isn't just for the food, it's for the awful experience I have every single time I go into this place. It's a good thing this place's main clientele is blacked-out bar goers, because I don't think anybody else would put up with their s**t. \n\nI walk in, and the first thing I have to do is wait about 10 minutes for somebody to help me. You know what, forget somebody helping me, it takes that long for somebody in that place to acknowledge my existence. Then I ask for help, and I get something like \"I KNOW YOU'RE THERE PAL, I'LL GET TO YOU IN A SECOND\". From the conversations I had at the front counter, nobody is working, or nobody is supposed to be working. Idk, but everybody is complaining that either \"I don't work here\" or \"I'm off the clock\". I don't care. I have money to give you, and you have sandwiches to give me. Let's make this trade happen. Somebody take my order, I don't care if you're the Dalai Lama. \n\nLet me say the girl that helped me out was really sweet. Super nice, and I know she doesn't WANT to suck at her job. I'm sure the owner is a nice guy, too, with the best of intentions but he runs a TERRIBLE business, with terrible employees and an inconsistent product. Again, I'm sure everybody that works there is just really great and fun to be around. But I don't care if they're great people. All I care about is if you can get me my sandwich in less than half-an-hour, and that's a struggle for them. IT'S JUST A SANDWICH, PUT IT IN MY MOUTH AND LET ME LEAVE!!!\n\nI was pretty damn drunk last night, and even I couldn't choke down more than 2 of the fries they sold us. Literally the worst fries I have ever had in my entire life. I understand that the review as you've read so far might make seem a bit dramatic, but I'm a vacuum. I will eat almost anything. The only way I would eat those fries is if my life depended on it. And even then I probably wouldn't enjoy it. I normally really like their fries too, which is why I paid them money so I could have some. I should have just thrown away six dollars.\n\nThe food quality went WAAAAY down when they moved locations. The service wasn't half bad at the old location either. They are also ALWAYS out of something. The last 4 times I've come in, I've had to change my order.\n\nIt's just a sandwich, I get it. Not that big of a deal, in fact not a big deal at all! But there are business that actually will work hard for and compete for my money. There are businesses that don't take their customers for granted simply because they have a good product. PSC is not one of those businesses. Don't go here unless your blacked out and can survive a 20-30 minute wait (even during lunch hour).
