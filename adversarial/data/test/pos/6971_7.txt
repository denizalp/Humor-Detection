I went for the brunch today. \nFirst of all I just don't understand why they didn't serve brunch at Green, that's where the kitchen is. They were very adamant about waiting until 9am until anyone could place a brunch order even though the place was filling up before 9am. \nThough once orders were placed food came quickly.\n\nThe plates were brought over from Green and probably played a hand in why the food wasn't hot, but it was more likely due to it being pre made, quite possibly the day ahead of time, and not heated well, which in turn made for a very dry tofu scramble.\n I got the Sage Sausage Hashsheesh, unfortunately no sage flavor just one note flavor, even so, it would have tasted better Hot and it would have been nice to have toast with it as well.\n\nBy the time we left it was standing room only. \n\nI may be pointing out the obvious here but Nami should stick to being a coffee and pastry shop and let real meals be at Green where food can be served hot from the kitchen into a dining room that can accommodate more people. Maybe consider having an option to order brunch at Nami for the overflow but to have it solely there is asinine.\n\n\nP.S.\nI'd like to add that the first time I visited Nami I ordered the Fluffernutterin\nSoynami which is ORGANIC peanut butter, banana, ricemellow fluff and toasted marshmellow flavor and I stood there and watched her scoop in SKIPPY Peanut Butter=Not Cool=False Advertising=Fail!
