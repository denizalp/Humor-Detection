Ping Pang Pong is definitely one of the better places for dim sum in Vegas. They open at 10 and there's a line before it even opens which I was in since I was a bit early. With 10 of us we were seated right after it opened.\n\nWe were at the table where all the employees had to open the cabinet to put their personal items so we had to keep moving out of the way. The food carts seemed to have been sparse in our area but we were able to order what we wanted from the server. My favorites were the shrimp churn fun and the gai mei bao. The shrimp\nwas huge! All of the food was good but I wish we got to have more of a variety like the turnip cake that I love or tripe.  \n\nPing Pang Pong is definitely a little on the pricey side for dim sum but it is worth it. Even though you do have to walk into a smokey casino you will forget that once you are seated surrounded by loud parties.
