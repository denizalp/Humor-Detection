You want to take a shot of jager on a... let's say Wednesday, at like... noon, well, you found the right place!\nWelcome to the dark side of mankind, or at least that's how I felt being there, observing several heavy drinking patrons in the middle of the day during my lunch break.  The place is dark, they even tinted the windows.  The \"decor\" (if I can even call it that) was confusing, bar on one side, the other side looks like Chucky Cheese (minus all the games).\nIt's a typical hole in the wall place.  They have a decent pizza lunch special ($4.75 2 slices with a drink).  I ordered a philly cheesesteak (half).  It's a pretty big half, but unfortunately, it looks and smell better than it tasted.  Kind of plain.  The seasoned waffle fries were better, even though they're definitely frozen and bought in bulk from some food supplier.  \nI see that they have 50cents wings night, dollar pizza slice night, karaoke on Fridays and other \"special.\"
