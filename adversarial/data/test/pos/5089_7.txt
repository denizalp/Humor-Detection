This is a pretty typical Urban Outfitters.  Hipster-ish clothes, somewhat overpriced.  Sweaters made of acrylic that will fall apart the first time you wash them.\n\nThere are some upsides.  Giant sale rack where you can find lots of cute clothes at reduced prices.  The rack is so crammed full that it's hard to see what is in there though.  Give yourself at least half an hour to comb through it.  The sale is upstairs, so climb the wobbly cement stairs carefully.
