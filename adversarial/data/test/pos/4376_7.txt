Total waste of time and money.\n\nThey get a star for service - our waiter was quite personable and competent and the bartender made some tasty drinks. But that's where the praise ends. I ordered something simple: spaghetti and meatballs. It was very...ordinary. As in \"I've had better at my junior high school cafeteria.\" Absolutely nothing to praise about the dish. I make better at home. So does the wife. So does Chef Boyardee, for that matter.\n\nThe wife ordered the veal parmesan. It was a huge hunk of meat, on the bone, pounded way too thin and then burnt under the cheese. The cook obviously put it on too high a heat and forgot it for a bit. Totally inedible.\n\nFor a place opened by a \"cake boss,\" you'd think the desserts would be exemplary. Guess again. The rum birthday cake was so-so, and the cannelloni were stale and flavorless. Again, worthless food served in a nice room with good service.\n\nSave your money and taste buds and go anywhere else for dinner. Maggiano's is just down the block and light years better tasting. Heck, go to Battista's. It's a dive that's over-rated and still better than Buddy V's. Or just stay home, heat a can of Chef Boyardee and eat it while tearing up $20 bills. In the end it's the same experience.
