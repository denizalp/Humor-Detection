Now this is a beautiful yoga studio! It's in an old building complete with creaky hardwood floors, high ceilings, and antiquey details throughout. \n\nI attended a 60 minute moksha class with my passport to prana. I was greeted at the large, welcoming reception desk by a very friendly gentleman who directed me to fill out a standard waiver and grqciously processed my passport. He then introduced me to my instructor, who gave me a run down about studio etiquette, where to find change rooms, and what to expect in class - a nice touch. Every studio is different and it's never nice to worry about where to find things.\n\nThe change room was great! Nice and bright, lots of space, and many hooks on the walls for... well... for hanging things. No lockers, which always makes me twitchy - i'm the kind of oerson who gets nervous checking luggage, so I definitely hate leaving my wallet\/iphone in a change room. Anyway. The showers are communal, which is fine by me, but might make some folks uncomfortable. There's mirror space for post-class prepping and the studio provides a blow dryer, complete with attachments (yay diffuser!)\n\nThe practice space is the same kind of bright, creaky and lovely room as the rest of the studio. Lots of windows let in lovely sunlight, which I strongly prefer over the darkness of many hot yoga places. The standard bank of mirrors along one wall. I must say that the creaking floors were less charming and more annoying in here, but that's a small quibble.\n\nThe class itself reminded me that I hate the pattern, routine, and dogma that accompany yoga 'systems'. I am particularly annoyed when instructors say things like \"... And this pose allows fresh new blood to flow through the (insert body part here)\" . . . You know that our blood is always circulating? Right? That it becomes 'fresh' by being filled with oxygen multiple times each minute? That nowhere in the body is there just a pool of stagnant blood waiting for some magical yoga pose to release it? Blood's whole job is to transport things - by definition it is always moving. Drives me bananas.\n\nI loved the studio so much I almost wish I enjoyed the class. But I didn't. I'll stick to my flowy, free form hot yoga classes, thanks.
