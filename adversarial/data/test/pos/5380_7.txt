My review is based on service alone and not the food. \n\nI walked into the restaurant and they told me it was an hour wait for a table. The hostess informed me there were 5 groups ahead of us so it would approximately be about 30min-1hr wait. We put our name on the waitlist and came back after an hour because we thought the wait was reasonable. \n\nWhen we came back, I asked how much longer the wait was and she said another 45min???? I asked how many groups were ahead of us and she said 4. I asked the hostess how it was possible that only one group had been seated in the last hour and she said that they had to seat people with reservations before walk-ins. Uhhhh it may have been nice to be notified that there were reservations and that the number of groups we were waiting on were only the walk-ins. The hostesses seemed completely unorganized and did not know how to deal with people waiting and\/or estimating the wait time. \n\nHere's a tip for you - if you have a full number of reservations then DON'T TAKE WALK-INS. Or at least inform people that are walking in of proper wait times. I may want to wait up to an hour but I don't want to wait an hour and then told that it's another hour wait. \n\nAnother thing that pissed me off was that there were plenty of empty tables when I first came in and when I came back in an hour. \n\nThe only saving grace of this place is that it's a well known restaurant chain and I will cut them some slack since it has newly opened. I will wait a while before visiting to actually eat so that the place figures out its shit and hires some proper service employees.
