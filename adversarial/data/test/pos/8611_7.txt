Normally I would say there are no positives about getting into a car accident but the staff at Birchmount Collision Centre made reporting a collision as pleasant as possible.\n\nThe procedure is that you take a number, then you see an attendant and explain the accident while producing driver's license, insurance papers and ownership. Then you proceed to see an officer and review the situation and walk out to view damages of your vehicle.  You then are asked to write a short blurb explaining the accident and are given an accident report for insurance purposes.\n\nThe officers were all very friendly and even cracked a few jokes to lighten up the mood. The process took about 40 minutes and was relatively stress-free and easy.
