If you like doing things like sitting around on your MacBook, drinking coffee and vinyl, you should come here.\n\nThis place will satisfy at least one of those needs. If you're lucky, all three.\n\n\nMy only experience with The Loop is brief; I stopped by on my way back from Pittsburgh and although I can only speak from one visit, I mostly have good things to say.\n\nAt first glance, this place has a tiny vinyl selection. If you're just downstairs you'll be dissapointed so go upstairs where the meat of the stuff is.\n\nThe selection is... Choosy? The loop wheels and deals in all sorts of genres but if you're only looking for Adele, Taylor swift and and Jimi Hendrix reissues you might be dissapointed.\n\n\nAlthough it might seem strange given the bulk of their inventory is new vinyl, the real strength of this place is used titles; they have a very good selection and outstanding prices on some very popular older titles. Although they have some good new titles, they are a bit pricey. \n\n\nIf you're looking for a coffee shop this place is good too. There's plenty of places to sit and their coffee is pretty darn good. Dissapointed in their pastries. \n\nIf you live in the greater Cleveland area, check this place out but it's not worth a journey.
