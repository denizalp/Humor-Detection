This place is ridiculous. And by ridiculous I mean, I want to live in one of the theatres. Recliner seats, free popcorn, a fluffy blanket, and a pillow? This is a movie experience built around the comforts of home, plus luxury, which every girl date needs when watching Jamie Foxx shoot the bloody crap out of cowboys, care of Quentin Tarantino. \n\nWhile we were perusing the menu, our waitress told us that the food ordered will be coming from Tanzy Express, so Angy B. decided to spring for the Death by Chocolate cake (\"We're celebrating!\" she said. \"Stop twisting my arm!\" I choked out). Just as the movie started, our waters came out, later was the complimentary popcorn, AND FINALLY THE CAKE. The heavens opened up and we accepted our fate. So chocolatey, so good. I don't even like frosting, but that couldn't have been frosting... maybe more of a ganache? Because I loved it. It also had some sort of cream dollop at one side of it that we couldn't get enough of. HIGHLY recommended. \n\nThis place isn't cheap, but it is certainly the kind of place you take a date you want to impress. I wish there was a way to get a waiter's attention between services, though. What if we decided to get a glass of red to accompany our cake? Or even just a refill on our waters. Other than that, I'll certainly be back with Husband.
