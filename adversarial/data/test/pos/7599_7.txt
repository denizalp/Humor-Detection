Had breakfast here with my boyfriend and friend. Our waiter was nice and service was quick.\n\nI ordered my usual, Eggs Benedict, which come with \"house potatoes\" which are O'brien potatoes. I thought it was great, the hollandaise had excellent flavor, and I loved the potatoes, they were seasoned well and very moist. \n\nBF ordered the French Toast Creme Brulee, wow. I am not a huge sweets person, especially in the morning, but I could have eaten that whole plate. Two pieces of awesome thick Brioche, stacked with a layer of creme brulee custard in the middle. It was served with some jam...raspberry I think...that he spread all over the top of it and made it that much better. It was dessert for breakfast, but it was very good!\n\nMy friend ordered a basic breakfast of over easy eggs, sausage, and potatoes. He enjoyed his food as well.\n\nBreakfast was $80 after tax and tip, so be prepared to spend last nights winnings here for some good food.
