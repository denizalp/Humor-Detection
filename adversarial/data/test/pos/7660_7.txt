Despite having capped off our meal at Trattoria Nakamura-Ya with their delicious panna cotta, stopping off for dessert before heading back to The Strip was at the top of our minds.  Which may not reflect well on us (or our waistlines), but hey...#YOLO.  So, with a return trip to Kung Fu Tea completely ruled out and the line at Sweets Raku longer than we were willing to endure, we decided to check out Gelato Bar!  Partly because it was nearby, but mostly because you can never go wrong with ice cream\/gelato!\n\nLocated in the same strip mall as the likes of Pho Kim Long and Udon Monzo, the inside of Gelato Bar looks more like a Baskin Robbins than a trendy gelato joint.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, of course; between the booth seating (perfect for families), their board games, and wealth of colorful gelatos, this is an awesome spot for families (and adults) to try to keep cool during those notoriously hot summers in Vegas!\n\nWith roughly two dozen varieties to choose from, spanning from classics (like Strawberry and Chocolate) to the unique (like Durian and Charcoal Vanilla), Gelato Bar's range of flavors is pretty impressive.  Had this been in San Francisco, I probably would've tried just a single scoop.  However, given how I may not come back again, I figured I'd give two of them a shot - their SALTED CARAMEL and BISCOTTI).\n\nOverall, I thought both scoops were pretty decent.  The consistency felt a bit more like ice cream than some of the gelatos I've had before (wasn't as \"gummy\"), but there were still pretty enjoyable.  Of the two, I thought the Salted Caramel was notably better, as it had a rich flavor that wasn't overly sweet.  Not that the Biscotti was bad, just that I got tired of the taste of it pretty quickly.  Perhaps it was just due to some taste bud fatigue, but I ended up leaving most of it behind.\n\nAt $6.50 for two scoops, the prices here initially seemed to be a shade high, but it's actually not bad when you consider the portion size (huge scoops) and the sugar wafer\/cookie that comes with your order.  What's more, service here is terrific, as the two girls manning the counter\/register did a great job of working through the large group of folks that came in right after us.  Sadly though, I'm not sure if\/when I'll make my way back here.  I'm certainly not opposed to it, but there are so many other places on my list of bookmarks that I still need to try!\n\nTHREE AND A HALF STARS rounded up.
