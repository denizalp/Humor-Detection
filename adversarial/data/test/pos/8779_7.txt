The Zulu Caffe is a great Lunch & Brunch spot. Bring your GPS because it's a little hard to find. Last time I was here was on a lazy Saturday afternoon. I enjoyed the views and my lunch. Fortunately,  my wife let me have a bit of her pulled pork sandwich and I'm telling you I'm hooked  on their pulled pork. \n\nWe chatted with Chef Ford for a bit because we were complimenting him on the delicious lunch. I said this sandwich is just like the pulled pork at Sweet Baby Ray's in Chicagoland. He said he uses their sauce and adds some of his own secret ingredients to the mix. I would stack this pulled pork sandwich up against any BBQ  joint in the metro area. This is the best pulled pork I have had since I've been in Arizona.\n\nI enjoy the food at Zulu but wish they had evening hours. I heard their brunch is really good with the bottomless Mimosas but I haven't had a chance to check that out.
