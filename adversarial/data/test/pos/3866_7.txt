Breakfast is a tricky little business on The Strip. Most casinos offer Starbucks or a grand buffet and not much in between. So Red, White and Blue appealed to me for the casual convenience factor. It is part grab-and-go deli with a sit down caf√© on either side. And although there was a line, it moved quickly so I was able to easily grab a table for our group. \n\nWe all ended up choosing the American Breakfast: choice of eggs, bread, sausage or bacon and juice. Definitely pricey at $16 and it was your basic forgettable breakfast. Most of our meals in Vegas fell into the expensive and worth it or expensive and not category. This would be the latter. Service was disinterested at best. By far our best breakfast on the trip was no where near the Strip.
