I'm fat and I know what's good. This place is good. I've been to a lot of Chinese food places and this one is near the top of my list. Not sure about these other reviewers.\n\nPros\nFast and friendly staff\nMongolian BBQ style grill\nWide selection of sushi (no complaints whatsoever)\nThey have Tabasco!!\nTheir is a wide variety of food on the buffet and everything I've had tasted great with the exception of two items listed below.\n\nCons\nThe cheese wontons look like they've been squished or crushed.\nThe duck tasted nasty but I think it's they way it's supposed to taste. \nMy wife complained that there needs to be a wider selection of non seafood items, but she's dumb.\nThe price is kinda high but in my option it's worth it.
