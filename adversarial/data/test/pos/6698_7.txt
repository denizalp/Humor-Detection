For many years, I longed to find a bathhouse\/sauna in Toronto that was a) not a salacious pickup spot for men b) filled with bachelorette parties or c) part of a gym.  I was looking for a place like you would find in Japan, or Scandinavian countries or Eastern Europe or Turkey which you could just go and steam yourself out for general health and relaxation.\n\nThis place is in a strip mall in Mississauga, in the back storage area of a Sleep Factory store (... where you often find spas... right?).  When I arrived there was a man chopping wood in the back parking lot.  So far, so good.  When I walked in, I was greeted with all sorts of Russian paraphernalia - tea pots, matryoshka dolls, felt mitts.... the staff were super friendly and one of the proprietors, Valerie, gave us a tour of the facilities.  A sitting area with lots of leather couches and televisions, the tea room (with the great smell of Russian food!), a small changing room for women, a Turkish style hammam (tiled), a Finnish sauna, and a large Banya with a giant smoky stove, a very cold plunge pool and cold shower.  All very functional, and exactly what I was looking for.  We were given robes and unlimited towels and a little key fob bracelet for a locker.  Facilities were all well maintained!  And it wasn't too busy, which was perfect.  \n\nThe food in the tea house is great.  Authentic and slightly heavy,  but not too much so.  The portions are very generous, so among two women, you could easily share one dish. We ordered the chicken cutlet (perfectly crispy on the outside, and tender on the inside) with mushroom sauce, as well as the homemade pork sausage.  All very tasty!  \n\nI will definitely be returning!
