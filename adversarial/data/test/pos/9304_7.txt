Wish I coud give it ZERO. DON'T EAT HERE....UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET SICK....THEN GET AN ATTITUDE FROM THE MANAGER (guess she doesn't know about YELP)!!! I came here for a casual night with a friend and ordered my usual sushi rolls. Fast forward a few hours as I am praying to the porcelain goddess.....up all night with terrible abdominal pain and food poisoning. No other explanation. After purging my system of the spicy tuna roll I finally felt better. I was set out to do my due diligence and contact the restaurant so nobody else has to experience a loss of sleep and fluid....so I called and spoke to a manager. Now, I was NICE about it... but  she was not sympathetic at all!! essentially called me a liar and was a total B-i-A-T-C-H. Don't eat here unless you want rotten food and rotten attitude.  Not worth the money for a terrible evening and no ownership. Man-up Stingray!!!! \n\nMy friend got food poisening from another well-established and recognized Asian restaurant and was treated SO much better!! He was given a $100 gift certificate, they apologized profusely, offered to pay his medical bills!!! and threw out their entire meat supply that could have born the offending portion my friend ate - RESPECTABLE!! not stingray- may you all suffer.....just don't order spicy tuna!! UM actually yeah... please do!
