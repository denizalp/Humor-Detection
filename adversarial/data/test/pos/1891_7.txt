I will say it loud and say it proud:\n\nI LOVE CP24.\n\nIt's true that when I moved to Toronto I held a certain amount of disdain for 'that cheap looking news channel that's always on in the subway and the chipper.' HOWEVER, I have since discovered that CP24 is good for more than just up-to-the-minute weather and traffic reports. CP24 is also the world's best hangover cure.\n\nYou may scoff, but it's true. I don't know if it's the chirpy weather updates, the news reports about lemonade stands getting served cease and desist orders, or what, but damn, CP24 is better than any 'fizzy-make-feel-better' I can find! \n\nScrew seltzer -- sit me down with a cup of tea, a fried egg sandwich (toasted, of course), some ketchup and CP24 with the volume on low and I will lose roughly four hours of my day in recovery mode.\n\nCP24 is usually reserved for my hangover days but I will confess that on Saturday morning (no hangover on this particular occasion), my boyfriend delivered to me a cup of tea and, brandishing the remote, asked, \"Does honey want her CP24?\" His tone of voice was exactly the tone you would use on a four-year-old begging for more Dora the Explorer.\n\nI don't care. I have no shame. CP24 is my crack. DELICIOUS, delicious crack.
