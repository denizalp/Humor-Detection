If you don't listen to the employee, you will pay twice as much, Hoeven I had great customer service and paid it odd in the 90 days ans only paid the small fee they explained to me at the beginning, the best part is they retorted to all three credit bureau that I went the 32 months, I now have credit card with the company I did not get aproved for the first time. Wish I knew about them years ago!
