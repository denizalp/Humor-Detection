What a great addition to the downtown area! Smooth Eats stepped into a former juice bar but added friendly service and a limited but well-executed menu. It's definitely an upgrade in my book.\n\nThe smoothies are all $5 and you can add on extra ingredients like flax seed, protein, etc. but I stick to the basics. The Beetbox and ProGreens are solid smoothies... actually, they're liquid, like they're supposed to be, but the flavors aren't overwhelmingly earthy, bitter, or sweet, which seems to happen when I take a chance on chain smoothies. \n\nThey have paninis, toasts, and acai bowls for those wanting something more substantial. So far, I've only tried the SD Toast (sundried tomato pesto, avocado, cilantro, sea salt) but I was impressed. I plan to try their strawberry version on my next visit!\n\nTIP: If you're driving, this grab and go business is in a paid parking area. Short of them getting a dedicated parking space out front, your best bet is to pull into the lot around back and be quick.
