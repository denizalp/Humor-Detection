Douchebag Central. There's extra charge for everything, including breathing it seems. You can smoke by the pool but you can't drink beyond the blue line and you'll be reprimanded if you cross it by an inch. The pool is small for such a huge place. There's limited space and we were asked to move, again, because we settled in the wrong place. This is a place for conspicuous consumption and people who buy into that. Disgusting. They can get away with this as there's not much competition around.
