Frustrated. When ordering an appetizer I expect it to come out before my sushi.  \n\nIt unfortunately was not.  It was served to me after my sushi. When I did not eat it and requested it removed from my bill as I was full by the time it arrived my request was flat out ignored. No let me check, no let me look into it just did not provide a response and another server brought my bill 10 minutes later. \n\nFood was mediocre and expensive. The restaurant gave off an odd smell or the grease trap was open. \n\nDisappointing as the area could use another good sushi spot.
