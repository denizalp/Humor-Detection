Back home my kids were attending a Kumon learning center for a few years.  When we moved here I wanted to continue the program.\n\nI made an appointment for an evaluation.  I sat out in the waiting room and got a chance to talk to other parents.  One parent raved about this location and  said his children made a lot of progress here.\n\nUsually Kumon is like $125 a month per subject (either math or reading).  However, the Kumon center in Summerlin was asking for a very large amount up front (over $800+).  I was shocked!\n\nI knew that back home I had no extra fees only $50 to start then I just started paying my monthly fee of $125 per child per subject and not some whopping amount all at once. \n\nA military discount for active duty members is given here as well. I will say the owner was very polite, very very patient with my children but I will have to consider this location as an option.
