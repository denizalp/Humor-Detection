If it's a Cult Count me IN ! !!  !!!   My Favorite Location of my Favorite Church of All-Time (so far)!  Another Reason to LOVE Charlotte\/Matthews!  When choosing a Church I'm looking to make Friends (not like FB or yelp for that matter) and I learned hear I could pick a Church that my friends would be attending!\n\nSound Biblical Teaching is Important AND after that I want Friends!  I made some Great Friends here and most of them pushed and Inspired me to take my ART further!  Very Important to have some people who LOVE You and even appreciate what you are doing!  \n\nOne of my Friends said this place reminded him of Laser-Tag and expected to see scores as we left!  What a GREAT Idea!\n\nMusic, well, um, I guess it is Good... If Mack Brock is Leading it is Way Better and if you are a Vocalist you might be able to learn something watching him (seems it is a BIG Secret since I have never seen anyone else do it)!  I will not complain that the Music is NOT my preference...Most Churches in the US will not be playing something that sounds like \"Insomnium\" nor \"Eisbrecher\" or any of the Neue Deutsche HÃ¤rte!  So what!  EarPlugs are a GREAT Idea!\n\nServing and Giving is Pushed and I think that is Excellent!  Most \"Churches I have attended do not talk about it enough!  As a SELFISH Person I LOVE to help people, it makes me feel so good, it is such a GREAT Idea to do something nice for others, without any recognition or \"reward\"!  I'm being open by saying I'm doing it for ME!
