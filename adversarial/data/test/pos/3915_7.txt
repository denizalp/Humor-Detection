China cottage never disappoints. Great, fast service, delicious selections, generous portions and fresh food. Get there early as lunch and dinner get very busy. \n\nOn this visit, we had their cashew chicken good, but not great, chicken 88, decent amount of spice, but too over bearing, and their house speciality, chilli chicken, which we all loved! Other favourites include their spicy mango salad, Hakka noodles and Hakka vegetables.\n\nTake out is also available if you want to eat at home. I'll be back and you won't be disappointed.
