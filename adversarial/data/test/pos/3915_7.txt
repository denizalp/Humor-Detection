Trust me, I'm Mexican. \n\nThis place has THE best carne asada I've had, besides my own ;) After shopping at Cardenas my son and I came here. This used to be an old Wendy's,  but they changed the inside drastically!  Nice! It was super later, almost 9 so I figured we'd get the janky meat. NOPE!\n\nWe ordered 4 tacos (2$ taco) de asada, paid, and went straight to the salsa bar. I noticed they had cilantro, onions, and various sauces so I figured to get a little of everything. The cashier brought out our food, which was really nice, and I noticed they were just plain tacos, just the meat and tortillas. I would definitely prefer more taco places to do this, because some people like my son, do not like onions and its a pain if you forget to tell them no onions. Also allows you to put as much cilantro or onions as you'd like. While examining the tacos, I noticed that the pieces of asada were huge! The tacos were definitely loaded! They come on a hot corn tortilla,  because seriously,  a taco on flour is a BURRITO. Pinches gavachos! And when I say the taco is packed, I mean it! I added my fixings and took a bite, my son had already finished one taco and was already getting his second one ready!\n\nThe asada here is cooked perfect, it is moist and tender, seasoning was on point as well, and did not taste like it had been sitting there for hours (Frijoles!) I had no gristle,  nor was it burned or charred. Coming as late as I did I expected that, but it was the opposite.  Mexicans always do it better! Lol. \n\nMy son is absolutely in love, so we will continue to frequent this spot after our trips to our motherland (Cardenas) haha. \n\nAJUAAA!
