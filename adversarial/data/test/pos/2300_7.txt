This place is straight up weird.  I could see this place being super busy and booming with popularity, especially with those awesome teppan tables.  But the outfit that the female servers wear is just a bit too creepy.  I could do without those.  The roll selection here is basic, but that's fine.  I got the roll that was on special, it was basically a California roll with chopped up deep fried shrimp.  I wasn't too hungry so it was nice that I didn't get a roll or food that I wanted to devour.  Service was attentive here and the bartender was interesting.  He asked my friend if she liked her drink because it was a drink he hadn't made in a while.  I liked that.  Other than that, this place is moderately priced, but not a place I'd go to on a regular basis.  Mainly because of the oddity and this place is just weird.  The drink specials look like a great deal, but unfortunately I wasn't in the mood to drink.
