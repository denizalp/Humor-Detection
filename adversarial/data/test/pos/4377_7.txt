Shoutout to Vegas Yelp locals Greyson N and Eric B, who brought me here. I didn't know we were even coming here, so I did not adequately prepare myself for the foods. Having a short few days in Vegas meant I was already making the most of it by eating the entire time. Not even 3 hours before I had been stuffing my face already. This ended up being meal number 4 for the day. \n\nLuckily, this was not an AYCE place. This is more like those Japanese BBQ places with a set menu, but with Korean banchan. They have a large variety of banchan including some dishes I've never seen before. All the items were very good. The meat itself was well seasoned and very tender. Of course, you get smaller but more appropriate portions of meats, which I definitely appreciated. Had this been an \"eat as much as you can to get your money worth\" location, I would not have been able to participate as well. \n\nUnlike other KBBQ joints, they cook everything for you. Instead of wasting your time trying not to burn your meat or figuring out if it's done or not, someone else does it. You are responsible for just putting it on your plate or directly into your mouth once it's done. \n\nWe had great attentive service in a lively atmosphere. I am definitely going to try to come back here again the next time I'm around.
