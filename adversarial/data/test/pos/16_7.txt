I drove to vegas may 6th,  to get my hair done.   im from huntington beach,  california,  and went all the way there,  well i had to get a place to stay,  because of the drive and time it takes to get hair extensions.  i booked a room at SOUTH POINT.  i heard it was nice,  besides it was close to the guys house that was doing my hair.   well my hair is destroyed,  but that is not what this is about.  the whole hotel stunk like a cigarette,  even my non smoking room,  which had dirty carpet,  and walls for a view outside my window,   the ac hardly worked and the room had practically no lite,   they also had some note about trying to conserve water or something,   like you should use your towels more than once,  and i dont think they change the sheets too often.  i booked that room a month in advance,   on top of that,  they booked it wrong at first so they billed my card twice for the room,  i was refunded the first cost but still,   when i went to actually confirm my room,  it was denied because of the double billing, thing.  that was resolved,  but my advice, is  DONT GO TO VEGAS TO GET HAIR EXTENSIONS  AND DONT STAY AT SOUTH POINT.
