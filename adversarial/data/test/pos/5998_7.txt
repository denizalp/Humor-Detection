This shopping center is rather ingeniously designed. Stairs take pedestrians past an outdoor dining area along Brownsville Road and into the parking lot. A sidewalk runs through the middle of the lot, making it easy and safe to cut across (a pair of benches have been installed in the center of said sidewalk). Business-wise, it's much ado about nothing. There's an excellent Giant Eagle, the gnarly sports gear shop Definitely You, and aside from that, one could find everything else here at any other strip mall. BTS has a Radio Shack, a Dollar General, a USPS store, a Wine & Spirits, and a bank if you need 'em. Think of it as Caste Village only less interesting.
