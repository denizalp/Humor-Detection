Our waitress was Penelope Cruz or her doppelg√§nger.\n\nPenelope made some recommendations. Me? I ordered the Green Chile burrito (not on her list of recommendations). While the burrito was very tasty, perhaps a bit on the heavy side for lunch, the fresh-looking tacos that were served up at my table for my companions looked sooo yummy. I only ate half of the burrito and learned you want to listen to the recommendations from Penelope!\n\nThe chips and salsa were yummy. If you decide to order the burrito (even when Penelope is recommending something else), don't eat all the chips and salsa first, leave room for the main entree.\n\nPlenty of inside and outside seating. We opted for outside as the weather was perfect.\n\nI'll definitely come here again, but I'm listening to Penelope next time! She knows her food.
