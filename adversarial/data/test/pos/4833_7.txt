This is one of my favorite breakfast places in the valley! However, you need to get there early on the weekends because it gets crowded. It's not too bad of a wait, about 25 to  35 minutes. \n\nI love their apple crepes and the bacon is really thick and yummy! Don't sleep on the blueberry crepes either! They are delicious! If you like fluffy omelettes then you will love the omelettes here. I still prefer the omelettes at Waffle House.  They also have wonderful skillet breakfasts as well!  Great coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice!
