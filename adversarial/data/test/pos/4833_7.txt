It's not really a coffee shop despite its name. It's more like a Denny's because they serve a variety of American food and they're open 24 hours. \n\nThe food itself wasn't very good. 3 of my friends and I shared a chicken pot pie which was more like thick chicken noodle soup in a bread bowl, cobb salad, chicken caesar salad, and a quesadilla. The salads were okay, and the quesadilla was very average. Nothing really memorable. But it's pretty dang overpriced. I guess that's expected as a restaurant inside a Vegas hotel. \n\nService was super sweet though! Everyone from the host to the servers were really nice and always smiling. But all in all, I'd rather eat at McDonalds than this place to get my service with a smile.
