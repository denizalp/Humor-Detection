Not only is the staff helpful, their prices are great! They'll price match furniture, which is great too. I found an Ashley couch online for $100 less than what they were offering, and they matched the price! Plus, they have delivery all over the valley too!\nI haven't used it, but they also have 0% financing for those that want\/need their furniture now.
