I recently started going back to Great Clips.  I kind of forgot about them for a while and was going to a more expensive place much further away.  I'm glad I'm back.  I get better haircuts there and it is much easier to check in.  The other place added a check in that I found to be a hassle.  This place has the Great Clips app which shows you the wait time so you can pass if the wait is long.  By the way this location is pretty busy so the app. has been useful.  I have not got a bad haircut here but I have settled on one stylist who cuts my hair the best.  I did go to one farther away when this place was busy and I was disappointed with my cut.
