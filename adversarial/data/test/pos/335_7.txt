I can't understand why this place gets such high ratings.  The burgers are just not good.   The meat was flavorless and tasted low quality.  The fries and tots were ok, but nothing special.  The worst part was the service-we waited an hour to receive our burgers.  The only highlight was the Jamaican corn side dish.  I would not return.
