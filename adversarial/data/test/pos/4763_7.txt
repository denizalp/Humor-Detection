I was here last night and I've always been impressed. This is a better version of Starbucks with more neighbourhood feel (they hire the locals, oy!). The servers are friendlier and the coffee is at par with Starbucks. \n\nLately, my Starbucks taste bud is dissipating and moving towards to more organic and local coffee. \n\nThere is a free wifi inside so do not expect to be seated when school starts - this is like a library with tons of keyboard-pushing students that order one cup of coffee. It can be noisy at the back due to loud music (perhaps to annoy chair hoggers) so make sure that you stay to the front of the cafe. \n\nThey serve coffee in mugs and not the environmentally-disastrous coffee cups. Think business class seats on the plane. I am pretentious I know, I still buy Starbucks Americano weekly. \n\nThe mini chocolate that comes with your coffee is a nice touch but is generally useless - why do you need chocolate with your coffee? \n\nThe price is reasonable, the chairs are comfy and the space is big. \n\nCome here and have battle for your seats. It's worth it.
