Okay.\nThis place just plain sucks.\nNo water stations inside the park,lousy turf,almost no shade and almost no place to sit.\nI never know when it's going to be open or not.\nIt's hit and miss like the reliability of a 2 bit crack dealer.\nWhy 3 stars?\nBecause people who come here tend not to be stark raving assholes like elsewhere and they actually let their dogs be....dogs....\nSo if you're one of those nervous dog parents who bring your nellie ass dog to a dog park,but don't want them to behave or play like the dogs they are;or if you're one of those holier than thou anti social too good for you types,do us both a favor will ya?\nJust stay the fuck out of this Attica of dog parks so the real owners and real dogs can have at least this one small thing.\nK?
