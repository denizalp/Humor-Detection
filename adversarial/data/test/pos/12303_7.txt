One of the smaller locations I have been to but they are jam packed with all sorts of goodies to browse through. \n\nSanrio, comic and cartoon characters galore, but beware the very narrow aisles and the multiple \"you break it, you buy it\" signs taunting you with every step you make.\n\nService was pleasant and friendly. Looking at particular items, they assisted quickly to get pricing and to reach items on higher shelves.
