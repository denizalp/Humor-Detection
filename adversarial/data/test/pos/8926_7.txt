Ok, I have been here a few times and have really only had one good experience and that was when it first opened up 2 years ago or so. I came here about a month ago and I noticed the little areas around been here a few times and have really only have 1 good experience and that was when its first opened up 2 years ago or so. I came here about a month ago and I noticed the little areas around the counter area had dried on disgusting grease. I was super appalled, and felt super bad because there were only two girls working at the time. That visit I saw the meats that were offered, and the girl offered to give me a sample of each. The beef definitely had been sitting there for at least an hour because it was now basically carmelized meat. The chicken was super dry and there wasn't but a spoonful left. And the pork was blah. \n\nFast forward to today, it was around 6:30 pm and we went in to order dinner. The place was dead, just like it was the last time we went in, but this time there were three girls working. Once again I go to the counter and see it's still disgusting and dirty right by where they keep the plates and bowls and I'm assuming it's a microwave or something. So I ordered the kids chicken bowl and a half pound box of the bark. Again the beef and the chicken look like they had been sitting there for at least an hour, the fish was also uncovered and there were flies around the food. I decided to go with the brown rice with the chicken for my kids bowl. When she actually gave me the scoop of chicken it was pitiful, then she put on some cheese, lettuce, jalapenos, sour cream, and some cilantro that looked like it had been there for at least 2 hours. When she rang me up the total came out to 17 dollars and change, I asked her why the price was that much, and she said the child's bowl was $5.95. Now I don't mind paying $5.95 for a kids meal, but I want to pay that much for a meal, not a tiny ass rice bowl. I didn't have it in my heart to tell her I did not want it after all, because it was already made, and I was already getting irritated. When I asked the price breakdown of the $5.95 she said the bowl itself  is $3.95, and to add the chicken it's an additional $2. Now that 2 dollars would have been fine if it was a large heaping scoop of chicken that hadn't been sitting there for the majority of the evening. But this was not that, this was a half of a scoop of dried up funky ass chicken. I hadn't really paid attention to the size of the bowl so I paid for my food and left. \n\nUpon getting home I became even more irritated! I could literally almost wrap my entire hand around the $5.95 \"bowl\" that I bought. Keep in mind, this $5.95 price tag does not include any drink or chips or anything else. It's just a small ass bowl. I get that it's a childs portion; but I wouldn't even call it a bowl its more like a soap dish full of rice. And, a regular sized bowl is only $1 which I failed to notice until the end!\n\nI don't think I will be returning, I've come here a few times, but things have just steadily gone downhill. This is not a Chipotle of any type! Chipotle is not this disgusting, nor has their food ever sat for over 30 minutes marinating in its own grease. So please stop comparing it to that, because it's definitely, definitely not that. I really think that they need to reevaluate the pricing, because for what you pay you can literally go and buy yourself a meal at another place and have fresh delicious food. In fact I had to go next door to stupid McDonalds just to purchase a side of french fries for that child's bowl accompaniment. They were extremely fresh and hot and even though extra fattening, they were delicious. \n\nI guess instead of complaining of the shit food, I'm gonna practice what I preach and go elsewhere. \n\nBoy bye!
