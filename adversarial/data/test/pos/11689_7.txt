With my crazy schedule that I'm on lately, it's hard to get in appointments at the nail salons that I usually go to. One of the techs suggested I try Nail Star, a brand new salon that had just opened up here in Henderson. \n\nIt wasn't busy yet when arrived since they just started their day. So I did not have no wait time for my walk-in appointment.  Was good to see a familiar face here, Joey! He's done my nails before, so I knew I'd be in good hands with him. \n\nCute salon! Everything is brand new, clean and sparkly! Especially the pretty pedi bowls! And yes they do use liners. They also have massage chairs so you can relax while getting your pedicure done \n\nOn both visits Joey did a great job as usual with my pedi and mani. Always meticulous. He can paint freehand designs as long as it's not complicated. Only concern I had though I had chip issues with the gel polish used. But Joey fixed the nail when I returned for my pedicure. \n\nFor the quality and time put into my manicure and pedi, the prices they charge are great! Happy that I have another reliable option to go to!
