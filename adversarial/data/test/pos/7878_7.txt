Special dinner for my special sis. We were a table of 4, the entrance is quite dramatic with the very high escalators up and down into the restaurant. They have a fun photo booth you can use before during and after your meal and we had such a hoot. It's all digital! We got the table by the window in the corner and I would say the ambience is really fun because they've got modern music playing at a moderate level and it's just so big and airy inside but also warm. Our server was beyond incredible he was very busy but always funny and attentive when needed. He made our birthday celebration very special and also didn't make us feel so bad that the table adjacent to us asked to be moved. We were just having fun and taking selfies but as my sister said. They just wanted a different experience. Haha. Ok to the food -  bone in rib-eye, arugula salad, lobster ravioli, lemon pasta, octopus, mushroom bruschetta. Omg. Everything tasted delicious!  Our drinks were perfection, I got the cosmo Blanco and the amaretto coffee after. Yummmm! So Giada, simple and delicious.
