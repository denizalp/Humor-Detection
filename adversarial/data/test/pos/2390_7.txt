Even as a gay guy, I can appreciate these beautiful women.  I thought the host was fine, though overly processed when she was singing with too much reverb and delay.\n\nThe comedian was very funny and racy.\n\nI've seen other topless shows on the strip like Crazy Girls,  but Fantasy felt classier.\n\nFantasy uses the same stage that host CarrotTop, so feel free to use this joke as you are exiting the theater \"Man, CarrotTop's show has really changed for the better.\"
