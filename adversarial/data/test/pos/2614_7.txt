All the things I love about Luana's\n\n- The Energy you get from Aaron is great! He's super friendly, very driven, energetic, and all around a great guy.\n- The Coffee is locally roasted\n- When he's at the at the nursery it's only a mile away from my house. \n- You get a ton of great and fun choices of coffee's and teas. \n- Your first drink and your birthday drink is free. \n- You can always find out their times and location's on his social media if you cant get enough of Luana's Coffee. \n- Everything is so dang cute and hand made. Not just the coffee but the sign, his truck, the labels, everything.\n- Aaron's a small business owner and I love to support local. \n- Aaron is making his dreams come true\n\nYou just need to go and give it a try! You will thank me later.
