I'm reviewing Ryerson University as someone who stayed here on accommodation purposes, not as someone who attended the University as a student. Because I have not. \n\nI stayed here about a year and a half ago when I was over in Canada performing a show in Mississauga. Why didn't I stay much closer to Mississauga you ask? I repeatedly asked my director the same question.  Regardless, Ryerson was a great place to stay I thought! It's so close to all of Toronto's local amenities, including a Subway right round the corner I frequently visited! The staff who worked in the reception area were always pleasant and helpful, and the rooms we stayed in were great for 2 weeks, not sure how longer I could've put up with the mint green walls though...
