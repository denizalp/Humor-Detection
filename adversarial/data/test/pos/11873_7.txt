This is the St Laurent location of the family owned and operated Jardin Du Cari. Same bare bones decor as the rest, with maps and posters pinned to the walls, same delicious roti with pumpkin. The veggie roti with pumpkin is one of my favourite inexpensive comfort foods in town, I pick it up for dinner about once per week, and I get the man the goat. Make sure you get the hot sauce that usually comes with, and make sure you're a bit careful with it. I love spicey and am always tempted to slather this stuff everywhere because it's deliciously mangoy and lemony but it's also badass burn your insides hot. The perfect antidote if you've had too much of the hot sauce is the peanut punch, creamy and not too sweet or peanut buttery. Like an inexplicable number of places in the area, Jardin du Cari is closed on Mondays.
