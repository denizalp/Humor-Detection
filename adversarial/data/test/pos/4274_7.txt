We happened on this stunning outdoor space walking from the metro to our chocolate restaurant. Pictures do not do it justice.\n\nI am a sucker for squares, and have always wanted to live on or near one.  The homes in this area are beautiful.  Folks were sitting and reading, laying on blankets, and picnicking on this warm summer day.\n\nIdyllic....except maybe the man urinating on one of the porches....a bit TMI! City life...
