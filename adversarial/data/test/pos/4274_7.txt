Much better than the \"Bang Mi Boys\" which are a bunch of guys I used to date in Toronto.\n\nWhat to get: Bulgogi or Pork Banh Mi. Amazing.\nWhat else: If anyone tells you not to come here, it's a load of Bull, gogi.\n\nI came here looking for Boy George and George Michael, Bono and Simon LeBon, Bob Geldof and Paul Young. I should have gone to \"Band Aid Boys\" instead.\n\nBMB is worth absolutely all the hype. And there is plenty of hype. I know people, both Torontonononononians, and people who have visited here a lot, who, asked which one single place I should eat in T Dot, have said BMB. But it really is that good. I love Mi and good Banh, but not all BMs are created equal, and BMB is the pigs of the Animal Farm.\n\nIf you think having children should be illegal, maybe you're one of those \"Ban Seed Boys.\"\n\nThe first time I came here I had their Bulgogi Banh Mi, and this most recent time it was the pork. Either way you can't go wrong. They're utterly amazing. I could eat 5 of them in one sitting, but they're not the cheapest, so I probably wouldn't.\n\nI asked them to sing a little ditty on their mini guitar. They didn't oblige. Should have gone to \"Banjo Boys.\"\n\nTheir other location on Yonge St is just as good, but slightly busier with even less parking options. Don't miss out on one of the best sandwiches in North America when you're up in Toronto.\n\nAnd if you're sick of Scott Stapp, I am too. So let's go to the \"Ban Creed Boys.\"
