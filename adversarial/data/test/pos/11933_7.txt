Pleasantly surprised to find dim sum in Summerlin.\nI was even more surprised to have enjoyed my pickings.\nI'm not the chicken feet gnawing kind of dim sum girl and I stick to my faves.\n\nBaked Honey Glazed BBQ Bun: I LOVED these! They came out fresh from the oven. Warm, super soft and the perfect ratio of filling to bun. The BBQ pork wasn't fatty or oozy and had excellent flavor. I had to order a few to take home to share.\n\nHar Gow: I liked them. Ok they might not be the traditional dim sumy kind but 2 orders of them (4 pieces\/order) found their way into my tummy.\n\nSweet Rice Cake (honeycomb cake). I felt like a kid going to the Bakery in Chinatown with my parents. I haven't been able to find these cakes and it was exactly the way I remember. Slightly sweet, glutinous honeycomb, bouncy texture with a hint of fermentation.\nI love that my daughter got to try it and likes it as much as I do.\n\nI'm giving 4 stars to encourage my Yelpers to give them a shot. It's nice having a dim sum place near school outside of Spring Mountain. Dim Sum Cafe definitely \"touched my heart\".
