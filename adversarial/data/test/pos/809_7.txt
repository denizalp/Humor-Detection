DO IT. JUST DO IT. YESTERDAY YOU SAID TOMORROW, SO JUST. DO IT. \n\nAnd go eat at Wicked Spoon. \n\nThis place is getting quite popular and with good cause, its got over 4k Yelp reviews. This is my favorite buffet in the world. After a long Vegas weekend this is my favorite place to go for Sunday brunch and binge before the trip home. Things are primarily individual serving-size dishes which is great because it means people move quickly through the lines, it lets you eat as much or as little as you want, and try lots of different things. About $35 for a visit, which is well worth it and a great value in the world of Vegas buffets. \n\nThis is in the category of more \"gourmet\" buffets around. Steak on point, omelets and waffles are great. The desserts are especially good, try them all. \n\nSort of nestled in the back of the Cosmopolitan, you've got walk for a bit through the hotel and there will be a line, but it shouldn't be more than 20 minutes. Service is also accommodating and fast, a refreshing change for most things around Vegas.
