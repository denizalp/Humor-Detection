\"Human Nature\" had the odds stacked against it.  Envision my anger after inhaling a carton of cigarettes while walking through the Imperial Palace.  Imagine the scowl on my face when I saw our seats were near the back and I had to turn my chair around to face the stage.  Picture my furrowed brow when I started to think that no show in this dump was worth my time.\n\nThese poor boys didn't stand a chance.\n\nSo, when I'm giving this show 5 stars, I'm really giving them 348 stars because they overcame so much.  I LOVED it.  Lovedlovedlovedlovedloved it.\n\nI must begin by saying I was an odd duck growing up.  My radio dial was set to the oldies station all through middle school.  So I know Motown music.  I love Motown music.  But you don't need to need to be a fan of Motown to enjoy this show.  These boys will easily convince you that you've been missing out your entire life.\n\nTheir harmonies are spot-on and they sing with passion and soul.  Their energy reaches unnatural levels as they dance the ENTIRE time they are on stage.  And they not only dance, but they've got MOVES.  I would imagine that if The Temptations were to watch their show, they would give Human Nature a standing ovation.\n\nAnd this is all coming from four Australian boys.\n\nThere's just enough commentary between the songs to pique your interest in the group without ever feeling drawn out.  They're charming, have good banter amongst themselves, and what they're saying doesn't feel scripted.  The band plays perfectly and brings the songs to life.  The stage production is surprisingly good considering the casino and theater it's in.\n\nIt's great!  Go see it!  Just make sure you close your eyes and have someone escort you to the theater so you don't have to look at the Imperial Palace!
