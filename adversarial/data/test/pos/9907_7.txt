HOLY SHIT, MOTHER OF GOD, THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!  \n\nFirst off, I am planning to file a lawsuit against this place -- because they have MADE ME ADDICTED TO SOUL FOOD!!!!!   Second, if you can't hear me, that is because you might be deafened by the sound of how FRIGGING INCREDIBLE THIS PLACE IS.  \n\nOk, maybe a little over the top, but it is well-deserved.  \n\nEveryone from my office strolled down here one day, figuring we might as well try a new local business.  The service was on the spot.  Your butt hits the chair and the cornbread gets slapped down in front of you.  You look at it... its a pancake.  You think, \"ok, sure, I'll eat this while I wait.\"  Then, this corn goodness just explodes in your mouth.  Seriously, I could eat just the cornbread.  \n\nThe first time I ate there, I had the Oxtail.  Then, that's what I had the next three times too, because it was sooooo good.  But, I figured that I should at least explore the menu a bit.  The chicken and waffles just might have to be on my short list if I am ever offered a \"last meal.\"  The breading here is like nothing I have ever tasted before.  The liver and onions?  FORGET EVERYTHING YOU THINK YOU KNOW ABOUT LIVER AND ONIONS!  They are a spiritual experience.  Turkey leg!  Howl at the freakin moon and call me sally!  Whatever that means.... \n\nI have yet to eat anything here that didn't make me crave it the next day.  I HATE this place, as it has caused me to put 5 lbs on in the past month eating here.  I CANT STOP!  \n\nYeah, its THAT good.  \n\nAnd, the food isn't the only great thing.  The people who work here are so nice, great service.  \n\nI guess if I had to say anything is not 100%, maybe the atmosphere?  But, that's only if you are looking for \"atmosphere.\"  It is utilitarian.  Nothing fancy.  Frankly, I am glad for that.  It does not NEED any accoutrements, or padded booths, or anything else.   This is the kind of place that keeps you coming again and again with great food and great service.  I love, love, love this place.  Best thing to happen to the neighborhood!
