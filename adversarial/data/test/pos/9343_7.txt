I was invited to Puma Yoga Studio by my friend who is pregnant and wanted to try their Pre-Natal Yoga class. She asked me if I would do it with her since she has never done yoga before. I purchased the $40 for 4 weeks new student special and went to the class with her. Laura, the instructor was great. I felt a little bad\/guilty that I was in a Prenatal class even though I wasn't pregnant but Laura made me feel at ease. My favorite thing about the class is that she took the time to talk and have everyone get to know each other a little bit. I've done yoga at a couple other studios and just didn't like the vibe (too many students.. felt judged). Puma truly made me feel relaxed and happy. I liked the class so much I signed up the next two weeks for the basics class.
