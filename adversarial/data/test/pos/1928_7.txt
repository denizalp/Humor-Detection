I love The Church! This is the only chicken spot of the big three that does not give me bubble gut itus. There has to be something in the batter with Popeyes and the colonel that has me wishing for death soon after eating their chicken. Church's so far has been friendly with my bowels. Fantastik!!!\n\nI love their chicken, but I am forced to endure the constant disappointment with the service at this Church's Chicken.  It must have been a chore for the chicken technician to get some hot sauce the couple of times I asked for it.  Today I got my regular 2 piece and a biscuit w\/ HOT SAUCE... I hurry home with the thoughts of Church's Chicken being devoured by my being with the essence of Louisiana hot sauce being inhaled through my nostrils. SHE THREW IN KETCHUP!!! CHEESE 'N RICE!!!
