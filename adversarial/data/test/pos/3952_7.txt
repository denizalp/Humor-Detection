I love soft-serve ice cream. However, I didn't know what I was getting myself into when I walked into Chocolats Favoris. I came here to kill some time before meeting up at a restaurant nearby. This place is huge. I felt like I won a golden ticket to Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. They have a variety of chocolate products to fulfill all of your chocolate dreams.\n\nBut let's get real, I was here for the soft-serve. You just have to choose a size and a soft-serve flavor at the cash register. The choice of chocolate dip and topping can be decided at the dipping station. I decided on the salted dark chocolate since the hazelnut praline was out. I was a bit confused about the topping since no where on the signage did it mention toppings, so I skipped out. But next time I will go nuts on the nuts. After receiving the cone, I thought to myself there was no way this was going to freeze like in the photos. It was still wet from the dip when I received it, but a few seconds later, it solidified. The salted dark chocolate was so good, the dark chocolate was bitterly dark and the flavor was enhanced by the saltiness. However, the solidified chocolate turned out to be quite thick that eating the whole thing became a mission. I enjoyed the perfectly thick soft-serve in the middle. I purchased a small cone and that was quite filling. I couldn't imagine ordering a larger size.\n\nThere's a water fountain near the back tables. However, I couldn't figure out where to get cups. There are also 2 unisex washrooms, you know, like at home. One is an accessible washroom. Kudos to Chocolats Favoris for making their store friendly to everyone.
