When we adopted our shih tzu, the rescue volunteer that did our home visit recommended Royal Pets when I asked where we should take her. Our dog was shy and scared easily, did not like strange places or strange dogs or strange people. But without fail, every time we took her to be groomed, she did not want to go home with us. The groomer would bring her out (and she always looked great), and then she would try to follow her back in when it was time for us to go. It's a magical doggie wonderland behind that door.\n\nThey also did our long-haired cat's yearly haircut - very straightforward, no fuss no muss, and hands-down the least traumatic grooming my cat has ever had. I got to sit with her and hold her the entire time (cat is not a fan of being put in a box and taken to strange places - at all). \n\nI did not know how good I had it until we moved to Chicago; we finally found a good dog groomer, but they don't do cats, and they're not Royal Pets.
