Our cheap rental is turning out to be $450 more because of the dent on the hood they insist was our responsibility. \n\nBIG TIP: Make a representative walk around the car with you and sign off on the no dents before you take the car off the lot or you could be the next one duped. \n\nI have never given a company a bad rating and I should have looked  here before renting at Fox since not many people had anything good to say.
