There are 2 reasons why the name of this ice cream counter is appropriate:\n\n1. One gets a chill from stepping foot into the Ice Queen neighborhood (if one could even call it that)  of Forest Hill Village\n2. the place has ice cream of course\n\nThough Forest Hill Village is not, as indicated above, the friendliest of areas in the city, it is worth going to this ice cream shop, if only for the sole reason that they always have Greg's Roasted Marshmallow on hand.  Greg's has its own venue on Bloor St. but one is not guaranteed that the flavour will be available .\n\nThe Village Chill also has a variety of waist watchers' options and that wacky Asian ice cream made up of hail sized balls.  \n\nMy advice: tough out the Forest Hill snobbery and enjoy yourself a good ol' fashioned cone.
