My first visit was when I realized this location was trending on yelp awhile back.  I visited on a Saturday afternoon.  I ate a sandwich.  I liked it.  I can't remember what it was.  But...I know I liked it.  And so....my review would wait. That was until...I was tasked with the answering the question, that is..similar to answering the question of one's existence.....\"Where are we going to eat lunch?\"  Remembering how much I liked TSS, I threw it out there.  I was happy it was accepted..now I could write a review.  Upon our visit, the one thing I noticed right off the bat, was the staff was not as helpful as I last remembered on my previous visit. I started to panic, but when I spied the \"The Winston Cooper\"  I knew everything would be alright.  The Winston Cooper incorporates a delicious combination of hot pastrami, roast beef, and salami.  You get your choice of cheese, i chose American.  I wanted everything on it.  This included Mayo, Mustard, Secret Sauce (Garlic\/herbs & Olive Oil), Lettuce, Tomato, Pickles, Onions & Peppers.  I asked for a side of \"Bomb Sauce\"...this beauty is a fusion of Ranch and Jalape√±o.  I chose the \"Dutch Crunch\" for bread.  It was a solid roll. This excellent sandwich was paired with some chips and a fountain drink.  If your looking for drink to just go with a sandwich, check in...your gonna get a drink for free (As of October. 2015).  Overall, I found the ingredients to be very fresh.  I look forward to visiting again!!
