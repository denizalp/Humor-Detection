I have found my home for street tacos ($1.43+tax) and tortas ($6.69+tax) The meat here is simple and delicious. No frills, just \"con todo\" - which on a Torta is buttered bread,chopped iceberg lettuce, tomato, and avocado. I've tried so many places that this the best of the best when it comes to replacing LA street tacos, burritos, tortas, and mulitas. \n\nGrungy location in a run down Mexican plaza (behind Farm Basket).
