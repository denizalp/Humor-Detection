My family and I were looking for a place for breakfast-this place was recommended by Hotel Bonaventure and guess what-\n\nTHEY MEAN BUSINESS with BrEaKfAsT!\n\nThey serve it all day!\n\nThe order-\nI had ham and asparagus crepes=amazingly delicious!\n\nMy Mami had the Avocado toast with a poached egg and LoVeD it!\n\nMy Dad had oatmeal with fresh berries, cream and sugar.\n\nOur Waiter-\nLaurent was exceptionally attentive refilling our coffee cups several times as the restaurant was packed and it took a while to receive our order.\nLaurent liked to chat with us and recommended some places to go including the World's Largest BARBIE DOLL MUSEUM-more about that in a future review! He said he posed as \"Ken\" in the life-sized pink Barbie Box in the exhibit!  Cool find!
