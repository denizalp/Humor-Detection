Since this is the only Scottsdale address, I'm assuming it's the headquarters - could be mistaken. In any case, I am a 20+ year customer (joined when TruWest was MECU) and am finally so fed up with the poor service and rude customer service agents that have cancelled all of my TruWest accounts. \n\nAll of my CU business is now with another CU, which offers much more advanced online services, as well as more polite agents. \n\nStay away from TruWest unless you want to be frustrated on a constant basis!
