What a strange experience. \n\nMy sister and I trekked over here for lunch one day, after she had heard good things about it. I wish they had been true. \n\nThe place looks like bar. It is a bar, but I expected it to be a little more cozy considering the emphasis they place on the food. Ah well. \n\nWe ordered a fried chicken sandwich, a fried green tomato sandwich, and tater tots to share. The sandwiches came out with nothing but the cheese on them- no lettuce, tomato, mayo, mustard, etc.- and we reread the menu thinking that we had misinterpreted what a sandwich consisted of here. We were right- the usual sandwich ingredients had been left off. The tater tots were good, but it would take special talent to screw those up.\n\nThe server\/bartender didn't bother coming back to check on us until we were just about done eating the mediocre food. When he did, I mentioned that the sandwiches were lacking the lettuce and tomato, and he called the cook out. The cook, who looked about 17 and stoned, seemed shocked that he could have forgotten to finish the sandwiches, and asked if we wanted some lettuce. We told him thanks but no thanks, considering we were finished eating. He insisted, offering to bring us a bowl of lettuce. WTF? \n\nThe server was nice enough to offer a small discount for the mess-up, but it was all a bit strange and I don't think I'll be going back.
