I DO NOT recommend this place. They are grumpy, unprofessional and inexperienced.\n\nI went in for a pedicure. The chubby girl with the dreads did it. I didn't catch her name. It was a mediocre job and I could tell she was new so I didn't complain because the girl still needed practice. I really wanted to get a manicure as well but since she didn't do a good job on my feet I just asked for a polish change on my hands so my nail polish could match.\n\nIt was $35 for a regular pedicure and $10 for a polish change.\n\nWhen the girl finished I walked out and then I noticed in the sunlight that she didn't even remove all of my old polish on my hands and it still remained on the perimeter of my nails. I debated going back in and having them fix it for a bit, but I figured I paid for it, might as well. \n\nThe manager ended up cleaning my nails with a little brush. She removed excess polish that the other girl left on my fingertips and insisted that it wasn't a bad paint job. I asked her if she could just repaint them. She just brushed me off and didn't even make eye contact with me. All I said was that the original procedure was simple. Remove the old polish and paint on new polish. She then raised her voice at me and said,\"Yea, it is simple!\" and said the left over nail polish was just dry skin and acetone does that. I ended up painting the nails that didn't have polish all the way on the sides myself!\n\nThe manager told me I was overreacting and didn't understand the way the product works. They didn't apologize for anything. I don't know if she was having a bad day or something but that entire team could have handled the situation better. \n\nWhat upset me the most was the worker continuing to argue with me.
