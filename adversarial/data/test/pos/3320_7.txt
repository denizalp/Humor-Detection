Not bad. Not bad at all. I expected this to be where suburbanites come to prowl aka cougar town USA. While the cougars were definitely out, it was fun people watching for sure!\n\nI was trying to describe this place to someone the other day. I tried to say it was like Dave and Busters, but with a dance club\/live band area and bowling. But that's really not doing it justice. It's actually pretty cool! \n\nWhile I wouldn't say the food would blow anyone away, we had some light appetizers (chips\/gauc and pretzels) and they weren't bad. Plus, the tap list wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I expected Bud, Bud Light, Miller Lite... you get the point? But they had that and seasonal brews. Sadly the one that sounded good, the Leinenkugel vanilla porter was tapped out, but I'm lame and settled with a Yuengling. I love love love when it comes out ice cold... you can just tell when it's badly tapped. \n\nThe bowling was $45 per hour before 10pm, then went down to $35. But you can have 6 (and maybe 8??) on one lane, so it really wasn't too high a price. We bought two hours and got in 2 games and a little bit of another. It's nice that they have servers coming around to take your drink orders too, so you don't have to go to the bar. \n\nI also enjoyed the live band. And I'll note, I'm not a live band person, but they weren't bad! They played everything from 90's pop to current hits like Blurred Lines and LMFAO. In between sets they had a DJ playing. \n\nI kept thinking it would have been a really fun place to come as a teenager. Something to do instead of getting into trouble:) Plus, it actually seemed like a good amount of families were there playing games in the game room or eating dinner. Plus, it would be fun to watch big games at because they have massive TV screens in the bowling and bar area. \n\nSo obviously you can see I'm surprised at how much I enjoyed myself. And I'm sure you're dying to know how awesome I did at bowling, because I beat everyone!\n\nDisclaimer: I did not beat everyone, I kinda sucked. But it was fun still!
