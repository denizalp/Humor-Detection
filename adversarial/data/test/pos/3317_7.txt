Had takeout from here twice and dined-in for the first time last night - so time for a review!\n\nThis place has certainly seen the the neighbourhood change since it opened in 1969. While the fabric shop has been replaced by a liquor store and the wig store replaced by Llantera El Rincon Tires and Rims, La Piñata remains constant, serving Sonoran Mexican cuisine and famous for it's Chimichanga. If you are struggling to find La Piñata, it's right across the street from Vlad's Barbershop (who also buys gold)\n\nService has always been very friendly here with the owner(?) always happy to strike up a conversation about the weather or the utility companies or the state of the nation. The hostesses and the servers are customer orientated too.\n\nIn my three visits I've had the Beef Asada Burro, the Chicken Quesadilla and the Shrimp Baja. The first thing worth mentioning is the portion size, absolutely massive! Certainly enough to make a meal again the next day. The burro was packed with heaps of meat, perfectly cooked and seasoned, onions, tomatoes, cilantro - excellent. There are two chicken quesadillas on the menu, Charbroiled or Machacadilla. The charbroiled is only meat, the machacadilla adds veggies. The choice is yours, they are both great. The shrimp for the Shrimp Baja was very good, although it was probably my least favourite of the three dishes and lacked a punch.\n\nGreat Mexican beer selection (plus Bud Light if you prefer to drink water!) and although we didn't have one, the margaritas looked amazing. The place is obviously very popular because the restaurant was almost full when we came in around 6pm and the tables turned while we were there.
