She's so lucky, she's a Mini Mart, but she cries cries cries with the wrong Lotto numbers.\n\nThis is a cute store selling all kinds of spices and fruits, and not as obnoxiously expensive as some of the convenience stores around here. The guys running it are really nice and the bananas and oranges we picked up (I use them every day for my blended fruit drink) were tasty and I ended up eating most of them before it was even time to make my drink. Shopping up and down this street is a real treat with all kinds of ethnic delights, but if you want healthy stuff to take home, this is a good place to stop. The guys are really cool in here too, or at least were when I was there.
