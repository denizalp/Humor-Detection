Ok, I admit it: I love having my teeth cleaned. There's nothing like running the tip of your tongue over clean, smooth and fresh teeth. So, you can imagine my excitement when I decided to go in for my quarterly cleaning. \n\nHaving received a voucher in the mail, I figured 25$ off a service was enough of a draw to get me in. Granted, this voucher wasn't mine - it was for the previous occupant of my apartment. But, hell, the dental office didn't know that. \"A friend gave it to me,\" I told them when I presented it proudly at 8 a.m. one morning. I was then told that's for birthdays only, and when my birthday comes around, I'll get mine to use. Oh. Well, I was already there, so I might as well stay - without the voucher even. Good thing my dental insurance covered the cleaning. \n\nAfter 30 minutes of waiting, I'm escorted back to a regular, average-sized dental office. You know, all decked out with the typical dental chair and machinery. That's when I'm told that the X-rays I emailed weren't going to be enough, so they had to re-take 'em. WTF. Ugh. \n\nFirst off, I hate stuff being stuck in my mouth. It pinches my cheeks and hurts. So, when the dental hygienist said, \"You have a really small mouth,\" I wasn't surprised. It wasn't the first time I heard it. Nor was it the first time I had ever had X-rays taken. Hell, I got 8 beautiful veneers last year. You don't get those overnight. That's one helluva process, which includes way too many impressions (translation: gooey-ness and mouth pieces stuck in your mouth for at least a minute.) \n\nSo, I sucked it up. It had to be done. It was the means to an end, I told myself. Besides, my dental insurance should cover it. \n\nThat's when I was told they then had to measure my gums. An assistant was called in and the poking and counting began. I didn't mind, but it was more of my time devoted to routine practice... and not the cleaning I had been dreaming of. Oh, sweet cleaning, why were you playing hard to get?!?\n\nImagine my frustration when, after the Gum \"stuff\" and X-rays were taken (a few re-taken due to bad shots), I then had to have my mandatory consultation with the dentist. I guess he, himself, had to poke and prod around my gums and teeth. That's when he wanted to talk about replacing a couple caps and taking care of a cavity I have. Uhm, now? All I wanted was a cleaning. Seriously. \n\nPlus, he heard that a friend referred me. \"What friend?\" He asked. \"Uh, Christy.\" I lied. \"Christy who? I only ask because I like to thank my patients when they refer their friends.\" I was cracking up inside. Of course he did. \"I don't know,\" I said, \"I don't really know her that well.\"\n\nThat's when I checked the time. It was close to 10 and I had a meeting. Was this really happening? I told them I had to get going because of work. Ok, so maybe I didn't look like the young professional I am when I'm sitting in a dentist chair with flip-flops, jeans and an old t-shirt on. Not to mention my hair was haphazard in a pony-tail and my face was free of make-up. Who was I trying to impress anyway? \n\nBottom line, I had to get going. The friendly hygienist (who, turns out, is from Michigan) said the cleaning would take about 20 minutes. I let my office know I was running behind; then, I relaxed into the dentist's chair.  Time for the cleaning! \n\nAh, the cleaning... bliss... pleasure... oh, sweet jesus...\n\nThen, ugh. Fluoride. I was told I couldn't eat or drink or rinse for 2 hours. WTF. My stomach rumbled in anger. \n\nAfterwards, I was given the usual bag of goodies. Upon check-out, the woman at the desk had already drafted up the coverage and cost for the procedures the dentist said I needed to get done. Cool. That's helpful, I thought. Right on. But then she wanted to schedule the appointment. \"I need to check my schedule,\" I said. She looked surprised again, as if to say, \"Oh, you work?\" Yes, g'dammit, I work!  After telling her about 2-3 times that I would have to get back to her, she finally let me go. \n\nThat's when I sped out of the parking lot with 15 minutes to run home, change (no time for a shower, grr!) and get my arse to work. I hate-hate-hate running late. I didn't know that a routine cleaning scheduled at 8 a.m. would take 2 hours. \n\nSo, why the 4 stars? I can't knock how thorough this office is. I just wish they would have told me ahead of time, then, the working gal I am, I would not have scheduled an important meeting that morning. I would have saved it for the afternoon, esp. since I had to lead a meeting on an empty stomach with Fluoride breath. Meh.
