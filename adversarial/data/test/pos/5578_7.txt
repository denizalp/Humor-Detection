THE D HOTEL. Originally known as the Fitzgerald. The \"D\" stands for downtown. \n\nI'm from Hawaii, yes Oahu, usually lots of Hawaii locals like to stay at the California downtown, (I don't LOL) but anyway whenever we come to Las Vegas we usually stay at a hotel on the strip because of course that's where the action is! However this time we switched it up and decided to stay downtown. \n\nI booked The D hotel and casino online through Hotwire , for 4 nights our stay at the d cost us a total of $300! \n\nAs soon as we got to the hotel, we self parked. \nFloors 7-10 is for self parking. \nFloor 6 and down is for valet. \nFloor 11 I believe is for enterprise. \nA couple of times we could not find parking, so we parked ourselves in the valet stalls and we just let them know there was no parking and it wasn't a problem. \n\nELEVATORS! It's a little tricky but you'll get the hang of it. Press your floor number on the keypad and it will direct you to your floor! :) \n\nThe room was nice! The heater was my best friend lol! The only downfall was that it was super loud! The thumping from the street show was just crazy loud and I was on the 23rd floor lol. They stop around 1-2am but I was on Hawaii time anyway so I was able to get through it lol. \n\nAnother thing I didn't care for was how the hallways smelt like straight up cigarettes, YUCK. Yes I know people's smoke in casinos I have no problem with that but the 23rd floor with non smoking rooms aren't supposed to smell like smoke. \n\nI loved that they give bath and body products however the shower was weird! There was no door so the water bouncing off your body just got the floor wet it was pointless LOL. \n\nAnyway all in all its a good place to lay your head at night, good casino friendly people. I'd definitely stay here again.
