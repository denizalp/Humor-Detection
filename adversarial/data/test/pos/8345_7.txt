This place is a bit difficult to find but is absolutely delicious, especially for brunch or lunch. Nestled near the Tower Suites in the Wynn sits this Tableau, this great little indoor\/outdoor eatery. This place has some extremely delicious food. I have eaten here a couple of times and the food has been exceptional in taste. Have had the seasonal pancakes, once apple and once peach and they are absolutely delicious. Had also had lunch here where I tried the blue crab split pea soup and the buttermilk chicken sandwich with truffle fries. Mmmmm, absolutely delicious! If you can score a table outside and the weather is nice, this place is an absolute must. Overall, love it. \n\nPros-\nMenu \nFood \nService \nOutside seating \nLocation \nJuice selection\n\nCons-\nPricey\nLots of birds outside, I mean birds that eat everything if you're not looking lol \nLimited selection\nWait for outside
