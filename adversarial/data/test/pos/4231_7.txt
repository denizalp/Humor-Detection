Great $5 happy hour drink specials in a relaxed atmosphere. Well, assuming it isn't a game night. Otherwise, it's a zoo. Worth stopping in when it's not packed though (unless that's your thing) because it's a nice change from the usual spots inside the hotel when you want to grab a beverage and chill out for an hour.
