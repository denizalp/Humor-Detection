I've been going to Aiden, Tony & Annie since Luxy first opened & I've never been to a salon better than theirs [or even equally as good-including out of state] they have SO many options! my gel is as durable as acrylic, it will literally grow off before it cracks or chips away. not only do they all do the best job but they're awesome people with great customer service. I wouldn't recommend anywhere but here!
