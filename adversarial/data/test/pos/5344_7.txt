Went inside on a whim as A and I killed time before our flight.  We were hungry and neither of us had tried this place so we decided to give it a try.  I really enjoyed the simple earthy toned decor with its dim lighting and the blocks of wood that make up the wall.  We started with some appetizers and wine by the bar because dinner had not started yet and were pleasantly intrigued with what else they had to offer.\nWe ordered the oysters and the foie gras sliders with pear compote.  Two of our very favorite foods and both were spectacular! We had to stay for dinner.\nWe were moved to the dining area where we both had the waygu Japanese rib eye med-rare of course.  It was perfectly prepared on their wood burning grill and went perfectly with the truffle mac and cheese (not the best MnC ever but still mouth watering).\nWe were served complimentary duck fat fries with a trio of dips and bags of caramel popcorn at the end.\nCan't recall the wine we had but after stuffing our faces we were the last passengers to board the last flight out to LA scampering into the plane buzzed and satisfied. 15 min later our luggage was loaded and we took off--I'm sure we got some dirty looks for the extra lag but the food coma had set in and we were knocked out.  Thanks A for a fabulous meal.
