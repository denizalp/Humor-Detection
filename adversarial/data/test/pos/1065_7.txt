I've said it once and I'll say it again: If you can deliver hot 'zza to my face without me moving off my ass, you're awesome in my book. \n\nAnd if you take my credit card over the phone, you're even better!\n\nThey're only open late-ish, but they're super-friendly, local and, do I really need to go on? I can't say it's the best pizza I've ever had, but it's a hell-a-va lot better than chain-imo's and greasy hut. Plus you get the warm fuzzies of supporting local business. \n\nI would stay away from the salad. It's huge, don't get me wrong, but it's a whole lot of what you don't want. For one, I don't like 3lbs of cheese on my salad and it's got to be fresh. And trust me, this thing weighs 3lbs. Also, lose the canned mushrooms. Is it really that much more expensive to have fresh ones? I can't handle those rubbery, soggy things on my 'zza.\n\nBeyond that, they'll deliver you fresh, hot, cheesy pizza to your door and fast. Oh, and they have grape and orange pop!
