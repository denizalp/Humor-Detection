My wife and I call this place, \"Conditional Pass\" because at one point that's what was written in the window!  \"I'll wait for you in Conditional Pass while you finish banking at BMO.\"\n\nThe coffee there is OK but if you're in the Junction, go to Starbucks or Crema instead.  You'll thank me later!\n\nWhat really stands out about Conditional Pass is the unlimited amount of unsavory, ne'er do wells it attracts.  Every time I've had to go in there, it's like a scene from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.  \n\nThe last time I was there, a \"special lady\" had the courtesy to go out for a cigarette but stand in front of the open entrance and smoke.  The draft from outside filled the coffee shop with the appetizing, relaxing smell of an ashtray.  It would have smelt better if she lit up at my table.  I was so outraged, my monocle and top hat nearly fell off!  Just kidding, I was only wearing my ascot that day!  \n\nI'm no primadonna but stuff like that is just another ingredient in the shit-pie that is Conditional Pass.\n\nBut, if you are crazy and look like you haven't bathed in a fortnight and also enjoy yelling into a cell phone at your mother, you'll love this place!
