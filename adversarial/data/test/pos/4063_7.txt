Unfortunately the Dobson location of The Good Egg in Tempe is horrible.\n\nUpon walking in, the place was in shambles.\n\nWe were seated, and it took the waitress over 5 minutes to come to our table. When she did, she was rude and it took 3 tries just to get water, ice and coffee.\n\nWhen our food finally arrived, the sausage was burned and the rest of the food looked like it came directly from the dumpster.\n\nThe whole experience was repulsive.\n\nI highly DO NOT recommend going to The Good Egg on 1665 South Dobson in Tempe.
