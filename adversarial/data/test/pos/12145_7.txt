This was my second time having Shake Shack. The first was in NYC three years ago and I still remember how good it was. So this was my place to hit up in Vegas this time, since the last two trip we came up short. I might have to give Shake Shack a slight edge over IN & Out burgers due to the fact that their burgers patties are more juicy and well season then IN &Out and plus they serve \"BEER\".\n\nWhat was ordered:\nShack Stack Burger: Cheeseburger w\/Shroom Burger lettuce and tomato and Shacksauce. Man what a great combination. The patty was perfectly cook and season and the portobello was battered and fried to perfection. For $9 yes it pretty pricey , but it's good. \n\nShack Burger: Cheeseburger w \/ Lettuce and Tomato and Shacksauce. Delicious! \n\nFries: This was ok. IN&OUT fries are still better and made fresh.\n\nYeah I'm definitely a fan of Shake Shack and can't wait until they open up one down here in southern California soon.
