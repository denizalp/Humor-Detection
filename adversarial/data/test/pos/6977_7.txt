It's is absolutely depressing to go to this casino.  The entire establishment has a tired, desperate vibe.  The music is just a little too cheery, a little too loud.  The smoke filled floors (is the air filtration system as ancient as the rest of the casino equipment here?) are littered with shrill children running frantically about while their distracted parents are mindlessly playing their own games.\n\nI don't like children, and I don't think they mix well with gambling.  Certainly not here at this derelict circus.
