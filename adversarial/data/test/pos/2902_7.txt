My wife and I stopped into Amy's last night for a birthday dessert right before they closed.  Samy welcomed us in and went the extra effort to even add a birthday candle to the chocolate mousse cake.  The dessert was amazing!!  We loved it!  Samy and the staff were incredibly friendly.  All in all a great ending to my birthday.  We would definitely go back.
