Tsp. Baking Co is a nice addition to our neighborhood and opened by Kari, former co-owner of Retro Bakery. Serving mini cupcakes, cookies from scratch, ice cream sandwiches using Lappert's ice cream, fairy and cinnamon rolls as well mini cream pies, this bakery makes for one sweet stop that's well worth it. \n\nMini Cupcakes ($2 each or $20 a dozen) - I've tried a good variety of the mini cupcake flavors in the case and some I've really liked while other flavor combos didn't work for me. Firstly, these mini bites are just that, a bite. $2 is too expensive for just a bite. I'll treat myself to 2-4 minis every now and then because there are a few standout flavors I really do like, but I do cake decorating as a hobby and know that quality ingredients can still be used with a price tag that's better on the wallet than $2 a bite. One fun thing is their \"mystery flavor\" that changes often. If you can guess what the mystery mini cupcake is, it's yours free! I really like the Beanie mini cupcake that comes topped with an espresso bean. Any of the mini cupcake flavors can be made into a personalized cake with enough notice. \n\nCookies ($2 each or $18 a dozen) - There's a good variety of cookies daily in the case and really the main reason to come here in my opinion. The cookies are good in size, not too thin, not to thick and they aren't greedy when it comes the the amount of chips and or nuts some of them have. The peanut butter cookie is effing delicious! Frosted Cinnamon is popular in my house also, but it's the Mega Chip that has milk chocolate, white chocolate, peanut butter and butterscotch chips in it that we love the most. If you're a fan of Lappert's ice cream you'll be pleased to know it can be found here! They will make ice cream sandwiches with any of the cookies in the case. \n\nFairy and Cinnamon Rolls ($2.50 each or $20 a dozen) - These are made with croissant dough and taste flaky as well delicious! The fairy roll, topped with magic, was good, but the cinnamon roll topped with their scratch made cinnamon frosting is heaven. These sell out by noon most days. \n\nThey now have tables and chairs inside and outside which I like because I've been meeting friends at the Starbucks next door since they have seating outside which is fine, but it's nice to know we can sit at the bakery also now. Inside is clean, the floor awesomely glitters (seriously!), there's a disco ball hanging from the roof and thought was even put into the bathroom. Cool bakery!
