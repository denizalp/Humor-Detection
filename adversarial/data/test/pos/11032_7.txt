Since our little jaunt to San Diego, yakitori has been on our mind.  Seeing the sign for Shuseki for the first time, the menu fit right into what we were looking for.  Their menu offers along the similar lines of other izakayas and yakitori-type places.\n\nWe tried a little of everything: (All their skewered stuff comes in an order of one.)\n\n* Takowasabi ($3.99) \"raw octopus in wasabi dressing\" - A slimy texture mixed in with the heat from the wasabi.  It was an interesting dish, although I can understand why others may not enjoy it.  Eaten in moderation with other food is necessary.\n\n* Torihatsu ($1.00) \"chicken hearts\" - I like the taste of crunchy-like texture of chicken hearts done yakitori-style.  Plus, it had a nice taste to it with a fresh squeeze of lemon and salt.\n\n* Gyutan ($2.50) \"beef tongue\" - Again, pretty tasty stuff.  Speckled with sesame seeds too.\n\n* Sunagimo ($1.00) \"chicken gizzard\" - I like the texture of chicken gizzard as well, although the Big F wasn't as impressed.  It reminded him more like liver this time, so he passed after the first piece.\n\n* Tontoro ($1.50) \"pork\" - Pork on skewers are just good, period.  When the fat hits the grill, it's just  brings out the flavors that only pork can provide.\n\n* Kurobuta Sausage ($1.50) - I was afraid this was going to taste like a hot dog, but it actually had a lot more flavor than a hot dog.  It was pretty good.\n\n* Yakitori Chicken ($1.50) - Nothing special about this, tasted like chicken with teriyaki sauce.  It was probably they least enjoyed out of all we ate.\n\n* Buta Kakuni ($4.99) \"stewed pork belly\" - Fatty chunks of pork belly stewed in a soy sauce concoction along with a hard-boiled egg.  You should probably order some white rice with this dish 'cuz of the strong taste.  (The Big F said my version at home was a lot better.)\n\n* Sashimi Salad ($7.99) - Their sashimi salad was a combo of raw seafood that included kani, ebi, maguro, tako, masago, seared albacore and saba on a bed of field greens, cucumbers and daikon.  The sauce they used was pretty good, although I could always do without the imitation crab meat.  There might have been some other fish in there as well.\n\nThey have a bunch of other dishes that range from your basic sushi rolls to unique dishes (sea snails with kimchee sauce, bang bang chicken, simmered guts in miso) and ramen bowls (which we noticed other diners gorging on).  They have a lot of seating room, and a few tables in the back for sitting on pillows.\n\nLike other yelpers said, it's not a bad alternative to Ichiza.  They even sell Honey Toast for $6.50!  We definitely would like to go back and order a few other things off their menu.\n\n(Pics posted!)
