I came across this gem while searching coffee during a short family visit and decided I should check it out. I tend to plan my non-vacation trips around food outings and this was no different - eating is always a great way to unplug and connect with others! Turns out Rooster Boy is especially perfect for this activity, so when I did a quick turnaround trip the following weekend, we naturally put another visit at the top of our to-do list!\n\nFirst off, if you prefer sprawling dining rooms, oversized buffet portions, ultra sweet or salty short-order fare, tall booths, bottomless mimosas and bloody Marys, and\/or keeping to yourself and your \"squad\", this is *not* for you and you should just keep scrolling through other breakfast and brunch spots. \n\nIf you're still with me here, then here's what you *can* expect:\n\nChef Sonia runs a tight well-oiled ship in a well organized kitchen that's significantly smaller than what you'd find in most standard suburban McMansions, with an adorable team of hard-working, warm, friendly staff. She's like a mom - you can tell she loves her restaurant, her staff and customers with a passion, but has no qualms about speaking up and being direct when she wants something done a certain way. She's not going to sugar coat anything but those beautiful Dutch oven pancakes and almond croissants... If you like the kind of restaurateur who asks \"how high?\" when you demand they jump, keep packing -- she has a vision, so trust her and she won't leave you hanging or disappointed. She's the kind of badass woman I prefer to keep in my company. \n\nButter. Cream. Organic Eggs. Fresh produce. Beautiful presentation. Real food made to order. Someone mentioned her food is all \"healthy\" in their review, which compared to highly processed premade foods, and pork based items, no gluten free, Paleo or vegan offerings many breakfast joints offer, I suppose it is. Unless your diet consists of strictly meat and absolutely nothing else, you'll find something tasty to meet your needs. From a strictly caloric and flavor standpoint, this is certainly no \"rabbit food\" - haha! \n\nThe setting is magical, albeit tiny. The interior offers 5 seats at the counter overlooking the kitchen where you can watch the culinary magic unfold. It's a front row seat to a gourmet cooking show, interacting with the chef and her talented staff, and then you actually get to eat what they make. There is also a community table that seats about eight, whether it's one big group or several smaller parties co-mingling European style. There is plenty of outdoor seating on their dog-friendly patio as well, along with heaters for cool weather and shade for warmer days. We sat at the counter both visits and it was like a dinner party, chatting with the kitchen team, as well as connecting with the other patrons enjoying the show. \n\nNow, more about the food... \n\nThat Dutch oven pancake is a delicious soufflé made to order, topped with perfectly paired accoutrements such as the crème fraiche and fresh berries on ours. She intends to rotate the offerings with seasonal fruit toppings, so be on the lookout for pear and cranberry, as well as other ever changing delights... It's not exceedingly sweet, which is what I love about it. The flavor is dependent upon the rich, yet light butter and eggs, perfectly balanced with those berries and crème fraiche. \n\nThe Sunshine. Basic vegetarian, grain free breakfast with two perfectly cooked eggs, avocado, butternut squash and a mile pepper sauce as a garnish. We had a slice of whole grain baguette with fresh butter to accompany ours.\n\nFrittata. The special of the day when we went was a bacon onion frittata served with a salad. The flavor of the bacon and toasted opinions perfectly complimented the baked egg. We particularly loved watching it come out of the oven right in front of us and rest before being dished up for us!\n\nShakshouka. Perfectly poached eggs accompanying a delightfully spicy sauce of tomatoes, onions, peppers and cumin (we watched them make the sauce from scratch) and a fresh pita .\n\nThe Frenchy. Two eggs baked in the centers of thick slices of brioche, topped with fresh arugula and truffle oil; a thicker, more indulgent and sophisticated version of a \"toad in a hole\".\n\nPastries. Pain au chocolate. Almond croissants. Chocolate chip cookies. Bread pudding. Scones. Baked fruit almond tartlets. How does one decide?? Try all of them over a number of visits and take a few home for later, of course!\n\nGranola. She has her own line of gourmet granolas, including indulgent varieties with chocolate, coconut and dried fruit, a grain free option and a mix with a healthier glycemic index. You can have it there, or you can take a package home with you (we took home a package of the \"rich\" granola)!\n\nThis is seriously the kind of place that would cause me to never cook breakfast on the weekend again if I lived in close proximity... Suffice it to say I'll be back anytime I'm in Vegas...
