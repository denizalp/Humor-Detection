This is one of the newest restaurants in desert shores. The location offers you a great and romantic view of the lake. The lighting and atmosphere are so pleasant it makes you forget we live in the dessert. Chef blandino cooks amazing food. Every dish we ordered was very tasty and well cooked. For our appetizer we ordered the scallops. For $18 dollars we got 2 scallops which were perfectly cooked. This dish came with an apple sauce and a piece of a braised Oxtail. For our main entree we ordered the salmon and the sablefish. I was very satisfied with both dishes but my favorite was the sablefish. The fish was crusty on the outside and very fresh and tender on the inside. The food was great but the service was even better. Our server was very attentive and provided us with a lot of information. The only bad side of this restaurant is that the portion sizes tend to be a bit small, but the quality of the food is evident.
