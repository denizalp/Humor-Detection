Most ridiculous happy hour ever! $3 shots of Jameson, Patron and Jager?! $2 drafts of 10+ different beers... 1\/2 off sushi.... need I say more? Oh yea, this ridiculously amazing happy hour is ALL DAY  Friday, Saturday and Sunday.\n\nThe sushi wasn't the best I've ever had, but considering how cheap everything is, it made it taste a lot better. \n\nCan't wait to return with some friends and take full advantage of this happy hour. We will definitely be taking a cab home!
