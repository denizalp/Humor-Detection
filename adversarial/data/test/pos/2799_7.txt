I needed some work done on my work car, and I was told to go to Chapman Ford. Initially there was some confusion, but once service advisor Tina got involved, red tape started disappearing. Tina got all the stuff ordered and handled, and in now time at all the repair was made and I was on my way. I really appreciated how down to earth and helpful she, and the other Chapman Ford people were. Their great service is the exact opposite of what we often hear about dealerships. Well done.
