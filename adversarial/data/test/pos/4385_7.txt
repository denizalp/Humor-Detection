Love Arirang, but really wish it was a bit bigger and better organized(and cleaner).\n\nMy fvorite part about Arirang is that it is the only grocery store in Calgary where I can find different kinds of yam noodles! And if you do not like making kimchi at home, Arirang has the closest to homemade kimchi perfection you can find in the city.\n\nTheir ramyun selection is massive and they also have a huge selection of side dishes, sticky rice cakes, and some warm sweet potatoes.\n\nThey also have a good selection of Japanese cooking staples and sushi ingredients if you are looking for things other than Korean grocery items. Also, they have a small section for household\/kitchen items at the far right hand side of the store past the noodles.\n\nI would have given them 5 stars if the store wasn't as cluttered and disorganized. There are some boxes on the floor and it gets pretty hard to navigate in the store when it gets busy. But other than that I love everything about Arirang and definitely recommend it!
