I had this restaurant bookmarked for over two months. I finally got some folks to go with me. Everything was horrible. I ordered my steak medium rare but it came out medium well. The manager came out to argue with me to say it was exactly how I ordered it when it clearly was not. He had me walk with him over into the dining room to show me what it looked like under different lighting. As though that would change the temperature, texture, and overall taste of my steak.  He then ordered me a replacement which came back extremely under cooked and cold. I advised the waitress that I expected her to take everything off of the menu. I guess they didn't take the onion rings off because I had a couple. Fine. Whatever. I will never go back to this nightmare horrific restaurant ever again. I have called the general manager Mark. I will advise you what I hear.  The photo I am attaching is from the replacement that he tried to bring back to me that was completely covered with uncooked fat and cold.
