I have been coming here for months and am so impressed with the consistent service and results.\n I bring in anywhere from 5-10 garments at a time, including slacks, silk blouses, and dresses. The rate is a flat  $2.25 per garment, so it is incredibly affordable. Garments are always ready next day after 5. My clothes look beautifully pressed and clean. \n\nNo frills no gimmicks here. Even the storefront signage says  $2.25 cleaners . \n\nGreat value, I don't go anywhere else!
