Can you believe it? This weekend was the first time I have ever been to L'Atelier. I go to Vegas several times a year, eat everywhere and have never really thought about coming to Atelier until now. Now that being said the food was excellent, the wine pours generous, the sommelier was gracious but damn it's expensive for what it is!\n\nWe shared one of the tasting menus and they allowed us to pick a couple of other courses off the al carte menu, which was very cool of them. But, because of the seating you almost don't get that attention you normally get from a fine dining experience. I guess I want to be pamped and fussed over and here you don't get that feeling. \n\nMy highlights: A-m-a-z-i-n-g BREAD! I love french bread, crewy and crispy with the salty butter. MMMMMMM! \n\nLES LANGOUSTINES- langoustines cooked in their shells with green curry and coconut milk -- sweet and lush, I only wish langoustines were bigger! LOL!\n\nLA CEBETTE -White onion tart with smoked bacon, quail egg \"mirror\" and green asparagus -- my absolute favorite dish of the evening, it was that feeling of home, breakfast on a whole another level. So good, utlimate comfort food. \n\nAnd my last favorite: LA FRAISE - Caramel panna cotta topped with fresh strawberries and yogurt foam -- I don't even really enjoy desserts however, this one hit the spot. I love sweet and savory at the same time. \n\nI thought I would love the Foie gras stuffed quail with mashed potatoes being a signtuare dish and all, but it was just okay. Maybe foie gras shouldnt be stuffed in something because it ends up tasting very irony. He he. (get it?) lol. \n\nThe dinner was lovely but if you ask me I have other favorite restaurants in Vegas for a cheaper price.  Sorry Joel, don't hate me. ;)
