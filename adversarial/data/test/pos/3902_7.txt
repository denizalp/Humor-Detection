We just finished up lunch and we were looking for some dessert.  Stumbled on this cute place that had soft serve! Score!\n\nIce Cream:  The soft serve was pretty good.  Very rich and creamy.  There were little chunks of white stuff in our vanilla cone.  We thought it might be chunks of vanilla? No idea.  It will remain a mystery. \n\nSoft serve (small run you 3.95) can be ordered in a regular cone (no sugar cones available) or cup.  You could order a waffle cone but for some extra mula. Oh, did I mention this place serves organic soft serve?\n\nService:  The lady who helped us was nice.  It was her first day working alone so she seemed very scattered.  \n\nAmbience:  You order your ice cream from the window. You can't enter their shop.  Instead, you enjoy your cone on a few chairs and tables right in front.
