this was more than I expected.  The price was really good (the best around) and it included free continental breakfast and free wireless internet!  You do not get this at the fancy hotels.  The breakfast was OK.  It was an array of fruit, muffins, hot and cold cereals, bagels, english muffins, and OJ apple juice and coffee.  You needed to get there before 9am if you wanted one of the toasted breads or muffins.  But hey, for free, it did the trick!  They also had free coffee all day long available in the lobby as well as a microwave for your use.  \n\nIf I ever need to stay in a motel again, I willdefinitly choose this one.
