They have some Native American, American, Chinese and European art, but unfortunately they devote far too much space to the modern crap.  \n\nI'm sorry, did I say crap, I meant modern \"art\"? A bunch of colors randomly thrown on a canvas is not art.  A bunch of cans or piece of metal welded together to symbolize anger or oppression, is not art.  the arts and crafts I did in kindergarten should not be up on the walls of museums.  Give me a call when you get some real art
