Finally Steak 'N Shake has come to VEGAS! \n\nYou have no idea how much I love this place. I grew up on Steak 'N Shake back home, and after every football game, or school dance everyone would always meet up here. Also they were open 24 hours so we could always grab a delicious milk shakes. \n\nNot only does Steak \"N shake have great Milkshakes- their Frisco Melt is to die for delicious. \n\nOddly enough my favorite thing on their menu, is their fried chicken salad with ranch. \n\nA salad... really..? I know! But it is amazing, instead of using croutons they use deep fried tortilla strips and everything is just yummy! \n\nYou must go here and try anything on their menu, you will not be disappointed! I promise.
