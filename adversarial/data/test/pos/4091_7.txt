Had my suspension repaired and my alignment adjusted here. Pierce (store manager) was super friendly, polite and helpful...despite being SWAMPED with phone calls and walk-ins! I'm serious; I came here twice and both times he was totally drowning in customers, but still kept his cool and stayed friendly and polite. \n\nWhoever is reading this from Firestone corporate.....hire this poor guy some help!!! Don't be so cheap -- I just paid out the ass ($500 for the suspension fix), so I *KNOW* you have the money.
