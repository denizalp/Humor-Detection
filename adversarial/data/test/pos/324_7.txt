Ok. The food is good. Atleast what we had was good. The thing I had a problem with was the waitress. My wife ordered an omlet and she asked for the potatoes on the outside. You would think she insulted this girls first born child with this request. She gave her the worst look ever. And the were on the inside to no ones surprise. Not saying a word, not refilling drinks. I just dont get it. I really think they need a suicide prevention course, she looked depressed. So OK food and bad staff. Depends on what bothers you I suppose. I cant handle bad staff at all and will never go back because of it. \n\nEdit. Forgot to mention the lengthy conversation she thought we should have about her period, and by converdation I mean just tell us about it for 20 minutes.............. so yeah...........
