I went here FOR SCIENCE. Well, it was a research trip for my world religions project on cults. Lemme tell you straight up, this is a CULT. I was welcomed by an overly enthusiastic volunteer named Mario who printed off the results of an online test and  told me I was failing in most areas of my life. While he was explaining the main points of their doctrine I came to the realization that Scientology only makes sense if you're a Scientologist and only the best ones aren't faking it. He then told me I could fix my life if I bought in to a $120 weekend course on Dianetics.  No thanks, I have better things to spend my money on and uh, thanks for the research. This is going to look great in my presentation. Also, can we have Tom Cruise back?
