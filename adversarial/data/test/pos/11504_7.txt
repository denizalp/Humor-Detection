Tonto has nice indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor is especially pretty weather permitting. It's not unusual to find wildlife roaming around here. I've seen bobcats and javelinas on prior visits.\n\nThe food is also really good. The salads are always good. Their appetizers are delicious and portions are large enough to share. \n\nTheir dinner entrees are really good too. Recently had their burger and it came out juicy and flavorful with tons of toppings. \n\nIt could get crowded here during the weekends so I'd recommend making reservations. Parking is decent and there are street parking if the parking lot gets full.
