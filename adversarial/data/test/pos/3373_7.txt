My first true poutine experience! \n\nMy fiance is Canadian and has raved about poutines ever since I met him. The only time we ever had it together was from Pomme Frites in NYC.. and according to him.. that place's version was just plain awful. \n\nWe came here for a \"light\" lunch. My fiance ordered their sherphard's pie poutine, I ordered the nacho supreme poutine, and his brother ordered their Italian poutine. I think each of us managed to finish 1\/3 of the order and was stuffed. I love the crunchy top layer of fries with the guac, sour cream, salsa and bean.. but i just couldn't plow through the soggy fries covered with gravy and cheese. I guess all in all i'm not a big poutine fan (since i hate soggy fries and I really hate cheese.. cheese curds? ew) but the top layer was delicious!\n\nFiance managed to eat more than 1\/3 .. maybe 1\/2.. mashed potato on top of fried potatoes? Carb overload.\n\nWill definitely get the nacho supreme again if i return!
