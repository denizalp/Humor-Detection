The bagels here are as good as they get! They make  bagels the real way, in-house everyday from scratch. The cream cheeses are all made in-house too and are delectable, they have about 10 different types. The lox and lox cream cheese are my personal favorites. The bagels are deliciously moist and chewy with just the right amount of toastiness. They have homemade muffins and cakes, as well as the standard espresso and coffee drinks.\n\nThey also offer half-price bagels to-go during the last hour they're open, between 1-2 PM. The inside is well decorated and the owners are super nice and accommodating. Definitely worth checking out!!
