My girlfriend received such grossly misrepresented services that I feel compelled to write a review. She was also charged an additional $50 for a haircut, but did not receive a haircut. Initially she was pleased on the day of services, yet this treatment that was represented as permanent color dissapeared within 10 days. My girlfriend attempted to contact the owner and the stylist, went back in person and was mistreated with no acceptable action taken to remedy the situation. The owner has been unresponsive and has made no attempt to correct the problem. This is not a place of business that I would recommend, as they are charging a premium price for hair treatments that are temporary and misleading.
