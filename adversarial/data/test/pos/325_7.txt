Yeah, sure, it's only two or three miles from the airport, and it's pretty clean, has some good amenities, but, I was disappointed.\n\nYou have to kinda drive through a shady area to get here, the walls are extremely thin, the beds are hard as a rock, the air conditioner sounds like a jet plane engine! Not to mention the toilet handle needs three muscle bound grown men to push down the handle! \n\nI also think the breakfast should begin earlier than 6:30, as many of us business travelers are en route for the first flight out. \n\nThe good news? The front desk ladies were so charming and helpful and the hotel offers an airport shuttle every 30 minutes, every hour, on the hour.\n\nOverall, expensive for what you get. Not impressed.
