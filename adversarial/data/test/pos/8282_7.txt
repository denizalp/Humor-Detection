Had a lovely girl's night out at Sel. The interior is modern with a white theme to echo the restaurant's name which is \"salt\" in French. The menu changes every few weeks (I think every 2 weeks the server said), so eating here will typically be a new experience each time you go.\n\nThey offer a 4 course prix fixe meal for $70 as well as a la carte items. If you go with the prix fixe you will have a choice of your appetizer and main entree while the soup and salad will be only one choice. I went with the prix fixe, choosing the lobster stuffed squash blossom and halibut with green curry cassoulet. The soup was a yellow tomato gazpacho and the salad was a gravlax vinaigrette salad with mixed greens.\n\nEach course was thoughtfully prepared, with a beautiful presentation. Seasoning was perfect, and the combination of textures and flavors of each dish was excellent. My favorite of the prix fixe menu was the lobster stuffed squash blossom. The delicate taste of the squash blossom went well with the lobster meat, and the breaded crispy outer layer of the blossom was perfect. I also have to say this is the best gazpacho I've had by far. It was a smooth, refreshing cold soup and the sweet peach gratinee in the center provided a great contrast with the more acidic taste of the tomatoes. The main entree was lovely, with a tender, perfectly cooked halibut and exotic tasting \"cassoulet\" with the addition of green curry.\n\nService was excellent. Plates were taken away and water was refilled as needed. Our server was friendly and warm. \n\nEven the water here is quite delicious, as it is steeped with cucumber and mint. I'll have to try this at home!\n\nDessert was a heavenly strawberry shortcake made with marizpan, a quenelle of vanilla bean gelato, caramel drizzle and balsamic vinegar. \n\nThe four course meal was just right for me. I'm glad I shared the dessert because I don't think I'd be able to finish the whole thing if I hadn't.\n\nThe only thing that bothered me was when the filet mignon dishes came out for the people at our table, each piece was differently sized. My friend sitting across from me got a significantly smaller piece of filet compared to her neighbor. If we are paying $70 for our meal you bet each dish needs to be consistent and have the same amount of food.\n\nOverall 4.5\/5.
