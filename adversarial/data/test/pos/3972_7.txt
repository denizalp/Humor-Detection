This is my go-to mall because of its convenience and the fact that it has been around since I was a 5th grader with no money.\n\nThe stores in this typically stay the same, but I will say that I think there have been many changes just in the past few years. The most notable would be the addition of the super large Forever 21 and the constant changes in the food court. There is no longer a boba vendor or the Great Philly Cheese Steak. There is now a froyo place downstairs near JCPenney's though.\n\nThe one and only bad incident that I've ever experienced here was when I went this past Saturday (06\/26\/10). I accidentally left my Victoria Secret and Bath & Body bags in the dressing room for 5 minutes and when I came back to retrieve them, they were gone! Thieves!!! It was partly my fault, but I wish they would have dropped it off at the counter. They knew it wasn't theirs! I became thoroughly disgusted with humanity at that point. But, as you can see, I am partly over it now and making progress.... Kinda.\n\nNonetheless, this is a great mall. It is a 2-story mall with a variety of stores. One store, though, makes me laugh just by the title. It's called Swagga. If any of you guys happen to go to Meadows and into that store, let me know how it is.
