The best way I can describe this Department Store is that it is a Discounted Version of TJ Maxx & Reminiscent of a Smaller Fallas Paredes Department Store.\n\nThey carry anything from Luggage, Handbags, Perfumes, Clothing for the Entire Family, a few Toys, and Electronics such as Cellphone Wire Chargers\/Adapters, and Household Goods for your Home.\n\n*You can Easily Find Things you Need by the Hanging Signs on the Ceiling. Fitting Rooms are Available on the Right Side of the Store. No Restrooms, lol.
