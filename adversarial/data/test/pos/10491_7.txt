It took me a bit for me to figure out that the Urban(E!) Eatery thing at the Eaton Centre is downstairs, I kept going back to where the old food court in my previous visits and wonder when the heck were they going to bring back the restaurants?  \nI'm hip like that.\n\nHow many of our friends on facebook check in to Jugo Juice?  Be honest, I had to investigate.\nSix bucks for OJ, investigation concluded.  Holy crap.  They size their drinks by OZs, so that you may confuse a medium cup for a large by getting the greater in the two options made available by the clever marketing team behind this place.  Juice man, it's expensive.\n\nBehind the counter was a teenager, another teenager, another and another.  So the service was as high-brow as your local neighbourhood lemon-stand.  Except, at the lemon stand I would feel charitable contributing to some little girl's cause to buy something cute like a bicycle, whereas here with the teenagers I just felt old.   \nI think my OJ took five oranges?  \n\nI paid for the largest size, which was equivalent to a large Timmy's cup (not so big when you compare OJ to coffee), sat down by the canteen area, and began eating my food.  I took one sip of my sweet, freshly squeezed, six dollar orange juice..\nIT WAS WARM!!!!!!!!!!\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DAMN TEENAGERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
