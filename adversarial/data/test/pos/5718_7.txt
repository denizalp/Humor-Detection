I've gotten my eye brows threaded, upper lip waxed, and nails done on numerous occasions, however it only takes one inexperienced threader to make so you'd never return.\n\nBack when I went - Nails are neatly done and they have a variety of colours and types to choose from. Waxing is powdered first, temperature is checked, wax paper is used as needed (they don't skimp like other places) and a nice lotion is put on afterwards to relieve the skin. Lastly, the threading experience has been pretty standard. It's quick, and you are out of there with nicely shaped brows. The cost is pretty much the same as other places downtown so you know you're not getting ripped off in any way. However...\n\nWhy I don't go anymore -  Having your brows threaded can be a painful experience but none more so than when the threader rips a piece of your skin straight off. It was enough to leave a throbbing red mark at the end of the session, which then developed into a scab, and is now a sensitive spot for me when going for any future threading sessions.\n\nThis experience may have been outlier for the numerous regulars that attend to this location, however it is one that has lost them one customer, and I hope none will have this experience in the future.
