More like 3.5 Stars, and yes I'm a Beatles fan. I was around to see them perform on the Ed Sullivan Show with my parents and 3 brothers. You could have called us \"The Black Beatles\" back in the 1960s. But I don't know, this was my second Cirque du Soleil show and I guess after all the hype through the years, I thought they were more superb with the acrobatic presentations then I've seen. \n\nThe music selections were no problem for me, since I'm quite familiar with their catalog. But like one previous reviewer stated, too much clowning and antics, after what were quite serious moments. Like their Michael Jackson show though, which I was thoroughly disappointed with, the music is the best part of the performance. And I get it with the odd costumes; think Yellow Submarine, Sgt. Pepper, Magical Mystery Tour. But still somewhat of a let down. I probably won't need to see another Cirque du Soleil show anytime in the near future.
