I can get down with the Smiling Banana Leaf. \n\nThe dining room is cozy,  gorgeous and ornate from the jade green glass table tops to the celestial mural painted on the ceiling. Each table had it's own glass vase filled with vibrant yellow tulips too.This was a truly relishable dining experience. \n\nMy waiter had the face of a Calvin Klein model and I detected a Western European accent, was it Austrian, or German? I dunno but he had it going on! \n\nAny who I had the shrimp tempura , pork dumplings and pineapple curry with shrimp.  The shrimp tempura was cooked too hard and was dark not light. That is the one and only complaint I have for SBL. The shrimp tempura was served with a peanut dipping sauce that was both sweet and tangy and full of peanuts.  The was a very nice touch.  \n\nThai food has me spellbound.  I cannot seem to get enough , I blissfully devoured every spoonful of my pineapple curry with shrimp. \n\nSBL is BYOB so I brought along a four pack of wine coolers.  Day drinking at it's finest.  Is BYOB just a dinner thing,  I am still new to the BYOB game.
