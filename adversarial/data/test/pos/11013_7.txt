My girlfriend and I were sprinting from one side of the Airport to the other in order to make our connecting flight after US Airways did everything in their power to almost make us miss it when one of those golf carts pulled up next to us and asked us if we needed a ride. The driver cracked jokes, told us he accepted gratuities and drove us to our gate. We would have tipped him but all we had were $20 dollar bills and the service wasn't $20 worthy. \n\nThe airport itself was nice, it is clean and a complete contrast to LAX in every aspect. I do hope that I never find myself at this Airport again because after my experience with US Airways I will never be taking another connecting flight in my lifetime and I have no reason to be in Phoenix so chances are this airport will remain a memory. \n\nThe guys who checked our Passports, customs and the TSA moved quickly unlike LAX.
