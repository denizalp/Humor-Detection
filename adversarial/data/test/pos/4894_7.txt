There are two things I really like about Loco Patron:\nFirst, I adore the grilled chicken skewers.  They are the best thing in old town for when I am trying to be healthy but still want to go out for happy hour.  I have ordered them dozens of times and they always taste good.\nSecond, when I am bombed, for some reason I am totally drawn to their nachos.  They are the bestest thing ever when I've had a few too many and I will leave other bars to go to Loco just to nosh on them.\n\nOther than that, the service is generally fine but can be spotty, the crowd is a little too douchey for me some days, but it's all A-OK in my book.  You will likely have a pretty good time there!
