Do not go to this Hermes store.  Let me tell you why.\n\nLet me first inform you about Hermes.  It is different from the LVMH conglomerate which owns Louis Vuitton, Moet & Chandon, etc.  Although those stores take exhaustive measures to ensure quality in their products, Hermes specifically is known for their leather goods (Louis Vuitton was first a luggage\/chest manufacturer).  Hermes has all been about leather goods- from when they were first catering to high-end equestrian hobbyists.\n\nWith that said, yes; their leather goods are unparalleled.  \n\nThe best things in life are free.  The next best things are very, very expensive.  Thus, Hermes.\n\nBut this store in particular is a big no no.  Sales associates should be helpful to whomever.  However, they were not helpful to me at all.  And no, I wasn't in shorts and t-shirt (regardless, they shouldn't judge), and I wore something decently presentable.  They discriminate relentlessly and act like they have no time for you.  This is a horrible, horrible mistake many people make in luxury retail.  Gucci does not do this.  Louis Vuitton does not do this.\n\nI was going to get an Hermes tie for a friend and as I was asking about prints, but the person helping me was just looking away as he was talking.  I'd have to grab his attention if I wanted to ask him something.  There was no one else in the store and he was just waddling around aimlessly around- at least stay nearby so you can make a sale.  But no.\n\nIf you want to go to an Hermes store and be treated right, go to the one at Crystals, at City Center.  I bought from them a year ago and they were very helpful and receiving.\n\nDo not go here.
