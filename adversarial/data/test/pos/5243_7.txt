Was pretty excited to come to this shop after reading (albeit) two great reviews commenting on the European feel....blah blah blah....well call me high maintenance but this place was like a regular grocery store selling regular cheese.  Don't waste your time.  Go to Olympia Cheese!  They are awesome there!  Small, knowledgeable and above all great selection!
