Affordable, clean, relaxing. So many different rooms. Large coed area.  You must be nude in the wet area, no swimwear.  They provide shirt and shorts along with towels.  Slippers, toothbrush, razors upon request. It is a very \"orange is the new black\" kind of look.  Oversized faded clothes... Cheap toothbrush... Showering beside all the other girls.  Fun!  The experience makes me feel like I am in the Korean tv dramas.   They sell food as well although I did not try it. It was really nice to get my girlfriends together to chit chat and relax.
