Here\n   Fishy         Fishy Fishy.\n        Caz doesn't look like much.\n         But the proof is in the batter.\n    Crispy, crunchy and moist.\nBit oily         Nice service.\n\nDoes that look like a fish?  That's my attempt  @Wayne C\n\nHonestly though, Caz has a variety of interesting things from healthier options of broiled citrus halibut to the guilty indulgent battered fish and fries.  Portions are big... a bit oily but totally satisfying for that crunchy goodness.  It's a touch on the expensive size but you can feed 2 small people with the fish!
