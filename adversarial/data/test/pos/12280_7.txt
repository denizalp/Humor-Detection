After checking this place out twice I feel like I have tested the waters enough to write a review. Everyone seems to be raving about this place and about how great it is. I don't get it.\n\nYes the food is cheap and the portions are huge but it's not really that great. Now on both visits I have ordered two different types of Soon Tofu. Both times I have been very disappointed at the lack of meat in the dish. Where's the pork? Oh there it is, just let me pull out my monocle so I can see that one tiny piece that I got in my bowl.\n\nThis may be the place for pork bone soup, but it certainly isn't the place for Soon Tofu. Go a couple doors down to Buk Chang, you'll be glad you did.
