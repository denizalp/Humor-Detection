Looking here FIRST in the optical department from now on when I want to purchase prescription glasses.\n\nWHY?\nIt a hella lot cheaper especially the for rX lenses that's why.\n\nIn my case, I paid $150 LESS for Progressive HD lens.\n\nTreatments like AR are included in package unlike LensCrafters they charge additional $ for other treatments for your glasses.\n\nThey now accept most vision care plans.  So your out of pocket expense here is not much at all, compared to LC I paid hell lot more! \n\nThey have designer frames for pretty affordable prices too. The Tiffany frames here average $100 less than LC. The selection is limited but they do have some of the best traditional or trendy frames represented. My fave were the Valentino ones.

They were pretty attentive  and didnt feel rushed despite how busy they were. My wait time was about 20 minutes I think, but didnt feel that long since I made use of that time to try on glasses on my own,\n\nThe optical department is right in front, as you walk in through front entrance. Make sure you you grab a ticket first by cash register and wait for your number to be called.  Don't forget to bring your medical info  to see if you are covered...but even without insurance, the frames and lens will still be even cheaper than what you would pay over at LC with insurance! Crazy!\n\nBring your patience though cause you'll have to to put up with the aggressive drivers in parking lot and grouchy customers. Lovely personality traits right there.
