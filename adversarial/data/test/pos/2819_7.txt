If you're looking to eat plain curry, this is the place the go. \nThe person taking our order was very nice, however it seemed that she didn't know much about japanese curry. \nThe pictures on the menu are spot on, if you want to call that a good thing. The food comes out on a huge plate with a mound of rice and the curry sauce with whatever you ordered on it (i.e. tonkatsu, chicken pieces, etc\/). It's like the curry is, to put it simply, a curry block you can buy at the store melted into water. That's all it is, nothing really authentic about it. \nI would never go back. I would rather waste 10$ by going to Ihop across the street.
