Any new restaurant is going to have challenges but Four Silos will have to go a mile to get me back in their doors. From a long wait to order to another long wait to get food this place is obviously understaffed. Our food orders all arrived minutes apart from each other and we had to go to the bar to get our drinks. The food is decent but nothing to write home about. \n\nI suggest that the owners go to a more established place, like the Coffee House, to see how to provide a great experience for your customers. Otherwise, your days are numbered.
