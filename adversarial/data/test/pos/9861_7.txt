Noticed that two of my Yelp friends, JD and Jay had been to this cigar bar in Talking Stick Resort and Casino, so we stopped by for a nightcap. We were very pleased with the dark ambiance and the outdoor patio complete with a firepit. \n\nAsked the bartender for a list of single malts and was impressed, especially since we had come from dinner where the answer to \"what single malts do you offer?\" was \"Dewars!\" Ugh. If memory serves, I went with a Macallan 15 that evening. Service from the barkeep was friendly, and we sipped our drinks on a comfy couch. \n\nWe've already returned, and I expect to often when in the hotel. Definitely a low key, cool spot to chill.
