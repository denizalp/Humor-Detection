This nail salon deserves 5 stars & beyond. I don't think I will be looking for another place for a mani\/pedi ever again. This is it!! The environment, staff, service & price is phenomenal!! \n\nFirstly a huge thank you to Janna for organizing the UYE (& cupckaes!)!! And Roma for introducing us to Nail Sense.\n\nI'm taking my sweet time writing this review as I can't stop admiring my hands (i keep smelling my hands too!)\/feet. I had such a wonderful time today & cannot wait to come back again. My hands & feet have never looked this amazing before. It's as though they don't belong to me. This is too good to be true!!!!! :) \n\nBefore the mani pedi began, we had one hurdle to go through... picking out colour(s) from their huge selection !! Trust me when I say you might be hanging by the wall for a few mins trying to narrow down your choices. I've never been so indecisive before. \n\nThuy did my pedi & she took such extreme care.. smoothing out everything & making sure they were perfect. I love how we got a calf\/foot massage & wish it was never ending. Each of us got sanitized nail kits that were all packaged & opened on the spot for the pedi. You would never have to worry about sanitation here. It is super clean ! Also, sit back and relax while u play w\/ the massage chair.\n\nMy manicure was done by Kim. I had gel nails done about 3 weeks ago & she was able to take off 90% of the gel without using the nail drill machine (gawd I wish I knew what the terminology was). Basically your nails would be super brittle if the drill was used to take off the gel. I thought the process would be a little uncomfortable but Kim was so exceptional you can't feel a thing. Kim was also very attentive & professional. Also enjoyed my hand\/forearm massage!! :)\n\nThe owner Tien is also very nice & accomodating..offering us Perrier & yummy pastries. We were really in bliss for two hours or so (who cares about the time when ur there?) watching Pretty Woman on the big screen TV. Gosh..I want to pamper myself here every weekend...next time I want to try the 20 min head\/shoulder massage & mani\/pedi again! \n\nParking - try the adjacent residental streets. It's FREE :)
