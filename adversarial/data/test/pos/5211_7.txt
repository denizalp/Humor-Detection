Hi Starbucks,\n\nLook ... I get that you want to be super nice and super cheery and super gag-me-with-a-goddamn-spoon-sunshiney.\n\nBut here's the deal: when I roll up to your drive-thru window, I want things to happen quickly and efficiently.\n\nI don't care what your barista's name is. I don't care if she thinks it's a wonderful morning. \n\nI'm not there to engage in a conversation with her and respond to her 'how is your super awesome day going?'\n\nI'm there to get a coffee. Quickly. Efficiently.\n\nOtherwise, I would have gone inside, had a chat with whomever was swiping my card through the till and cozied up in the chair next to the fake fire. \n\nYour location is convenient for me, but goddamn if it doesn't annoy me to no end that drive-thrus were built for speed and your morning barista wants to make sure it is anything but.
