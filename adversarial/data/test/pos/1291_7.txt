Pepper pitter-patters to patios periodically for play. Say that five times fast, and then consider frequenting this brick home turned corner al fresco haven. It's near your cool loft office and\/or your pal's overpriced condo. \n\nThe Caesar comes with a pickled bean and a hot pepper making this bloody babe pickle-y and naturally hotter. It's nice. They have a massive tap list, too, if beer is your thing. I paired my cocktail with their version of a Caprese that I shared with a bud. It was kind of sweet and they used cherry tomatoes. Honestly, it wasn't my fave, but I can appreciate that it's a decent salad. \n\nI enjoy their french onion soup in the winter, but this place is really all about their patios, so try to check it out in the warmer months.
