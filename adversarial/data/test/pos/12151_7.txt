Trattoria Nakamura-Ya has been on my Yelp radar for a while now, but it didn't top my list of must-eat places mostly because I've never had uni much less squid ink.  When the bestie invited me to dine there during their 3rd anniversary, the two most popular dishes of Linguini Uni Tomato Cream and the Spaghetti \"Ikasumi\" Squid Ink were half-off the normal price ($26.95 and $19.95, respectively).  Trusting that girlfriend wouldn't steer me wrong, I figured this would be an excellent time to finally try these exotic (to me) dishes.  Arriving around 6:00pm on a Wednesday, there was a line at the door as expected.  Checking in with the hostess, you can leave your phone number and get a call when your table is ready.  We waited 45 minutes for a table to open up.  Once seated, we were waited on quickly.  We ordered both the uni and squid ink pastas, more than enough for the two of us to share.  The Linguini Uni arrived at the table first and it was definitely delicious; I really loved the tomato cream sauce.  I couldn't really distinguish the taste of the uni, however, so I will have to try uni in another dish some other time.  The squid ink spaghetti came next and I was already getting full from the uni dish.  Other than its black color, this pasta is not as scary as it looked (to me).  If you tasted it blindfolded, you would not expect it to be squid ink or black; it tasted a bit garlicky and was very flavorful.  But, the uni was my favorite of the two and I would have it again.  Japanese and Italian fusion is an interesting concept and I look forward to another visit to try the Miso Carbonara and to have more of the uni.
