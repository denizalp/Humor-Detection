I purchased a CZ 75 Compact SDP online.  Then it was received it had two dot sights rather than the three dot sights described on the CZ website.  The front sight is barely visible in a dark room or outdoors at night.  The trigger which was suppose to be part of the custom package was gritty.  I contacted CZ immediately and was told that I'd have to talk to The Custom Shop who did the work.  It took several phone calls and emails but was finally contacted by Stuart.  Stuart told me that I'd need to send the gun to them and there would be a cost for replacing the sights.  Factoring time lost, cost of shipping I'd been better off to have a local shop do the work.  Also, when you pay an extra $700 for a gun you'd expect that they would do better work and attempt to take care of their customers with a little more concern.  At this point my advice is to buy the CZ 75 Compact and have the sights and trigger work done by a local reputable gun smith.
