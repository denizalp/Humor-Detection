Just watched the new Axl Rose interview on That Metal Show on VH1 and traveled back in time to one of the greatest nights of my life....\n\nSeptember 16, 2006. 11:15PM.  The Joint at The Hard Rock in Vegas.  A crowd of only 2,000. Waiting for Guns N' Roses to take the stage. My first GNR concert, ever.\n\nRobin Finck finally walked onto the stage and rocked the eagerly waiting crowd with the opening riff of \"Welcome to the Jungle.\" For what seemed to span an eternity, Robin teased the crowd with that riff. And just when our fragile little hearts couldn't take it anymore...the messiah himself, Mr. Axl Rose, belted out \"YOU KNOW WHERE THE F#%K YOU ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRE??!\"...and the crowd....went....absolutely...ape...you know what!! Including yours truly!\n\nThe following night, I came back to the same venue. Same band. Same set list. Rocked it out again for another 2.5 hours and it was like experiencing it for the first time.\n\nMost memorable venue I've ever been to not just for its small size and good acoustics, but for making my dreams come true...\n\n...Paradise City it became.
