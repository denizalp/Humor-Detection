Let me start by saying I anticipating the opening of this restaurant and wanted to fall madly in love with it. Town Square needed a delicious Cantina and Tequila Bar and sadly.....this place gets two thumbs way down from moi. The only reason Lolita's is getting one star is for the cocktails. Other than that I have nothing positive to say about this place! Let me break it down for you.\n\nDecor\/Atmosphere: Blah. The furniture and decorations appear very cheap and lacking style. Almost as if it was thrown together at the last minute. The interior designer should be fired. They also can't seem to get the lighting down either. The music was too loud for my taste, too. \n\nFood: Double blah. The salsa will usually set the mood for the rest of the meal and this left alot to be desired. Bland and too much of a sweet tomatoe taste. Secondly we had the mini quesadillas which tasted as if they were straight out of the freezer section at the grocery store and lacking depth in flavor. Lastly for my entree I chose the Carne Asada Plate which was just aweful. The meat was tough and chewy and had tons of grizzle. The black beans were bland as hell. Do you even think I felt like wasting another dime on dessert? No way, Jose. \n\nService: Triple Blah!!! All I expect from servers is to keep my glass full, table semi-clean, and bring to the table what I ordered. Simple? For starters the drink I ordered was a Kettle-GingerAle and I was delivered a Jack and Coke. My guest also was delivered the wrong beverage. Then when it came to the food it took seconds for our appetizer which only confirms it was frozen and it felt like five years to get my beef jerky Carne Asada dish. The whole time the waitress had this blank look on her face as if she was lost. \n\nNeedless to say I will not be back anytime soon and will not let any of my friends spend a dime or waste a minute of their life in this generic place.....Sorry Lolitas!
