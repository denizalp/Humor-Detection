The crown cheese with real fruit is so good. Highly recommend. You would want to drink all the cheese first. I got it with mango and you can see them making your drink with real mango in front of you. \n\nThey started mopping the floor in the middle of the day with mop water that smelled absolutely disgusting?!?
