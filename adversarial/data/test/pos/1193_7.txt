Cheap and easy just like I like my ho...tels\n\nI love this freaking place. WHY? \n\nCheap Seriously Cheap\n\nLocation smack dab in the middle for the most part\n\nCarnival Court. Great drinks great entertainment (sad to see it go)\n\nThe rooms were comfortable, I think. The only bad part to me was the tub filling up as I showered. I hate that.
