I went to Rick's last week during my vacation.  I'm a fan so i had to go by and see what was there.  Since, they moved i knew in advance the surroundings would be new.  I enjoyed seeing the items people didn't pickup and seeing a few familiar faces at the shop.  I appreciated Kelly answering a boring fan question, that I'm sure she has answered it a 1000 times before.  I was disappointed I didn't meet Rick, but I'm sure he had something better to do than to wait for my visit.  I bought a t shirt and would definitely encourage anyone to visit with the right expectations.
