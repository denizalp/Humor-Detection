Some may say that this location is no match for the original. I could agree in some sense. You definitely cannot beat the beer prices over at the original. Yet the new location does have some attributes that are more favorable than the original. One; They have beers on draft. Two; They have liquor. Three: Lines are quick. \n\nMy list is going to make it seem like I'm an alcoholic. That is only half true. The real reason why I go to Taco Y Taco is for their food. The al pastor is one of my favorites. They have that charred crisp on the outside that stands up to the slathering of everything. Ask for the grilled pineapple, too. It just makes the meal better. I have tried almost every single taco and I cannot see anything to complain about. The lengua, cabeza, and carnitas are all delicious. If they do not put on everything that you wanted, do not fret, their salsa bar is unreal, too. I'm used to the cold bar being filled with a few varying degrees of spice, radishes, limes, and the pickled veggies. Theirs has a hot section as well. Grilled onions and jalapenos just taste better when they are kept warm for you.\n\nAlthough I do not mind to drive to the old location. I can rest at ease knowing that this location is a viable solution to my taco needs.
