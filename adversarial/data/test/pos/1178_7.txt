Zero stars.  I've done lots of reviews but never with a zero!\n\nWe have rented many cars over the last 30 or so years in Vegas from almost any company you can name.  Payless was the worst in our experience, you could say it was Worthless....\n\nI found a new auto rental site in the LA Times Parade magazine travel section.  It seemed to work quite well as the Payless quote for three nights was very good.\nLike others we experienced long waits in line at the Vegas car rental center.   Our counter clerk seemed affable enough but the upsell circus was way up in his skill set!\nFirst came the 'extra driver' ripoff which would essentially double the cost.  All of the companies do it of course, this business is a monopoly.  We expressed our disgust with this but said we would do it since we were already at the rental center and had no reason to hope another company would not have this stupid rule.\nNext we declined the extra insurance since our car insurance covers damage in rental cars.  Oh NO NO NO you don't, he virtually said with his finger wagging.  He asserted that Nevada law allows car rental companies to charge  full rental fees for the days the car is in the shop!  This either approaches consumer fraud or some kind of cozy relationship between Nevada politicians and the rental firms.  We really balked at this, but unconcerned by us or the line behind us that now had grown to about 20 groups, our supersalesmaggot sternly warned us this could happen to us.  But he had the usual twist to sweeten the deal, he would drop the daily extra driver fee if we took the insurance.  \nWe were in Vegas to celebrate our 15th Anniversary, not spend hours in a sweaty car rental center arguing with a high pressure salesman.  We looked at each other, rolled our 4 eyes, and agreed.\nAfter signing and initialing nearly as many legal mumbo jumbos as when you buy a house the dude rewarded us with a car upgrade!  Oh Holy Day!\nSo we would pay 4 times the offered deal when we booked but oh boy an upgrade?\nSo we hurried to the parking garage where you go to another counter and deal with people who are in air conditioned comfort while you sweat outside their window.  Please go check your car for damage sir, she said cheerily.  So we toddled off dutifully with our luggage to a red car with multiple scratches and dents on all surfaces sides etc.  There appeared to be a spare lurking under a thick pad in the trunk.  The gas tank was full.  However the gray cloth upholstery had giant stains on all four seats.  Ugh.  And a sign which read \"If you smoke in this car we will assess you a $250 fee\".  I contemplated that any smoke might cover the stench of the multiple murders that left all those upholstery stains....\nI asked the lady why this car we were renting was so damaged, since it was an 'upgrade'.  Oh, she shrugged, we buy them from other rental companies when they are done with them....\nWow.  This car had around 30K miles on it which is closer to 300K miles when driven as a rental.  This car is literally a pig with lipstick.\nIt get's better (read worse).  This car drove as the absolute worst rental car we ever had, it bucked and yawed and felt like it was going to stall out at every stop. It reminded me of my wasted youth when I drove beat up crappy nearly dead cars and prayed they didn't die in traffic.  Seriously.\nWe drove it as little as we could during our stay in Vegas, not having time to go back to the rental center and get another jewell of a car for our holiday.\n\nWe will never never never never again rent a PAYLESS CAR.  We won't even go to Payless Shoes or anything else named Payless.\n\nIn an era where so many companies have learned that exquisite customer service begets return customers, Payless Rental Cars has learned that scaring and berating their customers while delivering severely substandard vehicles is what they call a 'business strategy'.\nIt's wrong.\n\nMig, Not Happy\n\n(The 1 star is because Yelp made me put in something higher than zero for some reason....)
