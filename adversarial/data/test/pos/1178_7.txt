We WERE regulars here, dropping $60-70 every other week, until one of the sushi chefs (one of the Mexican guys) says to my girlfriend \"If you ever leave your boyfriend, come see me.\" Now I was ahead of her and she didn't tell me this until later. And maybe he was joking (that was my initial response), but I think either way it was a classless thing to say. Wow. It was Monday April 9, around 1pm. Needless to say, the only time we'll be back is when I go have a talk with this clown.
