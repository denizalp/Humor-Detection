Pomegranate chicken gyro + 1\/2 order of Plato's Potatoes = A-OK\nChicken was very dry, and the main reason I got the gyro over the wrap was the addition of Feta- of which there was so little it didn't really matter.\nFries were seasoned well, and paired with a spicy yogurt sauce. Fries were tastier without the sauce, but it wasn't bad.\n\nOrder was takeout, and staff present was just okay- walked in and wasn't addressed for a while, was helped by the manager who eventually asked if I was ready while other employees ignored me. I seemed to be interrupting their closing duties and conversation, my bad.\n\nThe spanakopita and avgolemeno soup sound tasty, but I'll likely try another location.\nI agree with Betty W's review calling their pricing \"ballsy'- $13 is a bit high for my meal, $4 to add on a veggie skewer is ri-donk.
