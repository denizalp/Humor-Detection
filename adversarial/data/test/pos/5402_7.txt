My husband and I really like this place! We were very excited to try it and glad we did! The chef is very friendly, we have had many conversations with her. She really puts her heart into this place!\n\nI read some of the other reviews and yes, it's true, when they first opened they did not have much decor and did not have enough menus - no big deal! I go to a restaurant for food and for the experience, not the decor! The decor is coming along and they now have enough menus. They just opened and sometimes when a restaurant first opens, it's a little disorganized. \n\nI have tried several of their crepes - from sweet to savory. I prefer savory to sweet so I have tried more of the savory options. All have been tasty! The only critique is regarding the Indian Curry Style crepe - I feel like it should have had more spice! Or at least the option to add spice. \n\nI support this The Crepe because it is a wonderful concept,  they use locally grown food and they have plenty of options for people with dietary restrictions (gluten free, Vegan). Also, the food is GOOD!
