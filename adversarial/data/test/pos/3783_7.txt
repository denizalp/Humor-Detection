Extremely disappointed in the service. I would not recommend this restaurant to even my worst enemy. The food was subpar. My friend took a bite of the lobster and immediately spit it out. Upon sending it back we were then confronted by a waitress about 5 times and she was arguing with us about the lobster. The manager then came out to speak to us. Never in my life have I been spoken to so rudely. The staff and manager need to take a class on how to interact with customers.
