I would give a ZERO if offered..\nSo, we are visiting the area and while here saw the Plato's Closet. We are staying in Mesa, but we were out that way yesterday & decided to stop in. Looked like they had nice displays set up in the window & were well stocked as well as open for business.\nRight when we walk in there: there were two young girls at the front counter ( one was folding a scarf, while the other was just sitting there) . As we came in- the one employee says to us ( instead of greeting us) \" Have you been here before\", I said \" not to this location\" & she says \" Well, just to let you know we are only taking in consignment ( buying) clothing and so NON of the merchandise on the floor is available to sell right now? WHAT?? SMH.. My response was \"okay, well I guess we're leaving then\"...\nWhy is this place even open for business?. No where does it say we are open, but you can't shop or buy: we are JUST BUYING!! They have a HUGE sign on the front roof top hanging down that says \" now hiring\"?..\nThis place should rethink their whole idea before they OPEN their doors. I've never experienced anything like this!! On our way out \"leaving\" I said to the girl \" you should open when your REALLY OPEN\". \nI've been in retail for over 20 years, this was shocking & super rude. I was with my three kids and was embarrassed for us ALL as we had to turn right around to walk out. \nHow can a place like this even make money, if they are ONLY taking in merchandise: but not offering to sell it? They in turn; pay employees to send people out the door! Maybe that's why they moved & have so many bad reviews.
