OMG GUYS..... Boba boy is so delicious. The Tapioca is hand made so it is very good. Very chewy and just amazing. My mind is blown. Anyways they have a variety of flavours which is good. I recommend the green apple green tea. It is 11\/10. Ever since they removed green apple from chatime, I've been going to boba boy ever since. Boba boy is the place to be and the place to go.
