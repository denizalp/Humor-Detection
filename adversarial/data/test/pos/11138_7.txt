My pulled pork sandwich at Bootleggers wasn't fatty. \"Fatty\" implies some sort of holy union between tender shreds of protein and slow-cooked, melty lipid. Fat was on one side of the arena. Protein was on the other. I was picking wads of cholesterol-flavored chewing gum out from between the kaiser roll, which was very soft and brioche-y (you know, to enhance the mushy fat aspect of the experience.)\n\nNow look, I ain't a bitch. I like fat. I also like chips, so you know there's a problem when the greasiness from the chips is actually about to saturate and capsize the sandwich. Few things deter me from putting chips on a sandwich.\n\nMoving on from the first-world problems and onto the first world solutions, the coleslaw on the sandwich was excellent in all the ways. The pork itself, as well as the flavor, was good. I actually found the huge, unshredded chunks to be the best part, since I didn't have to worry about trimming them first. \n\nSPOILER ALERT: Happy ending! Basically, my persnicketry saved me from expelling food in public or having to go get a coronary artery bypass graft. (Day ruiner, am I right?) So naturally I got a blueberry & peach cobbler with ice cream afterwards. Super sweet, very comforting, and the topping was made of mutilated cinnamon toast crunch. Novel.
