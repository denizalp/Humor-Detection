Dear Montreal,\n\nThank you for renewing my faith in a place that should be enjoyed by everyone (the Lookout).  Arrived here in the morning, and there was not a piece of trash, cans, bottle, or anything garbage like to be seen.  Also it smelled like fresh air, not cigarettes, or fermenting alcohol bottles. \n\nAlso, did not see the obese raccoon.
