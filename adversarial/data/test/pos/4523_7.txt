DING DING DING!  We have a new winner for the best soup filled dumplings in GTA.  I actually ordered the soup filled dumplings again for \"dessert\" cause they were that good.  Seriously, if you only order one thing here order the soup filled dumplings.\n\nI came in here looking for soup filled dumplings, that's pretty much it.  I decided to give some of the other things a try, so we also ordered the drunken chicken, the pork and chive dumplings, chunky chill beef noodles and steamed pork buns.\n\nThe drunken chicken came first and I have to tell you that I wish they actually spent some time making this.  It seemed like they just poured alcohol on the chicken afterwards cause it tasted bitter afterwards because of the alcohol (yuk).\n\nThe chunky beef noodles were pretty neat cause they used handmade noodles, but the broth was really bland and the beef was not at all tender.  Too bad.  As for the pork and chive dumplings, they were alright.  The dough on them was really silky, but I found that they put way too much chive in there to my liking.  I don't think there was much pork in there at all.  As for the pork buns, they were about average.\n\nNow, what makes their soup dumplings so good?  First of all, the dough is really thin, but not so thin that it falls apart when you pick them up.  Second, the pork filling is probably the smoothest, tenderest filling I've ever had.  They pretty much melt in your mouth.  Third, there is no third, it's awesome just order it.\n\nIn my opinion, I think this place is really only good for their dim sum or \"appetizer\" dishes.  Every one of our entrees kinda sucked.  I'd love to give this place more stars but I can't justify it on one dish.  But then again, it's an amazing dish.  You already know what you're going to order when you come here.  Give it a try!
