The Plaza Premium Lounge was my gateway into the finer things in life. I was fortunate to fly business class for business purposes and arrived a little earlier with the excitement of using the lounge. I was also half dead with a cold and trying my best to hide it so they'd let me through the gates. \n\nFirst thing I noticed was that sleek, shiny, lounge-y atmosphere. Damn, this place looks like a hotel and was beautiful. Small, but with shiny wooden decor and large windows that looked out onto the runway. Off to one corner was a discreet area for a shower. This must be where the frequent flying elite brush up. I sat at one of the comfortable seats and just stared outside until I had to go. Blissful. \n\nOne of the main benefits of the lounge is of course, free food and refreshments. I'm guessing they rotate through different international fare. That day, I was only up for something soupy because I was sick. Luckily for me, they had laksa noodles. Even more luckily for me, I found it very tasty. Sipping away at my laksa and unlimited earl grey tea certainly helped put me to sleep for 8 hours straight on the plane ride afterwards.  \n\nYes, there were more people than I thought there would be. Yes, there were a surprising amount of families and kids. But this isn't some 18+, extra exclusive lounge. If I have my family with me and earned\/paid my way into the lounge, what am I gonna do? Leave my kids outside?\n\nI happened across a previous review that starts with: \"It blows my mind when I see 4 and 5 star ratings for this lounge. Have you never been to another lounge before?\" No, Jordan. I haven't. Because I'm a broke af young adult that just finished paying off college debts, goddammit. Chill. Let me enjoy your privilege for once. \n\n(17\/100) - 2018
