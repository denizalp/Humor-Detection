The Vig has a big comfy patio with soft couches, long tables and the occasional cat napping (what?). They have  heaters and an outdoor fireplace so its great regardless of the weather and your body temperature. If you are more into watching NFL Sunday  and staying away from nature, the indoors is small but fully equipped with flat screens showing the major games and scores. \n\nAlthough I only visited the Vig for brunch, I was pretty happy with their overall menu, food quality and service. The $5 Mimosa\/Bloody Mary brunch special is pretty decent but some of their more signature, full-priced cocktails (like the van goh vodka with coffee and milk) definitely needs to kick it up a couple notches and stop skimping on the good ingredients (read:booze). At a table of 3, we ordered the hangover helper, shepherds pie and the tofu scramble- 3 very unique menu breakfast\/brunch menu items that I was excited to try.\n\nThe tofu scramble (pictured) comes in a burrito but to be honest, the best way to eat it is sans tortilla bread and topped with 2 sunny-side up eggs. The mixture of grilled firm tofu, sun-dried tomatoes, chilies and assorted veggies is surprisingly spicy and full of flavor. However, since it doesn't come with any cheese or sauce, the yolk from the eggs on top boost up the dish by a factor of 10 and make it an amazing hearty (yet healthy) meal. Too bad the eggs don't come with the dish (gotta ask for it extra). \n\nIf the whole veggie\/vegan\/hippie roll ain't your thing, then the shepherds pie is probably the manliest breakfast you can get there. Giant piece of juicy steak and eggs sitting on a giant bed of potatoes, cheese, beans, corns and pretty much every ingredient in the kitchen. Its served on a giant skillet and will truly make you feel like a caveman eating for the next year. Props if you can finish eat, its a LOT of food. If that STILL seems too healthy for you, the hangover helper is another skillet drowning in baked tortilla, sauce and about 20lbs of melted cheese into one gooey dish. It tastes exactly like what you crave at 4am after doing too many jager-bombs in Old town. It comes with eggs, but instead it should comes with an additional 20lbs of hot sauce to accompany the cheese.\n\nEverything else really doesn't matter-  I mean, the service is decent, the crowd is good and the atmosphere is nice. I'd come back for the food in a heartbeat, maybe next time i'll snuggle up with the cat.
