Move here and have nothing? This is the best place for stuff like plastic baskets, glass kitchenware like cups, bowls, and the serving stuff. Also all the the small stuff you need for your kitchen and bbathroom. And where else can you get a package of 50 pairs of chopsticks for $1?\nThe products are decent if a bit unfamiliar. Use your own judgement. I wouldn't buy their condoms unless I was ging to use them as ballons....
