Ice cream. Amazing flavours of it. About ten of them with fun, cheeky names, among them, Atomic Chocolate. It's positively nuclear - it's so rich and dark it's nearly BLACK. Cones or cups are $2 including tax for a small, or you can get a large, which is three times the size of a small for only $0.75 more. How does that make any sense!? It's basically a pint of ice cream, and wholly endorse its consumption. I ordered the Peanut Butter & Chocolate flavour, which is Atomic Chocolate + PB, and it was dastardly good.\n\nOh. Um, I also rented a movie from The Film Buff. Cause you know, it IS primarily a video rental place. But with incredible ice cream flavours greeting you as you enter, can you really blame a girl for needing three return visits before making it past the ice cream display case to finally sign up for a membership??\n\n$4.50 (tax incl.) for a five night rental.
