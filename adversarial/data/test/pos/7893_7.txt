I was meeting a friend for lunch near the Excalibur hotel; he's a local and suggested we might try Burger Bar which is located a quick monorail or moving walkway ride away at the Mandalay Bay, as he'd heard decent things about it.\n\nIt was actually a good choice!  We were seated right away, ordered drinks and ordered food soon thereafter.  From that point on, service was great, our waitress checked in on us at least 3 or 4 times during the course of the meal to ask if everything was OK, and our drinks never got below a few inches from the top of the glass before they were topped off (though at one point, the staff did top off my Sierra Mist with ice water by mistake).\n\nI had the classic burger and fries, which simply came with lettuce, tomato and pickle.  It was a bit spendy at $15.40, but to be honest, it was one of the best tasting burgers I'd had in a while so I thought it was worth it.  My friend ordered the sliders and fries at $13.85 and was also happy with his food.  Soft drinks priced out at $3.75 each.\n\nTouristy Vegas prices perhaps, but the food here was good and so was the service.
