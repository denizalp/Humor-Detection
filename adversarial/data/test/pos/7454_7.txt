Well, my original intention was to write this review from the public bathroom less than 2 miles from Burger Theory, but as I sat there trying, I realized that I was too busy concentrating on keeping my insides inside of me. The intestinal exorcism was like nothing I have experienced before. \n\nDecor - 4 stars. BT looks good inside and would fit in about 4 miles northwest of its current location easily. \n\nService - 3 stars. Aaron did an average job. He was a little confused on the \"Staff Pick\" beer which seemed a little strange since the staff picked it. \n\nPricing - 2 stars. Happy Hour draft is a good deal and is par for the area. 3 stars for that. They lose a star with their burger pricing which I will go into details on next \n\nFood Quality - 1 star due to the fact that negative stars aren't an option. \nWe ordered the Firecracker Shrimp appetizer and the flavor wasn't horrible, but was served at a strange temperature. \nBurgers(should be great as it's in the name) were tricky. The flavor wasn't the worst we've had, but the color of the patties was off-putting to say the least. We ordered both burgers medium, which Aaron said would be slightly pink(as it should) but they were served grayish with no pink. I've had plenty of burgers in my life and I am pretty sure this is the first gray one I've seen. \nFries were soft and warm - far from hot. Maybe were sitting around for a while. The flavor wasn't horrible though and were seasoned decently. \nOnion rings were probably the highlight of the dinner. Not sure if they were fried out of a bag or not, but were above average in taste. \n\nAt the conclusion of our $71 dinner with tip, we made our way north. By the time we made it 1 mile to Thomas, I was desperately looking for a public restroom as I didn't want to ruin the seats of my truck and my clothes. BT has dethroned the champion of Intestinal Distress, Panda Express now and will be my go-to place any time I feel constipated. \n\nOn a side note, I will be back for Happy Hour beers... I mean, who can say \"No\" to a $3 local craft beer?
