Pizza AND Beer are here atPizza A Metro!!  They just got their liquor license and  I was apparently the first person to order a beer.  I have to say that it went perfectly with my Pizza.\nI can't really say anything else that the other yelpers have said so I'm keeping this one short.\nService was friendly and attentive.\nThe pizza was great.\nThe place was clean.\nThe beer (although the selection was limited to bud light and coors light) was refreshing.  Definitely going back.
