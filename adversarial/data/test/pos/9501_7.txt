This plaza has 2 other Nail places so it was a very random pick. Walking in I thanked my starts for coming in so early. All 4 pedicure seats were taken. Every manicurist etc was busy with a client. The owner, an older Asian gentleman greeted me and asked me if I could wait a few minutes. \"sure\". Replied I. Silly silly me. \n\nLittle did I know that a few minutes would be 27minutes. Ya, I timed it. \n\nWhen I finally climbed onto the pedicure seat and pushed start to the massage chair, I noticed the sign right in front of the pedicure station. \n\n\"Please note that we perform our pedicures to the highest standard and if you need to have extra skin removed\/shaved off you will need to sign a waiver. Excess peeling may cause burning or bleeding.\" \n3 thoughts crossed my mind \n\n1-Never seen this before. \n\n2-Not going to lie, it seduced me......towards scary images.\n3- I wonder how this came about. Leading back to point 2. \n \n\nNow let me run a spot light on the \"High Standard\" claims:\n\nThe place itself is tiny and everything has a noticeably great deal of wear and tear. The manicure stations are to the right from the door and the pedicure stations are to the left. There's only about 4 per station. \n\nThe rolling chairs (also acting like the towel dispenser)  in front of the pedicure stations had massive tears on the seating. How are they still sitting on this thing? Don't they feel the plastic scratches on their bums? \nThe pedicure chairs are old and the hot water function does not work very well. \n\nThe sanitation is ... well... questionably shuddering. Let me explain - Once a client leaves, the cold water is drained. While draining, a liquid (smelled like dish detergent)  is quickly poured and the same draining water is used to wipe the back wall of the water container by hand. You can see the dirt line of where the water rose all around the sides. Yuck. \nJust when I wanted to click my-already-emersed-in-water-heels for home, I witnessed the water flow was turned back on and kept that way until another client came in and used it. Now I am no expert in pedicure station sanitation but this cannot possibly be a way. By the time another client sat down, the water was cold, the dirt was still visible.  Just not in the vision of the client, only to the neighbour. I didn't want to ask my neighbour how mine looked. I cant handle the truth.\n \nThere were only 4 girls doing both the manicures ,pedi's and apparently eyebrows. The girl that was assigned to me was beyond slow. I swear it would've been Christmas if I didn't ask her how much longer it would take. Okay - every lady knows that it takes a good 40-45minutes for a good pedicure- with massage and polish. But and HOUR AND HALF?. Seriously, how could I explain that to anyone if I was running late? - Oh sorry, she took and hour on my feet. How horrid were they? - For the record, my feet are cute. \n\nSo as the slowness progressed- slowly, there came a medium toned Rhianna song from somewhere by the washroom. She got up leaving me high and dry - literally, went into the mystery room and emerged back out with an iphone- held up to her ear chatting away. She was very non responsive to anything around her - including the boss that was trying to get her attention to the other customers walking in. \n\nSO - the theory on getting what you pay for falls true for this business. For $26, I ignorantly expected a professional establishment. Silly silly me. \n\nxoxo\nM.
