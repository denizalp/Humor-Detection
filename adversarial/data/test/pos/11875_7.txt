Went to Vegas the past weekend for the usual: clubbing, gambling, drinking, etc. Our group decided to go to XS to see Afrojack so we all bought our tickets in advance via wanticket.com (Guys, buy your admission through wanticket.com; there's a separate line for wanticket holders so you don't have to wait in a long line or pay your way to cut the line!)\n\nXS is no different from the usual Vegas clubs: you got the party people jam packed in the middle of the dance floor leaving no room to move or dance, you got the high rollers on the tables INSIDE of XS and those that still wanted a table but couldn't really afford the $$$ on the outside tables of XS. \n\nI do wish that the Vegas clubs have some kind of maximum capacity because always at around 1-2am, it just gets impossible to maneuver through the dance floor and people just start pushing their way through. GIRLS, PUSHING WON'T GET YOU THROUGH ANY CROWD, THAT IS HOW YOU GET YOUR HAIR RIPPED OUT BY ANOTHER BELLIGERENT DRUNK. \n\nBesides the crowd issue, XS is a nice venue with the inside being the dance floor and the outside being a more relaxed open area.
