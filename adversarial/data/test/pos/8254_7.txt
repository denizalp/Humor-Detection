Empty waiting room when we arrived. Now 8 people are waiting. The appointment was set for 1:45. Got here 30 mins early as asked to \"fill out a paperwork\" (get asked questions for the computer database.) Asked at 2:15 what was the hold up? \"You will be seen shortly\" was the response. Seems pretty typical of this place. Definitely be prepared to wait and wait and wait...Oh my goodness, the waiting. \n\nBring a book, find some nice articles to read online or write a Yelp review! However, once we actually were seen then the process went fast. Hooray for that!
