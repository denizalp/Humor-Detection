I originally wanted to go to HK cafe, however, it was incredibly busy, so we decided to go across the street to Cafe100%. The food was decent and I thought the portions were good, however, it is more expensive than HK cafe. The presentation and atmosphere is lovely and very modern. Service started out very nice but, after we paid cash and left it on the table, one of the servers ran to us in the parking lot and insisted that we paid with \"fake cash.\" The $10 we paid was made in the 1980's and is old.  We tried to tell him that the bill has little marks like any other paper bill and we told him that there is a certain texture to the bill that makes it real, however, he still insisted for us to give him another $10 bill. I'm not the one to argue, so I gave him another bill. After, we went to the bank to check if it was real, and it was. After that experience, I will not come back again. Even if the HK cafe is busy again, I will just wait for a table rather than coming here.
