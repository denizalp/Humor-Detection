Great experience at this place! The margaritas are the best I've ever had and if you come during happy hour they are half off making an amazing margarita only like $5 or so. \n\nBartenders are great and everyone was friendly, good at making drinks. My friend got the corn but it wasn't salted enough for her and the mayo sauce they had wasn't enough on the corn to make it as flavorful as when we make it at home.\n\nOverall great experience and great place for drinks to avoid the hot Arizona weather!
