\"What would you do if I sang out of tune?\nWould you stand up and walk out on me?\nLend me your ears and I'll sing you a song,\nAnd I'll try not to sing out of key.\"-\"With A Little Help From My Friends\", Beatles\n\nBeatles LOVE, with seating in the round, so not a bad seat in the house.  It's been showcased on the Strip for a long time now, and still draws the crowds nightly.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/cirque-du-soleil-the-beatles-love-las-vegas?select=z2BQr5kmAM5La12sRzvQSg#z2BQr5kmAM5La12sRzvQSg\n\nWe used Tix4Tonight to score some primo seats for cheap.  There's a part of the act where a surpise is brought out to the audience and we happened to be the very last row to participate.  I won't spoil it, but it was fun!\n\nPre-show, some clowns put on some comic relief by, literally, blowing smoke up people's arses.  Kinda creepy, kinda funny - it was great seeing people's reactions.\n\nThe highlights of Beatles LOVE, for me, were the aerialist during \"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\" & the act featuring \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".  Very touching.  I didn't care much for the halfpipes and rollerbladers.  Oh, and the music is on blast!  I'm talking loud!  So, just be mindful of that, if you have sensitive hearing.\n\nOverall, a great show worth the money & time while in Vegas!  I highly recommend using Tix4Tonight for purchasing tickets the day before\/day of.  Our seats were great & we saved a lot of money.  I'm generally not a Cirque du Soleil fan, but I highly enjoyed this eclectic & colorful show.
