We are Seahawk fans and wanted to come to this so-called Seahawks bar to watch the Superbowl to be with other Hawks fans. Here was our experience:\n\n1) We paid $105 per person for standing space since the place was fully booked. It said the price included a buffet of food. They had a couple trays of nachos and wings for hundreds of people. \n\n2) Waiting in line was so confusing. We were supposed to have access to it from 4pm-end of the game. Waited for an hour; fought through the line to ask the host, he had no clue of what was going on and said we were in the right line. Found out later that we were in the walk-in line, not the line with people who had reserved a spot (this was a blob of people, not a line). We finally fought our way into the bar.\n\n3) Whenever the Patriots scored, someone blew a horn.. Seahawks bar?? Not to mention some Pats fan (a guy) pushed me when I fought my way to the bathroom.\n\n4) When we lost the game, they played the song \"We are the Champions\".. WTF. I would rather they just slap me in the face directly.\n\nThe whole experience was awful. At some point some punk Patz fan threw (Yes, he really threw it!) a tray of unfinished food on a large table of Seahawk fans and then wanted to fight. Sauces and food went flying everywhere and got on people's shirt.\nAfter the game, not only they trash talked, they also took off their shirts (the guys) and flung it around and wanted to fight. \n\nThe whole reason we picked a Hawks bar was because we want to be with other real Hawks fans. This is a flip-flopping bar. Whoever wins, they support. Overpriced, overcrowded, rude staff. Never again...
