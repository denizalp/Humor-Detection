I was happy to see this new restaurant opening. The decore was pleasant, the service was great and the food\\drinks were awesome. I wish the food portions were a bit bigger because they left me wanting more. Their drinks were also very good and had a good twist to them. I ordered the \"where there's smoke\"... which was tasty and pretty cool looking drink. This drink came with a small piece of pork! Who does not love their drinks garnished especially when they are meaty??!! \n\nTheir creations are very unique, some of my favorite dishes were the udon lamb bolognese, the pork shoulder and the artichoke. Every dish was extraordinary! Love, love this place and you should too!
