I don't know of the guy was having a bad day, but today the bald guy with glasses didn't like that I gave him a $20 and he tossed my change down at me and it flew all over.  I asked him if I did something wrong by giving him a $20, like 3 more people after me did also, and he says \"No, that's the just the way I am, have a nice day!\" And he turns around to ignore me.\n\nI don't care how good the food is there, I'll never spend another dime at that stand. He was shaking his head at me in disgust because I didn't have anything smaller than a $20.  They had an AM installed outside too. Guess what denomination it gives out?? Cash only businesses should know they have to MAKE CHANGE.  \nIt's not my fault you weren't prepared.  Customer lost.  \n\nAnd the Fire Dog was way overcooked.
