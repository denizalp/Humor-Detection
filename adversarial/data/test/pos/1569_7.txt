***Update 9\/15\/15***\nI'm so happy to say that this cute patisserie is as good as it was when we last visited a few years ago. (Nothing's worse than returning to a place that you had a positive experience at to discover it's gone downhill). \n\nThis past summer, we were ignored when we tried to have lunch at the nearby outdoor café at the \"5 Saisons\" so we returned here, to the Brioche Doree, for a casual mid-day meal. The display case was overflowing with enticing wraps and sandwiches and pastries and cakes and breads and palmiers and other cookies and treats. My kids shared a wrap which, though pricey, was large enough for two to share (easily). It came with a small but prettily plated and very fresh salad, which they loved. They also had chocolate croissants which were super fresh and flaky and wonderful. I had a café au lait which is one of my most-missed Montreal pleasures and it was wonderful as well. \n\nA side note: the washroom here is cute and clean. You can tell a lot about a place by how well kept they keep their bathroom (in my opinion)!\n\nThis is a great, unpretentious café with super fresh foods and well-crafted coffees. Good to know we can count on this place.
