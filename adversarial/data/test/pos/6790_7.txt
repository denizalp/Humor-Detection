Real Talk, Let's dispel the latest bs reviews \n\n1.) For everyone who gave this hotel less than 3 stars, you're obviously upset that you lost some dough on the slots, get over it. \n\n2.) Location on the strip: Ever heard of google maps? Probably should have checked that out before booking. Also there's a new program that just started recently...Taxis. \n\n3.) Quality vs other casinos\/hotels in the area:  Hmm I recall paying around $120\/night and It was damn well worth every penny. Was it 5 star? No. Could anyone have easily gone down the street and paid triple at Mandarin for said level of luxury service, yes.  Champagne taste, beer money...heard of that? \n\nOn with the Good\n\n1.) The Restaurants are FANTASTIC. I stayed for a week and had made reservations elsewhere prior to my arrival. Ended up canceling half of them. I would have eaten at CLEO every night of the week if my bf didn't insist we try something else. Hands down the BEST cocktails I've ever had. The service was on point, food was delectable, the waiter was like an old college buddy, just really personable and made the evening that much more enjoyable. \n800 Degrees makes delicious custom order pizza and you can get two scoops of gelato for $3, score!\nThe Griddle Cafe, has amazing French Press coffee and the best (yes that's getting redundant but its true) Juevos Rancheros,called Tequila Sunrise on their menu, I've ever had. EVER \nWhile I didn't try Bazaar Meat, I did frequent Jose Andres other restaurant Jaleo and the food was delish. I'll be sure to try it next time I'm there.\nUmami..just try it. Burgers, beer, betting,yes please. Chill ass outside bar seating overlooking the strip. \n Also excited for Beach Life to open!\n\n2.) I just have to say as an ex-smoker, I can't stand the smell of it. Not a hint of ashy death at this place. The Hotel smells divine..seriously I wish I could bottle it and spray my home with the scent. Im assuming it's a mixture of some powerful air filtration system and hidden fragrance machines, also the pastry aroma lingering around The Perq.  To Die For.\n\n3.) The staff was always friendly and accommodating. Nice having security near the elevators checking for key cards as well. \n\n4.) Chair hogs are my biggest hotel pool pet peeve. There wasn't an abandoned towel in sight. Nice bar in the center and plenty of lounges\/cabanas. \n\n5.) Last but not least..the decor : Ugh stunning, I mean really beautiful designs from the casino to the restaurants and bars, shops and rooms. I loved everything about it. \nThe bathroom has an amazing shower, ample closet space with adorable pink hangers, full size ironing board, 6 drawers, separate water closet, the bed was so f-ing comfortable, i have back issues and this was like sleeping on a cloud. yes a cloud. \n\n   For the money SLS is amazing, if you don't mind being further down the strip, or have heard of taxis\/rental cars, you're in for a real treat. Don't listen to the pretentious idiots inflated by their own yelp egos. I have a feeling this'll become the new place to be.
