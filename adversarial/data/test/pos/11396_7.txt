DO NOT..I Repeat...DO NOT use Quik Pik Towing.  Actually they are:\n5-D Leasing, L.L.C. dba\nQuik Pik\/All Over Towing\n\nThey don't take the shortest route so they add mileage.\n\nMy car died just as I was pulling in to where I work.  My insurance company covers towing up to a certain amount of miles.  The repair shop I chose is close to my home so I drive by it every day I go to work.\n\nI checked the mileage from the shop to my car four times using the odometer of two different cars while I was getting rides to work.  The mileage was less than what the insurance company covered.  I called the insurance company to have it towed.  They chose Quik Pik Towing.\n\nQuik Pik Towing arrived late.  The driver told me the mileage was higher than what the insurance company covered so I would have to pay the difference.  I explained to him that I checked the mileage and assured him it wasn't.  He said the office tells him it is and refused to load the car until I paid.  Hindsight being what it is I should have called the insurance company and told them to send someone else.\n\nI paid.  The driver loaded the car and left.  I followed because I was curious about the mileage difference.  The driver pulled on to a residential side street and stopped (I got the feeling he was hoping that I would just drive on).  I stopped and asked him if there was a problem.  He told me he forgot to do some paperwork.  I went and sat in my car.  When I didn't immediately leave he started the truck and left.  The small amount of time furthers my belief that he didn't have forgotten paperwork and it really was an attempt to keep me from following him.\n\nWhen we got on the highway he pulled away.  I tried to stick with him but when I hit 75 mph (10 mph above the speed limit) I backed off and just tried to keep him in sight.  Even at 75 mph he was pulling away quickly.  He had to be doing 85+ mph, and with my car on top.\n\nIt all became clear when I watched him pass the turn he needed to make and drive down a couple more exits before getting off.  He was adding mileage.\n\nI intend to raise the issue with my insurance company.
