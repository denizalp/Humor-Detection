I was searching for a place to eat for lunch a couple weeks ago. I saw this place. It wasn't  busy at all. I went up to order and the lady did not speak much English at all. It was hard to order cause she couldn't understand me. \nAfter I made my order I sat down and the owner of the place brought me my food. He was a nice guy and had a smile on his face. I asked him for some garlic sauce for my food and he kindly brought it to me. The food itself was mediocre. It had to much of this spice thats used in Mediterranean food. The garlic sauce looked like old butter that's been sitting out in room temperature. It didn't look appetizing. It was different than most Mediterranean food places I go too. \nAfter I finished I was nice enough to bring my plate back to the counter. It was a different girl that took my plate. She asked me if I payed for my food. She would know if the staff was working together. She was kind of rude and did not smile. That was it.\nI went to the washroom and when I left. Not even a smile or goodbye to show there appreciation. They just stared and talked in there language which is kinda rude. \nCustomer service sucks. The food was just okay. I don't think I would visit this place again, just because of horrible customer service.
