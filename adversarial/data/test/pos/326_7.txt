On paper, this place has NOTHING going for it - middle of no where in an industrial area, part of the same lot as a gas station and auto body shops, on a highway that attracts 18 ton trailers way more than cars. I mean who visits a place like that?\n\nWell, I did - and I totally LOVED it. This place is very hole in the wall, CASH only, minimal furniture and no decor. They serve up plates veyr quickly and have a process for it - be ready with your order when the guy asks - he goes fast through the toppings - you snooze, you lose! \n\nWe had the chicken shawarma plate - absolute best ever! Rice was tasty, chicken was tender, flavorful and moist - loved every bite of it!\n\nWe ended up using american money bec I am the hightailing chick who decides every place must use a credit card, and the guy charged us like Canadian money - which means I lost a few dollars, but hey - the food was delicious, so no complains!
