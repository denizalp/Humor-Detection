Dr. Owen is awesome! I scheduled an appointment online and they called me in 5 minutes! I drove over in 5 minutes as I live close. I was seen by Dr. Owen who treated me very good and took excellent care of me. I was diagnosed, and prescriptions called in to my pharmacy. I was sent on my way and happy with my visit even though I was miserable from being sick.\n\nThis was quick and easy! I won't visit the Hospital ER to wait hours upon hours unless my illness is life threatening!
