Checked in and started to inspect my sheets, the linens on the bed had eye makeup, hair, holes and PUBES from the previous occupant. I called the front desk to get it sorted and Jessica and Liz (her manager) were of NO help. In fact, Liz was down right rude. Taking an attitude as if *I* did something wrong. Had to wait over 30+ minutes (still waiting) to get the linens changed. When asked to move to a different room (King bed, non-smoking), I was told there was NONE available. However, when looking online, you could still book a King sized bed for the same nights that I have booked! Liz and Jessica either need to rethink their positions in hospitality, or be retrained. I will NEVER stay at the Aria again.
