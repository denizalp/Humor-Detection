I don't think I'll be going here much anymore. See, they have this cookie. It's chocolate chip. And has nuts. And maybe something else that's illegal and addictive. And they're big, and they're soft, and I cannot stop eating them! \n\nAnd all the weird tasty coffees! I love their Miel, which is a tasty, lite drink that reminded me of a chai. They also have a Filthy Chai, which is just a bit dirtier than a Dirty Chai. And today I tried the Gredo (?) which is a white chocolate with cayenne pepper. They are all so good, and have so many tasty calories!\n\nBut I love the way the place is decorated, and the barristas are great. So maybe I'll go there and hang out and stubbornly refuse to eat all their tasty, tasty goodness.
