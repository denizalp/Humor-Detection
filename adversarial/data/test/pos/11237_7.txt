Today I had an appointment with Dr. Hans in hope to alleviate a nagging neck pain that I've been having for a while. The kind that feels like you slept wrong, but it had gone on for way to long, so I called the Acupuncture Clinic after researching them on Google, finding the website, and reading about the doctors primary study and formal education accolades. \n\nI searched YELP.com for reviews prior to making an appointment, but found none, however I did find testimonials on the clinics website attesting to patient satisfaction. While that's all well and good, I'm a YELP Review READER and it always feels awesome and saves me so much time when I can just read YOUR REVIEWS here. So if you feel like me: you love YELP and you're looking for a FANTASTIC ACUPUNCTURIST, I'm going to have to recommend Dr. Han. \n\nThe office is quaint and serene. The front desk clerk acknowledged us immediately upon entrance with a smile and paperwork. Once completed we were situated in a treatment room. Dr. Hans entered the room, introduced himself and yielded a gentle handshake. We talked about my issue: Bruxism - I grind and clinch my teeth at night and the neck pain thereafter has been a beast. Dr. Hans identified the area, checked (looked at) both of my hands and took my blood pressure. He then explained the acupuncture procedure, though in all fairness, this is probably my 2nd or 3rd time seeing an acupuncturist, so I'm not completely new. I appreciated his informative mannerism. \n\nOnce on the table, he PIN-POINTED the area behind my right ear with 3 or 4 needles, (I'm not entirely sure how many he used, because I was face down on the table, but I did feel the gentle taps as he inserted them). Once I was PINNED down, the zen music came on, he set a timer and I zoned out. I had the best rest! He came in some time later, removed the pins, advised me to take it easy when working out, bundle up and come back if the issue doesn't subside. \n\nAbout the neck pain. What neck pain? By the time Dr. Hans was giving his exit speech I was already pain free. I'm sure he saw the \"happy kid look\" in my eyes as he so calmly and softly spoke. \n\nWill I go back? You betcha! Hopefully not because I'm in pain - however, if need be, I will.
