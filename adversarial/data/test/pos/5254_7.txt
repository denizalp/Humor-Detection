Vodka in my sauce?   I went to Armstrong's after reading several reviews.    This restaurant is in the  corner of a strip mall not visible from the street.\n\nIn trying to park, I felt like I was on an easter egg hunt - there were no open spots to be found.    I searched high and low and finally found a spot.\n\nThe stress increased my appetite.  Apparently I was stressed because I ate a lot.\n\nI was quickly seated and noticed every table was almost filled.\n\nI ordered the Penne and Vodka Sauce - I added Chicken.    I ordered the meal and was offered wedding or bean soup.   I jump on the bean soup because it sounded pretty good.\n\nEverything was cooked perfectly.   The soup beans were not overcooked with generous vegetables and chunks of ham.\n\nThe Penne was perfectly cooked - the pasta held the sauch and kept it shaped.   The sauce had very good flavor.   The chicken cooked perfectly as well (I know why this place gets good reviews).   It was all covered with Parmasean cheese and a half of loaf of italian bread.\n\nI am stuffed now.  I cannot eat any more until I gaze up and see the card on top of the holder of seasonings (salt and pepper).    They list what seems to be 12 different pies.    Understanding the importance of a thorough review and PIE,  I decided to be a team player and forgo my calorie \/ weight watcher point counting and ordered the pie.\n\nI cannot describe the pie but can tell you this.   I will come back to the restaurant and order the pie.   I did take a picture.  The picture was blurry.  This was due to the sugar coursing thru my veins like a super hero - okay that may be a little over the top but it was really good.\n\nEnjoy this litte gem - the previous Yelpers were correct.\n\nFood: - Vodka Penne Meal with Chicken (comes with Soup or Salad) - $15, Pie - $3.50\n\nAtmosphere - very crowded but on the nicer side.   It was okay - I woudl take family there but not a date (just saying).\n\nService - Very friendly and quick.   My waitress provided good suggestions and was very helpful.   I did notice an older waitress that knows many people there not so friendlly - she reminded me of Flo from Alice \n\nI will be back - Enjoy!
