The Porcupine Tree\/Bigelf gig was a sublime progfest. A great time was had by myself and my old friend and fellow musichound Dan. However, I'd like to make a suggestion.\n\nThey really need to lay this place out a little better. It got tiring dodging people as they made their way to and from the bar. The snack bar says \"EAT DINNER HERE\" but can one really do that?  There's really no room. Maybe the snack bar should be in the back somewhere. \n\nAlso, considering how loud the shows are and how hard it is for the bartenders to hear you, they should perhaps put in a touchscreen ordering system like they have at Sheetz and Get N Go. Just a thought.\n\nIt's still an incredible venue though. I'm appreciating this church of noise all the more.\n\nAnd no sticky floors this time. \\m\/
