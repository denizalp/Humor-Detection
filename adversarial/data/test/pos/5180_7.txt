Scramble is locally owned, and a fresh, delicious, fast casual concept. \n\nOrder at the counter, grab a number and wait for your food to be brought out.\n\nOh, and you can enjoy a Bloody Mary or Mimosa if it's that kind of day.\n\nWe dropped in for a quick breakfast on the way over to Shane Co. to check on my wedding bands. \n\nKept it simple and shared a Southwest Burrito ($10.49) with the avocado on the side and hold the jalape√±o cream cheese. \n\nThis came with a side of hashbrowns, and we also got a side of Applewood Bacon ($3.69) \n\nThe eggs in the burrito were nice and fluffy and thankfully not overcooked, and the chorizo had a nice zing to it. \n\nQuick, filling breakfast! \n\nI would definitely drop back in for a bite again when in the area.
