If you need to get some body work or some non computerized repairs, and don't want to pay an arm and a leg, this is the place. Martin the owner will tell you straight up how much and sticks to it. He has even looked at my brakes which a certain tire chain advised me need to be changed immediately, were in fact were fine. The only drawback is there is not much to do in the area if you have to wait for repairs. But paying a good chunk less than what you would normally is worth the small inconvenience unless you are a ferret with ADD and extra cash you do not need.
