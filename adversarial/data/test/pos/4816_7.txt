I don't understand why this place is popular.  The food was bad and the service was bad.  I ordered a burger medium well and got it medium rare.  After sending it back and getting another it was still medium\/medium rare but I was too hungry to send it back again and lost all faith in their cooks.  I think they served it on the same plate with the same cold fries as before.  My friend ordered a breakfast dish and it was terrible.  The scrambled eggs were so overcooked they were hard and rubbery, the potatoes were very undercooked, and the biscuit was dry and literally had no flavor.  None.  The service seriously lacked as well.  No one was unfriendly, just incompetent.\n\nWe thought the dessert would redeem them but after paying so much for a single slice of cheesecake we couldn't even finish it.  One slice was dried out and the other cheesecake had too much sour cream - it was actually mushy and very sour, almost spoiled tasting.\n\nBottom line, I found this place to be mediocre at best, and that's being generous. There's tons of better restaurants in the area and in the city.  Never going back, and I think the food has made me ill.
