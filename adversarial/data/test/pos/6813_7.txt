This location is really convenient if you're done with class and want to settle for some good food and cheap beers. This is also located near the Kiss mini putt putt if you're trying to take someone on a cheap date. \n\nI definitely receive my money's worth here, especially for it being a non AYCE Korean BBQ restaurant. The service is fast and friendly. The food is consistently delicious and you really can't beat the happy hour deals. I actually spent less money here for two people than if we were to go to any other AYCE. The pork belly and bulgolgi are really tender and even with a slight char from the grill, they never got overcooked.
