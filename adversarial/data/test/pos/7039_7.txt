We woke up this morning feeling like a celebratory breakfast was in order, considering the positive outcome of the Presidential election last night! It seemed like the perfect time to try eat, downtown's newest chef-driven hotspot. I'm happy to say that chef Natalie Young's restaurant fully met my expectations, and the waitstaff seemed slightly more friendly than anticipated. I noticed mixed reviews of the service, but I'm guessing that Romney's loss put everyone in a good mood!\n\nCrosby, Stills, Nash & Young was playing when we arrived, and Tony Hsieh was dining at a table in the front corner of the restaurant that I will assume is reserved for him. The soundtrack continued with the 60s\/70s folk theme, which suited me just fine! Choosing between the creative egg dishes and scrambled tofu on the breakfast menu was tough, but I was most interested in the truffled egg sandwich. Served on a buttery croissant (presumably from Chocolate & Spice, like the other pastries served at eat), the sandwich featured a flavorful melted cheese, perfectly scrambled eggs, sauteed wild mushrooms, and a side of tasty breakfast potatoes. I won't be surprised when I see one of those Food Network \"stars\" describing this dish as The Best Thing They Ever Ate, as it is certainly worthy of the praise. My request to leave the bacon off the sandwich was granted without attitude. The wild mushroom mix likely included some pesky shiitakes, but they were tastefully prepared.\n\nI love the feel of this restaurant and can't wait to return to sample the huevos motulenos and explore the lunch menu. My only complaint would be the difficulty of obtaining a coffee refill, but I'm not inclined to subtract a star for that.
