We were in Vegas recently and were excited to see Jennifer Lopez in her \"All I Have\" concert at the Zappos Theater in Planet Hollywood (PH).  No having been to Vegas in about six years, I remembered the theater called PH Live. I realized the theater has since been renamed The Axis and then to the current name Zappos Theater in 2018.\n\nArriving at 7:30 at the north entrance on Las Vegas Blvd of PH, we along with other concert goers had a little difficulty in locating the theater.  After going up to level 2, we lost souls wound ourselves back to the main level and saw a queue and a person in line said this was the waiting line for JLo.  We got in line until a worker walked the line and said tickets holders can proceed directly to the front for entrance. With our tickets in hand, we headed to the entrance security check before heading inside.  In the lobby, there are exhibits of JLo's stunning dresses.\n\nThe two level theater has two levels and our seats were located mid-orchestra center in 103.  Seats gave a great view of the stage.  JLo put on an entertaining concert incorporating her great dancing into her one hour fifty minutes performance.  The theater was nice and staff were friendly. Yes, there was renovations going on in the concert entrance area, which might have caused some confusion in finding the theater. Otherwise, it was an enjoyable show and experience.
