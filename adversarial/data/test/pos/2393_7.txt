Like many have said before me, I think the historical factor is what keeps this place open (well and the college kids) but I digress.\n\nJust your typical hot dog shop. Honestly nothing special about it. Fries aren't very good either. Pretty much like fries you could get anywhere else. $4 for an ok hot dog seems absolutely crazy to me. The service is terrible as well. It's like none of them want to be there.
