We went to the Charcoal Room last weekend for dinner. \n\nOur evening started with lackluster bar service. I suppose I expected a higher quality of bar service for what we were about to pay for dinner and not a woman with the sniffles, inappropriate tattoos for a steak house environment and a bad attitude. \n\nWe were able to place our order with the waitress within 5 minutes of being seated. About 10 minutes later our food was brought out to us. This surprised me since our steaks were ordered medium well and well done but the presentation of our dinner was beautiful. \n\nSteak is a strange creature. So many people like it prepared so many different ways. What one sees as medium well another sees as rare, what one sees at medium another seems as well done. The chefs at the Charcoal Room must have 20\/20 vision as they did an amazing job with our steaks and they were delicious. \n\nThe plan was to stay and have two glasses of wine with a decadent dessert but that plan was thwarted by the earlier experience with the bartender. Maybe I should thank her. Due to her attitude we saved an extra $30 on the bill and had desert at home in bed.
