Wow. For real for real Tanzy's service, the food, the people have been nothing but extraordinary. \n\nThis is one of the best events I have ever been to. The food set up with the chef creating custom mozzarella balls and the 6 different salt options with the oils was amazing. \n\nThe charcuterie, the meatballs, the cheeses, and can't forget the drinks were all phenomenal. \n\nIt doesn't stop there, they hosted us the movie \"first man\" if you have never been here they have the real deal stadium tile dating in HUGE leather recliners. \n\nIt gets better. They had cookies (amazing) and speciality drinks waiting for us at the chairs when we sat down. This is crazy. Crazy good. Then during the previews they brought us out popcorn. This is ELITE service and they did it right. So thankful I got invited to this one. I had a fantastic time.
