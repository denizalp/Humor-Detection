So I had a baby. Well I didn't give birth to a baby, but you know what I mean. \n\nThe facility was clean, the nurses were super nice and our nurse delivered a beautiful 8 pound little porker. The doctor was pretty comedic, switching from Panther season ticket talk to, \"push, push, push\" to \"I couldn't go to today's game,\" to  \"push, push, push\". Quite entertaining I must say. \n\nLabor wasn't that bad!
