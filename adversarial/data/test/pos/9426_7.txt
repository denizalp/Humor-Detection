Really fun place to come enjoy a hot-dog, fries or poutine. I must admit that I really do enjoy their hot dogs. Ask for all-dressed because the slaw they put on it is quite different then anywhere I've eaten so far. The fries are the real deal-delicious! Hmmm...Hmmm...Hm! The place itself is very kitschy and I have all the right touch that reminds me of those warm night in Virginia beach or in Florida. Keep in mind that this is a cash only place. There is a cash machine on site for you to withdraw some money.
