Food was bland. Had the Salmon spaghetti? Literally was spaghetti in a bland watery cream sauce with salmon teriyaki on top. At least the salmon was good. Also got the rose milk tea which tasted awful it was sour? I don't think rose milk tea should be sour as I get it often at Cup O House. The sweet potato fries were alright but is nothing special. Would rather the ones at Hot Star. Took a sip of the regular milk tea and \"honey\" oolong which tasted like dim sum tea with sugar. I know there is the honey oolong option on the menu but their order sticker doesn't say so. Maybe they messed up? I don't recommend the watery cream sauce spaghetti. Perhaps other food is better.
