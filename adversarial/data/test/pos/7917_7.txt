Not worth all the hype. I went here before and didn't really enjoy it. When I got home and finished the pizza it tasted way better. I had it to go the next day because I enjoyed it so much and again I gave it time to cool off and at it.. It was only average. Here we are a few months later I decided to order delivery and even after waiting a while the pizza was still horrible. It was so bland and the sauce was weird. There was so much cheese on it but again it didn't taste like anything. I'm so disappointed and upset that I wasted $15 on this. I only give it two stars because of the convenience of delivery.
