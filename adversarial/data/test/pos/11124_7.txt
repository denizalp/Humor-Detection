The food's ok. Nothing extravagant, and with all the other great burger joints around nowadays, its really nothing to write home about. Average, ok taste, etc.  \nThe service though? Completely different story. Johnny (or the likes of that old jerk) has no business working in an industry that requires any form of customer service. I understand that he's been around for a long time and has established a good customer base over the years, etc, but try going  into a place  that offers great food and even better customer service and is actually welcoming instead of North End where you are treated like dirt just because old Johnny thinks he can (and because he's been allowed to get away with it for all these years). Move over with your piss poor nasty attitude Johnny! Shake Rabble and Roll, and even Pete's Big Bite blow  you right out of the water (food-wise, and service-wise). With all the local competitors we have now, an attitude adjustment should be considered.
