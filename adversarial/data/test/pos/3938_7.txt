The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame was a fun and informative experience. They have many artifacts and historical items to view. There are also lots of multi-media presentations to enjoy.  This museum begins with the story of the roots of rock and roll and ands with a exhibit on Rolling Stone magazine.  Located right on the Lake Erie shorefront. There are also other attractions in the area. Highly recommend.
