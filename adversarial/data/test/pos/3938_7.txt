No .   Never again . Horrible !   \nFirst !   They tell you that they don't accept debit card and they point to circle k outside the window and tell you to go take out money there .\nSecond !  All they play is really loud Spanish religious music .  \nThird !  The couple that run the place are of course salvadoreans in their early 60s .... Rude as hell . \nThe lady has no manners and talks to you like your stupid .  \nLast but not least ... the food.   The food was alright . \nNothing to brag about . \nNo thank you. Never again.
