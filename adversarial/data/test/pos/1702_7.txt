I was excited to try this restaurant even though this specific location has seen quite a few restaurants that have come and gone over the years however with the rave reviews I saw on their Facebook page I had to give them a try. I visited this restaurant on a Friday night and it was fairly busy given that it was a Friday (no one cooks on Friday right?). The place itself is small, there are about 4 tables if you want to sit down to eat so I really think this is more of a pick up your order and go spot. All the tables were full and a huge party actually came in which what looked like the intentions to sit down and eat however when they noticed that all the tables were taken they left. Now let's talk about the experience....I was able to order fairly quickly. I ordered the I Love Seafood (crag legs, shrimp, corn, potato, beef smoked sausage) and Chili Dog basket (2 hot dogs and fries). We sat down to wait because they were fairly busy (looked like only 2 cooks were in the back and then the cashier taking orders) and I knew this was not a fast food location. We waited for 30 minutes before our order was ready. To me 30 minutes is a long time (not to mention it was TGIF) so I was ready to go home. With that said I think they need to improve their wait time or next time I will just call my order in ahead of time. Now let's get to the food. I couldn't wait to get home to try a fry (like who does?) so I tried one in the car and it was hot fresh out the grease. So my mouth is watering all the way home....could we finally have a winner in this location I said to my boyfriend. I got home and first tried the hot dogs and they were very good. I'm funny about my chili but I thought it tasted homemade and fresh. My boyfriend had the Seafood platter but of course I tried everything and it was delicious. I haven't tried Seafood Connection yet but based on what I have seen from that restaurant Rosie's seafood platter is similar to what they have yet cheaper. Final outcome, I will definitely be back. They have some pretty good specials during the week too if you really don't want to cook but don't want to spend a lot of money. More restaurants such as this is needed in this area however they just need to work on getting food out faster and perhaps consider expanding their sit down area.
