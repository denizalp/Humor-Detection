I boarded my fur baby here while vacationing in Vegas. I was very impressed with the non kennel environment and loved my baby having his own room and not being stuck in a kennel. He was here ten days and was groomed and ready to go when I arrived. This is the first time I have ever boarded him when he did not lose weight during time away from me. I will definitely, return.
