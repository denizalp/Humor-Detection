Terrible experience! Went in for a simple polish change for my fingernails and toe nails. The gentleman rushed thru polishing my fingernails. When we got to my toenails he wouldn't take off my Stuart Weitzman gladiator sandals. Instead he insisted he complete my polish change with them on. I argued with him, then gave in as he insisted that I trust him.... He got pure acetone on my sandals and removed the dye. My sandals are ruined! $500 sandals down the drain. To make matters worse he never apologized instead he said he didn't know. Even though he ruined my sandals, I still was asked to pay for my polish change. \n\nI paid and would have paid but the right thing to do was to at least make me feel as if ruining my personal belongings mattered to them. \n\nI'll never go back! A $14 polish change cost me $500 sandals. Simply because the nail Technician was lazy and wanted to rush thru my job.  Extremely disappointed in my experience here.
