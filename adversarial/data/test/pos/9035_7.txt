So here i am walking down the street with one of my best buds. We were looking for somewhere to eat while i had work done on my car. I read the name of Assads Bakery as we passed it on the opposite side of the street. We never really considered it an option so we didnt think what of it. It was raining out side i had no hood on and i wanted a bite to eat. After a short burst of wind this amazing fragrant smell hit the air. It smelled of bread butter and ethnic seasonings! It was at this moment when we knew we had to cross the street and locate that smell. I felt like toucan Sam following my nose past a bar or two. As we got closer to the bakery we knew that was where we were going to eat. \n\nWhen we first went in the store instantly reminded us of some of the hybrid bakery stores with hot food in New York City. Coming here for the first time we weren't really sure where to order. The chef bursting in smells was fairly quit until he asked us what we wanted. I decided on the Chicken Shawarma and ny buddy the beef. He also got a dozen falafel's and paired it with some of cheapest baklava we have ever purchased. \n\nThe cashier was the sweetest elderly woman with a keen sense of humor that was very welcoming. We decided to eat in the cramped store with seating tables and groceries geared toward people originating in the Middle Eastern countries. The store was filled with laughter of people speaking in a language i found unfamiliar but i could tell they were all liie family to one another.
