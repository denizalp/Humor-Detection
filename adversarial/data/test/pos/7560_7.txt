After sampling several donut shops around town. This one is the best! The classics are great. Simplicity is a great indicator of quality and taste. The \"gourmet\" ones are not too over the top and they taste as good as they look. This is a problem with other shops offering extravagant, gourmet donuts that do not taste that great. Glaze doughnuts nails it! \n\nThe donuts here remind me of Krispy Kreme, but better! It's thicker, but not heavy. The glaze is truly amazing! Don't get me started on the donut holes. You can't have just one, two, or three. Just throw moderation out the door. \n\nFinally, a place that can make a glazed green tea donut. The matcha taste is very obvious and pairs well with the pistachios. \n\nI love purple drinks\/desserts AKA taro or ube! I was stoked to see a taro glazed donut with toasted coconut sprinkles. I enjoyed the overall taste, but it was shy on taro flavor and prominent on the coconut flavor. \n\nGreat donut shop, with excellent customer service!\n\n*****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge*****\n25\/100
