I really wish I could give Hyatt Regency Montreal a better review than 2 stars. This hotel is very centrally located but they dropped the ball in so many ways. We asked for an upgraded room and after we checked in we found out that it was a basic room but we were tired and just deal with it. The toilet overflowed so I called and let the desk know. We can back two hours later and no one had taken care of it. The refrigerator made a lot of noise and did not cool properly. So I had to unplug the refrigerator in the middle of the night. When I pulled it out to unplug it there was so much dust and dirt it was hard to believe. The next day they just plugged in the same refrigerator (did not fix or replace it!) and it happened again with the noise and what really surprised me is they still did not clean all the dust. The list actually goes on(: It really seems like this hotel is mismanaged and one person does not communicate with the others in the departments. When I come back to Montreal I will not be staying here again, They did compensate me for the overcharge on the room after I left. Hey Hyatt get your act together because this place needs to be checked out from the top down!
