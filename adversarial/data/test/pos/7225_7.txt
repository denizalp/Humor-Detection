I got The Billionaire and some Asian themed dog- the name of which escapes me. The dogs and the toppings themselves were great, however it seemed like they used cheap store bought buns unbecoming of a dog at that price. \n\nWorth a try if you've never had foie gras on a hot dog, but they have room to improve - especially for the price.
