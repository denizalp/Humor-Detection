*Im so excited! And I just can't hide it, Im about to lose control and I think I like it!!!*\n\nThis was the song I was singing as we were walking into this place to have dinner! I was honestly super duper excited to try this place after I read all of my fellow yelper's reviews! This place is odd but in a cool way, it's a grocery store and a small restaurant. The store offers a variety of Italian food\/ingredients along with random tables set around the store, so if you choose to stay and eat you can literally have a seat anywhere.\n\nI was looking forward to a known Italian dish, the chicken parmesan and my friend ordered the baked ziti. It does take a little while for your food to come out, but because this was my first time here I had no problem looking around through the store and enjoying observing people (I like to people watch) as we waited. We ordered the meals so we received our main dish along with salad and Italian bread. The salad was small, basic and simple nothing really exciting there; the Italian bread was crispy and had a lot of flavor to it, for they seasoned it well. Now unfortunately when it came to my dish of chicken parmesan I was quite disappointed! The chicken was super dry and the sauce was really watery! Because of the sauce being so watery the whole meal lost A TON of flavor. When you have thick marinara sauce that covers the pasta and the chicken you get an abundance of flavor from the sauce, spices, chicken and noodles. I was really hoping for some authentic mouth watering chicken parm and my tummy was sad to get....... a mediocre dish. When I tasted it I immediately thought.... we should have gone to Olive Garden for their chicken parm! Now on the other hand I was able to have a few bites of my friend's baked ziti and that was to die for! The noodles were cooked perfectly, the sauce, the meat, the spices, the cheese.... mmmmmmm everything in the baked ziti was delicious! So many flavors, so thick and creamy, I wanted to trade my chicken parm in for an order of baked ziti!\n\nI have mixed feelings about this place from not liking my meal to enjoying my friend's meal! I may go back and try other things on their menu just to give it another whirl, but I will be going somewhere else when I am on a chicken parm kick!
