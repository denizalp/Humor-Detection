Forget nightclubs. Dayclubs is where it's at and WET REPUBLIC is the ONLY place you'll find me ;) \n\nTons of fun, tons of opportunity to socialize and really just talk to groups of people from all over the world. I love Wet Republic for their amazing DJs. This time around I saw Calvin Harris. \n\nDrinks are expensive around $40 for the 32 ounce which has 4 shots, but I found my favorite bartender and he hooked me up the entire time. He put about 10 shots in mine with a splash of Red Bull. I swear to you by the time Calvin Harris was gone, so was I lmao jk also they later had a 2 drink special for 1\/2 off. I'm not sure if they offer this to everyone, but we got 2 big drinks for ~$60.\n\nIf you're not on the guest list or even if you are, as a guy you can easily spend between $100-$200. But it's completely worth it because you get to watch a world class DJ, party with probably the best looking pool crowd in all of Vegas, and find groups to party with later on the night! \n\nSkip the nightclub and come to Wet Republic on Saturdays. It's definitely worth it $$
