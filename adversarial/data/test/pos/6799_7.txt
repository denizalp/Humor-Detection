The only reason to check this place out is for its historic value.  \n\nI stopped by for two milk shakes to go and it took over 20 minutes for the girls to make the shakes and then another 5 plus minutes just to check out.  \n\nThey were not busy... just scatter brained, inattentive, and oblivious.\n\nSweet kids work here but the SERVICE IS AWEFUL. They need a manager to keep everyone focused.  \n\n I was charged just over 11 dollars for 2 shakes... not sure if that was correct but I paid this balance as all I wanted to do was leave.  If you decide to trying this place out... have zero expectations.
