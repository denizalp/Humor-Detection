The staff was RUDE! Going to the doctors is NO fun to begin with and then dealing with the front desk that don't show any customer service makes it that much harder. I left feeling as though I had been ripped off and threw 50 bucks out the window. I will never go back to that practice. I left the practice in tears on how I was treated.
