On the one hand, major hotel\/casinos all resemble each other.  On the other, there are definitely some slight nuances.  Over the years I think I've stayed at every major Strip hotel.\n\nI just didn't connect with the Cosmo.  For a newer venue it feels dated, the casino is dark.  There's no poker!\n\nTheir food venues are a cut above those at the Aria: big props for housing the Egg Slut.\n\nI'm getting older so Palazzo, Encore, Venetian, or Bellagio for me.
