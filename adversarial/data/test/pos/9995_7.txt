In protest of the lousy service that I've experienced at the Go For Tea in Scarborough, I decided to drive a bit further to their Richmond Hill location.  I do not mind driving the distance if it means that I'm less irritated on my way home about the horrible food experience.\n\nThis location is much bigger, although parking is not as plentiful as the Scarborough counterpart and you have to compete with patrons who share the lot with a plaza that is also home to a Baton Rouge.  \n\nI ended up scoring a sweet parking spot that I am surprised was not reserved as a Handicap spot because of its proximity to the front entrance, but I shall shut up and count my blessings!\n\nWe were promptly seated.  It appears that the employees hired at this location have a working knowledge on their English.  About 2 minutes after we were seated, our server came by to take our order.\n\nI ordered a Honey Green Tea to nurse my undying cough, and Boyfriend ordered the Coffee Milk Tea.  \n\nWe lingered for about another hour longer after we finished our respective drinks, and I was surprised when a server brought us glasses of water.  \n\nFor once, I can say that I have found a bubble tea establishment that has quality service worth mentioning.  \n\nThey also do not set a password on their wi-fi which means that you can start surfing the moment you walk in the door.  The Scarborough location requires a password... I could crack a Scarborough joke, but I really don't think I need to add to the list of ever-growing Scarborough jokes that already exist.
