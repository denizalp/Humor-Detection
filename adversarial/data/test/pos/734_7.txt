I would give it a half star if that was possible. The hotel smells like my dearly departed Grandma's house since she smoked Virginia Slims for about 40 years. The entire hotel even the rooms is saturated with cigarette smoke. I'm a smoker and it was making me gag and cough! \n\nMy sister had the bright idea to stay here on her last trip and tried to get me to stay in her room. I woke up in the middle of the night trying to catch my breath because I felt like I smoked a carton of Pall Malls! I had to leave and go home around 4 a.m. wondering if they have ever cleaned the vents. \n\nThe next day I went back for more abuse and humored my sister by eating this piss poor excuse of a buffet with her. All 4 in our group had  IBS attacks and were literally tripping each other to get to the restroom because we all had projectile diarrhea! I wondered if it was food poisoning or E-Coli that would be responsible for my demise. We all literally had sore stomachs and flaming hot nether regions! \n\nIf you're looking for a good detox or going through a self loathing \"What have I got to live for?\" phase then this is your place! Bon apetite!
