Meh =Indifference; one simply does not care.  \n\nI did feel bad (just a bit) for Rose from Ireland who apparently came in not expecting to be called out by the female bartenders.  When she did not want to come over to take a free shot straight from an upended bottle she got a lecture on the finer points of...acts of...oral...uh...broadcast over the sound system and ran out of the saloon with the crowd chanting \"Rose!...Rose!\"\n\nOh well.  Welcome to Vegas.\n\nKeep in mind this is really just a wannabe rowdy-raunchy bar and not a hip dance club.
