Don't sleep on the rocket...salad that is. Yes, Skybox has a surprisingly delicious and generous arugula salad that I would definitely order again to get my green fix! It's a nice casual spot with multitudes of tvs for your sport viewing. We stopped in for a late night dine because we wanted something quick and simple. Service was great. I had the chicken enchiladas as my main entree, and I wouldn't order them again. I happened to be craving enchiladas, and they were ok. However, they were the type of enchiladas that come with black olives on top, which is a bit of a warning sign. I also sampled my husband's wings which he requested to be tossed in BBQ, and they were darn good. I would recommend that menu mod. Overall, a solid go-to if you need something quick on the Aria casino floor, but it is for the most part standard bar fare, except for the rocket.
