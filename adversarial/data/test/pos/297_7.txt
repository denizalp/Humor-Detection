You know on Top Chef S06 when Robin was like \"ooh I'm so inspired by all this beautiful Chihuly glasswork I just want to cook something way beyond the scope of my capabilities but still incredibly banal\" and you were like \"ugh why is Robin still on this show - go home!\"? \n\nThat reminded me that the Chihuly glasswork in the Bellagio is an irritating example of the dangers inherent in mixing bad taste and extravagance. It's less a knock on Chihuly than Wynn, who commissioned the work, and have you seen the Wynn? It's batshit insane.  Much like a bottle of Beringer white zin for $32.\n\nAnyway, never been a fan of fiori di como, but you know, de gustibus non est disputandum. That's my thing.
