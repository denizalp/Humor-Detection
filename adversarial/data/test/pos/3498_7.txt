We \"discovered\" this place last Friday, and planned our Sunday just so we'd have a reason to drop by again. \n\nIt's a little slow, and it might take a few minutes for anyone to acknowledge you, but the food is worth it. When we were there on Sunday, they even had fresh chickpeas! Have you ever had a fresh chickpea? There is a reason the saying, \"two chickpeas in a pod\" does not exist, because chickpeas live lonely lives in their individual pods. \n\nAlso, my dear Yelp friend PW gave this place 5 stars (actually, everyone who has reviewed this place has, which should tell you something) and he has great taste. Celebrity endorsement!
