I was drawn to this place because of the photos they have on their windows of their bagel sandwiches.  I finally found the time to stop by for breakfast and wasn't disappointed.  The lady working the counter was super sweet and patient with me while I debated a nova lox or egg, ham and cheese... the latter won.  I wasn't disappointed.  The sandwich was moist and delish... a lot better than Einstiens.
