Roulette Tables FTW !!!\n\n- Food spots - limited and were an average of 'C' ratings.\n\n- Service - OMG ! How long does it take to get a drAnk here while you play ??! We decided to bail out after waiting for what seemed like an hour.\n\n- Roulette tables FTW ! I think I said that already !\n\nWould I go back ??! For the $10 minimum roulette tables YES ! Anything else, sadly no. They do have awesome rooms next door at PH Towers, but that's a separate review. \n\nAll 4 stars are for..YOU GUESSED IT !!! Roulette Tables FTW !!! Sorry, I was that into it ! My new found go-to Vegas game ! Thanks to my entourage for introducing me to it ! RAWR !
