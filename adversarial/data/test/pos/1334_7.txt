This is an absolutely wonderful place for children.  My son is 5 and has been going here for a couple years now.  All the teachers are just wonderful.  I was trying to figure out if all day kindergarten was a good idea but a chat with Ms. Ann cleared that right up.  As she explained, they do not just watch kids, they teach.  Lots of reading and learning goes on, but plenty of fun too!  They make crafts, read books, do projects, watch movies, and there's a wonderful outdoor playground.  \n\nThe price is quite reasonable and they watch the kids all day, whereas \"all day\" kindergarten for example is barely six hours.  My son often comes home with new info such as math or in particular, learning the state capitols.  Turns out he did not learn that stuff in public school!\n\nSo as far as \"daycare\" goes I am sure most people want something affordable, safe, and perhaps a place that likes children and helps them grow and learn.  This is all of that.  If you are considering daycare at all you owe it to yourself to at least visit a Learning Tree and see what you think!
