Whenever I'm out of town and time permits, I have to try a local burger joint. This is where I ended up during my 4 day trip to Chandler, AZ (work training). I walked in around 6pm on a Monday night and the place was pretty empty. The gal working the register asked me and my buddy if it was our first time to which we replied \"Yes\". She then grabbed a couple of fries and drizzled their special sauce on them and gave them to us to sample. Two thumbs up for the sauce!\n\nI ordered the (beef) BBQ M.O.S. with grilled onions on a brioche bun and some fries. The burger is served pre-sliced in two halves. This helps with the presentation of their \"stuffed burgers\". I can dig it. After taking my first bite I was convinced that this place has a good concept going with these stuffed burgers. My buddy ordered the (beef) caprese and he was thoroughly satisfied as well.\n\nI would definitely recommend this spot to anyone craving a reasonably priced, fresh & juicy burger. I will definitely come back and try something else on their menu when I'm in town again. \n\nMy only gripe: the fries are whatever. They aren't horrible -- I just wasn't impressed.
