This location has come a long way since it first opened. I stopped coming here for several months because they were always getting my order wrong and this always happened in the drive-thru and never inside. After some time went by I decided to give them another try after I received some coupons in the mail and figured I'd go inside and eat since previously I had no luck in the drive-thru getting the right order. My order was not only correct when I went inside, but tasted really good and when it's good like that, I hardly remember that I am in a fast food joint. I've been back several times and they accept the coupons I present with no problem and even my order has been correct when going through the drive-thru. Problem is consistency. Sometimes It's hot, fresh and tasty while on occasion the chicken is on the colder side. \n\nOriginal Pollo Bowl ($5) - This is the best value on the menu currently. Get it as a combo (still $5 even if you don't want the combo) and it comes with a small drink and side of hot tortillas. The bowl as fire-grilled chicken, onions, beans, rice, cilantro and pico. Filling and affordable! \n\nUltimate Double Tostada Salad ($7.49) - When you feel like something more filling and with a few more extras, this should do this trick. This one has all the same things the original pollo bowl has, but the chicken is double in portion and with the addition of shredded cheese, sliced avocado and sour cream it's really good. The creamy cilantro dressing is very good!!! All this goodness is put inside a crunchy tostada shell that doesn't taste bad either. \n\nThey have Cherry Coke from the fountain and drinks are free refills if you are eating inside. One improvement this location could make is not running out of chicken. I have stopped by between 6:30 - 8 pm and they have been out of chicken for the night. Not sure what's up with that, but when chicken is the main ingredient and you are out of it by dinner time yet staying open until 11 pm or later only serving rice and beans... well that is crazy.
