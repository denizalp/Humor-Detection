Do you want a career in bartending? Are you looking for an exciting course that'll leave you job ready and confident in your abilities? \n\nIf so DO NOT go here.\n\nI signed up for the course with a college friend, hoping to have a good time and maybe get a part time bartending jobs afterwards,\nThis was definitely NOT the course for us\n\nThe TIB did not teach many hands on skills and to put it simply,\nit was just boring as all hell.\n\n\nThe course itself has so much potential, from the beginning they preach\n\"a mixologist makes your drink, a bartender makes your night\"\nhm, though provoking.\n\nBut nope, instead buckle up for hour after hour of reading boring facts off a paragraph filled powerpoint looking like something straight off of wikipedia.\n\n\nYou might be thinking 'Well wait a minute, you get to practice in a real bar setting, optimal for job training right?'\nWell, you're only behind the bar maybe 20minutes each day. The other hours are spent sitting in front of the bar getting spoon fed the shitty power points.\n\nThe course is literally at least 85% boring history lessons and If I wanted to spend three hours on the in depth history of Gin I would've fucking googled it.\n\nA good bartender should know the history, sure.\nbut everything in moderation. its very clear that they cram as much bullshit material into the powerpoints as they can.\n\nMost classes had tastings. Maybe the quality of alcohol wasnt very good, or it was the selection, or maybe the amounts were too stingy but all the students had trouble tasting anything at all. We'd eventually catch up on keywords \"fruity, like wheat, or mahogany\". It was clear everyone was winging it and its unfortunate the tastings weren't experienced properly.\n\nSmelling the different ingredients in wine and trying to identify them was great, i must admit\n\nWe were located in a smaller side bar beside a regular bar with regular customers during the evening. You could constantly hear whats going on beside us and the noise was distracting. \n\nthe instructors i had were first alex and then stephanie \n\nduring what i considered the most valuable part of each class (the 20minute drink making session), neither instructor guided us, or made sure we had proper technique.\nBoth of them immediately neglected their job and took it as an opportunity to stop lecturing, play some music, and look at their phones. \nWhen you had to ask them something, it always felt as if they were preoccupied.\n\nalex was nice, a good socializer, and an even better entertainer. \nit was great to watch someone act like a bartender youknow?\ntelling stories, making puns, and playfully flirting.\n\nhe just kept on flirting with one of the students though. Day after day to the point where she became clearly uncomfortable with him and just sucked up his flirting anyways.\nYou pushed it bro. \nHe also drifted off waay topic constantly, but i cant blame him. the material was garbage and it was much more enjoyable hearing his stories about scotland.\n\n\nstephanie was rude, \nher passive-agressive managerial teaching style was very annoying. She was fun for a bit, and then would say things word for word like \"ugh, you're useless.\" or \"look at you, you're a mess.\" On our first day with her she even shit talked the other instructor, Alex.\n\"Alex is an idiot.\" \nOh, your co-worker? The guy we just paid for? \n\nOverall it felt like we worked for her, she was bossy and rude.\n\n\nThere was more to the TIB, but im sure you get the point.\n\nThis couse is only worthwhile for the boring middle aged woman bookworm who wants to have a few friends over and slowly whip up a couple drinks. \n\"Did you know beer is the 3rd most consumed beverage in the world?\" \nWoahh thats so cool!\n\nHah, What a joke
