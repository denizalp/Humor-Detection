A charming spot across the street from a sweet parc. Customers here are well dressed. One looks like an experimental dancer in form-fitting all black. Pony tails are also in evidence. There are subtle differences in the chairs - some black, some like in schoolhouses in the 1950s. I like the tiny grocery and OMG the cookies. Also: Talking Heads on the stereo. The experimental dancer and I are seat-dancing in time to it. A good place!
