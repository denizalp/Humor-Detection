I don't buy a lot of sports badged stuff. Other than what I have bought at a game I have come here for. All two times. :) The store has a lot of stuff but hardly any walking room and not an intuitive layout. Fortunately, after searching around, one of the staff asked if he could help and he took me to it and walked me through the options.
