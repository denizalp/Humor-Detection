Giving this fine establishment anything less than the requisite 5 stars would be tantamount to heresy of the highest order. I've been here countless times over the years. Most of those times have involved waiting in line to get in, as well as a loud and crowded restaurant on the inside. But, you know what? It never matters how busy they are or how boisterous the clientele-- they ALWAYS knock it out of the park. The food and drinks haven't been less than stellar on any occasion, nor the service anything but friendly. And, the most remarkable part? The food has ALWAYS come out in a timely manner. It's insane, considering the volume they experience on such a regular occasion. I swear to God, they must have robots working the kitchen they're so fast...\n\nAnyway, the short of it is this: Everything here rocks, it's totally worth your time, and if you somehow are in the area and don't stop by, do yourself a favor: put your right hand up in front of your face, palm-side facing you, and bring your face into your hand... Because you deserve it.
