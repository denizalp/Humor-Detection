my hubby and I used to go here a lot! we still do sometimes..he goes on cycle like there are  times we would dine in a certain restaurant for 3-4 times a week, and would do that for3 consecutive months. then we try another one, then go to another other places.. I actually like that idea so we don't get tired dining in the same place haha\nThis place is fun, they have  huge TV'S  all over the  wall..you can watch different types of Sports games..mainly sports are on the screen. But if you are not really a sports fanatic, \nyou'd definitely not be enjoying. There's some other options though. Like what we normally do is we both play Trivias. That's what we love doing when we come to this place! \nTalking about foods, they have good foods. Hubby and I both loves spicy chicken wings, but he loves to you really sauce on his wings, while I prefer just mild. Well we both don't drink, so prefer lemonade or soda. If you do, they have different varieties of liquors you can choose from at the bar. \nTheir service are good. \nThe reason why I'm giving them 4 stars, is that I don't like their bathroom. It's not that clean. I mean, you know ,when you go out to eat in a restaurant, cleanliness in the restroom is extremely important for me and a really big deal. It has to be clean. No tissues on the floor etc. \nWell that's the concern i have. \nAll other things are fine!
