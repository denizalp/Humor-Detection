3.5 stars. This place reminds me of cafes in Paris or something you'd find on the Champs Elysees. Watercolour imprints of rosepetals on the ceiling, beautiful d√©cor, hints of pink and gold. It was a wonderful setting for a girls night. On a Friday night, it was super busy - there were people on dates, groups of friends, suits who came straight from the office. Swanky, classy setting that doesn't disappoint when it comes to atmosphere (ironically, it's also located right across from the Hooter's on John St., hahah). \n\nFirst, the parking situation. Street parking is limited. There's a few parking garages and lots along Adelaide and around John St. you may want to consider, and it's also not too far of a walk from Union Station (about 12 minutes). \n\nSecond, the service. The hostesses are awfully rude, no question. No smiles, brusque tones, not welcoming at all. Really, really awkward. However, our experience totally improved with our actual server, Denisa, who was so sweet, accommodating, welcoming, and helpful. She may be an anomaly in terms of service here, but she made our experience better, and for this, we thank her!\n\nThird, the food. We ordered a large bulk of items and split it between the four of us: the house ricotta served on baked crostini was fine but very small in size, it's basically crackers and a small mini tray of ricotta with toppings (we got truffle honey with black pepper at $9.00 and figs, port and prosciutto at $8.00), the zucchini fritti (very good, probably my favourite part of the meal! Tasted like zucchini tempura at $11.00), the black kale with crispy garlic at $8.00 (it was fine, the kale was kind of limp), the Gnocchi at $17.00 (pretty good, tasty sauce, but I've had better), and the mushroom pizza at $19.00 (above average, quite tasty, not too doughy which I liked). \n\nOverall, we'd come back here for the atmosphere - the swanky environment is definitely its winning point. The food overall is a hit or miss with the hits being better than average (for me, the hits were the zuchinni fritti and pizza out of everything we had). We split our bill four ways, and for all that food, with tax and tip, my total was around $34.00.
