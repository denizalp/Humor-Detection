While waiting for a three hour service call for my car, I took the bus to the SLS and was greeted by the Perq right after entering the east doors.  I ordered a large iced coffee but I didn't get any pastries.  I just needed a caffeine jolt.\n\nThe drink was served quickly and I was on my way to the casino.  I drank the good coffee quickly.\n\nI'm giving this an A-OK rating because it was but I can't go higher unless I'd try something besides one plain iced coffee.  Convenient location in the SLS and the free wifi was zippy!
