Mid century furniture is supposed to be warm, welcoming, and approachable. Not here. Almost every piece of furniture had a sign on it: \"do not touch\" or \"do not sit\". It felt more like an overpriced museum. \n\nWhen I asked the owner about all the signs, she said \"I don't go to a luxury car dealership and sit in all the cars I can't afford. People who buy a really nice piece of furniture here don't want something that everyone has sat their butt on.\" I'll never waste my time there again.
