4.5 stars for a really solid restaurant on The Strip.\n\nAfter having a great experience at the Bethesda Mon Ami Gabi the previous week, I decided to look up Vegas location. After seeing that it was well reviewed and one of the most reviewed venues on The Strip on Yelp (wow!), I made lunch reservations to see if it could live up to the hype.\n\nMy wife and I arrived at the venue, which is literally located right across from the Bellagio fountains (what a view!), around 1pm on a Thursday. We were a little concerned that the inside of the restaurant was mostly empty, but understood why when we saw that the patio was absolutely packed (once again, the view). \n\nAfter sitting down at our table and getting a quick rundown of the venue from our solid server (apparently Mon Ami is one of the oldest restaurants on The Strip), we started looking over the menu (the venue only offers a dinner menu during lunch instead of a separate lunch menu). While the items were rather pricey compared to the Bethesda location, I learned over the course of my trip that the prices relative to the rest of The Strip were actually pretty good. \n\nAfter looking over the menu, my wife and I placed an order for a couple local beers to go along with my prime steak frites and my wife's duck order. The local beers were good and went along well with the standard baggette that is served as part of each table's set of meals. \n\nWhile it took a little while for our food to come out (due to the place being busy...be mindful if you are on a time crunch), it wasn't an unreasonable amount of time and the food was worth the wait. My prime steak frite (the Bordelaise version served in red wine sauce) was solid and the accompanying fries were excellent. However, the reason this review is 5 stars instead of 4 is my wife's duck. She orders duck quite often, and this duck (which was an appetizer!) was one of the best duck dishes she has ever eaten. The flavor was absolutely amazing and texture on point. Honestly, if this venue served the duck as an entree, it would probably become its best seller regardless of price. As the French say: C'est fameux!\n\nAfter finishing our meal, we then ordered one of Mon Ami's legendary Profiteroles. Unlike the lunch deal in Bethesda, ordering the Profiteroles here gets you 3 pieces! Each piece was absolutely excellent and combined to make a dessert worthy of both the money and being classified as French.\n\nOverall, the Vegas Mon Ami Gabi delivers on the hype. The amazing view of the Bellagio fountains combined with the amazing food make for a restaurant definitely worth checking out while you spend time on the Strip.
