Major disappointment! First of all, I requested a female to do my massage when I called to make my appt. When I got there I was told that there was only a male available. He reaked badly of cigarette smoke and made me nauseous. It was the worst and most horrible 90 minutes I've ever spent on a massage table. Then when I was paying I was pressured by the cashier to tip more than I was comfortable with. I'll never go back to this place nor will I ever suggest it to anyone.
