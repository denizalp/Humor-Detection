Who would have ever thought of inventing a cookie sandwich with ice cream in the middle. This place is delicious! We decided to have the white macadamia nut cookie with almond mocha ice cream.. I must say it is damn freaking good! It's too bad they are located on the west side of town but good news Henderson Yelpers! They are planning to open one soon on our side of town.. Now that is dangerous for my diet.. but who cares its worth it, you will be on cloud 9 for 10 minutes, try sweet addiction now for an orgasmic experience in your mouth!
