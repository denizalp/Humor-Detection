Was happy to find out that KoMex has a second location in Las Vegas!!  Have loved going to their original location ever since I started Yelping!!  First thing I noticed upon entering is that this restaurant is much bigger than the original.  Also, they have a bar here!  \n\nCame between lunch and dinner time so no fighting for a table!  Score!!  I am a fan of KoMex because they have good service, are affordably priced, and they make some of the best food anywhere!!\n\nFor our first visit to this new location, my wife ordered a breakfast entree.  Well, I do not recall the exact name of her entree.  I think it was some sort of breakfast dish.  I has the chance to try a couple of bites, and it was good.  \n\nI ordered my absolute favorite item of theirs.  The Bulgogi Nachos!!  Everything looked the same, but I did not quite get the same satisfaction this time around.  I was not wowed, but it was still very good.  Flavorful and filling.  Don't know what was missing from making it a completely gratifying experience.  Guess I'm used to patronizing their old locale. \n\nLook forward to making more trips here in the future whenever we travel to Vegas.  So convenient to have them closer to the Strip.  Korean Mexican Fusion dining doesn't get any better than visiting one of their restaurants.  Give them a try!  More than likely, you will not regret it!!
