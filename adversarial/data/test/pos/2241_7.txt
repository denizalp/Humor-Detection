To Bethany F. who posted the review last night. First off, my boyfriend and I were sitting right by you when the two of you made that scene last night. One of you claimed to be a \"personal chef\". I'm assuming that was your friend because you claim you are the \"biggest restaurant connoisseur\". If you knew anything about food or steaks for that matter you should know that if you order a steak medium well or more it dries out the steak and can make it tough. You should also know that a ribeye tends to be fatty. So my point is when you order a ribeye medium well, then complain to the server that there is gristle and the steak is tough you should know better. \nToo make it worse you wanted your meals for free, even after you continued to eat the steak. It takes a special kind of person to stoop that low. Good for the owner for standing up to you. \n\nP.S. My medium-rare ribeye was FANTASTIC!
