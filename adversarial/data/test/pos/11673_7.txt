Ah.  The ultimate Vegas playground for young adults.  I think older folks have a harder time keeping up with the 20yo's drinking, laughing, dancing, flexing, flirting, posing... did I mention drinking?  \n\nFortunately for me, I never grew up. [grin]\n\nHere's why the Hard Rock is the hotel for 20-somethings:\n\n1) THE POOL\n\"Jeezus Christ\":  Practice that phrase, boys, because once you hit the pool at opening @ 9AM, you're gonna be saying it a LOT as the ladies come out.  Welcome to the 8th wonder of the world, gentlemen.\n... CHAIRS:  You'll need to get a beach chair - preferrably one on the sand if you get there early enough.  Break out the suntan lotion & the shades and get ready for the show. (Thr\/Fri is the best)  And bring slippers - the ground is hot.\n(HINT:  $20 to a pool boy will reserve a beach chair for you the NEXT DAY between 10-11AM.)\n... BLACKJACK:  At around 11:30PM, my favorite feature of the pool opens.  Swim-up Blackjack!  This is $25\/$500 3-2 6-deck, H17, DDany, Split 4.  It's an okay game and a place to have some fun.  Get a line of credit beforehand so you don't need to bring bills.\n(HINT:  Women gravitate to this area like a moth to a flame.  I've seen some of the absolutely hottest ladies on the planet revolving around the 3 tables here, so keep your eyes peeled.  If you're winning, trust me - they'll notice.)\n... REHAB:  On Sundays, a massively successful party is thrown called Rehab which provides the ladies from across the street at Club Paradise (a high end strip club) with free admission... so the eye candy is immediate from sun up.  If you're a hotel guest, you get free pass.  If not, you're screwed.\n\n2) THE CASINO\nThe HRH Casino is one of the only major properties in Vegas that gets the majority of its casino revenues from table games and NOT slots.  This equates to HRH having bad table games with bad odds.  But they'll do it with a lot of eye candy wandering the floor and really great music playing in the background.  Somehow it doesn't hurt as much to lose a hand when \"Sweet Child o' Mine\" is playing.\n... BLACKJACK:  They have a LOT of really awful $15\/$1000 single deck & double deck games because they all pay 6-5 on natural 21's. (For the uneducated, that's really BAD)  Stick to the $25\/$2000 3-2 6-deck shoes that they have out on the floor.  They have marginal rules but it's the best game in the casino.\n\n3) THE RESTAURANTS\nThere are two restaurants worth worrying about:  \n... PINK TACO:  It serves some of the most delicious chips & salsa, while providing a menu loaded in carbs to keep that youthful energy goin'... alongside a 'Patron' Margarita.  Incidentally, for those of you inexperienced with tequila, this is a good opportunity to broaden your horizons with various types of tequila like Tres Generacions, 3 Amigos Blanco, Herradura, Jimador, etc.\n... NOBU:  Be sure to have reservations here if you intend on going.  No amount of grease will get you to the front of the reservation book.  Even a host may have trouble finding you a table on the fly so don't chance it.  See my review of Nobu for a better idea of what it's like.\n\n4) THE JOINT\nThe Joint is a concert venue at HRH that plays host to some great concerts.  Everything from Breaking Benjamin & Linkin Park to David Spade & Jimmy Fallon.   Having the concert be in the hotel is awesomely convenient when good shows come up. \n... MR LUCKY'S:  And after the show you can drop into Mr. Lucky's for coffee or dessert!\n(HINT:  There's 24\/7 off the menu special that isn't really a secret any more called the $7.77 special that's a real deal.  Instead of telling you, I'll let you order it to find out what is in it.)\n\n5) THE ROCK SPA GYM\nThe HRH gym is the BIGGEST gym for guys in Vegas. 3 racks of free weights, over 6 benches, 3 shoulder presses, 3 crossovers, etc.  Really great set up - especially on the weekdays when no one's there.\n\nFYI:  The rooms are old & Internet access is crap - get used to it.  You'll want a room that overlooks the pool... and it'll cost you close to $100\/day extra.  If you tip the front desk $20, they may bump you from a \"mountain view\" to a \"pool view\" at no charge.  Check http:\/\/www.frontdesktip.com\/fhotel.php?id=35 for success rates.  (And watch for the cross-promo products in your bathroom!  Hilarious!)\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThis is the place to stay if you're under 30.  You'll need to bring your fittest body, your funniest pick up lines, and your tiniest bikini.  And don't forget that with the exception of Nobu, virtually anything is possible... with the right tip.\n\n4-Stars.\n\n-----------\nREGARDING THE HARD ROCK \"HATERS\" ON YELP:\nI don't understand the haters of HRH - especially the \"aging\" ones.  Are they so narcissistic that they can't see that this was once a helluva lot of fun for them and is still fun for a lot of young folk?  I would have thought that a little age & experience would have broadened their perspective a little.
