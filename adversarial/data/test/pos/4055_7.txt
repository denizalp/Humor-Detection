If you're gunna grab a coffee grab a Bunna.  Here's why you're gunna grab a Bunna:\n\n-You're gunna wanna chat with the nice folks at Bunna.\n-Their coffee is very good and shade grown but you can drink it in the sunna.\n-Here at Bunna they really know their stuff and you can get toddy at Bunna.\n-It takes real coffee expertise at a coffee house to even know what toddy is - go to Bunna and try it.\n-Gabi's office hours at Bunna brought me here in a roundabout way.\n-Meet with a friend is what I was gunna, he said hey let's meet over at this place I tried with Gabi, do you know it, it's called Bunna.\n\n*Toddy - coffee brewed by soaking the grounds in cold water for 12 hours or so, then draining off the liquid.  The result is highly caffeinated, very smooth, concentrated coffee which can then be used in drinks in place of espresso or consumed on it's own.  It is very smooth because no hot water or steam is used as in regular brewing methods and the bitter acids that are released from the beans by heat are not present in the toddy.
