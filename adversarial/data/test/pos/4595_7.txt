Came here thanks to all the good reviews from Yelpers. The steak special was pretty good although hubby's steak was quite dry. Mine was ok but I didn't feel like steak at the time so hubby ate mine and we saved his for later. Everything else was good. Forgot that it came with a free root beer (we don't drink), should've tried that. Oh well.\n\nService was pretty good. The waitress Ricco was pretty nice and patient. She came by a couple of times and we still weren't sure what to order, the  off the menu steak special is still the best deal, glad y'all shared about it.\n\nThe place is really smokey and pretty run down, but we were seated pretty far back into the restaurant so it was ok, other than that, it wasn't bad. The location is sketchy, glad we came for lunch and not dinner as we didn't have a car and just walked from the strip and walked back (taking the bus while touring the strip).
