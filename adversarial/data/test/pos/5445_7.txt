more around a 3.5. \n\nService was prompt and friendly.  I had no wait on a weeknight. This restaurant is more fusiony, but I would recommend you stick with sashimi or rolls. \n\nWe ordered with our eyes rather than our stomachs and couldn't finish. \n\nThe Alaskan King Crab tempura was too greasy and had too much batter. The batter was just so overwhelming, I couldn't taste the crab! I had one piece and let my friend eat the rest. \n\nWe ordered a sashimi appetizer of snapper topped w\/ uni. Extremely fresh and very tasty. \nAlso ordered the 12 pc sashimi and everything was fresh. \n\nI was a fan of the spicy tuna w\/ crispy rice roll, but my friend said he found it to be too dry. My only quip with it was that it's hard to eat and falls apart immediately, boo! \n\nWe had 2 rolls that I can't recall.. but they were just ok.\n\nThe hamachi kama was also just ok. I felt it could've been grilled a bit longer, and I didn't like the dipping sauce. Normally, the sauce that comes on the side is just ponzu  but theirs tasted like something is added to it. \n\nWe got the matcha tiramisu and I honestly felt we could've done without that too.
