Oh what the hell. I hope that when I'm 80 years old I can still shake a tail feather without breaking it, and hike my fanny on up to the stage. Heck, I'm gonna love not giving a shit what the young whipper-snappers think.\n\nThe place was packed on the weeknight the oldman and I stopped by. I really wanted to just chug down my diet coke and skedaddle my ass on out of there.  But, the little old lady on the stage, who just celebrated a birthday was just too cute... so we stayed for a few more minutes. Yeah, it's that kind of place...
