Have you seen this place? I MEAN SERIOUSLY HAVE TO SEEN IT?! This place is like if you took the hallways of the death star and put HUNDREDS of people looking for chocolate in it. Yeah, that actually means its awesome! Not only does this place have the best tasting desserts in all of Las Vegas, but they are also the prettiest of all the desserts in Las Vegas. Be wary, you are going to most like pay around $8-your whole wallet here, but it will so be worth it as you walk away from the table holding onto that chocolate food baby. \nWhat would I recommend? Well that really just depends on what you are craving. Hotter than Pompeii outside and just as dangerous? I'd possibly recommend one of the many amazing gelatos they make from scratch. Or did you just wake up with a massive hangover after having a girls night out at one of the nightclubs? Croissant and coffee would make the day a little better. Or are you just a person that loves something sweet? Well then get everything they have, including the amazing triple cheesecake. \n\nShould you go here? No, no you should not...Is what a doctor would say if you were trying to loose weight. I say, run as fast as you can to get the nummies before everyone else does.
