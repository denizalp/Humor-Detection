I love the MGM Grand. Stayed Friday-Sunday for around $170 on an apparently popular weekend and got adjoining rooms with plus double queens and a California king plus two twin rollaways (mattresses on wheels). Maybe I'm weird, but I loved their hotel linens; they didn't make me wake up in the middle of the night sweating, even with the pillowtops.\n\n+ $35 credit on each room for the food court, not applicable at Emeril's restaurant, etc. But it WAS valid at Wolfgang Puck's, and their burgers were amaaazing. I think we devoured 3 in total. \n+ The staff, specifically the guards, were so nice. So nice, in fact, they were borderline baby-talking to me. This is referring to when I fainted waiting for food at Wolfgang's from possible shock of the heat outside and cold inside. Who knows.\n- Wet Republic: maybe it's fun when it's sunny and there are actual DJs spinning, but I would have no idea bc the weekend I went was rainy and the pools were closed for a good while due to lightning. Literally rained on our parade.\n? Casino: like any other.\n+ (Multiple) Pools: plenty of lounge chairs, and you can bring in your own booze provided the cans are emptied into cups. Tip: buy plastic sports bottles and fill it up before you get to the pool for additional alcohol.\n+ Lazy river: love it.\n+ Food court: pretty good during the day, and definitely not bad at 4am.\n- No late check-out, even when leaving on a Monday afternoon\n- The ELEVATORS! Oh, the elevators. We must have spent about half an hour waiting for a non-occupied elevator to get down to the lobby and check out on time, and the stairs were emergency only. Not that I'd want to carry luggage down 8 flights of stairs, but I'm just saying I'd at least like the option so I don't feel trapped.
