Let me start off by talking about the whole \"the server was on his phone the whole time he was taking our order!\" comment in one of the reviews a women left. \n\nIf you didn't already know, their cell phones have an operating program that's connected to their computers & printers; therefore, instead of writing it down they use their phones & once they hit send it goes straight to the kitchen's printer. Not quite sure if this technique is really professional or even more efficient than the old fashion way, but I guess that's just how they do things here & I have no problem with that.\n\nLet's move on, the food I absolutely love! I am a seafood fanatic & this place is one of my favorite places to go. They give you good portions especially for their snow crab legs. The only problem I have is that they charge an outrageous amount for a half a pound of shrimp. I think it was either $8.99 or $9.99. Personally I can go somewhere else for cheaper shrimp that tastes the same, but I still sometimes come here anyway.\n\nApparently the service is hit or miss, but I never have bad service when I go there. But they are right about one thing, water refills..
