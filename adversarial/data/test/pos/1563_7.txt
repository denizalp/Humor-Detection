why is this place so far away??\n\nwe ordered a burger, the grilled chicken sandwich, fries and onion rings. we topped it off w a fresh strawberry shake since it was the special for the day. \n\nwe split everything and boy oh boy was it great! I have also heard that their pizza is awesome and their breakfast. I need to go back and get both.\n\nalso, don't forget to check out the bathroom. i think i spent like 15 minutes in there. lol jk. it is pretty entertaining though.
