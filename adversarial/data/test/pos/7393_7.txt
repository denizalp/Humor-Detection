Worst chipotle ever. Super dopey employees. We had to repeat our order twice to the gal working at station 1 on the line. And she still got it wrong even I told her twice. One bowl one burrito. Not complicated. She seemed liked she could care less causing the line to back up almost to the front door. Total unorganized disaster between co-workers. The food was just not as good as I remember. Not good at all. I would not recommend. \n\nTIP: If you are traveling down I-15 or a local, I would advise you to just skip this location altogether.
