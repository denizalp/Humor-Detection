A five minute walk from my work place, Marhaba is the most convenient option for a quick lunch. So, boy am I glad that this place makes some amazing shawarma! \n\nIt's a dingy little joint on the notorious street corner of Dundas and Sherbourne, so I wasn't expecting much when I first walked in. But then I met a really cool, chatty guy behind the counter who made me a fantastic beef shawarma with fresh ingredients, just as I wanted... and I am picky - it's got to be mild, it's got be be extra extra garlicky and it's got to be without onions and pepper. Not a lot of people get my order to perfection; hence, I am extra fond of the places where I can hover over the counter going \"Some of this... no, not that...\" - and I get to do that at Marhaba, while the guy behind the counter attentively works on my Shawarma. \n\nPrices are fair and that's a bonus! $5 for one shawarma, $8 for two, and $6 for a shawarma combo with pop. Marhaba is a takeout joint, and even though there's single row seating near the window, it'd be too weird to do it because of the size of the place. It's pretty tiny. Also, it's not the cleanest place... but I keep coming back. The shawarma is just that good!
