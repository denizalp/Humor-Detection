Hi, my name is Amy and I am addicted to Polka Dot Bake Shop.\n*Hi, Amy*\n\nI love this place, so much so that I am afraid I will need to go get bigger pants.  Everything I have gotten has been consistently fresh and delicious.  On their website, they list the \"daily flavors\" for cupcakes and whenever something looks good to me (almost daily), I try to stop in.  Whenever cotton candy cupcakes appear, I am there, and should they ever do the swiss cake roll cupcake again, I am getting a dozen.  \n\nOn my list visit, I got a bag of their sweet potato crackers - DELICIOUS.  Light with just a faint hint of the potato-ey goodness.  They are not sweet crackers, but so delicious.  I ate the bag in one weekend, I could not stop myself from getting a handful every time I got the munchies.  \n\nToday's new adventure was their nut brittle.... holy smokes.  Not quite an inch thick of crunchy, buttery brittle goodness with every kind of nut that you can imagine in it (I recognized pecans and cashews, but couldn't stop eating long enough to do a thorough search).\n\nThe daily flavor today was a hummingbird cupcake which was topped with a delicious cream cheese icing that was exactly the right amount of sweetness with exactly the right amount of icing.  Moist cake - perfection.  \n\nTheir sweet potato cream cheese muffins are a dream come true.  When I stop in for a cupcake(s), I usually get a sweet potato cream cheese muffin to eat the next morning for breakfast.  \n\nI heart the Polka Dot, what a gem!
