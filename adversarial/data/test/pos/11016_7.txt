This is THE place to get your breakfast on in Vegas. Screw the 'all you can eat' buffets, those are good if you have the time & the room in your stomach. But, this little Jewish deli (run by Asians) serves it up hangover style! $5 for an egg, bacon & cheese sammie - on kaiser roll or bagel, with your choice of beverage. They also do the standard breakfast thing, as does the cafe next to it, but they change $9! The service is really slow for a place that's just a to go cafe, which makes it hard when you are swooning and in need of caffeine and grease. It is what hits the spot though for sure!
