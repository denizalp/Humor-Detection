I agree with Kelley H. Had the pork and shrimp egg rolls which were mediocre and a little undercooked. I was concerned but they said they freeze the egg rolls so the pork which looked very pink was ok. I thought these were made from scratch. Try the Tottie rolls at Totties 2 down the street which are way better. I also had the meatball pho which was very bland and the meat looked and tasted like sausage. The server didn't offer to get me something else when I said I didn't really like it or when he picked it up and saw I ate very little of it. The service was ok otherwise. Definitely not coming back.
