We're from California and came to visit for Banff, and before heading out wanted to try pho in another city. \n\nWe weren't sure if this is consider good pho for Calgary, but came because we saw great reviews. The pho was okay. The broth was waaay to sweet. Like super sweet. If they took out the sweetness it could be good pho. But it was decent. Meat and noodles were good. Big portion, pricing just right. The spring rolls were sad, very thin and had no substance. Veggie were at least fresh. \n\nThe server was very friendly and helpful though. The place was small and clean. It's a nice change (friendly service and clean) for a pho place!
