Came here with my mom and brother who are in from out of town, to grab some boba to beat the heat and partially to show them one of the only places that has boba in Phoenix (haha!)\n\nI got the Almond Milk Tea with pudding, my brother got the House Milk Tea with boba and my mom got the Honeydew with boba. We sat down and played a few games available in the corner of the shop and had our drinks before going on our way. The Almond Milk Tea was good, definitely not as sweet as the Honeydew I had last time that was way too sweet. The pudding was just alright. I don't feel that their boba is sweetened, but more often than not the boba is cooked well. I honestly think that the best drinks here so far has got to be their flavored Green Teas, House Milk Tea and their Almond Milk Tea! The drinks are one size I believe!\n\nThe service is pretty fast considering it's never too crowded all the times I've visited. Great place to hang out with a friend or to stop in to satisfy your boba cravings.
