Expensive the food was not worth the price.\nIt's marketed as an upscale Italian pizzeria but the food was not that upscale. First off good luck figuring out the menu (basically in Italian), second off the appetizers tasted all the same fried potato and cheese like and the salad greens had no dressing, thirdly my bruschetta variety platter also tasted all the same. The drink I got was too strong and gross for what I paid. It wasn't great but not terrible meh.
