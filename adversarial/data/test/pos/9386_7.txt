This is definitely NOT the place to go if you want to be treated FAIR!  I went in yesterday for an appointment only to be greeted with a new patient questionnaire that I could not see because no one took time to ensure the faded forms were legible.  I went on to realize after 30 minutes of sitting in the chair hearing whisper behind me that they were discussing my insurance rather than engaging me the patient!  I was then told they could not reach my insurance company and were kicking me out without any help.  Asking about anti biotic for my infection the assistant told me it would not help me!  Asking about pain meds she said the Dr will not see me because my insurance company wasn't reached. So I decided to head home without treatment when all of a  sudden the FAX came and I was insured! Amazingly I needed anti biotic and pain medication! You get a second class service with second class insurance! Don't even go unless you have the best insurance available. If you do have the best this is not the place for you either
