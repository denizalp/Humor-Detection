Have you ever wanted to sit in a chic, dark bar, eat good food and pretend you aren't in Vegas for a minute? I do. This is the place. They are giving me modern design and furnishing choices along with unique art on the walls to go with it. There is actually an Andy Warhol Elvis piece with the \nBAR logo on it next to a painting of De Niro in shades from Casino. I know these things because the service was so outstanding the GM and the Marketing Director (I think that was her title) both took the time to personally introduce themselves and get to know us. We discovered we were all born and raised here which is unusual to have four people in one room born here. Lol. The place is gorgeous and has a long bar with comfy chairs and televisions everywhere. There is a lounge area with couches and tables that I will definitely come back and enjoy with a group. The music was everything from Michael Jackson to The Smiths and Coldplay. I was a happy girl. They hit it out of the ballpark on decor and ambiance. \nThe food was above average for bar food in Las Vegas. I ordered the chicken fingers and onion rings which was served with homemade ranch dressing. Yum. The fingers were crisp and beer battered and tender white meat inside which I LOVED. The rings and the ranch were the perfect accompaniment to the fingers. They were light, very crisp and not too greasy. My guest had the Hawaiian chicken sliders and fries and licked his plate clean. He was satisfied. The food is quality. \nI will be back most definitely because every employee I encountered was super friendly, the chill vibe of this place and the tasty food. This city has needed a stylish bar like this forever. Leave it to some natives to finally bring it to us. Thanks B.A.R.!!!!!
