Okay, so I'm always tempted to get my shoes shined in the airport mainly because it just looks upper class, but never do. I recently discovered Tony when searching for a good place in Old Town to take my only pair of brown shoes that were pretty scuffed up. I wanted my feet to look sharp for a wedding I was attending - give me a break. Anyway, I brought my shoes in on a Wednesday afternoon (they were ready Thursday) and paid $15 up front for the repair - I was honestly kind of hesitant to pay up front before seeing the final product but Tony convinced me that he was the best. Boy was he right!!! My shoes literally look brand new and I could not stop showing them off at the wedding...why does a pair of shined shoes get me so excited you ask? Because they look bomb.
