I have to declare my love for Eureka Casino.\n\nI am a Vegas native, have been to all the hotels and casinos big and small. I dont find anything as charming as Eureka Casino. Sure it reeks of stale cigarettes, the people (both the staff and other patrons) seem a bit off and sort of quirky, its small and can get crowded easily, but they keep the free drinks coming while you are gambling and I have never won more money on nickle slots than I have here. Seriously, every single time I come here I win big.\n\nIf you want to get away from the fancy lights and swanky interiors and just see some old-school, down-home, wacky local place give Eureka a try. Keep your expectations low and you just might be surprised.
