Beer is excellent but the dishes are terrible... Pork belly sliders were ALL fat, not belly. Worst of all the bruschetta was small pieces of toast with MARINARA sauce on top (probably from a jar) and chunks of poor quality mozzarella thrown on top\n\nThere were no descriptions of food on late night menu either, otherwise I would've skipped the \"tomato jelly\" bruschetta (MARINARA)\n\nDo not eat here. Have a beer and then leave.
