This is a very solid three stars.  Went tonight for a party and there were about 15 of us, we had a reservation for 7:00.  We waited for about 20 minutes for our table, which I consider pretty fair.  It's a popular place Downtown, especially on a Saturday night.  \nIf you go, you need to anticipate that these are small plates, like tapas.  I was sitting with a few others and we all ordered different things, so we could try a bunch of stuff.  I had the mango spring rolls, and they were awesome.  They came with a yummy dipping sauce.  Also got the wasabi tofu.  Now, before you start flipping out about how nasty tofu is and blah blah blah, you need to try it at Sens.  It's lightly fried, first of all, so it's got a crisp coating.  They're creative with the different sauce flavors.  I also tried the sesame.  Both were de-lish.  \nMy drink was a really crisp ginger beer that had a good bite.  \nOur service was great.  Not once did I have to ask for my water to be refilled.  That is my biggest pet peeve.  \nThere is one bathroom.  One.  Unisex.  I don't mind having to share a bathroom with guys.  Oh, wait, now I do, because around the toilet, on the floor, it was wet.  Pee wet.  I've lived with guys and I know what that is.  Guys don't always have good aim.\nLoved the food and the prices weren't bad.  Didn't love the bathroom situation.
