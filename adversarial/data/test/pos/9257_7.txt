I am reviewing the salon on their formal  hair and makeup services. I made the mistake of using them on my wedding day as I was getting married in the Stratosphere. Boy did I make a huge and EXPENSIVE mistake!\n\nThis place is SHADY on their pricing!! Be very careful!!\n\nI received a very nice massage which I would give a different review for.  After I was supposed to get my hair done. The masseuse advised me that I did not have to wash my hair if I did not want to, since dirty hair styles better. And she gave me the heads up that they charge an extra $55 for just the wash!!!\n\nThen she came back in to the room and let me know that the hair stylist wanted her to make sure she got extra massage oil in my hair forcing me to have to wash it so he could charge me the $55!!  How shady is that??\n\nSo, I did opt to wash my hair and was going to deal with the charge...it was my wedding day and people had smoked around me the night before.  Then the stylist (who stunk of cigarette smoke himself) charged me for long hair...when I clearly have mid-length hair. I'm not asking for an up-do.  Just some curls with a hair pin on one side.  Not a complicated hairstyle. So now I'm being charged $225 for this. Again...I deal, bc it's a couple hours before my wedding and I don't want to argue.\n\nHe puts the curlers in, takes them out, brushes my hair, pins up the one side with my barrettes, sprays it and it's done!  All this for $225!!  The curls were gone and my hair was flat 45 minutes after I left the salon!!  And he didn't even give me a nice blow-out so when my curls flopped I was left with unfinished hair.\n\nMy friend had to come with a curling iron and fix it...and her curls lasted the entire day!\n\nNow the makeup...if you want to look like a cheap and trashy stripper then this is the place to get your makeup done...otherwise stay away. The cosmetologist was quoting for services $10 over what the menu stated. She barely looked at the picture that I brought in and did not try at all to copy the style.  I'm a red head and she used black powder on my eyebrows!!  And they weren't even!!  My fiance saw me as I rushed into our hotel room with tears in my eyes in horror of my appearance...and he would be the type to reassure me if I was just being critical.  He looked at me and shook his head, and said \"Oh My God, what did she do to your face!\"\n\nThe same friend who saved my hair with the curling iron ended up redoing my makeup. I barely made it to the chapel in time and I was so upset the whole day.\n\nI think  they hear \"Wedding\" and use it as an opportunity to gauge you.  And the level of their ability doesn't match what you are paying for.
