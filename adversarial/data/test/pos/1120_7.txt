This is a fantastic place to get work done.  I was probably the most annoying, loudest person there - looking for a good seat (close to a plug because my battery was dead), asking about the wifi, bumping the table a few too many times.\n\nThe barista was extremely friendly considering how annoying I was.  My latte was delicious, and just the right size.  I was able to get a lot of work done in the silence.\n\nThe washroom was far, far away (down the hall, down the stairs... across the river, up a mountain) - so plan accordingly.
