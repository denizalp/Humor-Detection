Came here on a weekday mid morning. They have a few spaces for parking in front of the place. My father wanted to come here and I haven't been to Einstein in a while. When we entered we walked to the counter and placed our order. The place was semi clean. There was chairs disarray and some food on tables, we assumed they just finished the morning rush. The menu up top doesn't list all of the ingredients in each sandwich. You have to ask. They didn't have mini menus to view near the register. No hello or welcome to Einstein just a stare.The sales associate punched in our order and it came out way wrong. Despite explaining the order to her on what needed to be corrected it came out wrong again. After the 2nd time I needed to leave it was taking too long. I figured if they couldn't get it right twice on two different peoples orders then it wasn't coming out right a third time. There was 4 people behind the counter area and no one  offered to help this associate or help us to ensure customer service as good and the order was accurate. They seemed engaged in whatever they were doing. I did the survey on the receipt the same day and asked to be contacted for follow up. I wasn't contacted. I'll skip this place in the future.
