I saw this topless revue courtesy of a couple comp tickets. \n\nOne star for it being a production show that really seemed to be trying. This isn't a Jubilee quality show but for what it was, free, it was okay. About 8 women, (6 topless on occasion) dance in different themed segments.\nSecond star for a live music during the show.  The ladies are accompanied by two male musicians.  The drummer and sexy guitarist seemed to be having a good time while performing.\nI don't know what I expected but I was bored during the show. The lead singer, Lorena Peril,  had a very weak singing voice. She was unsexy and her dancing was amateurish Maybe someone should explain to her that loud does not equal good.\nThere were two blond women that were bigger and thicker than the other dancers.  The were obviously former strippers and did not fit well at all as they could not dance and were lumbering across the stage.\n There was no key theme to the show. After watching the women tear through t-shirts the second time and stumbling across the stage while trying to carry off the dismal choreography for 10 minutes I was ready to leave.   \n\nI am not sure how long the shows run was but the show is now CLOSED.   Maybe with some more time and fine tuning it would have been a bit more watchable but I doubt it.  A few of the women were cute but even the man I was with was bored.  You've seen one fake boob or small boob and you have seen them all. This show was less than impressive.
