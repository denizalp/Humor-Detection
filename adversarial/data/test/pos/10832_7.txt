This store offers a decent selection of party supplies at a fair price. The staff appears to be predominantly high school age and their level of experience really varies. If you need balloons, party favors, decorations and other \"flair\" prizes, this location has what you need.\n\nI'm giving them three (3) stars because the staff during my visit on 06 MAY 2017 AD was spread too thin. The lines were long, the wait was substantial and when I asked about some in-store and company promotions, nobody could answer my questions.
