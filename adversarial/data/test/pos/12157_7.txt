Searching for good mexican food is Vegas is not easy.  Every place, even the ones that use the word \"authentic\" are just americanized eateries that have the usual mexican dishes.\n\nLindo Michoacan is no different.  I agree with most of the posts.  The salsa is plain and way too much tomato sauce and no tomatoes, onions or cilantro.  The beans served with the salsa was as you would expect.\n\nThe best part was our shrimp dish.  The shrimp tasted like- SHRIMP.  We found that amazing.  Our server was great.  The house margaritas seemed watered down and we had a pitchers worth of them.\n\nThis is probably more a personal thing but I found a spelling error in the dessert menu, they used the word CARMEL meaning CARAMEL.  I pointed it out to our server and then tried to reach the overall manager for the chain, Gerardo at the number listed on the website.  He was too busy to take my call so I wrote to them via the supplied email address.  Three days later no email or call.  This indicates a real lack of concern and a lack of customer service that I expect where ever I eat. I would think they would be very appreciative of someone who spotted this mistake so they could correct it.  Now that I see how they ignored me, I am doubting they care or will ever correct it.\n\nOverall the food was average to good.  The service was great, the atmosphere was typical mexican restaurant.  I really wish they would improve the salsa and margaritas and learn how to spell.
