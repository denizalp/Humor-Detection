Don't go this place! It is not safe for your dog! They do not ask for any proof of rabies taken. You will not know if your love would catch any disease from this place! We brought our Bichon there and apparently, those people do not know how to groom a Bichon! They groomed him like a husky afterward. His head is no longer round! Terrible terrible place! They also charge much higher than other places!
