This mall is like glimpsing into the Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous for me. While Concord Mills has it beat in foot traffic (in fact that mall has the Blue Ridge Parkway conquered in # of annual visitors, which I think is ridiculous), this mall is the Ritzy place to go and spend $600 on a fur coat or a cool grand on new kitchen gadgets.\n\nSpeaking of kitchen gadgets, that's pretty much the only reason I go here besides window shopping and mall walking. Sur La Table is an amazing store for the culinary-geek. If I ever win the Powerball, the first thing I'll do is completely buy out their store. I have a separate review for this store so you can go check it out if you'd like!\n\nI come here at least once a week just to burn off a few calories (usually on one of my non-gym days just to give the ol' FitBit a bit of a boost!). If you walk the perimeter of the mall concourse, including the food court, you will have walked just shy of a mile. What's nice is the entire mall is level and, of course, Air Conditioned so it's a nice place to put in some earbuds and clear your head while walking. They even open the entrance from the Lower Level to the escalators at 7am just for Mall Walkers! That's earlier than any other Charlotte mall!\n\nAs I said, most of the stores are focused on the Urban\/High-Income clientele so don't be surprised if you see a T-shirt in the window for \"Only $49 each when you buy 3!\" They have feature anchors stores that you'd find just about anywhere like Dillard's, Belk, Macy's, and Nordstrom. But in some of the outlet spots they have super-$$$ stores like Tiffany & Co., Louis Vuitton, and Coach (ok, are they really pricy? I'm just assuming here). Due to this atmosphere and the elevated presence of security, you really don't have to worry too much about troublemakers as you would in other shopping centers. Sure, there have been instances of shoplifting here and there, but they are vastly far and few between. Use common sense and basic self-awareness, and you're going to be just fine.\n\nSome of the more reasonably priced stores that I actually visit from time to time are Dick's, The Container Store (which is super cool if you like all kinds of unique shelving and storage solutions), The Microsoft Store, and even Dillard's has good deals from time to time. The food court has a ton of options and most are better pickings than you would normally find in a mall. Think of Five Guys, Panera, Chipotle, and Showmars.\n\nParking can be a bit of a nightmare during prime-time. My suggestion after 4PM is to use the street level parking adjacent to Morrison Blvd and enter the Mall through either Dillard's or Macy's. The Parking decks remind me of a mosh pit as far as aggressive drivers trying to zoom into spaces, so good luck if that's the way you decide to go.\n\nNext time you get a new line of credit, consider SouthPark Mall to fulfill those grandiose aspirations of your six-figure alter-ego, I won't judge.
