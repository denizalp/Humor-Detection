Eh, they're okay in my book, not a place I'd go out of my way for. \n\nThe boyfriend and I came in on their grand opening day, I've been wanting to try nitrogen ice cream for quite some time now so I was excited when I heard this place was opening up so close to home. \n\nYou have a lot of combinations to choose from, in the end, we decided to go for their specialties, we got The 808 and the Cafe Sua Da.\n\nI felt like The 808 was lacking in flavor, it's supposed to be a pineapple sorbet but the taste of pineapple was just too weak, combine it with the lihingmui powder and it was just off tasting, to top it off, it completely melted within 15 minutes, think cold soup. The Cafe Sua Da was better, if you like a strong taste of coffee then this ice cream is for you, it's made with Vietnamese coffee. Overall staff was friendly, place was clean, a little on the small side, if you're in the neighborhood, it's definitely worth checking out just for the nitrogen tanks.
