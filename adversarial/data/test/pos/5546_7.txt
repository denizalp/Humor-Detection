As a dog-free human, I am still able to appreciate the high canine appeal of Spring Valley Park. I went there with a large group of pals who all owned dogs. It was a doggy date, but I only had a 2-D dog (on my shirt). There were at least three, gated dog parks with plenty of grass divided up for different size pooches. One was closed. The only real drawbacks were the lack of benches (be sure to bring a chair) and the ant trap in the corner (so beware). I witnessed a sweet little puffy guy get engulfed with ants in a matter of moments, but it was in one extreme corner of one of the areas. I don't think it is a problem to warrant not visiting here with your personal Spot.\n\nBesides the dog area, there is a water park-- very tempting even to an adult when it is 100+ outside. The playground looks fancy and fun, and from the smells, I would say there are some nice grilling areas. And, basketball too. No tennis courts. \n\nAll in all a solid park.
