I was very frustrated with this group.  After having a referral from my Perinatologist faxed multiple times by them and by me, having multiple calls unreturned, I FINALLY got a hold of someone 3 weeks later.  Then I was told to just come in without an appointment. Which I did.\n\nThen when I got there they made a huge deal about me not having an appointment.  The whole experience took an hour for a 10 second EKG test (I kid you not, it took 10 whole seconds).  And that was after I finally was called back and the technician couldn't even find the information she needed that was written on the referral from (a form that originated from AZ Cardiology Group, I might add).  I had to show her where the Drs name was, the phone number, the code for the test.  And all of it was written clearly and it was easy to read.\n\nSeriously?  Should the patient have to do the job of the front office staff AND the tech running the equipment??
