My one star goes out to one of the new managers working at the store (amanda was her name i think ) ( she deserves 5 stars) for her kindness, understanding, helpfulness , and knowledge in fashion. She was an amazing person to communicate with and for the rest of the employes that work in the store they all sucked.. The head manager Fernanda was a total bitch and I feel sorry for all of the employes that have to deal with her every day. That lady Fernanda is going to know where in life.. poor customer service and an extremely fake and bitchy personality. Also very unimpressed with the display of clothing in the store. Everything was all over the place and all of the hangers were backwards... poorly displayed... and to fernanda ... WHATS YOUR NAME BITCH???
