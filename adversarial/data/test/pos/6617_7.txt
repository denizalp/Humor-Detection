Bone-in-ribeye, mashed potatoes and vegetables:perfectly cooked. \nWine(cant remember what kind due to drunkeness):tasted good. \nThe service and staff was excellent and knowledgeable. \n\nThe walls of this place change about every 15ish minutes. Yes they change. Music starts playing and the wall either raises and lowers to look different. I cant do it justice you need to see it for yourself
