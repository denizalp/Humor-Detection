Echoing other fellow yelpers:  \n\n*Use the restaurant.com coupon FTW\n*Service is good\n*Food is fantastic\n\nI got the 19 oz. prime bone-in ribeye.  It was a huge portion for 42 bucks.  Cooked to perfection.  It was slap your grandma awesome.  I love when you work your way toward the bone and the meat just gets tastier along the way.  They gave three salts for extra flavor.  I think it was sea salt, some expensive pink salt, and black lava salt from Hawaii.  The black lava salt went well with the steak.  4.5 stars for the steak.\n\nEvery time I see the word truffle I usually order it.  My group was ok with me ordering the truffle fries.  When they started eating them, they were excited for the next bite.  The only thing that would make this 5 stars instead of 4.5 stars is if these fries were cooked in rendered duck fat!\n\nWe all shared sides, so I got to taste the sampler of three mashed potatoes and three mac n cheeses.  The sides were great.  They weren't the best I've had, but they were damn tasty.  \n\nI would rate ENVY a strong 4 stars, but the coupon, service, and the great atmosphere made it 4.5 rounded to 5 for yelp.  Is it me or are most restaurants not even close to full.  I went Friday night and it was barren.
