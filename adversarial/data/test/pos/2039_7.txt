the only ramen place i go to other than kinton ramen. i usually order the tonkutso black and it's very delicious and flavourful. i especially love the egg bc the yolk melts in your mouth. the meat is also good but a bit oily. service is pretty good as well. recently started to order the gyoza too and it's pretty good but it takes 10-15 mins to make. \n\nfunny story when we got our bill and was paying with the machine the server was cleaning our table and taking our bowls but my boyfriend was not done eating but she already stacked the bowls... lol i guess she could've asked us if we were done before taking the bowl cuz there was still a good chunk of noodles left. oh well but my bf said give 4 stars cuz of this experience lol.
