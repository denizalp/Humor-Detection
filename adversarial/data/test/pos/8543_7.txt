After munching on brunch delights at Bada Boom Pasta Room, my comrad had a splendid idea. \"Let's hop on this trolley and see where it takes us!\" Uhm, why not? So, we rode the trolley on its route, which included areas around downtown Scottsdale. It was fun, I'll admit. I never thought it would be, but you can sit in a comfortable air conditioning trolley car as it lurches to and fro. It does occasionally stop, with the driver confessing, \"We'll be stopped here for 5 minutes, then be on our way again.\" I can't imagine what it'd like to drive the same route over and over and over again... But I'm sure you can have some fun talking with guests, who may be visiting Scottsdale and no little, if anything, about the place. \n\nI just love the idea of public transportation, especially if it's free. \n\nAfter riding for a little bit longer, my comrad and I hopped off at Cafe Carumba for some espresso. Then we took our drinks and walked the length of the Mondrian Hotel. We were drawn to the pool area, where it looked like a scene right out of a movie. Bronze beauties and muscular men all bathing in the pool. A DJ was playing music and misters offered reprieve from the summer heat. This was, after all, July in Scottsdale. \n\nI think you can easily make a day out of touring the area, especially when you can hop on and off the trolley. It's so easy! \n\n* * *\n\nTrolley Schedule: \nEvery 10 minutes \n7 Days a week \n11:00 am to 9:00 pm \nNo Trolley service on New Years Day, \nMemorial Day, July 4th, Labor Day, \nThanksgiving or Christmas. \n\nThe Scottsdale Trolley is free to ride, \n(drivers may not accept tips), and visits : \n\nScottsdale Fashion Square \nFifth Avenue Shops \nMarshall Way Arts District \nMain Street Arts District \nOld Town \nWaterfront \nSouthBridge \nScottsdale Convention & Visitors' Bureau\n\nTo see a map of all the routes and stops, click here:\nhttp:\/\/www.scottsdaleaz.gov\/trolley\/downtown_route.asp
