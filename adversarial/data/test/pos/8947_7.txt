Started off being a favorite, however the service has gone down hill fast!!  There are two male  workers named Daniel and Peter and are absolutely horrible. One of them was so busy cruising the female customers and staring at their bodies and the other one was incredibly rude and condescending. \n\nThere are plenty of other restaurants around the area that provide much better service.
