I can't believe I'm reviewing a Vegas nightclub LOL...but I'm so angry about my experience it's come to this.\n\nI've been to pretty much all the nightclubs in Vegas, twice to Omnia. The first time wasn't so great because it was SO ridiculously crowded. Not your typical crowded, but like this-is-a-fire-hazard crowded. I nearly suffocated trying to squeeze my way to the restroom. Not a pleasant experience at all.\n\nThe second time was what made me angry. A few weeks ago a group of my friends and I headed to Omnia (we were on the guest list). It rained earlier that day which means nightclubs are even more packed, so we prepared for this and left about an hour before our free entry time interval ended. The line was absolutely ridiculous so we waited for 2 hours and ended up not getting in. But what really ticked me off was the guy checking our IDs. Some scrawny dude with glasses checked my ID (which is NOT a fake - I'm 24 for God's sake) and for whatever reason didn't think it looked like me. Then asked for other forms of ID so I gave him my school ID, credit card, debit card, AND my Kaiser card. And this kid STILL doesn't believe me and at this point is being pretty rude about it and calls over his manager. She fortunately is more reasonable, takes a look at my ID and lets me past right away. But @little scrawny kid - You really think if I'm gonna use a fake ID I've also ordered a freaking KAISER CARD to go with it?? Why are you so intent on trying to not me through? Aren't you like 20?? Does your mom know where you go at night? Who hurt you?? WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM\n\nAnyway the wait at Omnia is always bad and the interior is a little above average for a Vegas club but I think it's way overrated because people love the big screens that are inside. Pass.
