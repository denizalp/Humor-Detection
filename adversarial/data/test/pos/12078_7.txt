I infrequently go to Jack in the Box. \n\nDon't get me wrong; Jack in the Box makes great burgers, sandwiches and sides.\n\nBut the only time I'll go to Jack's is in the wintertime, in which they featured the Pumpkin Pie Milkshake and Eggnog Milkshake. And I was craving for the Eggnog Milkshake after my dinner. \n\nAnother piece of technology I don't see back home is the kiosk booth to place your order for your food. As a substitute of seeing the cashier, you input what you want and how you want your food(s) and\/or drink(s) customized. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/duCjWA3EBSA-ox5LTcXbwQ?select=MkeNe_5lsNK9CkM4mqZMKg\n\nAnd the large $2.99 seasonal milkshake is programmed in the machine. You can even request for extra whipped cream and extra maraschino cherry as one many options. I slide my Visa to pay for my treat and I get my receipt with the order number. \n\nMy milkshake: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/duCjWA3EBSA-ox5LTcXbwQ?select=ymC0PFMYFXXeOjZgd5QH9w\n\nAfter a few minutes, the clerk yelled out my number and I finally got my milkshake. \n\nOne sip of the thick seasonal milkshake, I was instantly in the holiday spirit.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen: that is technology in Las Vegas!
