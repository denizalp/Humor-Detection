My favorite cold dessert place this summer! They have the best taiyaki in Vegas. I've only had taiyaki in Vegas, which all other places fall short. So, I'm not sure if it's truly authentic like in Asia or not. It's hella good though! The fish shaped caked is on the small side, but it is served warm and filled with nutella. The texture is great and easy to eat. Nothing like eating cardboard at a competitor. The downside is you gotta eat it fast because it falls apart. The ice cream sits on top and not really in the cavity of the cake part. \n\nI love the flavors! They have matcha, taro, and black sesame, with various swirl options such as vanilla. My favorite is the matcha. It is an extremely smooth custard with perfect flavor. \n\nThey have italian ice desserts with so many pre designed options for every palate. I went with a tropical themed one and I was satisfied with all the flavors in it. I have to come back to try the spicy mango one. \n\nThey even make great boba drinks. My favorite is the milk tea with horchata and nutella. So good! I could do without the boba (tapioca balls).
