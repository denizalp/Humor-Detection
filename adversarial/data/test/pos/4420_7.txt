Love kfc. Hate this place. Was just telling my mom how your order always goes up for negotiation here. Ordered 20 pice hot wings. Well they only have 15. Then the awkward silence then eventually I get \"do you still want 20?\" Eff yeah I do! If I wanted 15 I would've ordered 15. Then they ask me if I wanted to substitute my wings with wedges. That is NOT equivalent exchange. So when you come here prepare to \"pull up please\" but first he prepared for someone to try to renegotiate your order to make their job a bit more easier.
