This was my boyfriend and i's first time there. My friend recommended it to us. This place is by far the WORST breakfast place I've ever gone to!!!!! First of all unbelievable customer service. Our waiter yes did the right thing and asked if we wanted coffee, and drinks. My friend got an orange juice. He said his orange juice tasted like Sunny D. My friend asked for a fruit bowl. WHAT DID HE GET SPOILED ROTTEN FRUIT!!!!!! What you see here on the strawberry has MOLD on it. My friend felt disgusted and said forget the fruit bowl. He didn't even touch it, we were so mad. I on the other hand got the red velvet pancake, tasted dry and very sweet. My boyfriend got the Eggsmart Big breakfast, my boyfriend asked his eggs to be OVER MEDIUM AND IT WAS NOT!!!! IT CAME OUT A RUNNY OVER EASY! His pancakes were so dry and cold and slightly over cooked \/ burned.\nTHIS SPANISH MAN DIDNT EVEN SAY SORRY OR OFFER ANYTHING ELSE, WHAT HE DID WAS ROLL HIS EYES AND BITCHED AT THE CHEF.. The waiter didn't even ask my boyfriend and I how we were doing or anything. I was so annoyed to the point where I just grabbed the bill and paid for it.
