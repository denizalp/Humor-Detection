I did not enjoy this show.  It was cheesy with lame jokes and his impressions weren't that good.  Gordie was laughing more than the audience.  I feel bad for him.  He needs some new material.  It was all dated or juvenile.  Corny jokes a 12 year old would think up.  Then pretended they were shocking.  The only people I can see enjoying this show are older or maybe tourists who don't get out much.  It was terrible.
