The best restaurant experience I've had in a really long time.\n\nIt was probably because I was reunited with my two great friends who I met in Korea. Or maybe it's because I was in Canada! Or maybe it's because their restroom had mouth wash with cups and a notebook for you to write in. Or maybe it's because our waitress had so much energy. Or maybe it's because we were seated next to this family from Ottawa and I got super excited because I just learned that Ottawa was Canada's capital. Or maybe it's because the food, each and every single thing we ordered, was freakin spectacular! Oh, and the huge beer mug. Yes.\n\nHere's a replica of our receipt (I kept it for my scrapbook!):\n \nSapporo Big Mug 9.5\nGyu Shabu Salad 6\nSalmon Tataki 6.8\nGyu Carpaccio 6.5\nBBQ 6\nKaki Mayo 7.2\nKinoko Cheese Bibimbap 8.8\nKabocha Korokke 4.8\nGomaee 3.8\n\nTotal: 67.12\nARIGATOU GOZAIMASU!!\nBe careful!! Guuing is addictive.\n\nYes.
