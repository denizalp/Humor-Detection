Located at the far end of the Downtown Container Park, Kappa Toys is a must-stop for me when in the area! The ambiance in here is great for kids and adults alike. Although items are usually over regular retail pricing, the walk down memory lane for me always gets me\/suckers me into buying something. The store does a good job of displaying their large array of all different kinds of toys and leaving room for playing\/interacting as well. The staff is usually very friendly and eager to help you find something. There is a specific-colored rare Yoshi I love collecting and I found a wind-up toy of it here. The other day I also found these hard to find Lego Disney minifigures. Never hurts to look in here and see what you can find!
