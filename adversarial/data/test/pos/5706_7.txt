I have been a member here for a few months. At first, it seemed ok. Mediocre, but for the cost it was good and all I needed. Lately, it's been the busiest I've ever seen and the people here seem to be getting trashier and trashier. I can't get on machines that I want and lastly, come on can we please have some type of dress code in there so the girls who think they are hot in their tight shorts that don't cover their ass maybe put a pair of shorts on?!!! Gross! Literally, half their privates are hanging out and it's gross. I'm not sure how much longer I'm going to stay here.
