I was a personal trainer for 10 years, over 30,000 sessions under my belt and I find the Whole food concept to be misleading in many ways!\n\nA friend and  I went into the store and we both were disappointed in the Very High Prices of Food!  I Did educate him very quickly!  He no longer shops there and achieves his fitness and health goals just fine!  WOW - Thanks Jake For Saving Me a Ton of Money!\n\nBecause of the word \"Organic\" does it really mean you can hike up the prices to ridiculous levels?  I Think Not!\n\nBecause of the word \"Organic\" is it really better for you?  I Think Not!\n\nThe store was very clean, great location, & staff professional!\n\nQuestion, If you take a piece of chicken that is \"organic\" and you take another piece that is \"non-organic\", you eat both, Does Your Body Know The Difference?  Answer,  I Think Not!  The body will pull out all nutrients from what ever you eat, no matter where it comes from and how it is grown or raised and then disperse the rest out the body!  That Is The Facts!\n\nOMG - LOL  Brain speaking to itself, wow, that organic food was really great today, SILLY, the body does not know the difference!\n\nSave your money, eat smart and eat according to your fitness and health goals!\n\nDon't be pulled into the hype of organic food is better for you, it is not, the body does not know how the food was grown or raised!  PERIOD!
