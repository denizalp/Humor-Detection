So glad we bought the Groupon because this place is a disgusting mess that no one should pay full price for. Brought the kids to skate here on 4\/12\/14. Never again!\n\nThe Groupon included skate rental and a coupon for a drink. What they don't tell you is that the \"drink\" is a Coke product fountain drink. They're too cheap to include bottled water (the cheapest Nestle brand water out there, they charge $2 for). Lame. The trailer trash teen girls serving drinks behind the counter were more concerned with gossiping and screaming \"let me take a selfie!\" Than serving people. One girl had either henna or a bunch of pen scribbled writing on her hands (filthy). The whole operation is run on rude, obnoxious teenagers. Cheap labor, I suppose. Decided to pass on any crappy food and drink from behind the counter. \n\nDon't recommend a Saturday night, the place is crawling with loud, disrespectful pre-teens playing grab ass and bored parents who probably wish they served alcohol. \n\nThe rink employees were very dangerous on the ice: messing around, skating way too fast and the opposite direction....felt bad for the little kids out there.  They obviously rent skate-walkers to big kids who absolutely don't need them to help them skate, instead they use them as an accelerator to fuck around with. Nice. \n\nThe whole establishment is dirty and obnoxious. Will NOT be back!!!
