One of the most cleanest, organized 99 Cent stores I've ever seen!\n\nThey sell those Jamba Juice juices that are normally $2-3 at the regular stores. I stocked up with a case of those!\n\nTazo Tea, two for 99 cents! Also stocked up on a case of those!\n\nSix-pack of 12oz Crystal Geyser waters, spent $4 on four six-packs!\n\nThis store practically saved me from dehydration in this 109 degree AZ weather for the next two weeks! I love this store :)
