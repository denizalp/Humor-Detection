I was very surprised! Positively! From the outside, it's a rustic deco, it also looks like a dessert place, clean and neat, with the white wooden chairs.\nWe reserved for two, the waitress was really nice, she explained the Japanese menu, teishoku style and the chefs special plates.\nWe were inspired, and ordered:\nKARAAGE; fried chicken\nVEGETABLE PANCAKE; Vegetable pancake okonomiyaki style\nUNI IKURA DON (SEASONAL DISH); Sea urchin, salmon tartar and roe served over rice, with miso soup\nKAISEN DON; Assorted sashimi, sweet shrimp and quail egg served over rice\nWith a refreshing Kirin beer\nFinally the food was to die for !!! I would definitively recommend it, and come again. It's definitively my favorite japanese restaurant in montreal.
