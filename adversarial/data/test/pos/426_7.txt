Amazing! Everything tastes delicious and portions were huge! This place has amazing quality, does not skimp on MEAT either. This is coming from someone from Toronto whom has HUGE options of chinese food downtown..... Lucky to have been passing by Whitby to Oshawa (to get my G license) and decided on some chinese food... Found one of the best spots. If I lived closer I would definitely eat here every day.
