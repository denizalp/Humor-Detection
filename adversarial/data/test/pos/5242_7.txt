After reading some of the bad reviews I felt the need to speak up because I love this Boot Camp.\n\nI have been going to the South Scottsdale location(Wilshire Plaza) with Richelle as the main trainer for around 6 months or so.  I have been working out since 15 years old and absolutely hate the gym at this point.  I always look for something new to hold my interest and change it up when it comes to staying in shape.  UBBC is exactly what I needed.\n\nThe workouts are different every day.  Some days you are inside, some outside, some days you are on your own, other days you partner up or run circuits.  There are always new faces and the group setting is very motivational for me.  I personally get bored out of my mind lifting weights by myself, while surrounded by a bunch of meatheads at the gym.  Again, UBBC is a great alternative to that.  I generally do UBBC 2-3 times a week and hit the gym or go biking and hiking on the off days.  It is a good mix.\n\nThe workouts are grueling some days and other days not as bad, but still very challenging.  There is never a day when I think \"oh, this is so easy\".  I always leave the class sweating bullets and feeling good.  To anyone who thinks \"this is just like a class at the gym\", I don't know what gym you go to, but I have never experienced workouts like these at LA Fitness.  I honestly think you're full of s$%t.\n\nRichelle is a great trainer and I love being pushed to work harder.  I don't know anyone who can motivate themselves to workout this hard on their own.  If you can, friggen good for you man,.  This is again why I like UBBC.  I saw someone bitching about the cost and attention they got.   If you don't think Richelle or your trainer \"gives you enough 1 on 1 attention\" go get a personal trainer and see how much they cost.  Usually they are $100 an hour.  At 3 days a week that is $300 a week, $1200 a month.  When you break down what you get, this class is far cheaper then a personal trainer on a monthly basis and most trainers won't push you this hard.  If you need advice, she will certainly talk to you before, after class or via email.  She can't possibly give 30+ people 1 on 1 attention at the same time and run the class simultaneously.  Doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand that...\n\nIf you want someone to hold your hand and change your diaper, this probably isn't the class for you.  Richelle has a sarcastic sense of humor and I can see where some people might be caught off guard sometimes.  It isn't because she is \"mean or insensitive to your issues\", it is because you simply don't \"get it\" and are most likely taking what she says the wrong way.  I have never felt insulted or as if she she doesn't care about injuries or limits.  I have had a few injuries and as long as she knows about them, she will recommend alternative exercises to avoid further injury or discomfort.\n\nI have gotten much stronger since starting and I have no plans to stop.  I assure you, if you come here for 3 months. work hard, don't miss a day and eat right, you will see great results.  If you don't eat right and show up once a week, don't waste your time because no one can help you.\n\nAnywho, definitely don't let the whiners and lame reviews steer you off.  I can't speak for the other locations, but Wilshire Plaza is a great group of core people and Richelle is great.  I dare you to come to one of these classes and tell Richelle it isn't challenging enough...haha.  Wow...I can't even imagine a human who would feel that way...\n\nAnd no, I didn't write this to get on Richelle's good side or kiss her ass.  If you know Richelle, you know that's a battle I can't win.  ;)
