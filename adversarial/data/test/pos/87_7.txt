Ok so this review is a bit overdue, but as they say, it's better late than never right?! I got my haircut and colour done here before the Canada Day long weekend, and was happy with the results as I've also received many compliments about it! It was my second time at this hair salon near Summerhill station, and the stylists know what they're doing and make you feel comfortable in their chair with magazines, water or tea, and friendly\/funny conversations. My colourist, Aaron, recommended the trendy 'Bali-Aj' or 'Hombre' highlights where the highlights are closer to the bottom versus the tin foil highlights where it starts from the root. Afterwards, he showed me how to curl my hair with the flat iron and let me practice on a few strands. For my haircut, Aiden, did a great job as I just got a trim from the first time he cut layers in my hair. And you know it's a great cut when its consistent from how it looked the first time..as I've been to other salons before where the first time it turned out good, but the second time the haircut didn't quite look the same?! Anyways, Aaron and Aiden are awesome, and I've found my go to guys for colour and cut :)
