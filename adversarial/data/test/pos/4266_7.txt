Hole in the wall that's right near the corner that Tupac got shot (so you know it's good).\n\nGET THE BBQ RIBS HERE!!! They are some of the best I've ever had.\n\nAlso get the Hefeweizen here. Not a beer drinker? Grab their root beer. I'm not a fan of root beer but it's supposed to be the best here. They brew all of their beers here on site.\n\nThe ribs are made right there and fall right off.\n\nMy girlfriend will eat like a bird but she cleared a whole rack no problem.\n\nOn my birthday I could have chosen any restaurant in this city of amazing food but I wanted one thing. Ellis Island BBQ ribs. Now that has to saysomething.\n\nSorry about the sporadic review but you get the point...GO HERE\n\n(Don't do the restaurant in the casino, go to the BBQ spot on the side and don't get it twisted haha)
