Located inside the Biltmore, this place is an awesome restaurant to meet clients or friends for lunch.  I ordered a Margherita Pizza and some Iced Tea.  The Margarita Pizza was superb!  Very good and just the right size too....not too large & not too small.  I left satisfied.  The Iced Tea was very good too....I think I drank 5 or 6 glasses!\n\nOf course, the service was outstanding as well.  It's no wonder why there were several tables and booths with people conducting business....it's a great place for that.\n\nReturn Factor - 96%
