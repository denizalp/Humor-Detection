This is a rather late review but we came here at the end of October for a group birthday brewery crawl. Wisconsin Brewing Company was the last leg of our trip and it was a good way to end our journey.\n\nThe bartenders are super friendly, letting you sample their vast collection of beers on tap and patiently describing each on to our entire group. \n\nWe had tried to schedule a tour online but it was closed for a special event. However, when we arrived and told the bartenders of our predicament, they managed to find an employee to give us the guided tour!\n\nSome could say, a brewery tour is a brewery tour is a brewery tour. Yes, but! You can tell the enthusiasm from the staff here and the pride in their immaculate vats and equipment. We got to walk into their giant refrigerator. The entire plant and building is spotless. The tour probably lasted 45 minutes, mostly because our group kept asking questions and bantering back and forth. \n\nAt the end, there is a little souvenir store with their merchandise, I really wanted the Wisco shaped cheeseboard!\n\nThe special event was a wedding reception and the staff were handing out pieces of leftover wedding cake.\n\nThere are high top chairs and tables you could sit, or lounge on their sofas. They do not serve food here, but are very dog friendly! I picture bringing the dog inside during the hot summer time after the dog park in the near future!
