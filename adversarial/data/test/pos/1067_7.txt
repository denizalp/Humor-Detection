Wasn't pleased with my reading. Everything that was said seemed like general guessing, and was completely off from who I am, \"oh you love flowers don't you\" no I do not. Also said she was connecting with my grandfather on the other side. Both of my grandfathers are still alive, and said that the grandfather she was connecting with was telling her qualities about me, I have only met my mothers father a handful of times let alone he is still living. I came to Terri because of the good reviews I saw on Yelp so I decided that I would write one on my experience so hopefully this doesn't happen to anyone else. Not one thing that she said\/guessed about me was accurate and anything that I could somewhat connect to what she was saying was very general. Very disappointed
