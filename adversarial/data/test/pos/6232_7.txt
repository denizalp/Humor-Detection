This place was recommended to me by a friend who had only had the cocktails at the bar but said it was worth trying the various vodkas.  We thought well, as long as we are doing it we should get a dinner reservation.  \n\nThis is located in Mandalay Bay near the wedding chapel, my friend said after he took his girlfriend there she wanted to go over to the chapel and get married so, folks, be aware of that potential hazard.\n\nWe entered in and walked through the bar to the dining area.  The dining area and bar was decorated with interesting Russian theme chandeliers and other decor.\n\nThe YS ordered a flight of vodka (four shots) that came in a red square of ice to keep it chilled.  That was the most fun trying all of those and the cool way they had of presenting it.\n\nWe of course being the model customers had to have drinks, dessert and appetizers because you know that's where they make their money.  It was all so eloquently done we hardly minded the $200 that was to come by later.  \n\nThis was a Tuesday night and early (by Vegas standards 6pm) so we had a few other tables near us but not a packed house, which was nice.\n\nJoseph was our server and he completely knew his craft and he was present without being invasive.\n\nI had salmon and it was quite well prepared and not overpriced.\n\nAll in all I would try it again when I'm on the south end of the strip.
