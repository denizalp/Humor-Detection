Went in with a party of 6 around 5:30pm. Took about 5-10 minutes for a drink order to be placed. Didn't get asked to order entree until being there for probably 25-30 minutes. Food was alright, overly salted. Service was absolutely horrible. We were never asked how our food was. We asked for our bill three times and it took 40 minutes to show up (which was supposedly being done by the owner). They refused to split our bill and coughed an attitude when we asked what was taking so long. Absolutely ridiculous service. Not worth it for the food at all. Do not go here.
