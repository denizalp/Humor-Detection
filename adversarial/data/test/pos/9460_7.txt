A.Y.C.E. SUSHI TILL YOU HAVE A KOMA.\n.\n**2018 Yelp 100 Challenge #5**\n.\nCute little place near where i live. Its much closer to me than Goyeomon so we thought we would try it out since a friend wanted to go. The interior is simple & small w\/ nice high ceilings & you are definitly not sooo close to each other that you could hear the next table gossip. \n.\nThe first time we ate here we LOVED it... the rice was PERFECT & the fish had that fresh texture that i love.\nThe second time we ate here we were OK w\/ it..... the rice was MUSHY but the fish was still that fresh texture that i love.\nThe THIRD time we came to eat here it was because my friend said he would buy us dinner since we haven't been eating out for 5 months so we decided why not go to AYCE sushi..... it was sooo DISAPPOINTING.... the fish was fishy and mushy... the rice was like eating mushy oatmeal... the tempura was DISGUSTINGLY cold & old & took FOREVER to come out.\n.\nService was GREAT the first two visits & our server was MELISSA.... the third time.... OMG ... my miso never came out until i asked 3x... my shrimp tempura never came out.... i asked for no carrots in my salads but all 3 of them had carrots.... \n.\nMaybe i will try ONE more time next year...
