We did this crawl for our friend's bachelor party. And all I can say is that by the end of the night, we lost one of the guys, bachelor was hammer and my buddy could barely walk.\nThe best part about the crawl is that we didn't have to wait in any lines for the bars\/clubs. That alone was well worth the cost of the ticket.
