I called this cab for a 5 am ride to the airport from my workplace. My cell phone was broken at the time, and I don't have a home phone. I explained all of this to the person taking my appointment, and she became belligerent. She asked where I was calling from, if I don't have a home phone. She accused me of prank calling, because I don't have a home phone - this argument is patently absurd. She even said that she doesn't know me, I could be at a club at 5 am rather than waiting in front of my house for the taxi that I was calling 18 hours in advance for.\n\nIn the end, I straight up asked her: \"so, is this going to be a problem or can you come get me? I can call another company if you really can't do it.\" She replied that there were no guarantees. Of course, I asked what that meant. Then I said, \"look, is someone coming tomorrow or not? Just tell me if you're not coming, so I can call another company.\" She said, finally, yes, someone will be there between 5:15 and 5:45, and I told her that I'd wait outside and described my house (fire hydrant, irish flag, etc.). At that point she appeared to have stopped listening.\n\nOf course, I was outside from 5 until 5:55, and no one showed. I took the bus with my 100 lbs of luggage (this was Christmas time, and I had lots of presents for my family). When I got to my family's place, I called back to make sure they hadn't sent someone I missed. What do you know, no record of the call! So that woman was messing with me, she didn't even put in a request! \n\nWhen I asked to complain, the person who answered the phone refused to take the complaint, saying it was their policy to take a phone number so it couldn't have happened. She refused to call a supervisor. They basically screwed me over, then spat on me.\n\nShe answered Henderson\/Whittlesea. I assume that Whittlesea is the same company, with the same horrible service and complete disregard for their patrons and basic customer service.
