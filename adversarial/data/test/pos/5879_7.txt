My name is Kelly \nI got a belly \nto eat some good food\nwith staff that aint rude\n\nsha sha shibuya role call.\n\nMy name is Gina \nI like food Lean-a\nthe sushi's real fresh\nand the flavors all mesh\n\nsha sha shibuya role call.\n\nmy name is cheryl* \ni drink by the barryl\ni am so damn full\ni need to fart. \n\n*crickets* Ok that's as far as we got. \n\n\nThe summer menu was only $60.00 a person and it consisted of enough food to feed an army. Again, my diligent attempt at self control did not prevail. As each beautiful dish was placed upon us, my eyes glazed, hands shifted and my mouth moved faster than a fat kid runs to cake.  All in a lady-like way of course...Anyway the food was indeed delicious and innovative, ambiance was beautiful and the fish was fresh. I especially enjoyed the appetizers of sashimi and the pork tenderloin with its amazing soft and almost creamy texture.  Bill came close to $500.00 for the 7 of us. Really, not bad for the amount of food we got! \n\n*Real names have been changed for embarassment purposes
