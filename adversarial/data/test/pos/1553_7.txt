Should be a 1.5  Stars (F+)\n\nWent to watch some Sunday football, only TV playing my team was in the back bar. (Way back!) out of the 12 + TVs in the place you would think they could display a little diversity. The service was horrible!!! The worst service I've experienced in a few years. The poor service wasn't limited to our table either. A gentlemen at the bar got a burger minus the actual burger.  Fries, bun, lettuce, tomato, no meat!  I have no clue how the dish made it out of the kitchen.  Our drink order took a good 15 minuets and our server forgot half of our orders. We ordered a few munchies which also took far too long. We had to request water, napkins, and silverwear. While our food sat waiting. Throughout our meal we never saw a manager to discuss our frustrations.  \n\nThe food was average. Weirderedchips and salsa, poratoe skins, calamari, chicken quesadilla. The chips were stale, salsa similar to store bought. Potatoe skins were poor. The calamari gets a B. The chicken quesadilla gets an A however. \n\nAll in all we left very disapointed and will not be returning due to unacceptable service.
