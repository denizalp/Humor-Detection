Overall a great venue! Especially that we saw Bruno Mars there!\n\nAnywhere you sit or stand the stage is of clear view! \n\nTwo things I wasn't a fan of though :\n1) When everyone's getting into the music and they're jumping--- the whole venue bounces!!! I guess you just get the full effect of the concert but I just found it weird!\n2) Drink prices at the bars were up the ass!! $19 for RedBull Vodka?! -____-\n\nOther than those two things! I still had a great time!!
