Went in for summer performance tires and rims because they always have great sales.\n\nTheir wait room has multiple iPods setup, a TV, various magazines and a free pop fridge.\n\nI guess that's the smoking mirror for their lack in quality service.These guys didn't balance the car properly after the installation which led the car to shake at about 100 clicks.  Had to go back in to correct it - annoying! According to a mechanic, professionals should be able to get this right the first time.  I guess you really do get what you pay for.\n\nThree stars since they were apologetic and fixed the problem right away free of service.  Also, there were no issues when winter tires were installed in a previous visit. Their price point would make me consider returning again.
