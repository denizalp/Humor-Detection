First  timer here, located south of the 215 freeway and located in a strip center where there was ample parking. Being it was a hot summer evening \n\nI was pleased once viewing the gelato selection and the owner introduced herself as she offered me various  samples. The baked items case also caught my eye with macaroons .\n\nI ended up selecting the white chocolate gelato with macadamia nuts and a coconut macaroon - both were delish and definitely fixed my sweet tooth.\n\nOverall a satisfying dessert after dinner. Im looking forward to returning next time I visit Las Vegas.
