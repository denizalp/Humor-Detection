This establishment operates on the concept of the \"Indian work lunch\". It is best that you pre-order at least one day ahead and have them deliver to you the next day. This is not the place you order on the same day and expect a quick turn around in 20 minutes. The kitchen opens at 11:30am. So even if you place an order earlier than that, expect some serious wait time. If you want food delivered, you have to call one day ahead because they need to arrange it with  their deliver guy.\n\nFood: \nTiffin specializes in north Indian style cuisine. That means...get your dosa at Taste of Kerala in Mayfield Heights.\n\nThe owner's mom cooks all the food. It's very home-made. Another reason that the food here takes time.\n\nWhat I order here: Mutter Paneer. Butter chicken. Paratha. When ordering, I emphasize I want non spicy at all. Not even mild, just zero spiciness. \n\nGoat curry available on Friday only, because it takes 4 hours to make.
