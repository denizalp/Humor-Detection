This review is for all you Westerners out there!  You'd be wise to read this review to understand what you're in for here.\n\nThe good\nClean, spacious, and inexpensive.\nA number of different options with steam rooms, treatments, etc.\nJacuzzi was perfect temperature and water press was good everywhere.\n\nOkay, the strange and unusual\nFirst, they allow kids in this place, and there were a number of rug rats running around.  I don't feel particularly good with 6 year olds that aren't my issue running around at schwantz level looking at my crotch area.  Might be cool in other cultures, but definitely queers the vibe.\nSecond, they have a restaurant located on the second floor.  Didn't try any of the food, but I'm not a huge fan of smelling kalbi while I'm trying to relax after a steam shower.  Food is a good idea, I just wouldn't have anything cooked to serve.  \nThird, this is a Korean spa, so all the televisions are on Korean channels, whose programming is strange.  Would like to have seen more screens for all the new years day bowl games.\nFinally, because this is Korean joint, all the men(and woman according to my girlfriend who also visited the woman's spa) do not shave, so it looks like a jeri curl convention in there, which is also unattractive.  Massage I got was pretty good, but not cheap at 90.00 for an off strip joint.  I get 45 dollar Thai massages here in LA that blow away every massage I've ever had around the world, some costing up to 200 bucks.
