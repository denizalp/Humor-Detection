It's a 5 for Subway. After many road trips, I have learned that not all Subways are the same. I have seen impeccably clean and I have seen roaches scampering across the floor (that was off I-95 in Georgia). This Subway is clean and sports a 97.5 rating on that front. That's not All-Star Subway status, but it's a solid performance.\n\nAs you can see from the picture, I got a turkey sandwich and a chocolate chip cookie. I actually got two chocolate chip cookies because I brought one home for my son. Little did he know, I ate the one with more chocolate chips. Evil? Debatable. When chocolate chip cookies are around, I might have a chance at fighting off John Cena.\n\nIf you're cruising on I-77 on an interstate trip, have never even heard of Huntersville, and you're searching for a good Subway to \"fill up,\" then this spot should be strongly considered. \n\nImportant Note: This location always has soft chocolate chip cookies. The Subway off Ex. 23 does not.
