Wow. Just wow. \n\nI have to say the lack of customer service and communication in this place is mind blowing. \n\nI called yesterday to ask if I could exchange a smaller frame for a larger frame. I mentioned twice that I didn't have a receipt and the that frame was unwrapped from the plastic... \"No worries, you're replacing it for a more expensive frame so it doesn't matter\", this is what I was told. They even held the frame for me, put my name on it, and left a note stating the situation. \n\nThe next day, I come in and found out that all of the above can't be done? Really? There's a note from the manager stating my situation on the actual frame I'm buying. The clerk states... \"I still can't do it, unless my manager OKs it\". Umm, isn't that note on the frame a form of \"OKing\"? He also says he couldn't do it anyway because he doesn't know the SKU number for the frame... Can't he look that up? \n\nI ended up calling another location to get the SKU number for him. As I start to give him the SKU number, he just looks at me and does the transaction anyway without the SKU!... \"My manager got back to me, you're good\"... WTF? When did he get back to you?, I've been here the whole time! Oye. \n\nThe icing on the cake is that the clerk tells me they're closing this location in a few weeks anyway. So this whole manager verification thing doesn't even matter because Aaron Brothers on Sunset is closing its doors. Clerk dude, you're a d**k. \n\nThey get two stars instead of one because the one cent sale is awesome and my framed Bride of Frankenstein piece looks great.
