I needed a compressor replaced but wound up going with another company that could do the work sooner for about $200 less.  Also, when I got the estimate, I asked for the Yelp 10% discount that they offer in their posting and I was told they were already giving me a discounted price.  Really?  Why was another company's non-discounted price so much cheaper?   Also, they never told me in advance that they would be charging me for an estimate.  They charged $49 for the estimate, but shouldn't they have told me that upfront?   The second company said they would not charge me for an estimate regardless of whether I went with them.
