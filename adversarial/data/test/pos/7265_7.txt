There were no signs on how to get there since the place is newly opened. Some of the casino employees didn't even know what we were talking about. You have to go up the escalators to the 2nd floor of the Aria and head in the direction of the buffet. The restaurant is before the buffet on the right, next to Jean Georges Steakhouse. They have a few tables outside of the restaurant but since it's inside the Aria, that's the closest to outdoor seating that you're going to get. The dress is business casual. Love the liquor rack over the bar. Simply gorgeous! BTW, HH is daily from 5-7PM in the bar area only. Spacious with very simple but classic decor and very dim lighting. The fancy bathrooms are in the back corner, close to the kitchen on the side of the entrance. \n\nBF was very skeptical about coming here because he is not a Michael Mina fan (he's been to a few of his other restaurants and wasn't impressed). One of my foodie besties went for Valentine's Day and loved it so I was able to convince him to go here with the group. Initially I had wanted to just come here for HH but we all had evening shows to attend so we had a late dinner reservation.\n\nOur Order on 2\/28\/2015\nFoie Gras Parfait: ($15) Ruby Port Gelee, Grilled Country Bread\nDuck a l'orange: ($13) Wood-grilled Wings, Blood Orange, Sauce Maltaise\nOnion Soup Grainee: ($14) Add Perigord Truffle, Braised Oxtail & Soft Poached Egg ($25)\n8oz Filet Mignon: ($54) Topped with Bearnaise \/ Au Poivre \/ Foie Gras Butter and server w\/ Beef Fat Fries\nLe Steakburger: ($19) Prime Rib Patty,, Comte Cheese, Garlic Aioli, Watercress, Bordelaise Onions & Hand-cut Fries\nParisian Gnocchi: ($23) Wild Mushrooms, Goat Cheese, Roasted Garlic\nCroque Madame: ($18) Pain de Mie, Paris Ham, Gruyere Fondue, Oranic Egg\nSauteed Skate Wing: ($29) Wood-Roasted Cauliflower Puree, Caper-brown Butter, Lemon\nCarlsbad Mussels Marinieres: ($26) Garlic Butter Dolin Vermouth, Warm Baguette\nOak-Fired Duroc Pork Chop: ($36) bacon Lardons, Baby Carrots, Potato Puree, Grain Mustard\nPotato Puree\nRed - Glass: ($16) Bouchard Bourgogne Rouge, Burgundy, France 2013. fleshy strawberry and black cherry notes overturned black soil and baking spices\nPinot Noir - Bottle: ($133) Domaine Faively 2009.

While it was good, I would've liked more of the Gelee to go with it to balance it out more. There wasn't enough bread to eat with the foie gras so I used the complimentary bread which was fine. We ordered an order of the Duck a l'orange for the table that everyone devoured because they all really enjoyed it. Our friends who ordered the Onion Soup thought that it was amazing (it looked and smelled really good too!).\n\nI had the Sauteed Skate which I would say it was more fried. I had wanted something fairly light since I had all the foie gras earlier in the meal and was a bit disappointed in the skate. It still tasted pretty good (just a bit on the dry side). Loved the pureed cauliflower. Tried some of the BFs Filet Mignon w\/ Foie Gras Butter. He wasn't going to have any sauce but I wanted to try the butter so he asked for it on the side. It was ok but the filet mignon tasted better on its own (which is how it should be). Tried a bite of my friend's gnocchi and thought it was very tender and pretty good. Not the best I've had like in an authentic Italian restaurant though.\n\nAbsolutely amazing service! Even though we had a late dinner reservation that was close to their closing time, we never once felt rushed. Our chairs were pulled out for us and when someone left the table, our napkins were still folded when we came back. Plates and drinks constantly refilled. The wine list is long so the waiter had the sommelier come by to assist in picking a bottle. The sommelier tried to sell the table a $2k bottle, even though we wanted a mid-range bottle so that wasn't to helpful initially. Ended up with a really good bottle though (I'm not a wine drinker and thought it was easy to drink).\n\nApparently this dinner (and one later in the weekend) got me nominated in picking all the Vegas meals in the future. Would definitely come back. Hopefully for HH next time. Want to try the marrow & escargot!
