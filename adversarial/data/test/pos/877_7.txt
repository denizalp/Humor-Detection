Fantastic local bar with well above \"bar food\" food!  As soon as I walked I could smell the sweet aroma of perogies (and NOT smoke!).  I knew I was in polish heaven!  \n\nNot only was the bartender extremely friendly, but so were all the patrons!  We even got a free drink from a happy patron (his b ball team won that night).  Score!\n\nI went in sorta hungry and sorta wanting to try the food everyone has been raving about, but not sure.  Well, I kept staring at the dudes stuffed cabbage next to me to the point that I was probably starting to make him feel awkward.  So I decided it was gonna happen.  I was gonna order me some polish food!  \n\nI had to do the whole shebang!  And seriously, $1.99 for each for stuffed cabbage (3 min) and $.99 for pierogies (3 min), how could I say no!  They have three different perogies, cheese and potato, sauerkraut and cottage cheese. You want to know the amazing thing?  Instead of having to order your choice in 3's, you can have one of each!  So I ordered them all, for the sake of trying, of course!  They were all delish, with my fav being a toss up b\/n the tater and sauerkraut.  \n\nWait, this is a bar?! Who cares about the beer when you can have excellent polish food!  Obviously you know where my heads at!  I can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu.  They don't call it the \"Polish Party House\" for nothing.  Let the food party begin!
