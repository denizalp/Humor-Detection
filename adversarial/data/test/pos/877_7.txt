It is offical, I have been converted to the Retro style of making AWESOME CUPCAKES!\n\nHoly sheep these people put a lot of frosting on their cupcakes- but it is SO good! And their toppings make you want to smash your face into a wall, it's so cool.\n\nI tried the Cotton Candy cupcake which is a vanilla cake with, DUH, cotton candy pink frosting on tip and GLITTER!! Screw carnivals, if I need a cotton candy fix I'm going here. \n\nTheir prices are at this moment a bit lower than some other places- and they make cakes. Awesome. Cakes.
