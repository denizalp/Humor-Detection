One of the things I truly love about Phoenix is their coffee culture and when it's supporting small, local businesses I support them 100%\n\nUrban Beans is a coffee shop that not only serves coffee, but has a wine bar and pastries. There's ample amounts of space to sit inside and a patio facing 7th street that's great for lounging.\n\nOrdered a Chai Latte and tried Anthony L.'s Latte- the pours are generous! Don't let the lack of latte art fool you, their coffee is bold and true. I enjoyed my Chai, it wasn't watered down like how it is at Lux and had a good amount of spice that wasn't too light nor spicy- sorry extra spicy Chai lovers. It tasted like Christmas and felt like a hug from the inside out.\n\nDefinitely a great spot!
