***UPDATE***\n\nAfter my experience was brought to the attention of Happy Dental, I must say they worked hard to make changes. I did leave and go to another office but it was financially easier to stay.. I had went back to them and I have to say the improvement was amazing.  Everyone was very friendly including the staff, and not just towards me but to all of their customers.  I do appreciate their ability to improve and it hasnt gone unnoticed!  Now I have no problems reffering anyone to this office! \n\n\nSo done with this place! \nI have been coming here for about 9 months- I had a routine check up and then some fills before I got braces. Everything was just \"okay\" until my wait times started getting longer and the front desk staff started getting more rude. \nIm all about time management- so if I have an appointment at 430pm I dont appreciate when at 5pm im asking  how much longer and im being told I have 2 people ahead of me! Unacceptable!  And everytime I go in the girls are bullshi**ing and laughing and having full blown personal conversations on the office phone about their baby daddy drama and how so and so is in jail!\n\nI hope I can switch desntists in the middle of having my braces on
