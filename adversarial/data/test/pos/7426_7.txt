Here's The Scoop: This was such a wonderful find. After returning our rental we were looking for someplace to go for lunch. We walked through the mall and discovered this place. Beautiful decorations and lovely booth seating. The food was awesome. The food was setup buffet style. Everything on the menu was delicious! the Chicken Tikka, Garlic Naan, Chicken Biryan, Veggies  and Samosas were very good. We would definitely come here during our stay in Vegas. Beautiful decorstions and comfortable booths adorn interior.
