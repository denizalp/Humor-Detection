If I could give this place 4.5 stars I really would. It is so close to perfection for me, so I am being slightly generous with my half a star but I'm ok with it. For one, the bakery is amazing. Seriously, some of the most delicious vegan desserts I have ever had. It has taken first place away from my favourite vegan bakery ever located in Washington, DC that is so good that it has gotten award after award (even by non-vegans.) I have been dairy free for over 4 years now and I always appreciate amazing pastures that make me forget I even have an allergy. \n\nAnyway, pastries aside Community has the best selection of vegan products I have been able to find so far. I was able find multiple varieties of vegan cheese, milk, and yogurt. They even have locally made vegan cheese spread. The fake-meat products are a little lacking but I did appreciate the reasonable price of tofu. Also, the salad bar has quality ingredients and a good variety. The only reason I would minus half a star is that the fresh produce section could be a bit more robust. That being said, I found about everything I wanted so even my complaints there aren't that tenable. \n\nIt's not a very big store, so I don't know if I would be able I exclusively shop there, but I do know that I would drive across town for this place.
