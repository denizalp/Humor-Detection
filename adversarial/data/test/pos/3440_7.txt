This review is SOLELY for the makeup mastery of Michelle at the YSL counter.  I totally don't know why I didn't remember to write a review sooner since my trip was in the summer.\n\nI love MAC products, but let's admit it, many of the girls who work there themselves and on their customers cake the makeup on!  I love having that sexy nighttime smokey eye look, but if I went to MAC to get my makeup done it would be 1000 times more intense and probably take a lot longer to wash off.  \n\nMichelle knows her stuff, she actually used to work at MAC awhile back; so she can give you that MAC look without caking on the makeup!  She gave me the best makeover for two nights in a row for the clubs.  I kept receiving compliments all night and had way better Vegas b-day pictures because of her.  Go see visit her at the YSL counter, she's so sweet and talented.  She'll make you look so damn hot!
