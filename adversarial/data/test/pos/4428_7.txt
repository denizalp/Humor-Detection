I have said it before and I will say it again. The Japanese establishments need to stop being so Japanese confusing and get some order and discipline. In short, they need to think more in terms of customers and less in regards to their complicated minds.\n\nI dropped by today at the maid cafe location not for a show, but to pick up some pastry. The poster outside showed and listed a range of products (cheese tart, yuzu tart, etc.), but of course they do not carry those items. The maid at the counter explained I would have to go to the original location for those. She was friendly and polite, but that is confusing. Why advertise something this location does not have?\nSecondly, a piece of paper on the door advises customers to go upstairs as the kitchen\/booth downstairs is closed. \nThirdly, the working hours are pure Japanese. Compare this to a Chinese business whose opening hours are typically something like this: every day from 10:00 am to 11:30 pm. Here (like so many other Japanese businesses) it went something like this:\nTo buy a cake (incidentally don't look to buy what we advertise outside): Mondays and Tuesday 10:30 to 2:00, Wednesdays 7:00 to 7:15 and Weekends all days except during the lunar crescendo then we will limit hours according to the will of Buddha. \nTo buy a madeleine: Mondays 10:45 to 14:00 (except cold days), Tuesdays 10:00 to 12:00 and again 13:00 to 16:15. Closed Wednesday and Thursdays, etc.\nCafe: Afternoons weekdays (except Mondays and Thursdays) and Saturdays most of the afternoon and Sundays less hours than that.\nI wish I had taken a photo of the, er, hours sheet on the door. \nIncidentally, it is a maid cafe with a stage show, but the show is as scarce as Donald Trump's brain power. \nAnyway, the maid at the counter was friendly and packaged my $10 original cheesecake (still no credit card, but they accept debit cards), which may be imported from the original location and was as light and fluffy as always, and told me how happy she was to work there. In all seriousness, I love hearing that because I support employers and businesses that tend to their employees.\nThe cafe itself was empty of course. You see, a limited assortment of baked goods for take-out only were for sale, but there was no dine-in when I was there. That follows a different operating hour than the take-out counter.
