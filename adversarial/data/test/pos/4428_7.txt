DO NOT BE FOOLED by the good reviews here, I am SURE they are written by the owners or staff.\n\nThe chicken here is terrible. I ordered a family meal ($60+) and was so very disappointed. The chicken was too oily, and the fries were dry. I ordered two philly cheese steak sandwiches on the side and they came on HOT DOG BUNS!!! It had melted CHEDDAR cheese and did not resemble philly cheese steak even remotely!\n\nI have no idea why people are rating this place high. They must be high.
