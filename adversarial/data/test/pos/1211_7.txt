If you can't even get a grilled cheese sandwich right, you might as well pack it in! We went there on a quiet Sunday afternoon. The heat wasn't working and the owner is practically incompetent in his food-preparation methods. The tea was lukewarm and never in my life have I seen a grilled cheese sandwich served burnt (thoroughly and on both sides) and squished to the point that it appeared to have been run over by a pick-up truck. A questionable and solitary sliced tomato was served alongside the burnt sandwich, and was peppered with a dried green herb of some kind. The sandwiches were also expensive--$5.25 each! To make matters worse, the owner used Kraft singles--something that I haven't seen done since 1977.
