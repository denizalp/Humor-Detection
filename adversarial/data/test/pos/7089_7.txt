So I played all three of the Summerlin city golf courses and already left a review on the other 2. This course was a good experience for me and it was all because of the customer service. This course has no drinking water anywhere on the course and of course i never saw a marshall anywhere giving water but thankfully the proshop guy gave me 2 waters before i went out and made sure the cart guy put an ice chest in my cart to keep them cold. The other 2 courses didn't give a rats ass about me out in 110 degree heat without any water. There weren't really any people on the course so that part was nice. The conditions were fine, decent greens, decent fairways (a lot of unfilled divots though), good t boxes, pretty terrible sand...but no biggie. \nWould i suggest people to play here? sure, it's cheap and fun, but with the experience i had at the other 2 courses, i would like nothing more than for this whole chain to go bankrupt.
