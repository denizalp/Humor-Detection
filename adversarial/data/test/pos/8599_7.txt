I've never had a bad room at the Omni and I've always enjoyed my stay at this hotel.  It's in a great location and with the \"T\" up the road you can get virtually anywhere you need to go fast and for free. This was my 4th stay at the Omni and over all it was just as great of an experience as always.\n\nI love that I know what to expect for parking, the garage across the street is $5 every time you leave. I also know I will not receive a complimentary breakfast, but hey there's a Starbucks so I can live with that! The rooms are always clean and staff is somewhat pleasant (about what you expect at a fancier hotel).\n\nBut employees\/managers of the Omni William Penn please explain to me why you have now decided to charge your customers $10-$15 to use the WIFI on top of the large some of money they pay just to sleep in your comfy beds? I can get free WIFI at a Super 8, at a Comfort Inn, at the Cambria Suites, or basically any hotel or motel in America. \n\nYou've always been a 5-star hotel. But I feel like you did me wrong this time.
