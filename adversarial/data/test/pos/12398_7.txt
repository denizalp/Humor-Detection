The All-Suite hotels in Vegas are my kind of thing.  The Palazzo at the Venetian is a great addition to an already glamorous resort.  \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/uGupeWqih0yIcCg8anM1PA?select=Bz6PhFb6nKwK-xoF4YhIng\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/uGupeWqih0yIcCg8anM1PA?select=JTmlnccqC0ysBGBOSise2Q\n\nWe stayed here at the Palazzo during our short  Pre-Christmas vacation.  The decorations of Grand Lobby and Registration were beautiful and non-conventional.  No traditional wreaths here. But still just as elegant! \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/uGupeWqih0yIcCg8anM1PA?select=g4sfQkRHet5A1DeehyGYFA\n\nIn comparison to the Venetian across the way, Palazzo has a more \"Modern\" feel to it, with dark brown color scheme in the rooms and contemporary flower art pieces and wallpaper surrounding.  \n\nThe ordinary suites are as spacious as can be...at around 700 square feet.  Upon entering the room, you are guided down a short little marble hallway passing the bathroom with separate toilet.  Dual-sinks, separate Deep soak tub, and spacious shower. \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/uGupeWqih0yIcCg8anM1PA?select=VB-PMUwon0sgh3Wxxf1DgA\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/uGupeWqih0yIcCg8anM1PA?select=0fDKmMg9OoMbZPDyXS32Yg\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/uGupeWqih0yIcCg8anM1PA?select=sluR6FsLPoyzZk5B8UDwQA\n\nThe room itself has three flat street TV's, one of them being in the bathroom above the sink area.  King bed was so comfortable, and formed to each party of you body, as you stink in.  \n\nThe Venetian trademark is their Sunken Living rooms--two steps down below from the main bedroom.  There is a very comfy L-Shaped couch that turns into a fold out bed.  \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/uGupeWqih0yIcCg8anM1PA?select=gNR436WO_1ELwOMaggaK2Q\n\nFor the most part, my stay here was pleasant and comfortable.  Employees were attentive, efficient with room service requests and very polite.  \n\nJust a few negatives...I wish that the housekeeping staff would've given an extra roll of toilet paper.  We kept having to request more.  Lol.  I also would've liked more toiletry amenities, as there were only the usual's like Shower cap, soaps, shampoo's.  I was expecting a bit more in terms of convenience when it comes to a high end hotel like this.  Housekeeping staff also did not restock toiletries on a daily basis, and only \"when needed.\"  They still should've restocked.  \n\nOverall, I had a wonderful time here at the Palazzo, this goes partly to the Canyon Ranch Spa and Health Club, that I will get much more into later!  =D\n\nBut  Y E S,  I will stay here again.
