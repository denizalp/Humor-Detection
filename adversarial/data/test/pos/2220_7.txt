I was in Shoe Heaven!!! Boots, Stilettos, Sandals, Shoes, Flats, Socks....Whatever you need, they got them. They have a large selection of Well Known Brands, and some Not So Well Known Brands. \n\nCustomer Service is Excellent. The Salespeople were attentive, and asked if we needed help with a shoe size, if there wasn't one available on the floor. \n\nI Believe there was a Men's Shoe Section as well, Sorry Guys I was glued to the Women's Side, lol!\n\nOff Broadway Shoes is located in Downtown Summerlin, I believe next to Nordstrom Rack.\n\nI did find a pair of Summer Sandals, as did my family! I will definitely be back  =)
