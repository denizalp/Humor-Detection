How many places do you know that serve sushi, burgers and burgushi (combine them both) in one restaurant? Exactly, none...for that reason Cowfish deserves a 5-star review. They back it up with their great food, menu and service. Been here at least 10 times and it's safe to say I've tried a lot of menu items. I usually sit at the bar because there's always a wait when I get there. Bartenders are knowledgeable and quick with their service. \n\nAs for the menu. The sushi is really good. Not as good as some specialty sushi restaurants around town, but the rolls are unique and large. Recommendation...ask the rolls to be cut in 10 pieces vs. 8 so they are more manageable. The burgers are really good. This is my favorite part of the place. The Green Monster burger has avocado, pepparjack and jalapenos on it! They're also at least 1\/2 pound...big! Choice of sides are abundant, but sweet potato fries are usually the norm. On a recent visit I went with the Ahi Tuna burger, which was very tasty and had a nice Asian slaw on it. \n\nBut for something unique and light, go with the bento box...definiately for lunch. Comes with 5 sections. Small (4 piece) roll of your choice (think there's 3-4 options), a mini burger of the day, sweet potato fries, edamame and cucumber salad. A little bit of everything for those that can't decide because the menu is so BIG. \n\nMy only two complaints are 1)the menu itself, as it's so big. Everything Ive had on it has been good, don't get me wrong...you just need a solid 5-10 minutes to look it over, hence the reason for multiple visits and 2) PBR tallboys are $5. From one who loves PBR, this is just a laughable price. I look forward to enjoying the large patio when the weather is warmer. This is the new hot spot of the Southpark area and it's well deserved.
