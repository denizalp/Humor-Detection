Well I guess I'm going to be in the minority here and say that I was somewhat disappointed.  Not too much, but a little.\n\nIt is ridiculously inexpensive, and for the money, I thought the food was decent.  We started with the homus.  I didn't think it was great, but it was okay.  The pita bread it was served with was nothing special, similar to the pita pockets from any supermarket.  The Arabic bread my lunch was served with was much better, a soft flat bread.  I had the chicken shawarma plate which was served with rice and tabouli.  The tabouli was very good, although I don't much care for tabouli in general...or rice.  So I'm not sure why I ordered the plate instead of the sandwich.  Maybe I just wanted to see more food on my plate.  That sounds like me.  The flavor of the shawarma was good, but I was really disappointed in the chicken.  It was everything from larger chunks of meat to itty bitty little scraps, mostly scraps.  But again, dirt cheap so you can only complain so much.\n\nWe also browsed in the grocery part and picked up some packaged goodies and 2 pieces of baklava.  Probably some of the best baklava I have had!  They were out of the pecan variety, but there was also almond, pistachio, and cashew to choose from.  It was something crazy like a buck a piece.\n\nOverall, I'm glad we went, and I would go again.  But I don't know I would go out of my way unless their dinner menu is different than the lunch menu, or I was seeking out the baklava.
