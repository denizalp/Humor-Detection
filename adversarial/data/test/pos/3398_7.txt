So, this place can only exist in Vegas! The fact that the nurses (servers) paddle patrons is AWESOME but probably wouldn't go over so well anywhere else. Lol loved the hospital gowns you have to wear, and hey, it protects your outfit! The menu is simple but legit: heart attack waiting to happen. The burger I ordered (one party only lol) was surprisingly good but I wouldn't call it the best burger I have ever had. The onion rings are a huge portion...insert your arteries clogging here. Two of us shared it and there were still more than half of the order left. The Blond Nurse beer is great and the best part, I got to sing karaoke on stage baby!!!! I showed them what's up!! Love it!!!
