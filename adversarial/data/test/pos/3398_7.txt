What I liked what the style of training they were trying to create- what I didn't was that it seemed to lack the small group feel of other similar gyms I've been to. The gym is very small. During the summer they also run kids classes at the same time which detracted from the overall experience. It wasn't for me, but I am sure there are many others who will love it.
