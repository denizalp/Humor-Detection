There's two people Pittsburgh that I truly trust when it comes to food, and Gaucho was the first restaurant that both of them mentioned as a must-visit for me.\n\nAnd they were right.\n\nWhether you're getting a sandwich, a salad, or a plate, be prepared for charred meaty goodness, and absolutely gigantic flavors.\n\nA few reasons I knew I was going to like Gaucho BEFORE I even got my food:\n\n1. There was a gang of grandmas on bikes leaving when we walked in. I've  never seen a gang of grandmas on bikes before, so as far as I know these grandmas only eat at Gaucho. Which seems like a strong endorsement.\n\n2. The nice young woman behind the counter was wearing a necklace\/scarf made of receipt paper, and making it look good. Basically, everyone that works here seems like they enjoy their job, which is always a good sign.\n\n3. The menu is full of all the things I want in my life.\n\nA few reasons I really, really loved Gaucho AFTER I got my food.\n\n1. The Carne Sandwich. This comes with your choice of steak; I went ribeye, which was a juicy, fatty, perfect medium rare, sliced up and slapped onto that amazing bread with char-grilled peppers. If they put more chimichurri on it, it would've been perfect. Luckily, they have jars of chimichurri* available. I put more on, and it was perfect.\n\n2. The Paletilla de Cordero. This is a roasted lamb shank with root vegetables in a phenomenal gravy, over grits, with a charred piece of bread to top it off. It is impossible to decide whether this dish was more beautiful or delicious, because it was so beautiful, and so delicious.\n\n3. The Gaucho Salad. This fresh and colorful salad is the exact thing to order on top of two disgustingly meaty dishes to make you feel like you didn't beast too hard at lunch. But you did. You really, really did.\n\n4. The sauces. Yes, the chimichurri is fantastic and I want to slather it on everything. But don't sleep on the other sauces! This joint knows flavor, and I would gladly drink the ajo, the pimenton, and of course, the always enigmatic quiquirimichi.\n\nIn case you didn't realize, my list of things I love after I got my food was all of my food. Because all the food here is delicious. Don't miss it.\n____________\n\n*It turns out chimichurri is autocorrected to 'chino hurry.' Which is racist, Apple. But chinos and everyone else should probably hurry to Gaucho before they run out of meat. (I don't think they ever run out of meat.)
