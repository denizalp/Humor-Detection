When Arizona Mills first opened, I was a fan of this massive one-story mall. But over the years, it's lost the appeal. While I still love some of the shops such as Shoe Pavilion, Bebe and the Saks Fifth Avenue outlet, it's very rare that I'll head to Arizona Mills unless it's a week day when it's a little more quiet.\n\nWeekends are  a nightmare here. It's g-h-e-t-t-o. The mall has become quite the high school hangout and it's a favorite with parents who flood the mall with their strollers and walk at an extremely slow pace.\n\nWhile it's great to have such a big mall near my pad, I'd rather make the drive to Fashion Square on the weekends.
