Villa Fresh Italian Kitchen - McCarran Airport (Terminal 1 \/ C-Gates)\n\nI am really jealous of all the travelers flying in and out of Terminal 3.  They have all the good restaurants.  When you're in Terminal 1, specifically the C-Gates, you're limited to a lot of fast food.  Villa Fresh Italian Kitchen is just another fast food restaurant inside the C-Gates.  Lunch and dinner is okay.  They have pizza, meatballs, and pasta.  I'll usually go with their wings for lunch or dinner.  I recommend Villa Fresh if you're here early enough for breakfast.  Their eggs, bacon, sausage, and pancakes is as good as you're going to get in this terminal.  Good Luck!
