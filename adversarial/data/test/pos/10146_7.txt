Top line auto services just that - top-of-the-line. I have had over a dozen services performed here and have been overly satisfied with every single one. Even one time when things I felt weren't fixed properly Chris told me to bring the truck back in and everything was fixed properly, promptly and with no extra charge. I have had everything from oil changes and tuneups, to front and alignments, bodywork and major engine work on my Chrysler 300 C. Chris also works wonders with diesel trucks. I have a Dodge 6.7 L Cummins diesel which many places have difficulty servicing; and I certainly won't go to the Steal-ership for any service issues. Chris and his team have been able to fix or maintain everything properly with my truck. Our Chrysler 300 C Hemi is so dialed in and running so mean and lean I couldn't be happier. Frankly, I was rather surprised to see some of the negative reviews here; however, once you read the negative reviews you can see what kind of wing nuts are writing them. Anyhow, I'm very happy and pleased every time I leave the top line parking lot with one of my vehicles.
