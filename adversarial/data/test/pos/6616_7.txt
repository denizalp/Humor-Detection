I really like Dr. Kennedy however if you go there be sure to question EVERYTHING before you sign the dotted line. I was charged for upgrades that were never discussed with me. They were hidden in the estimate and I was never told my insurance wouldn't cover it. I don't know if the Dr is aware of this but his billing staff is I'm sure padding patients bills over a years time makes for a nice bonus for her. She lost our business.
