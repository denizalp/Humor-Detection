I know it's the Casino and they got a lot of money and can afford to do whatever the H-E double hockey sticks they want, but I'm still not gonna bash them just cause they are big business cause the Sunday Brunch at this place is one of the best Sunday early eating decisions you could make.\n\nWe went here as a recovery meal after a long concert weekend.  It's worth $14.99 to eat on the patio or by the window alone, then you eat and realize this is what eating in heaven might feel like.\nGazing out at the river either from my hangover or the beauty I couldn't help but think \"this is the best eggs Benedict and country fried steak I've had in a long time\", and that is just the tip of the ice burgh (yes with GH).  \n\nAwesome French toast, bacon by the boatload and all the eggs a bodybuilder needs, breakfast isn't the only option on this brunch buffet.  You want some general tso's at 11am? Go right ahead!  Sushi? Sure!  Pasta and Pizza, early carb session? Why not!  Better yet take my around the world for brunch tour and every plate get something different.  Eggs and bacon for one plate, and pesto on the next!  They also mix a pretty mean mimosa and for $6.99 you can even add some crab legs or prime rib!  End this journey with a trip through sweets and get the awesome creme brûlée!!  \n\nCorporate entity or not, the Sunday Brunch Buffet is one to go out of your way for if you live or are visiting in Pittsburgh.  Never went on any other day, but I'm sure it's just as good.  When you're all done, hit up a table and win your money back!  Free lunch and a food time, win\/win!!  (Unless you lose)
