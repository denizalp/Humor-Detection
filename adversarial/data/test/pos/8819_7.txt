In the multicultural landscape of the GTA, it wasn't surprising that a french themed party would be followed by a Chinese themed after party! Teacher Jen K, gave us a rope which we dutifully followed, much like day care toddlers, to Ding Tai Fung (DTF). Boy was the after party one big mouthgasm!\n\nThanks to our supreme leaders and knowers of all good dishes at DTF, Jen K and Wayne C, we ordered a bunch of tasty morsels: soup dumplings, steamed buns, chinese broccoli,spicy porky belly, shanghai noodles, kung pao shrimp,drunken chicken and dessert! I know it sounds like a lot, and it was quite a lot, but there's nothing like getting a bunch of foodies together who've just had their appetites whetted with light and airy snacks (aka sugary and buttery cookies, cupcakes and alcohol)!\n\nThe soup dumplings were amazeballs: gotta snip one corner of the dreamboat, suck the juice out and then munch on the delicious meat. It's quite a task doing all this with a pair of chopsticks. Medical schools should include this in training programs for surgeons; it'll enhance the dexterity of their fingers!\n\nThe pork and chive dumplings were standout and the pork belly was very succulent and flavorful. The Chinese broccoli was deliciously garlicky. Unfortunately, the shrimp wasn't as spicy as I thought it'd be given that it had red chillies. I forget what the drunken chicken was drunk in, but it was an Asian version of a cold cut. The bun desserts with condensed milk were a nice palette cleanser.\n\nI was so engrossed in eating my way through the food we had ordered, and too busy trashing Tiesto to pay much attention to the spartan surroundings or the service. I did notice that the place was pretty full when we got there quite late on a Sunday evening. I am not surprised and agree, that DTF is totally worth the trip uptown.\n\np.s. I felt bad for Jen K and Wayne C because they didn't seem to be eating much, they were too busy ordering for us and ensuring that our plates were never empty. Thanks you two for an awesome time!\n\np.p.s. The dumplings and buns at DTF totally put those at CPFD (Crown Princess Fine Dining) to shame.
