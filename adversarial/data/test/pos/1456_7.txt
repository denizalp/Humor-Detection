I give this store a 4 but my intentions were to write a bad review for the 130th Avenue location.  I stopped in a few days ago to purchase a product that I had seen on online Sally, a lady came and stood beside me staring but not saying anything and finally asked if I needed help, I asked my question and she grabbed something off the shelf, handed it to me and went on to the next person.  After looking at the product it was safe to say that she had not listened to what I told her I wanted and she assumed it was something else.  I proceeded to wait and then ask if this was actually what I asked for and it wasn't but to make a long story short, this lady was the manager of the store, while I had been shopping I heard her speak to somebody in a really unacceptable manner, she obviously had no clue what she was doing and giving out poor advice to people and recommending products without listening.  She was rude, condescending and even though I live maybe 10 minutes away from the 130th store I will travel to the Sunridge Way location anytime to enable never setting eyes on this disgustingly rude, fried haired character ever again.
