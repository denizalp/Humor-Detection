I had a great time at the Beverly Hills location and was excited to see Scottsdale offer a summer special: $40 with dessert. Even though I ate a lot, I was underwhelmed by my dining experience. \n\nWhen eating out, I expect service to correlate with the price point of a meal. Fogo's service should be approaching outstanding. At the very least, I shouldn't be questioning throughout: Where is our waiter? Are they going to bring more sides? Are they going to clear our plates? We've been sitting here a while, are they going to offer dessert? Seems like they don't want us to pay, should we dine and dash? At least our water server kept our glasses full.  We ended up just asking him for more sides and he happily filled our request. Props to him because our waiter was useless: unwelcoming,  not personable, not attentive.\n\nOn to the food: the salad bar looked fresh and I enjoyed having some greens to munch on between meats and carbs.  The polenta fries had a nice crunch.  The bananas (what happened to thick plantains?) were good but didn't have a nice crispy exterior.  The cheese bread though is amazing, especially when hot. I could eat these all night, every night.  They probably get a star for the bread alone.  The meats were variable.  The lamb was very gamey and I usually love lamb. Some meats were very salty, especially the pork ribs.  I found the beef ribs to be a bit dry. I liked the different sirloin cuts.  My friends found some meats to have huge chunks of fat - I don't mind that because I like the flavor and texture. Just cut them off if you don't, no big deal.  Sausage and chicken were also flavorful. No sight of ribeye all night. I did have a problem with the gauchos not knowing what medium-rare looks like. They kept giving me medium to medium-well even after they slice a piece and checked it. Why even bother asking me what I prefer if they're not going to give the right temp? I wouldn't have ordered dessert if it didn't come free with the summer special. Seemed mass-produced and overly sweet.\n\nFunny thing is that the wait team was very attentive to the larger table next to us. I overheard a patron there raving to his first-timer guests about how the food and service are ALWAYS wonderful here and how he ALWAYS has a great time. Wish I had the same experience. I'll take my money elsewhere for a pricey night out.  \n\nI was going to give 3 stars until I realized that was \"A-OK\" and 2 stars is \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" Sorry Fogo, you were a 2 that night. Thanks for reading my Fogo essay.
