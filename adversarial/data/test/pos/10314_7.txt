We came from CA to visit family we almost never see. We stayed 3 nights total. I'd never been to Las Vegas before so driving in at 1 am was interesting. \n\nVALET: For one thing, there was only one valet working and the sign said the valet parking was full. I was worried that my Mercedes would get broken into so something overnight, so I waited 20 minutes to check it in. I have no idea how long it took for it to get parked.\n\n**UPDATE: I needed something out of my car after I checked it with the valets but before they parked it. They guy came up to me and asked why I needed the key. TO MY OWN CAR. Then I asked him kindly to cover the front seats with towels (on the console) after he parked, and he said that he knows how to do his job and I should just let him do it. I didn't ask him to go out of his way, or for anything unreasonable. Then he stormed off in a huff. I couldn't believe it.  My exact response was, \"what the hell--did that just happen?\" My friend and I tried to complain but the only response we got was, \"he has a dry sense of humor,\" and, \"that's just him.\" Seriously? It's MY car. I'm entitled to my key whenever I want it. And the car was still sitting at the check-in area. Also, my interior is leather and cherry wood (and valet parking is not covered), so it isn't like I'm over protective of my vehicle.  Customer service is not a priority of this hotel. PS it was a tall Romanian guy who had a whitewashed Jersey douche-like accent.**\n\nWe went to our friend's place in the morning. It took half an hour to find a valet to get my car. And returning was a clusterfuck. Again there was no room in valet parking and the drive ins were both blocked. But we already checked into the hotel. So they had us go around to the employee side and leave it by the door. I didn't tip them at any point.\n\nSTAFF: At 1am it was slow. It took 5 minutes to check in. Our porter was nice. He helped us unload our car and brought our bags into our room. He didn't try to sell us anything, which was a plus. Throughout our trip were were constantly hounded by timeshare people. We also encountered some less-than friendly gambling employees. I had my friend take a picture of my first casino bet ever and they yelled at me and told me to put my camera away. I can take all kinds of pictures of the place but not of myself gambling. I don't get it.\n\nROOM: we were on the 27th floor in Tower 1. My first thought was, in Marty McFly's voice, \"27th Floor?!\" I really hoped to have a view of the strip but not really. We saw the back of the castle thingy and a piece of New York New York. The window from the elevator faces Luxor.\n\nWalking in it smelled musty but not offensive. It was like a simple outdated motel kinda scent. That said, this is Las Vegas. I expected it to look and feel cleaner than it did. The linens may not have been clean, as there was a sign in the bathroom saying they only change sheets on request. The beds, artwork, and curtains were old and didn't match the castle decor,  making me wonder if the casino floor had been reorganized at some point. There was also a message on the phone advertizing the spa ($100 Swedish massages). We passed.\n\nWhen we booked through AAA, we were told there would be a mini fridge. There wasn't one. This was a problem as we brought all our food to save money. Believe me--we went through a lot of ice. Same for the wifi. At booking we were told it was free but our cell phones struggled to access google until we went across the Luxor for Bodies and Titanic.\n\nThe bathroom was...clean enough. I noticed a hole in the wall where the doorknob would hit. I guess they never had a bumper there. The shower doesn't have a place to put things inside other than a tiny ledge for soap. The ice bucket was sterile stainless steel but there was no coffee maker. Were also only given one shampoo, one conditioner, one liquid soap, and one bar soap. I thought it's standard for hotels to provide 2 of each. Also, there is a fan in the bathroom, but it is so inneffective will be hazy and the mirror will be fogged when you get out. I found this highly annoying, as my time was short and I didn't want to clean a huge mirror. The mirror itself had signs of water damage around the edges.\n\nLastly, I took the stairs once and I found a used condom in the stairwell. Viva Las Vegas? No. Not a good sign.\n\nOVERALL: This place clearly hasn't aged well. The walls have dents. The floors need replacing. The amenities are overstated. The gambling mostly sucks as all the machines are standard. The gambling employees are a big negative. And parking and valets suck. I'd give this place negative stars if I could.\n\nPhotos coming soon.
