So when I was eating pizza in the food court which was on the second level I noticed a Haagen Dazs. I knew right away I wanted some asap so once I was done with my pizza I went and got a Dolce de leche. You could either get a small or a large so I got the small because I was pretty full from the pizza.\n\nMartha who worked there was friendly enough to tell me when they closed because I was thinking of coming back again later on that night. I was really excited to eat my ice cream which looked so delicious just check out my pictures.\n\nIf I'm in Vegas again I will definitely come here and even though the prices are a little high I think it's well worth it.
