Good tequila selection with a tequila bar in the back. We were here on the day where the terminal 4 was closed for 4 hours for bomb threat.\n\nThousand of people got stuck here. People was frustrated. The line to he here so we could get a tequila shot while smelling everyone else's sweat! \n\nChaotic!
