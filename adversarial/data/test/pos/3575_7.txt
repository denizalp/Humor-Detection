Walima Cafe was such a disappointment.... The website, menu and even the decoration show a lot of promise... for some yummy Moroccan food.... \n\nThe only good part of the meal aside from the deco... yes I just love those cushion sofa type seatings... was the Harissa (hot sauce)!! My yelp dinner mates just drowned everything in the Harissa to give some kick and spice to the food. \n\nGrilled Merguez - Moroccan style sausages served with Harissa ($6.25) was the best dish of the night... the sausages was tasty and has great flavour \n\nMarrakesh Chicken Tagine, chicken with saffron potatoes and preserved lemons, olives ($13.25) \n- I would not have consider this as a tagine as the chicken was definitely not cooked in low heat over a period of time... a fast food version maybe? \n- white meat was used and the chicken was dried and not tender at all \n- the broth is interesting though really light \n\nKofta Tagine ($11.95) \n- ground meat balls cooked in tomato sauce with an fried egg on top? \n- Maybe it is our fault to pick this dish as it tasted like Italian meatballs?? \n\nSahara Chicken Bastilla ($13.75) \n- The outer layer of the pastry was nicely done..but the chicken was overcooked and the whole bastilla was really dry \n- lack the complexity contrast of sweet and saltiness of the other bastilla I had before \n\nMint Tea ($5) \n- A-OK... and love the standard Moroccan presentation... \n\nI don't think I would be coming back to Walima Cafe again... it was just a totally disappointing experience.
