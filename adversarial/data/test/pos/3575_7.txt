We had a wonderful experience here at Cafe Forte. Even though it was a little busy for Valentine's Day, the staff was wonderful and accommodating and the food delicious and flavorful. I had the Pecan crusted chicken and my date had the Bloody Mary penne pasta. We both loved our dishes and enjoyed the view from our patio seating. This is a great little romantic spot off of Main St in Scottsdale that is nestled between all the art galleries. I highly recommend.
