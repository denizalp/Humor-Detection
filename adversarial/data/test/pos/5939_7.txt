I really wanted to like this place, and maybe I'll update my review once I find that fantastic designer item at a discount that the store so often breathless touts in their tweets and blog.  I purchased a few of those online group buying deals for this store months ago, and so I've been visiting the store and their online boutique quite consistently.  Still no luck on finding that special item yet.  The selection is limited, with merchandise that doesn't move very quickly.  I saw the same BCBG dress there the last 3 or 4 times I've been there.\n\nI'm just tired of seeing the same merchandise or some very well worn designer shoes that makes me cringe to look at them.  It's disappointing that the marketing of the store is so much better than the reality.  So at least, kudos to the marketing and pr people.\n\nI do have to say that the staff is always very friendly and helpful, and it is an interesting place to visit - if I ever find something glamorous, pretty and worthy to buy!
