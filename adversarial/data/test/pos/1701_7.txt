\"I thought midi-chicken meant half a chicken breast or something.\" \n\nFirst off the portions here are huge! The look on my friend's face when he saw half a chicken being brought towards his direction was pretty priceless. The waiter who served us was super friendly and had quite the sense of humour also. The fries at this place are pretty amazing too. I don't know if it's the seasoning or the way they fry it, but whatever witchcraft it is they're doing behind the kitchen, it's pretty darn good. Another thing is that I love is how they serve the food when it is still hot and fresh. Everything came pretty quickly and for the great price, the food tastes even better.
