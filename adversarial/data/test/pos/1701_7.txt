The cashier was a BITCH!!!! She wasn't helpful at all I don't think she even has attempted to work out in her life!!! She kept interrupting me when I was trying to ask questions!! So I just gave up.... If your going to have someone who's a cashier least make sure they can help she was rude and didn't know anything!!! \n\nThey leave food on the tables for an extremely long time with out cleaning it\n\nBut the food is yummy so I would come back but I won't eat here to go for sure
