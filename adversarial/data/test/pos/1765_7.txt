I know it is amazing, it only opened yesterday!  The Grind Burger Bar is awesome. It is so close it is to work.  I happened to be working today and drove down to BlueGreen Resort area to try this place out.  I walk in and lo and behold - another mutual friend of mine and one of the owners!  Lucky me, I got a free lunch!\nThe hostesses were super friendly, the waiter Kyle is awesome, and the bus help was fantastic (got that iced tea to go when I was leaving!)\nKyle explained all of the toppings I needed clarification on, and I had to with BEEF on CIABATTA and cheese was unnecessary for me so I went for marinated onions (in sea salt and olive oil), avocado and toasted garlic, jalepenos, a FRIED EGG (yummmmmy), and eggplant mayo and cilantro dressing on the side.  \nAll sauces are served on the side, 2 come with the burger, and 2 toppings do too (my avocado and egg were premium extras).\nMy friend tried the veggie burger and loved it (chickpea-based), and there are a few other types of burgers.\nThey have a bar area with TVs and signature cocktails, plus milkshakes and other salads and sides.\nI ate my entire burger - the meat itself was juicy and well seasoned.  The bun was fresh and delish.  The sides were unique, and the best part was the runny yolk in my first bite.\nI would DEFINITELY return here with friends - fun, good location, great atmosphere, good service, great food!  A real treat!!!
