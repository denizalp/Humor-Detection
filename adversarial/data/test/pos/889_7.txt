Restaurant, bowling alley, a bar, arcade games, private party areas....\n\nThey have tons of amenities for the whole family! \n\nWe usually go bowling and play games with the kids at this spot. A blowing alley that lights up to create a dance floor type of feel, added by the upbeat, heart pounding music helps give energy and life to the lanes. \n\nThe food is average at best. Its bowling alley, bar food so expectations can't be set too high.\n\nService is below par, we usually find ourselves looking for a server more so than actually feeling like she's checking on us.
