This is my second time to Harvest now, the first was for a Yelp Elite Event, and I cannot say enough good things about this place. \n\nEnvironment\/Concept: The front bar\/lounge area has a slightly different set-up and ambience (light and bright) than the back dining area which is a little more rustic but still very modern. I love the almost completely see through kitchen area! Many restaurants claim to be \"farm to table\" or \"sustainable\" or whatever other catch-phrase is hip at the time, but not a single one lives and breaths that mission quite like Harvest. Few chefs can cite the names of the farmers who collect the vegetables they serve, or the names of the fisherman who catch the fish they serve. It provides a unique element, particularly for a restaurant of this caliber in a literal desert. \nService: I think the staff here should train the staff at other restaurants in the Bellagio. A prime example of professionalism, courtesy\/respect, and efficiency. Everyone from the hostess, server, manager, and the people who brought out the food carts were incredible. They all were also incredibly informed\/educated on each item and could talk about the simplest thing forever if asked. Seriously, kudos to your team at Harvest. \nFood: There are more or less two dining options: 1) you can get a bunch of small plates and share them (what we did), or 2) you can order standard entrees. Either way you are offered the snack cart before your meal and the dessert cart after your meal. I personally LOVED the concept of the dessert cart. I don't care if you do or don't like brussel sprouts, you have to order them here. Sounds weird to say they were the best thing on the menu, but they were seriously that good. The duck confit buns were also pretty incredible, and tasted like an entire thanksgiving meal in a single bite. After meals I rarely want to eat an entire dessert, I mostly just want to nibble on something sweet (take one or two bites and be done). For one price you get to pick three small things from the cart, and it was the perfect amount for me, and the flavors were incredible. The passionfruit marshmallow seriously exploded in my mouth, I was so shocked by how much flavor it had it literally left me and my spouse speechless for a minute. The creme brûlée was also incredible. \nPrices: Look folks, you're eating on the strip, so that alone should give you some pause if you are worried about any sort of budget. That being said, I think compared to many other places in Bellagio and nearby hotels, the prices here are actually reasonable, especially when you take into account the fact that this food is farm to table, sustainable, and provides you with an actual food\/educational experience not just the satisfaction of taste buds. If you're really worried about prices but still want to try it, the small shared plates are definitely doable. \n\nThis place is an all around gem and I strongly recommend it to all.\n\n2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge #40
