Awesome food during the day, and best deals on marked down food prices at night. My new favorite supermarket!\n\nFirst time here, and was really impressed by this Korean supermarket. They have huge selection of grocery items, especially hot food. Came here today (Saturday) and was pleased at how many sample stations there were. Staff can also speak good English. \n\nI picked up a couple of snacks from the grocery section, then tried one item from the bakery (sugar twist for $1.80) which was pretty tasty.\n\nFrom the cafeteria (buffet style) section, I got some fried rice with vegetable, beef bulgogi, and pork ribs (pics in photos) and paid $5.69 for it which is a good price.\n\nMy BF ordered a fresh bulgogi with rice meal for about $7 which is also pretty good.\n\nPlace was clean, and there were a lot of seating, even during a busy day.\n\nI will come back for sure to try some of their pork bone soup and more bakery items.\n\nEDIT: I don't always go to a food place twice in the same day, but when I do, it is at Galleria Supermarket! Came here at 9:30PM to check out marked down items before closing and BOY, WAS I GLAD I WENT TONIGHT!\n\nMarked down sushi \/ sashimi is by far the best deal! And this is not just cheap sushi, it is definitely still excellent and the sushi is sooo good!\n\nMarked down prices:\n50% off Tuna Roll - paid only $3.49 for a $7.99 tuna roll pack\n20% off Salmon Sashimi - paid only $7.72 for a $9.65 salmon sashimi\n\nAlso got a pack of cheese filled fish cakes for about $2.59. Good deal!\n\nWill definitely make a point to come here at night to get the best deals on food. I signed up for their points card, because I know I will be a regular!\n\nReview 2 of 100
