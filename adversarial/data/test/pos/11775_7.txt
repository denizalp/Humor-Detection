secret pizza what? i always that place was over priced and ohhhhh kill em pin up is a god send.\n\nNot exactly a 25 cent slice like ny but c'mon it's vegas where people buy a bottle of goose for $300. PERFECT for all you SoCal college kids busting a mission to Vegas without any money.\n\n-----now for the food-----\n\nI got a lil carried away and bought a slice of the margarita, meatball parm, sausage, artichoke, and 1 garlic knot (you can get 4 for $3) \n\nall the pizzas get heated up one of those pizza ovens before they serve them to you and the crust is freaking amazing!!! be WARNED if you have left overs for the next day, those pizzas are gonna be hella hard, you can literally smack someone and knock them out\n\nout of those what i highly recommend \n\nmargarita -huge cuts of mozzarella melted perfectly the tomatoes are seasoned in this balsamic sauce which is the shit if you're into that. \n\ngarlic knots - not only are they cheap but they're pretty big, they're burried underneath globs of garlicy butter, if you love garlic this is the shit to make you feel some type of way.  if only it was crunchy then goddam gg imma be ktfo from a food coma and not make it to the club\n\nAfter i ordered my stuff they brought out a \"meat lovers\" don't really know the name which kind of annoyed me cus i could've just bought that one instead of buying the meatball parm and sausage seperately
