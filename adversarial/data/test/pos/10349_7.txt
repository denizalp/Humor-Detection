4 stars for being the lowest price for brand name gas in Henderson. Plenty of pumps, never waiting to pump gas like in LA.\n\nWide lanes and lots of room around each pump to get your gas. Convenience store for  cold drinks and snacks. Squeegee with soapy water and paper towels to clean my windows, works for me.
