Ok let me say this about stratosphere.. If you want to stay at a place that doesn't make your bed or take your garbage out then this place is for you. It does the job on providing a bed but that's about it. I am amazed at how hotels don't have a fart fan in the bathroom!  Is a fart man to much to ask for. I know this is first world problems but hey it's just a fart fan. The stores there are pretty lame compared to other hotel stores. So fellas if you want to make your ladies believe the stratosphere is on par with The Cosmopolitan or the Bellagio then my advice is don't let her leave the room or Casino. Going to the top is a real perk because it's free but trust me that's the only perk. Spend a little more and stay in a boss hotel!
