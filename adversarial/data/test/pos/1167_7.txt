I had Jessica as a piercer for an industrial. As someone with an anxiety disorder, the first thing Jessica did was ask me when I was finished talking, very rudely, like what I was saying\/asking was obsolete. The rest of the session was awesome, but I will never go here again because of the first thing that was said to me. I have been here several times because of friends, and I was never truly impressed to begin with. Went here for history and was disappointed. Jessica needs a better bedside manner.
