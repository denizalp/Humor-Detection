Foods good.  Cute place.  Nothing special, good value.\n\nNow the important part:\n\nLast time I ate here I was staring at this guy the whole time, like \"Do I know you?\"  He looked back some, mostly bored as hell with his woman.  After he gets up I hear the other tables talking... It was Luke Wilson!  I mean, if Luke Wilson eats there, it's good for something :)  I'm sure he was just in town talking his brother down from the Clarendon roof... zing!
