Really enjoy the spice, value and portion here. Self-serve chai is always a plus. Have eaten there twice now, and the same dishes were consistent and it is refreshing to see reasonably priced a-la-carte naan ($1.50) and rice ($2.95 for a very big mound on an oblong plate - enough for 2 persons.) Sidenote: Pet peeve is when restaurants 'getcha' on the sides that you depend on, like rice, miso soup, etc. Some of the worst offenders in my experience have been China Grill at Mandalay Bay ($7 bowl of white rice), Gaylord India at Rio ($7 plate of white rice), Nobu Matsuhisa locations ($5 for small cup of miso soup), Olive Garden ($4 for a side of marinara sauce to go with your free breadsticks). Most of these 'getchas' show up on your bill by surprise.\n\nBack to the curry at hand: Shalimar serves up quality, cheap and generous vegetarian curries (the eggplant masala and mili juli(sp?) mixed vegetable curry and yellow dal are all top tier) and the Chicken Tikka Masala is excellent as well. We ordered everything \"medium-hot\" and it came out spicy but not stupid spicy. Spice is dialed in with experienced hands in the kitchen over at Shalimar. No flavors were ruined with too much spice here. And the flavors are complex and different in every dish. This is important because sometimes I swear that when we are at an unfamiliar Indian restaurant and we order 4 different dishes, they use the exact same curry base in 3 of them, hoping we don't notice. Not the case here. Shalimar makes each dish with singular care.\n\nFood is basically 5-stars in my book, but the lack of ambiance (i.e. fluorescent lights) brings it down a star. Certainly not a first (or second) date kind of place. Instead you will see husbands and wives, families and groups of friends.\n\nWe're going to sit in view of the kitchen next time so we can see the behind-the-scenes. I really like eating here. It's a nice flavor change-up from our other favorite Indian spots such as Mint Indian Bistro, Namast√©, Rani's World Foods Thali counter, and the Indian counter at the Riviera Food Court. \n\nWarm-up note: both times we've had enough left over for lunch for two the next day. Upon opening the to-go box out of the fridge, the curry has a healthy viscosity without any sign of ghee-ponding or crusting. Less ghee = less butter = OK to eat when craving
