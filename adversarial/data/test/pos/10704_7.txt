Ol√©! Not that I need a reason to go out for margaritas and tacos... but having Taco Tuesday as an excuse definitely helps! Aside from the other great places in the valley that have the amazing (and very dangerous) frozen margaritas, Sol has lip-smackingly delicious margaritas! \n\nThe moment you walk in and sit, one of the delightful staff members brings you a basket of fresh-out-of-the-fryer house-made tortilla chips with a delicious bean dip and mild salsa (so yum!) And on Taco Tuesday, the special is -- can you guess? TACOS!!! There are a handful of the tacos that are a \"steal\" on the special menu, and of course, the full menu is always an option if the special deals don't appeal to your tastebuds. \n\nOn this particular visit, my best friend and I needed to unwind, relax, and have some girl talk over tacos and margaritas. We both ordered a house margarita with no agave or simple syrup -- yes, we like our margaritas tart -- and we munched on the warm tortilla chips and the dips. \n\nWe decided we should get some tacos... because, Taco Tuesday... so I got two grilled chicken tacos and my best friend got two carne asada tacos. Oh.Em.Gee. These tacos are so good!!! Full of flavor, and they don't skimp on the meat! They also give you this amazing hot sauce that is sure to kick up the heat on the tacos a notch or two... or ten. Proceed with caution if you don't like spicy. I do, however, so I loaded up on the hot sauce and woo, it was tasty. (I may have chugged my margarita and water thereafter, but it was a good hurt. haha)\n\nWhat I love about Sol is that you get good food at a great price, and the atmosphere is wonderful. The staff is superb, attentive, and kind as well. This wasn't my first time going to Sol, and it most certainly won't be my last!
