My dad and I come here for the salad. That salad is bomb diggity in our book and we can eat it til we hate ourselves. Thanks Louis CK for helping me let others understand my tendency to overstuff myself with Olive Garden salad LOL. I also really like how there is a discount on wine if you're waiting for a table (go to the bar and wait to be seated). Yes, please! And who doesn't like those mint chocolates to conclude your self loathing? When the server gives us extra, they are indeed the real MVP.
