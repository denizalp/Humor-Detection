I lived in Euclid for five years and somehow never discovered this place. If I still did I'd be here every week. GET THE WEDDING SOUP. Get some to take home too. The Sparta burger was the bomb but it looked like everything was. Wish I had time this visit to come for breakfast. Service was absolutely top notch too.
