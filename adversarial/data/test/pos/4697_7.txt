Seriously, Seriously (!!)  Lunch date this afternoon with Lauren M - the two of us decide to head just down Church street to Fabarnak. We are seated and begin to discuss 5 star reviews, what is good, and how sparingly we give 5-stars-now-a-days. Three minutes later we are both salivating over the meals being placed before us, and three minutes after that we are crafting our 5 star reviews in our heads and practically sobbing. \n\nSo I exaggerate slightly, but with the plethora of mediocre and expensive lunch options for us Yorkville area office workers Fabarak shines through like a delicious, inexpensive, beacon of fabulousness which cannot be ignored.\n\nSee Lauren M's review below for her description of the \"Square Peg\" Lunch special which is a delightful and experimental steal at $9. Today's was crispy pigtail w\/horseradish aioli, roasted asparagus w\/ toscano cheese, mini yukon potatoes w\/ basil pesto and rosemary shortbread cookies w\/ dolce de leche.\n\nI was interested in reverting to childhood, so I selected a tomato bisque with 4 cheese grilled cheese which was accompanied by onion marmalade and tomato jam. My only complaint was that I could have used much more marmalade, being that it was outstanding. My lunch came in at just over $11. \n\nI did have one of Lauren's cookies which were, indeed, drool worthy. \n\nService was spotty at first, and then exemplary as lunch went on. And to add to the good karma, all profits benefit the 519 community centre, and 80% of the food is locally and sustainably produced. All of it is healthy, and none of the other patrons left a spot on their plates either, which is a good sign. Lots of veggie friendly options. \n\nFollow on Twitter for lunch specials and the like.\n\nFeel Good, Eat Good food that blows all of the Y&B competition out of the water. I have not had lunch this good in Toronto, maybe EVER, especially anywhere near this price range.  I will be back, frequently - likely waiting in line once the word gets out.
