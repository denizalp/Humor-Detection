Came in for a simple cup of coffee, \"barista\" spills a large cup of hot latte on me ruining my shoes and drenching my shirt and jeans... Was given a simple apology and asked if I still wanted my fucking cookie and shitty coffee. This is \"local\" my ass, would have gotten better service and care at a Starbucks I'm sure... This place lives on the markets atmosphere but is sub par in overall quality. Do yourself a favor, pick up some coffee on the way here instead, come in and enjoy the atmosphere.
