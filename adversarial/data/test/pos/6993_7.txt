Bomb Tacos came highly recommended to me by one of my coworkers. As a taco connoisseur, I knew I had to give them a try! Please keep in mind that I ordered only their vegan options.\n\nMy friends and I arrived right when the restaurant opened. It was a very strategic move on our behalf to avoid extended wait times. Why did it take approximately 40 minutes to make two orders of carne asada fries and 12 tacos?\n\nI ordered the vegan \"carne asada\" fries and cauliflower tacos. On a positive note, the cauliflower tacos were very innovative and pretty yummy. On a scale from 1-5, I'd give the tacos a solid 3. Now, the vegan \"carne asada\" fries were made with mushrooms instead of beef. I was super excited to try them because I know that mushrooms generally have a meaty taste. They also used curly fries, which are my fave, so I knew it had to be bomb. I'm not sure what was saltier, the mushrooms or the curly fries. One forkful exceeded my entire sodium intake for the day. I thought, maybe I just got a bad batch, but my carnivorous friends had the same experience with their carne asada fries. \n\nLesson learned: Good things don't always come to those who wait 40 minutes for tacos.
