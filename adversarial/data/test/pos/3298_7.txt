Terrible customer service!! Talked to a man named Brian about one of their advertisements being GLUED to my window (apparently they think that by ruining someone's tint, the victim of their vandalism may come to get it fixed at their place of business). He told me is was \"MY PROBLEM\" that it happened. When all I asked was for his company to repair the damage that they did to my car, Brian cussed me out and told me to come down and fight him. As unprofessional as anyone can get. Avoid these scam artists. Go somewhere else!!!
