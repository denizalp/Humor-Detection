Sorry but I gotta call it as I see it on this one.  I tried 3 different beer styles here and all of them were very subpar.  The vibe has a chain-restaurant feel to it and it is basically just a college town hang-out.  The beers are super cheap and sports are on TV though so I totally get the appeal, it's just not my thing.
