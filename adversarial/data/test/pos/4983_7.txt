Smelly Cat smells quite delicious-wifts of freshly roasted coffee.  Another flattering review of Smelly Cat seems redundant, but here's my observations about this place\n\n-High \"perk\" factor of baristas-I can't even pull off that level of perkiness with liberal doses of caffeine\n\n-Variety of bevies- Chai lattes, a different flavor of iced tea daily on special, several roast of coffee to choose from.  They keep iced coffee (don't know if its cold press) but it does the trick.  \n\n-Dilworth coffee used in coffee beverage-It's \"dil-worthy\" of praise, wha wha whaaa!\n\n-Smallish-Though I wouldn't likely loiter here for hours, I would certainly visit Smelly Cat on a lunch break or before a big day in NoDa (or night, if you know what I mean).\n\nThe overall experience is great.  I like light or medium roast coffee and I find it to be a tad bitter here.  It's really good, but it's not as smooth as I've had in other coffeehouses.  Overall, Smelly Cat makes NoDa what it is.
