So... I'm here now, been sitting at a table in the bar area for about 15 min. At least three different employees have, literally, walked right past me without saying a word. Not one word. No eye contact, no glass of water, no \"Someone will be right with you,\" no \"GTFO of our restaurant,\" nothing. The only reason I'm still here is that I wanted to post my review while it was still fresh in my mind, and I also want to find somewhere else to eat before I leave.
