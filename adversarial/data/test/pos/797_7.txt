The only reason I give this place two stars is because they almost killed me. In my reservation on OpenTable and when I entered the restaurant and when we talk to the waitress we told her multiple times about our food allergies. But somehow she failed to connect that with the chefs.  Two of the dishes we received had our allergies and  one was actually eaten. We had to write an incident report with the SLS and the manager had to handle the situation because the waitress was unable to. She couldn't even list the ingredients that were in many of the food that we ordered.  The busboys knew more then her. \n\nOn the slightly positive note about the restaurant some of the dishes we ate were very good. The shwarma  was excellent and so were the kebabs. We did not receive most of our dishes because after almost eating a pinenut  that would've killed me I wasn't really that hungry.\n\nThe management and busboys were excellent in handling the situation. The waitress was an epic fail. I would go back and try the restaurant again but I would make sure that my waitress truly understands what might kill me in my food.
