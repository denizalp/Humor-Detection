Wow.  I was really impressed by the service provided at this restaurant.  The waiter was a bit zany, but this added to the dining experience.\n\nThe food was really good, and satisfied my cravings.  The menu was also pretty extensive.\n\nHOWEVER, I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because my plate was dirty (gross).
