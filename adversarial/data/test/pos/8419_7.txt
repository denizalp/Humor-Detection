The sandwiches are good, but don't let the fancy names and descriptions fool you. They are made with quite plain ingredients (deli meat, packaged sliced cheese) and they look exactly like something your mom packed in your lunch in grade 4.\n\nI have lived nearby here for awhile but I have never been in. Sandwich shops just do not excite me.\n\nI did have an online coupon which allowed me to buy 2 sandwiches for $5. I stopped in on my way home from work to try it out. Got a soup ($3.49) as well.\n\nIt's quite nice inside. The owner is REALLY friendly and chatty. He takes his time making the sandwiches, so I waited a bit as he was preparing some others first. \n\nThere are some nice loungy leather couches, a few booths, free books to read and a few board games. Looks like a really good place to veg out for a few hours and read over a coffee and sandwich.\n\nThe menu has changed recently and there are new sandwiches (website still shows most of the old ones).\n\nI tried \"We're Just Friends\" - chicken, swiss cheese, roasted red peppers, red onions and also a new one (with the word \"Sea\" in it) which was tuna w\/ lemon juice, honey mustard, capers and tomatoes.\n\nThe first one was quite good, but the tuna one just tasted too much of canned tuna, not enough ingredients added to mask the fishy taste. Wouldn't recommend that one.\n\nThe soup was chicken & rice and very average.
