The Serene at Eastern Walmart ought to be in my New York State of Mind List. From 10 AM to 9 PM the congestion here reminds me of the Long Island Expressway approaching Midtown Manhattan. \n\n  This Walmart is a major convenience for me. The prices are competitive in grocery items and sometimes as good as it gets on general merchandise. A few examples are a $13 hiking pole, $10 leather wallet, and $450 Toshiba laptop. When it comes to prices I save money but don't live better.\n\n   This supercenter is hypercrowded. Shopping here could be stressful.  The parking lot is one of the worst in the valley. When Walmart is hypercrowded so is the parking lot. An element of impatient and insane motorists is a recipe for the stress level to rise. The parking lot that Walmart shares with other power retailers is unsignalized at Serene Avenue. This causes a dangerous situation for motorists waiting to turn left on a main road with a parade of cars in back honking. I avoid making a left turn here like swimming in the Las Vegas Wash.\n\n  Recently this facility was remodeled.  The major flaw was it was designed to look like Target. The result is that the main walkways are similar to Interstate 15 loosing four lanes for a landscaped median. It is a challenge to maneuver a shopping cart.\n\n  Another issue is that on account of the crowds, there are holes. This is the scene in the majority of super centers.\n\n  The food selection is good. Some hard to find items they sell are Yum Tum Wonton soup, a full line of La Choy, Campbells Manhattan Clam Chowder Soup.\n\n  The checkout generally moves fast. The majority of the cashiers are friendly.  This is a representation of the majority of employees.  \n\n Before concluding this review, I have a recommendation for drivers visiting from Interstate 215. Avoid the crazy left from the parking lot onto Serene Avenue. Instead do this: make a right on Serene Avenue. At the traffic light turn right on Spencer Street.  Past the underpass (I-215), at the traffic light turn right on Pebble Road. And at the traffic light turn right on Eastern Avenue. Immediately you will see the Junction 215 sign.
