Sitting at work while sadly looking at my chipped 4 day old manicure prompted me to write this review. I'm pretty upset that this was the second time I went to this salon, and the second time my manicure lasted less than a week.\n\nI know L.A. Nails is cheap. I got a manicure and pedicure for $40. That's pretty damn cheap. But if I'm paying them to do my nails, I would expect them to AT LEAST do a better job than I do for myself.\n\nThe lady who did my pedicure was pretty good. However, I think she cut the bottom of my foot with that scary razor thing. That is a HUGE no-no in the salon industry. Emma, you should be happy that you didn't get the razor. I'm still praying to God that I don't get some kind of delayed fungal infection.\n\nThe lady who did my nails did a sub-par job. I found that my cuticles weren't perfectly groomed, and 4 days later, the polished already chipped. The manicures that I give myself always last a full week. Not impressed.\n\nWith that being said, my pedicure did turn out nicely. That is something I would pay for, but for the future, I don't think I'll EVER pay for someone else to do my manicures!
