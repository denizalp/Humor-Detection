Living in Tremont is like the black hole for internet reception, mail and grocery stores.  This is the home base for all the carriers that deliver my route.  My guy is awesome but when hes off they put in a sub and they BLOW.  Cannot put mail in proper boxes, leave my packages in the rain..etc.  My Hummels and Saved by Bell stuff I got off Ebay got ruined! If ya have to go to the branch to pick up a package plan on waiting forever.  The people that work the counter are nice but slow as an earthworm crawlin down Gary Buseys buttcrack!
