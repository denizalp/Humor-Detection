Wow. If there's one thing you must eat In Montréal it's this. \n\nI don't exaggerate when I say this is one of the best sandwiches I've had in my life. Even though it's very simple, the smoked meat melts in your mouth. It has a perfect flavor that's accentuated by the mustard, and doesn't need any other ingredients to spruce it up. \n\nAt first I wrote Shwartz's off as a lame tourist trap and wasn't even going to stop in. Let me just say I am so, so glad I stopped in and that this is no tourist trap. The smoked meat sandwiches are really just that good. I'm so sad that this place is all the way up in Montréal, if I had one near me I would be there all the time.
