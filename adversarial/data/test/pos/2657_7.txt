3-stars for food, 2 for service. I am a sucker for crawfish and was overall pleased with the taste quality, especially for a chain (and seafood in AZ). I don't recall the price but it was pretty reasonable. \n\nThe service itself was very slow. Our waitress seemed more concerned with flirting with the group of men than checking on us every now and again. Also, the fountain soda was super flat and when my guest told her she wanted a different drink, it took her a good 15 minutes to return with it. \n\nI am going to knock on the hostess, who I told upon entry I am meeting people and I know where they're seated. She decided it would be important to add she thought they were \"in the corner booth.\" It was a group of Asian women I don't know and that certainly was not the party I was meeting. Honey, it's 2015- don't assume two Asians in a room MUST know each other.
