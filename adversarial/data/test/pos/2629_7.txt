I hate to give a place a 1 star review, and maybe it was an anomaly the morning we tried to go to Black Bear Diner.  \n\nWe came in on a Saturday late morning wanting to try a new breakfast\/brunch place.  The decor is very cozy and we were seated right away.  The gentleman seating us said in passing that they had just had a huge rush and that they WERE an hour behind.  But he assured us that the rush was over.\n\nAt the beginning our server was very friendly with good communication.  We decided on our meals quickly and this is where it all went south.  Yes it was a busy morning, but 45 minutes later were were all getting anxious for our food.  Two adults and 2 kids (10 and 8)  Our server had not been back to check on us, refill our coffee\/drinks, or update us on our food.  By 1hr15 minutes (another 30 MINUTES after we had seen our waiter) my husband found our server by the kitchen and asked about our order.  We were the 3rd ticket in and it hadn't been started.  So disappointing. If were would have been told how far behind the kitchen was, we wouldn't have stayed. So we paid for our drinks and left.  \n\nNext door the Costco hotdogs tasted AMAZING!
