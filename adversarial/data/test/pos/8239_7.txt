I find the sushi here to be run-of-the-mill.   The I-17\/Northern-adjacent strip mall restaurant is kind of quiet and subdued compared to the Scottsdale joints, and I like it that way.  I come here when I want something dependable in the central Phoenix area without driving clear out to Scottsdale.\n\nThe fish here for the most part is fresh - nothing too creative here, and the interior isn't much to crow about either.   I find the sushi here to be better than Zen 32 (and cheaper), but not quite at the caliber of other standout places in town.\n\nP.S.  I find the name a little peculiar.  Mr. Sushi??  I would normally scoff at a place called Senor Taco, Ms. Pasta or Madame Hot Dog.  But for some reason I'm ok with the cheesy name.
