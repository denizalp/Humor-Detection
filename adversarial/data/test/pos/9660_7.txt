It truly pains me to lower La Piazza al Forno to three stars since in the past I had the best tasting pizzas here due to the high quality products they use to prepare the pizzas. They house make the cheese, they use the low acid D.O.C. Tomatoes, a special flour and Extra Virgin Olive Oil and a leaf of fresh basil on every slice. The pizzas are Brick oven Neapolitan Certified Pizzas.\n\nThis last Margherita D.O.C. Pizza was far different from others I've had here and that is the reason I feel the need to lower to three stars. \n\nI thought the crust was actually a good batch of dough as it was chewy with a nice char on the bottom. The pizza had the right structure, the perfect amount of salt and I could taste the E.V.O.O. I know these pizzas are always on the wet side with a moist middle but the pizza I recently received was overly wet and if you take the time to look at my photo and compare it to my old photo or other similar photos you can see the cheese got broken up by the water. Due to all the water on my pizza I couldn't really taste the D.O.P. tomatoes as they were very watery. My pizza was so wet that the center broke from the slices and stuck to the plate. All the water on the pizza sort of deflated it and I also felt deflated and bummed.\n\nFor what it worth I do note I had excellent pizzas here in the past and your pizza might not come out the way my last one did.\n\nAlso not a fan of the tropical fruit Iced tea.
