Wow.  I've seen three or four Cirque shows, and this one was one of the best.  Well, they're all amazing, but this one was great.  Some of the other shows are more heavy on the acrobatics and less on the artsy stuff.  Love is really artsy.  It's also kind of interactive, in a really cool way.\n\nI was really excited when stuff fell on us.  I think other people have done a good job of describing the show, so the purpose of my review will be the following:  I AM GOING TO INSTRUCT YOU WHERE TO SIT IF YOU WANT STUFF TO FALL ON YOU.  I'm talking about confetti and stuff.  It's awesome.  \n\nDuring this lesson, please refer to the seating chart, which I have conveniently uploaded to the photos section of this review.  \n\nSO.  We were seated in the green \"expensive\" seats, in section 200.  Stuff fell on us.  The best places to sit are in 101, 102, 107, 108, and the first row of 200, 201, 202, 207, 208 and 209.  I'm not sure if stuff fell into the other green sections, but I KNOW it fell in the areas I mentioned.  \n\nWhen I called to make the reservations, the woman on the phone knew nothing about which seats are good, or which seats were in the line of confetti fire.  That, my friends, is what Yelp is for.  You're welcome.
