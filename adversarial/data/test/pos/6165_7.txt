Just look at the picture...\n\nThis was the Crab Leg station on a Sunday evening at around 7pm. It looked (and smelled) like low tide at the pier.\n\nThe rest of the buffet wasnt much better. Dry meat, burnt pasta, sketchy looking sushi. All served by employees who seemed like they were being inconvenienced by your mere presence.\n\nI don't understand how such a reputable hotel can have such an awful restaurant... especially for their flagship buffet. And for almost $50? Ridiculous.\n\nEdit: The response from Management is laughable. Basically, \"hey, come on back, give us $50 again and it might be better this time.\"\n\nWhats the definition of insanity? Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting it to change...
