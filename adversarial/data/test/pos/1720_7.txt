Since I had a lovely night here last night and have had several such nights, it must be time for me to yelp this place.\n\nI wouldn't say that I would go to Side Bar on any random night, but rather on a night where I felt like doing it up just a little bit.  I'm not a lounge bar girl, but rather a dive bar girl.  Either way, as far as lounge bars go, Side Bar is basically it.  This is the kind of bar you bring a boy that you're dating who lives in Tempe to show him that there are cool bars in Central PHX.  It seemed to work out well for me last night.\n\nThe crowd can be pretty hit or miss- I've seen some major characters in this place.  You just have to lay back and take it all in, I guess.  \n\nI'm always a bit irritated by the lack of draft beer, but Strongbow always seems to make me happy here.  The bartenders are hot, and they have mints in the bathroom.  I'm a fan.
