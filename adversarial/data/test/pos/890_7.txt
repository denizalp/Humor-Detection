Not a bad place to watch sports.  I like the layout here because I don't feel so claustrophobic.  I like the seats in the back because they are like couches and more comfortable than the regular seats.  \n\nI never really found it difficult to find a place to sit here so props to MGM sports book for somehow pulling that off.  \n\nOnly problem is that I feel like I have to turn my head a lot because the screens are laid out more horizontally. Hahah.
