Right across the street from trendy Bark and Fitz, you could say Global Pet foods has a bit of competition. In the dog market, that is.\n\nGood thing this place offers way more options for other animals (plus cheaper prices for those not wanting to pay the price at Bark and Fitz). \n\nI like this place because it has a huge bird feed section, with loads of different kinds of feeders and seeds for cheap prices. Plus, with High Park so close, you can easily grab some seed and go feed the chickadees for the afternoon.
