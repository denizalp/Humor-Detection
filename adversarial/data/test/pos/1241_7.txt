Only come here if you have a table or if you're a group of hot young girls who can get into a table. I give LAX 1 star if you're not VIP. I give it 4 stars if you are VIP. I experienced the regular crowd for about 15 horrible minutes. I was ready to go, but fortunately there are a bunch of rich bored duded who like to pull ladies off the dance floor and behind the ropes (yes I know, sorry boys but you can't win at everything). Then you can go about your evening however you want. You actually have room to move, which is always appreciated. The music was fine until it started to sound more like a wedding than a club, at which point we ditched the VIP area and walked the few feet over to Cathouse.
