Great place for brunch\/lunch. The bread is amazing. I recommend getting their fresh fruit juice, its the authentic stuff with a juicer.\n\nStay away from Baked French Toast, it will own your stomach with it's deliciousness.. I never thought something could be so insanely good that it's bad. I guess what I'm trying to say is if you are there for breakfast it's the wrong way to start to your day.\n\nAlso Bill Cosby has been there and signed an autograph... So like thats worth something right?
