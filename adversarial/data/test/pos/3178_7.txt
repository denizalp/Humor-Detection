This is just a gorgeous store with lovely furniture and linens. The style is Pottery Barn with a funky, ethnic twist. Sort of like an upscale Pier One. I found a ton of stuff I would love to have in my bedroom but unfortunately we were there on a mission: to find some new bath accessories. Sadly, their bath sectiotn is very, very small but after I saw how nice their stuff was I did peruse the website at home a few days later and found lots of gorgeous options online!
