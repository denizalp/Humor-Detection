Never, ever, rent from here. We did not receive the car we reserved online in advance. We did not get it for the price we reserved either. \n\nThe customer service attendants were so rude, and so unhelpful. All they wanted to do was argue and not try to find any solution to the problem. We ended up having to pay extra because we had 5 people in our group, and the car we reserved was supposed to fit 5, but the one they tried to give us wouldn't. She told us we could come back tomorrow and we could get the one we wanted. Ok? So were we supposed to sleep in the airport for the night to get the car we reserved a day late? Cause that sure makes sense....\n\nThe lot attendant was not helpful. She just points and goes \"pick one.\" No instructions or anything. They didn't come to look at or note any prior damage to the car before we left, so who knows if they are going to try to charge us for all the giant scratches that were on it before we even left the lot.
