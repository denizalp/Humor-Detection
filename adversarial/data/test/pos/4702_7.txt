Wine bars... What's NOT to love! Especially this one! \n\nI came here with some friends the other night and I already love wine bars so I love trying new ones. I loved everything about this place. From the food, to the wine, to the environment...\n\nI ordered the Chicken Pesto Pasta. This entree was delicious! I like it when they don't skimp on the sauce because I feel that it makes it taste dry. The pesto sauce was really yummy. I'm a pretty light eater and usually always have leftovers to take home, but I devoured it! My friend ordered the Portobello burger that I tried. Quite tasty as well and I like the combination fries and dipping sauce that it came with. I also ordered the Red Sangria which was quite yummy. It wasn't too sweet like most Sangrias that I've had. \n\nOur server was very friendly and knowledgeable as to his recommendations to what was good on the menu. \n\nI loved the lounge area that they have set up as well. You can stay and hang out after you eat. It actually reminded me of the Living Room wine bar in Chandler that I absolutely love. Another great thing is that it's in Old town Scottsdale so it's not that far from me. \n\nThey have a happy hour menu as well that I'd really like to come back and try and will probably do an updated review on that as well! If you like wine bars with great food this is definitely the place to go! =)
