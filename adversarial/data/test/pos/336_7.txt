The Combo Pan Roast was delicious but a little pricey at $30. The Oyster Bar at Palace Station has it for $20 but I have yet to try.\n\nAnyways, the combo roast had a hearty amount of lobster and crab. The broth was rich and flavorful which soaked up very nice with the big scoop of rice that they give you.\n\nHave an oyster shooter for $5 but I suggest you go for more since 3 goes for $12. \n\nNext time I wanna try the Oyster Bar Six Shooter!\n\nBang Bang
