The clinic staff is wonderful, very seldom have I waited past my appt time, and the doctors obviously live their clients.\n The clinic is clean, and they have informative posters that are actually interesting.\n The doctors always give me several treatment choices, understanding that sometimes, sadly, cost IS a factor.\n Easy to get to, next to a Dominoes, so if I need comfort food it's handy!
