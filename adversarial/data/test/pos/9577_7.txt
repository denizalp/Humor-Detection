I was really amazed by the BBQ here. \n\nI'm from the South Chicago. Therefore, I know what good BBQ is. Haha... I got to say this place is not bad at all. Sure you may second think it by being a chained restaurant-ish, but looks can sure be deceiving. \n\nSadly, this place was very dead, but the service was well awake. For me, BBQ is really hard to describe in words. It's a type of food you just have try for your self. \n\nEven though most of the items on the menu are sort of pricey, you have to get, I guess the sampler, \"the feast for 2. \n\nIt'll change your mind about overrated BBQ joints.
