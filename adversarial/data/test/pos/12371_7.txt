I've noticed that for every 4 or 5-star review, there's a corresponding 1 or 2-star review.  I guess, then, a potential diner should go without expectations, but don't be surprised if it's terrible either.\n\nHere's the deal:  I've been here a few times because 1.) it's cheap and 2.) it's cheap and you get a lot of food (typical cheap pasta joint).  To me, inexpensive is GOOD, so it gets an extra star just for that.\n\nI would say I'm a bit of a pizza connoisseur and critic, especially when it comes to a LIttle Italy neighborhood.  I've had outstanding pizza and average pizza across the U.S. and in Italy.  Verdict: This pizza is mediocre.  It should not be in Little Italy.  I really think that people who say it's good are simply inexperienced when it comes to the joy of quality pizza.  If I want a cheap, inauthentic pizza, I will go to my grocer's freezer, and ultimately be more satisfied by the taste.  The sauce, the cheese, it's just plain bad.  The service, too, has been under par when I've gone.\n\nGet a sandwich instead, but I don't recommend the marinara.  Oh, and that reminds me, the bread they serve is not even good.  I wouldn't be so critical if they weren't in the Little Italy neighborhood where patrons have expectations of quality and authenticity.
