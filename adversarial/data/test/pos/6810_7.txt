I was surprised to learn that Makkal Chon was located on Lawrence Ave. in Scarborough as this is not a neighbourhood I would expect to find a Korean restaurant. \n\nMakkal Chon is easily one of the best Korean restaurants I have had the pleasure of dining at. Coming in on a cold Friday evening, and feeling a bit under the weather I opted for a hearty Kamjatang (Spicy Pork Bone Soup). This soup was an otherworldly experience, and possibly the best kamjatang I have every had. The portion was massive with large, meaty chunks of fall off the bone pork. The broth was spicy with a good mix of spices and pepper that gave it a complex flavour. Overall this was the perfect bowl of soup that left me feeling warm for the next few hours. \n\nThe banchan (Korean side dishes) were plentiful (we got about 7). All the banchan were clearly made from scratch and with care. My only complaint is that the service here was a bit slow, it took a while to be seated and even  longer to get our food. In the end this wasn't such a big deal, I will gladly wait for my meal to be cooked with care, just be warned not to come here too hungry. \n\nI for one cannot wait to come back to this hidden Scarborough gem.
