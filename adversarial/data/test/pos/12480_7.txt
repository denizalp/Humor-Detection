I just don't get the hype or the long brunch wait time.  Why is everybody clamoring to eat here?  I have a lifelong love affair with brunch and to top it with outdoor patio dining is dropping a cherry on my brunch sundae.  But both times that I've been to Tupelo have left me wishing that I had that egg McMuffin, breakfast burrito and Krispy Kreme glazed donut (my on the fly, tried-and-true backup weekend sweet and savory breakfast) instead.  Tupelo gets 2.5 stars but I'm rounding down because I'm literally stunned by the 4-star rating for: (1) fabulous ambience (4.5 stars); (2) long wait time (2 stars); (3) better than average service (3.5 stars); and (4) REALLY heavy, greasy, bland food (2 stars).\n\n_____Fabulous ambience.  Tupelo feels like how I would imagine it would be to visit a Southern aunt or grandmother who baked pies, fried everything that you could imagine, and when she wasn't baking, she was making quilts; it's rustic and meant to feel welcoming and cozy.  The patio is enclosed and tucked away behind some mature trees to facilitate your immersion into its Southern charm.  \n\n_____Dreadful wait time.  You can't book a reservation on Open Table until 12:30 and let's be honest, by then that's not brunch, that's just plain old lunch.  It is noteworthy to mention that they can't serve alcohol until noon, on the dot.  To their credit, the wait does move along pretty quickly and they overestimate the wait time so that you're pleasantly surprised when your name gets called ahead of schedule.\n\n_____Better than average service.  Our server was upbeat, super friendly and attentive.  However, his recommendations weren't very good (see below); when we asked for extra mustard (our chicken BLT was very bland), it didn't come until AFTER our meal was almost over; and when we told him that the best thing we had on the menu was our pineapple tiki drink, as he cleared away our nearly full plates after we declined to go boxes, he didn't give the 5-star Yelp spiel that we overheard him giving to all the other patrons (in fact, he didn't mention Yelp at all) and didn't really do anything or offer any conciliatory gesture or at least communicate our discontent to a manager.\n\n______REALLY heavy, greasy, bland food.  Tupelo is southern cooking with an unexpected twist but its delivery leaves you wanting more flavor, less charring.  I've been twice and both times I was wishing I had that egg McMuffin or Krispy Kreme donut instead.  I've had:\n\nGOOD:\n++++++pineapple tiki drink: It's $23 and meant for 2 and pretty heavy on the alcohol.  It's delicious and refreshing but wish they would have given me the pineapple that was cored out to enjoy.\n++++++Bloody Mary: the vodka pour is pretty heavy handed; this is a hearty drink and very flavorful.\n++++++complimentary biscuits:  the biscuits are served warm with raspberry jam and honey.  They're sweet and fluffy, especially with the jam and honey but I wouldn't say they are better than Red Lobster's biscuits.\nMEH:\n--------fried chicken BLT.  The chicken was dry yet greasy and bland but overall, the dish was edible.\n--------beet salad.  The sweet, tangy dressing, cheese and candied nuts are a nice touch to the salad.\n--------signature salad.  Wish there were more apples because the greens are a little bitter; the sweet vinaigrette goes nicely with the tartness of the apples.  The croutons are made of corn bread so they're a little sweet. \n--------Eggs Betty.  The hollandaise sauce was pretty bland but is better after salt is added.\n--------shrimp and grits. Tried this because it's a signature southern dish but it was underwhelming and bland.  The shrimp was chewy and rubbery; the sauce was spicy but otherwise not very flavorful.\nAVOID:\n--------Appalachian shrimp: the shrimps are supposed to be infused in sweet, semi spicy chili sauce dressed on corn soufflé.  Everything tasted charred and the corn soufflé was just soggy corn bread.\n--------okra.  The okra was charred and very greasy.  The buttermilk dipping sauce isn't as salty and flavorful as Ranch dressing, which would have tasted better.\n--------Brussel sprouts.  Charred, super dry, bland and very greasy.\n--------mac and cheese.  Dry and not cheesy at all.  \n\nOverall, every time I have been here, I am remorseful for the money I spend eating here (which is usually around $65 for 2 people, before 20% gratuity) because I could have my egg McMuffin and Krispy Kreme for less than $10.  I don't mind shelling out that amount if the experience is better than McDonald's and Krispy Kreme, but sadly, it is not.
