2.5 Star\n\nI love to support family business and Shawarma Stop does have this small homey cheerful vibe.\n\nMaybe it was a mistake to order a Chicken Shawarma Wrap? The cheapest item on the menu. I could not even find the chicken after taking several bites. I do know veggie and salad is good for me but I am getting a \"Chicken\" wrap after all. I do expect 1\/3 of the filling be at least chicken.\n\nMaybe a Chicken Shawarma plate is a better choice? At least I can see what I am getting.\n\nA pass for me unless I have craving for a veggie wrap.
