Emma's opened a few weeks ago and has become my go to brunch spot, whether eating with friends or alone (yeah, yeah, YEAH). I like to think of it as a real reminder of home cooked food - something that I had lost in the fray of all the great different ethnic eats Toronto has to offer. Like a really good pair of old shoes. Listen, I'm not comparing the food to old shoes, just the comfort I get from it.\n\nI love the classic breakfast. It's all the pieces you'd expect from a breakfast special at say, a diner, but everything is done so much better. The eggs are cooked to order properly and taste fresher than eggs generally do, the roasted new potatoes are of nice family dinner quality, the fresh baked bread (rye, white, and honey oat usually) are fluffy and perfect. The meat. This is where I've had the best breakfast bacon in Toronto. No joke. It's thick cut and it's perfect. Bacon that needs some knife action every once in a while. If you decide to go sausage....you get a sausage patty! This ain't no tube sausage. Everything is made in house and you can taste it.\n\nBest part, the best breakfast special in TO only costs $10. So get up to St. Clair and Oakwood(ish) and have a breakfast that you'll really enjoy.
