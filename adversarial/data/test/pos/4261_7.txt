Z's is such a fabulous place for fast, cheap, delicious grub.  Their tzatziki is legendary, but it's true that your breath will smell like you kissed a garlic-chewing goat. They only get 4 stars because when I order salads, the lettuce is wet. Wet! No!  Wet lettuce is one of the biggest food-offensives ever!  Otherwise, they're legit.
