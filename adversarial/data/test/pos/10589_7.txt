Really? Great Jerky? What a joke. I placed an order online and it took 5 weeks to arrive. Over $40 for 2 lbs. I just don't like it. Not enough spices, salt,weird taste, way overrated. I really wanted some real jerky. I enjoy brand \"Damn Good Jerky\" a lot.  This jerky can't compare to them. I did not like it so much that it sat in a fridge until it went bad. Simon sucks, just like 95% of things on Food Network Best Thing I ever ate. I try to visit places in New York recommended on the show and yet found one I really love. Just like McCLure's pickles at $11.99 a jar suggested by Ted Allen. Claussen is better than that.
