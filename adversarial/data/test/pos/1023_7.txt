Seeing is believing!  Maintaining our eye healthcare is definitely essential with what we eat, wearing sunglasses to protect from UV rays to seeing a ophthalmologist or optometrist on a regular basis for checkups. \n\nSouthwestern Eye Center has several locations to choose from when I was booking for my first visit:  she asked what locations were more convenient & then we checked for availability. The second location was able to get me in earlier since I was having particular eye issues & wanted to see a doctor as soon as possible. \n\nDr. Matthew Palmer & his staff have been great so far.  His staff were very courteous & professional. Dr. Palmer was beyond helpful in explaining any concerns I had with my eyes. I have & will continue to see him for all my vision needs.  I've gotten my contacts & glasses prescriptions (I'm getting 'old'-er lol because now have to get bifocals\/readers) and tear duct plugs (punctual plugs) to help my eyes stay healthy after my initial visit.  The tear duct plugs have been amazing. Thank you for helpful recommendation. \n\nPS:  I use to see an optometrist but realized when I have a medical issue with my eyes\/vision I would then be referred to an Ophthalmologist plus most insurances will cover them since they are a doctor. After this latest issue with my eyes I realized that for \"Total Eye Care\" offering complete eye care services; seeing an ophthalmologist diminishes additional costs & visits to different locations.\n\nPS (for optical shop):\n\nOk I must admit, vanity & comfort are two key factors in choosing contacts & eyewear.  Shannon (Scottsdale Optical Center is located within Southwestern Eye Center) & my ophthalmologist, Dr. Matthew Palmer, worked together to find me the perfect contacts through several free trials. After several attempts; we finally found what worked for me since I'm sensitive now with dry eye issues (which were diminished significantly with tear duct plugs & specific brand daily wear contacts). \n\nShannon is great!  Very knowledgeable & professional. She was great in taking care of my needs & questions.  Many current, stylish glasses to choose from. Also, has cute assortment of kids glasses.  \n\nIf you buy 3 month supply of contacts; you will receive a great discount. \n\nLocated within Southwestern Eye Center.  They do not accept American Express cards but do take other forms of payment & Care Credit.
