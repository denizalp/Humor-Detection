I seriously have no idea where all these bad reviews were from. My review is based on 2 appointments. \nMy first appointment was a FREE second opinion after seeing another dentist in town and receiving a quote for a extraction and bridge on a very infected tooth. Also a few fillings. \nWas quoted over 3000.00 at the other office and paid 1000.00 at Abbey dental. \nMy first appointment ran about 30 minutes after my scheduled time which should be expected in such a busy office. To save 2000.00 I would have waited all day. It consisted of X-rays and a 3D scan. The dentist I spoke to explained everything and told me what I needed to get done right away and what could wait. I than sat with a treatment coordinator who went over the financial aspect of things and scheduled my appointment. \n\nMy second appointment was for an Extraction, temporary bridge and filling with Dr CROW. After arriving 20 minutes early to pay my remaining balance and check in. My appointment was scheduled at 3pm I was in the room around 3:15. He went over everything in an extremely professional manner and told me exactly what to expect. \nHe numbed me up real good. Took care of the filling around 10 minutes. Prepped my other teeth for the temporary bridge. About 20 minutes each tooth. \nExtracted my extremely infected tooth in around 5 minutes. After receiving the temporary bridge. And scheduling my appointment to get the real bridge put in. \nI was out of the chair in around an hour and a half. \n\nI absolutely hate going to the dentist. However I would come back to see Dr CROW any day. Thank you again Abby dental for saving me thousands of dollars.
