This place just opened 2 days ago. Drinks are amazingly delicious! If you don't want to read everything below, read this. ORDER THEIR FRIES, amazingly crispy with a great garlic sauce!!! Yesterday (12\/3), I tried their \n\nTaro Milk Tea: got it hot, really creamy and full of flavor but not overly sweet\n\nPinenuts Milk Tea: pinenuts were not really my thing, but the milk tea was great. It's not the traditional Taiwanese milk tea. It's made with either English Breakfast or some other kind of black tea that I couldn't completely identify, not with red tea. So if you're expecting red tea, don't. \n\nToday, I went in to try some other drinks and their food. I got their house special. It's the 6th page in their menu. You can choose from Juicy Steak, Chicken Steak Cutlet, Fish Fillet Steak, or Sizzling Noodle. All of them come on a sizzling platter, which has a cool feeling when it comes out of the kitchen to your table in this chic ambience, light gray-blue walls, with glass art, print art, and tea sets decorating different cities' names in their bar area. \n\nIn Chinese, it says you can choose either mushroom sauce or black pepper sauce on the right side, next to the prices of House Special. This is for you non-Chinese reading people. Below that, you see \"Soup\/Sala\/French Fries\/Toast\" and \"Sala\" is NOT a typo. That's what it says. I'm sure you can figure out what word that is. Anyway, I chose the\n\nChicken Steak Cutlet with Mushroom Sauce: Chicken was so tender, mushroom sauce was an on-the-sweeter-side tomato sauce with canned mushrooms, and the pasta that came on top swirled into the sauce was al dente. It was a great meal for a cheap price.\n\nSalad: iceberg, came with a package of ranch on the side\n\nFries: one of the BEST order of fries I have ever had, so crispy and came with a garlic sauce\n\nThey're also having a promotion right now until the 7th. If you check in on Facebook, you receive 50% off. I did that yesterday and today. :) Yummy food at half off... service is the typical Chinatown service you would get at most places, so I can't complain too much there. They try to take things away a little earlier than you'd like, but that's the eager beaver in them, right? \n\nI would say their drinks are a bit better than Miss, definitely five stars. Their ambience is five stars. Their food is not bad. 4.5... overall. I will be back, even after their sale.
