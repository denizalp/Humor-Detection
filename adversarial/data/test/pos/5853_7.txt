My wife has been waiting a Louie Vuitton purse for quite some time now.  Last night I had a great run at the casino and decided to finally spoil my pregnant wife with her dream purse.  Of all the staff we dealt with, all were very professional and pleasant to deal with.  However, Joseph Solla, stood above the rest because he was so patient with the wifey as she couldn't decide which purse to purchase.  They have many choices.\n\nMe personally, I don't know how women can spend that much money on a purse, but hey to each there own.  High quality products, great service, and all inventory in stock.  Come see Joseph!
