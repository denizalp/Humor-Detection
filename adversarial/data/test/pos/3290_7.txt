I did not have the same experience as some of the others that reviewed this location, thankfully. Was greated almost immediately. Received friendly courteous service and my popcorn , which I affectionately call my crack, totally hit the spot and satisfied my craving. My favorite location is the strip but this one served me well when I had a hankering and could not get downtown. Love the peanut butter cup (my crack lol) and got caramel peanut for the hubby which he enjoys. I will definitely stop in again. Very near an entrance too (near ll bean) which works out well when I run in in my lunch.
