They went out to my girlfriends house in Phoenix without even really analyzing it he said it was a compressor he checked out the second unit and after he left neither units worked I  feel that because she was a woman he tried to push the service contact, he talk to me like I was in first grade like I knew nothing so if you want to get racked over the coals call ace he never even checked if the units were under warranty Daniel Loisel was the technician !
