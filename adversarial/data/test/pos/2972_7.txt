i have been seeing angelica valdivieso at detox for life very regularly for 5 1\/2 years. the environment is very clean and professional. if you've ever felt weird about getting a colonic... don't! she will make you feel very comfortable. she is also very well educated in her field of expertise. as strange as it is to talk about it... i really try to encourage people to see her because i am truly aware that i am healthier and i feel better when i am consistent with my appointments. Angelica knows her s... stuff ...;))
