I swear I have left 900 reviews for this place!? I guess not!? What happened lol!? LOVE THIS PLACE!!! The family staff is so friendly, attentive and great at what they do! There hasn't been 1 time I have gone here and been dissapointed. Its a cute life cafe outside the Williams Gateway airport. You can sit inside and watch planes come and go, super neat! They have great aviator decor, great relaxed atmosphere, nice and clean, easy going kind of place. If you stop by come for breakfast! Their hint of cinnamon pancakes are delicious (way better than ihop!) They also have a very affordable breakfast buffets on the weekends.\n\nFlightdeck - You are the reason I am fat! LOL! Your food is way too delicious to throw away, clear my plate every time, no matter what I order! Keep it up! :)
