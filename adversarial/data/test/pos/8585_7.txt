Riddle me this one, Batman: why are airports such bland, expensive haunts, and who determined it justifiable to rip-off the general public - nationwide - with sub-par dining and drink options? The other day I paid eight and a half bucks for a beer at the Albuquerque Sunport. One friggin' beer, the price of a craft six pack. Want a bowl of stew with that? Expect to drop a twenty. Packing us in like travelin' sardines of the sky, the average airport experience is bound to be colorless, uncomfortable and a pain in the wallet. As a whole, options in Phoenix perfectly match this description for me. Being here is like sitting through a Chuck Norris movie.\n\nCartel Coffee, by shocking contrast, is like a special guest appearance by Bill Murray: completely unexpected, instantly memorable, and almost familial, this coffee shop has all of the basic ingredients that make this small local chain invariably cool. The barista was, like, my neighbor, with a t-shirt that said something along the lines of \"I Like Cows\". Likewise with the other guy. And the music was really good. And they had cold brewed, my favorite. And so I got my cup and turned around and set myself down on a chair and if only for a moment, just one blink in time and space, I imagined myself upon a little urban cloud of delight.\n\nAnd then... \"Thank you for flying Southwest Airlines, this is a boarding announcement for Gate 33, scheduled for Seattle...\"
