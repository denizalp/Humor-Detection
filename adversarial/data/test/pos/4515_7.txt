I had the wonderful pleasure of working with this incredible team as a student nurse for their FREE community healthcare fair that recently passed. I was excited to be part of such an important event and that I was able to contribute my services to a great outreach program of providing health promotion to a community that is in need.   Services that were provided and specialist included: vital signs and blood glucose checks, body fat analysis, ophthalmologist, audiologist, neurologist, internist and gynecologist.  The public was happy to be there with an abundance of many medical professionals who came together to volunteer.  I am looking forward to many other events through this group and would love to help out on a regular basis.   It was a very organized event with friendly and professionals. I enjoyed my first experience as as student nurse and networking with everyone who made this event possible. Thank you Truecare MD and everyone that contributed to this positive event. :)
