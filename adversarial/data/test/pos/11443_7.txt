Well, I'm not sure how I feel about covered wagon. Firstly, let me say that the floor staff was very helpful. A young man was eager to help us view items in the case. Another vibrant lady was so eager to tell us about all of the sales they had going on. I decided to buy one item and when I went I ring it up I had asked the counter person if the dealer could take off 10 percent of the price. To my surprise, the counter person had already called the dealer and took the 10 percent. \n\nMy problem: I tried using my resale license and it was like all of the gears stopped turning, everything came to a halt. This place asked for a physical copy of the license.. Wtf? I must have used my license hundreds of times and no one has ever asked for the actual copy. Why would I carry the actual copy around with me? Anyways. Counterperson could not figure out how to fill in the form on the computer. She had us waiting about 20 minutes. After asking if I could leave she responded \"If you leave, I'm going to have to charge you sales tax.\" Well you know what? Congratulations you just lost a sale. Please explain to the dealer in box 6 that you lost him a $65 sale because of $4 in sales tax, complete incompetence and your rude attitude.\n\nOh and the antiques here are just okay. A lot of glass ware, some garage sale stuff. Still some good stuff.
