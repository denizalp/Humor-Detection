$1 Sushi, wtf??!?!?  Ok, so I tried this place after I overheard two people talking about it in a restaurant one night.  They said it was a GREAT spot, and they were right!  I couldn't believe the price, $1 for a nigiri piece, $3 for a standard tuna roll or spicy tuna (8 piece).  It's mostly a take-out spot and does not offer much in the way of decor, but when I can get an entire sushi meal for $10.81 (haha, I go way too much), who cares?\n\nTheir fish is always fresh and the size of the pieces are just fine, especially for $1.  You can't complain.  I'm here 2x's a week on average and completely hooked.  I usually call on my way home, place my order, pick up, and go home to enjoy.  They now even have Tamari wheat-free soy sauce!  (on request)\n\nThey have a variety of specialty rolls as well that vary in price from $3 - $7.  They also serve a sort of Vietnamese-Chinese fusion menu with spring rolls, Pho, stir-fry, etc...  I haven't tried anything there except for the sushi, but people seem to enjoy it.\n\nI highly recommend this place.  Again, go for the food, not the atmosphere.  The sushi chef, John, is very cool too.  Nice guy and very personable.  Makes you feel at home.
