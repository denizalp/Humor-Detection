The reason why I didn't adore Gordon Ramsay BurGR as much as I should have is no fault of my burger, the restaurant, the wait, or the man himself. The fault is entirely my own.\n\nI rolled in around 2 PM because I overslept and we had to wait for an hour. Luckily, GRB texts you when your table is ready, so we went off in search of drinks. One visit to Fat Tuesdays later, I get the text message and we drunkenly ordered two orders of truffle parmesan fries and our burgers.\n\nNow, two orders of fries is a little (a lot) extreme. You don't need two. But oh my god, these fries are delicious. And they come with this unbelievable truffle aioli that I want to dip everything into. If I only knew how to make one thing in my life, I would want to know how to make this truffle aioli. \n\nI ordered the farm burger, which comes with an egg and some sort of duck bacon, which made me excited, because I love duck. The burger was very good, the egg was perfect, and the bacon was disappointing because it didn't taste like duck, but whatever. The only problem? I was so full of alcohol that I really didn't enjoy the burger as much as I could have.\n\nWell, it looks like I'll just have to find another excuse to come back!
