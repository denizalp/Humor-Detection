Minus 1 star for crunchy rice.  What is it about Chinese restaurants with crunchy rice?\n\nSo far I've tried the orange peel chicken (WAYYYYY better than Panda Express, imo), mongolian beef (okay, but really nothing to squeal about), tomato beef (would've liked for it to be a little sweeter, but other than that, it was goooood), egg rolls (small but yummy), and egg drop soup (same as any restaurant).\n\nThere's a reason the orange peel chicken is one of their house specials.  Moist pieces of white meat buckk-erk with a satisfyingly crunchy battered outside smothered in a slightly spicy tangy sweet orange peel sauce.  Freak-en awesome.\n\nMy advice:  If you have a rice cooker, make your own.   Take-out is better than eating in...it's a small cramped little restaurant, and lines tend to form outside.  If you want to eat there, go early.  \n\nThe lunch special with food enough for two averages about $5.50.\n\nDon't trust the fortune cookies. \n\nConfucious does NOT say.
