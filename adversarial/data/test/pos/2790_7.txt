There are signs up that say something to the effect of \"This is a lounge, no dancing allowed\". I don't even like dancing but this rubs me the wrong way. If you don't buy a table you're stuck standing in this cramped loud small \"club\" where you can't dance. Drinks are pricey and not well made. \n\nThe view does rock, but try Voodoo lounge or Mix instead for awesome views and less B\/S.
