Place sucks. \n\nI've now come here enough to pick our what is consistent.  If you eat here you will encounter some or all of these :\n\n1.  Wait to be seated by somebody that is neglecting a table somewhere\n\n2. Be seated in a booth oddly close to someone when other more open seats are available. \n\n3.  Be seated and then sit for a while before a server comes by.  \n\n4.  Finally get to order. \n\n5.  Not get what you ordered. \n\n6.  Have your drink sit empty for most of your meal. \n\n7.  Have your food get cold as your friends misorder is being cooked. \n\n8. Eat tasty food when you do get it. \n\n9.  Not have any silverware. \n\n10.  Be confused about the music they play. It's like they want it to be a club. \n\n11. Over pay. \n\n12. Come badk because there's no other place nearby.
