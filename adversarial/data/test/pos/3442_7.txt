Okay, I've  been shopping  to this store a lot..but this is gonna be my first dong review for them because I don't do Yelp before  I LOVE this store a lot!!! Well, I am the type of person that's very frugal when it comes to our expenditures. I mean there's no point going to these high end stores when you can get same things and spend so much less money? This place pretty much  have everything you need - from your home decors, beddings, bathroom, kitchen etc. Even furnitures too! They got clothes, shoes, purses, anything for cheap! They  sell branded stuffs in here too for a very low price! \nHow amazing is that? They're very budget friendly! You can get a whole lot of things without spending so much \nThis store in Peoria specifically, is cool. I got really nice deal and they have nicer things in here I couldn't find on the other store I usually go to..I'm happy to be able to get amazing things on my list and so much more. \nThe store appearance? It's clean and organized. I didn't have a hard time finding things. If things gets messy, they make sure  they rearrange them. I noticed that most shoppers are just so terribly inconsiderate , they disarrange things and dont even mind putting them back on properly. \nTheir fitting room is neat and so is their bathroom. As for check out counters, there are staffs on each lane , and we checked out faster than normal. \nKeep it up! Customer's  convenience and satisfaction  are very important!
