Had the worst experience here and ruined our first night of clubbing in Vegas. I always plan these things weeks in advance to ensure peace of mind. I was promised by management that all the couples in our group would be comped. Once we got there the people at the door made up some BS and said guys have to pay $40 and \"all the girls\" will be comped, but supposedly the open bar until midnight for girls lets you take \"2 drinks at a time with the wristbands\". Then they handed me a paper which I didn't look over but was supposed to present to the cashier. Once getting to cashier I was then told only 3\/5 of the girls will get comped and the other two are also $40. Are you EFFING KIDDING ME? At this point I texted Justin pleading \"what's going on, this is not what you promised?\"... He completely abandoned me replying \"things changed, sorry\". What type of guest service is that?!! Then once we finally got in, the bartenders at the \"open bar\" barely acknowledged girls with wristbands so we really had to fight for their attention, and come to find it was not \"2drinks with wristband\" but 1! 1 FRIGGIN' drink, which was more like just a glass of ice. Like really Tao? This is what you've resorted to? No wonder everyone says \"Tao sucks now\" and your establishment is not known to be a credible one. Not to mention the restrooms  have no privacy. Never again will we be going there, made sure to tell everyone I know in LA about this horrendous experience and most people agreed (no surprise there).\n\nOn a happier note_ we went to Marquee next day, all couples comped, and had a blast. The promoter there kept his word, unlike the devious pigs at Tao.
