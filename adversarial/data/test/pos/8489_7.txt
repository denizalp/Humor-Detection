Beyond food coma...it's food paralysis!  The itis ain't got nothin' on this.\n\nI had my preconceptions of the food here but I put them away for a short time and figured I'll try anything once.  Dinner started with some bread with butter and munched on the truffle and parmesan potato chips.  They were very oily, warm, crunchy, savory, and tangy in flavor.  We did not make a dent in them.  The appetizer was soon followed by the lobster bisque and traditional New Orleans gumbo with chicken and andouille sausage.  The lobster bisque was really intense in flavor.  It had an almost bitter flavor but so rich like condensed sweet buttery lobster in sea water.\n\nThe protein that night was the bone-in ribeye which we split.  Perfectly cooked to medium, it had a nice crust on the outside and had a big glob of butter on top.  I immediately scraped the butter off and put it on the side but a lot of it had already melted onto the plate or penetrated the meat.  The meat was thick, tender, juicy, had perfect grill marks on the outside, and smelled floral due to the either rosemary or thyme sprigs.  Accompanying the main dish was the seared foie gras.  Yes, I had to try the duck (or goose) liver.  It was indeed buttery, silky, melt in your mouth tender and a good sized piece at that.  Like everything else here, it was seared in butter and had a salty, buttery crust to it.\n\nAs for the sides, we had sauteed garlic wild mushrooms and the creamed corn gratinee.  The mushrooms were delightful.  I loved forking up different varieties that I had no idea what they were.  They just tasted great.  The garlicky, buttery flavor and tender yet almost slippery texture makes this dish my favorite of the night.  The creamed corn also exhibited buttery flavor so much I think it was in a bath of butter and heavy cream.\n\nYou couldn't have all this great food without wine and they have an impressive wine menu indeed.  I went with that I know and got the syrah.  Toward the end of the meal it hit me.  The wall...of carbs, butter, salt, cholesterol, all in a sluggish soup coursing though my veins like molasses.  I feel my heart straining to pump the blood with heavy thumps and I feel the arteries of my wrist bumping against the table.  My body starts to get lethargic - I don't wanna move, no I can't move - as I gaze blankly over the huge leftovers of corn and butter.  This is beyond food coma, I need a blood transfusion I thought.  Need I be more dramatic?  My preconceptions were right.\n\nOn the bright side, the service is impeccable here and everyone seems to to take their job seriously and sincerely.  It is a bit of a formal atmosphere but you don't feel like you're in Las Vegas for the short time you're there.
