I was meeting a girlfriend for cocktails, she came into town and was staying here. I have stayed here in the past, but not on this occasion. We met in one of the hotel bars. I ended up being a little late for our meeting so she had already ordered me a drink. When I finally got from the parking garage to the bar I had a refreshing mojito waiting for me. It was so refreshing. \n\nWhen I walked into the bar, I believe it was the Vista the wait staff just pointed out the bar and I found my friend waiting for me. We had another round but this time I ordered us vodka tonics with lime. They were just as good if not better than the first round. My girlfriend insisted on paying the tab to the bartender by charging it to the room. I got the tip. The bartender was very professional and sweet even after I tipped him. As we left he asked if we needed anything and we were in our way. \n\nAs we made our way through the casino the staff is so friendly on guiding one back to the parking garage. I do not frequent Caesars enough to know the casino layout. Guests are surrounded by such ambiance and wonders of Ancient Rome all around. When we got back to the parking garage and found the car it was off to play in Vegas.
