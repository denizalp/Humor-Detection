I love this place. I visited the Desert Ridge location earlier in the year and really liked it, but was disappointed that there was not another location closer to my home. Well now there is. Woo hoo!\n\nThere's lots of parking directly across the street from the store. And they always have several registers open so even on a busy weekend day, you usually only have one other person in front of you in line. Pretty good selection and stock. \n\nThey now charge $0.10 for wine tastings (tried 3 wines) and they have them on Fridays (12-6 pm), Saturdays (11-6 pm), and Sundays (12-5 pm). They have a table set up in the middle of the store where you show your ID and drop a dime into the jar. They had a beer tasting going on at the same time. I wasn't interested in that so I didn't check out the dates, times, and cost for that. Sorry! \n\nAnd the best part is there's actually people to help you here unlike some other big places like this that I've visited. Where there isn't an employee in sight. \n\nSign up on their website for their e-mails to get coupons.
