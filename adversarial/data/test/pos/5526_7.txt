i've been spoiled by nicer rooms at the venetian \/ planet hollywood....\n\ncame here cuz it was free from expedia.**\n\nthe hotels room are nothing too special.  they look like your typical motel 6 rooms.  albeit, they are more \"tropical\".  think like a poor man's Hawaii paradise.  the room was clean and surprisingly the pillows were really fluffy and soft.   they have an iron and board and they also have a hair blow dryer.\n\nthe elevator is ghetto as hell.  its broken and slow and scary... the parking garage is also very dilapidated.    \n\nas for the casino floor.....\nthey have 3$ black jack!!  one of the cheapest tables on the strip.\nthey usually have cheap tables, low limits, and cheap slots.\n\nthey hooters girls are nice and they sometimes frequent the casino floor with drinks.  you just gotta flag them down.\n\nvalet people are nice and you can order a taxi and or limo from them very efficiently and quickly.  \n\nPS: the hotel room's walls are very thin cuz we heard creaking from the bed next door.  T_T.  i wonder what they were doing.... 0_0
