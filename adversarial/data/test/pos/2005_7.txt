I am really excited about this place. I just ate there last night, and am looking forward to many more meals of exciting creative modernist cuisine!\n\nBefore this review gets further, I should say upfront that this restaurant may not please everyone. This place isn't for you if: 1) you want your meals to come in inhumanly large portions; 2) you are only happy when you get the biggest bang for your bucks; or 3) you think liquid nitrogen only belongs in science classes.  \n\nThe Twisted Frenchman offers a fresh take on classic dishes. On paper, the dishes that composed my three course meal sound standard enough: foie gras, lamb chop, and chocolate mousse; but the way these dishes were prepared was definitely not strictly old school.  The lamb chop, for example, was wrapped in ground lamb, cooked \"sous vide,\" then browned. The result is a wonderful contrast between the tender, juicy chop meat and the crispy outer skin. The accompanying side is a poached onion shell piped with brie-whipped mashed potato. Surprisingly, the onion still had a crunch to it; it was a great pairing with the velvety, creamy, mashed potato. The chocolate mousse was a fun show piece. Chef Garbarino came out with a pitcher of liquid nitrogen and poured it over a bowl of melted chocolate. He then cracked and mixed the frozen surface shards with the soft gooey chocolate beneath. Every bite was a delicious contrast.\n\nI can't wait to see what new adventures Chef Garbarino will dream up next.
