This place is actually pretty delicious Italian food that usually has a couple of openings for last minute reservations should you need it. I have eaten at this place several times and have yet to be disappointed. The service rocks, the food is fresh and the drinks are strong. The lasagna here is worth a mention as it is delicious, especially when washed down alongside a bold Tuscan red. Overall, not a super high end establishment but an extremely solid option for some casual Italian dining without having to leave the Cosmo. \n\nPros-\nService \nLocation\nFood \nFlavoring \nDrinks\nMenu \nBread \n\nCons-\nLoud \nSpace is small\nPortions are a tad small\nCan get pricey
