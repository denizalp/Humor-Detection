The price for dinner is $14.95 (or something close to $15).\n\nPros:\n-dinner buffet (most indian places only have buffet for lunch)\n\nCons:\n-the selection was abysmal. Most of the stuff I wouldn't eat.\n-butter chicken had bones in it\n-no lamb curry, chicken curry, etc\n-not worth the $15!\n\nI recommend going somewhere else... anywhere else. It's yonge st, lots of options. Like Salad King, Chipotle, etc.
