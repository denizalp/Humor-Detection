I've been going here for what feels like forever now. Have yet to try their overpriced surritos. Their poke bowls are now bigger and better, which is great since it comes out to $10-11. Drinks can be ordered on the iPads as soon as you walk in to make things quicker. I've been visiting more often in the past months and for some reason their boba and teas are tasting of lower quality than I remember. The milk teas have too much milk or their tapioca pearls would be too sticky, clumpy, or bland. Today was a bit better though! It's probably due to new staff who are being trained since they're always so busy and need more hands on deck. Kungfu Tea, you are still my go to!
