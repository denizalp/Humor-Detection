This place is RIDICULOUSLY overpriced. I don't know why every animal in there has a price tag of at least $2000. I can understand that they MAY be AKC registered (which looking at the paperwork is hard to believe.) and that makes them more valuable but let's be honest, these are animals from a PET STORE. Not a reputable breeder or a shelter. You can get a true AKC registered pet from a breeder for HALF the cost and with higher care of the animal. \n\nI give kudos to this place for making people sanitize their hands before touching the animals (unlike Pet Pros) however I did see them giving some of their puppies PINK water, which causes suspicion to the health of these animals. Usually when Pet Stores give animals water with \"medicine\" in it, it is so that they will pass the initial vet exam...(keep them healthy until their out of our care then who care's if they die). It's unfortunate but true. \n\nIf you are going to purchase an animal from here and not go through a reputable breeder or adopt from a shelter, proceed with caution. Like a wise man once told me; \"Expect the worst, hope for the best.\"
