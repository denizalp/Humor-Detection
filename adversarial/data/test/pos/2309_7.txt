I love this place!!!  There's the whole Five Guys v. In-N-Out argument, and which one is better, etc.  But the truth is, that's like comparing apples to oranges (whether you like apples over oranges, or vice versa, is a different story).  \n\nTo me, it tastes a little more like burgers you get fresh off the grill in your backyard (of course, that could be because they wrap the burgers in foil).  It is more expensive than In-N-Out, but when I order a small hamburger (one patty), fries and drink, it comes out to about $10.  That's the same as a burger at Applebee's or Red Robin, and believe me, this burger is MUCH better.  I also like that they offer a ton of toppings for \"free,\" i.e., they don't charge extra.  This allows me to get a burger with grilled onions, mushrooms and bell peppers (ohhhhh yeah, what's your name, who's your daddy).\n\nThe regular size fries come in a pretty decent sized cup, which is sharable with *at least* one other person.  (Depending on how much of a fry monster you are.)  Personally, I like the regular seasoned fries, as opposed to the cajun seasoned fries.  \n\nAlso, as other peeps have mentioned, the soda machines are touch screen that give you lots of soda options.  For example, for Diet Coke - there's Diet Coke Lime, Diet Coke Cherry, Diet Coke Cherry Vanilla, Diet Coke Orange, etc.  And that's just for Diet Coke.  It's like that for each type of soda, e.g., Fanta, Coke Sprite, etc.  It's awesome! \n\nAs a FYI, this particular location appears to have the A\/C on overdrive ALL the time.  It makes it a little uncomfortable to eat there sometimes.  I've been to Five Guys at the Las Vegas outlets and on Flamingo at the 215, and neither seem to have the same issue.  \n\nOverall, I can't compare Five Guys to In-N-Out because for me, they're just different.  In my world (and with the help of an elastic waistband), I can make room for both.
