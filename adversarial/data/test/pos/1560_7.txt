The bf took me here for our one year anniversary... Gotta say, what a huge disappointment. Besides the amazing view and the fact that they introduced me to my favorite wine (fyi - Dom. des Trois Toits Muscadet Sevre et Maine), Isabela is NOT 5 stars in my book.\n\nPlain and simple: The food leaves something to be desired. Actually, it leaves a lot.\n\nDon't get me wrong... Service was great (although I've still experienced better). It's just that the food was SO forgettable. It was so forgettable that I forgot the name of the restaurant until I went back on Yelp to look for it. For a \"5 star\" rating, I'd expect better.\n\nI'm not from the Pitts, so I can objectively say that this is NOT a 4 or 5 star restaurant. It's an extremely overpriced 2 star restaurant (and again, I'm  talking strictly about the food here). Then again, it is in the Pitts, and the Pitts isn't a city known for its yummy fare.\n\nSave your money and go to a cafe in Shadyside instead... then go to the Grandview Park afterwards to enjoy a nice view of the city.
