So I never had this place burgers until last week.  I'm at a mehhh... as far as the overall taste of everything.  The Burger was good (Just good) but for $12.95 I would expect the burger to be a knock out.  The fries weren't good at all.  I mean I thought McDonalds fries were better than these fries.  Soggy and greasy potato sticks would be a better description.  Of course my large soda was $3.95.  I'm sorry that movie theater prices.  For the mehhh food and the Super price thats why I gave this place 3 stars.  I don't understand why its so expensive here.  The place itself is in the Excalibur hotel.  You see all kinds of bleacher creature tourist in that place.  The line was pretty long the whole time.  After I ordered I had to wait about 10 minutes for the food to be done.  They give you a pager with a number on it.  The dining part is pretty big.  I would think it fits 100 people at least.  The food was ight...  But from looks alone the milkshakes looked like the best thing here.  Maybe I'll go back for a milkshake next time.
