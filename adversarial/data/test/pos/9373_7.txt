Wow oh wow. I came here for my birthday wanting to try something new. Reviews seemed ok. Unfortunately, a happy day turned sour when everyone around me is getting their food and I've waited 40 minutes after ordering. Very disappointed with this place. The service was just absolutely terrible. I was so frustrated by being ignored by wait staff as I was raising my hand for 3 minutes trying to get someone's attention. When mentioned that we had been waiting long, we got a shrug. I will not be going to this place again. Food was to mediocre for what I had to endure. Wish it was possible to give 0 stars. Thanks for a ruined birthday.
