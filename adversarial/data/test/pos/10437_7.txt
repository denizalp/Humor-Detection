I think the franchise was still called International House of Pancakes the last time I came to one of these, and no, I can't remember where in the hell it was. I do know that another IHOP is opening in Eastern Pittsburgh. We passed it on the way to and from Munhall, but it's not ready for business yet, and I don't know if it will be 24\/7 like this Robinson location is. \n\nThe food was good, but the service was really rushed and was a bit lackluster. Although I saw a gaggle of teenagers leaving who had obviously been to a high school football game earlier and was told their credit card machine was down, I really don't know what exactly was going on that night. The staff was incredibly harried despite only being half-full at most. We were handed our check before we finished our meal and were not given a chance to order dessert. I was also given pancakes instead of the fruit I ordered on the side. I wanted to order chocolate chip pancakes for dessert, but it was obvious that they wanted us out of there, so kaput on that. We were not causing a disturbance either, so what their problem was, I really don't know. \n\nHell, they had 5 different people bringing out food for one party, all of whom had distressed expressions on their faces. \n\nSome of them even looked like dishwashers based on their uniforms.\n\n????\n\nDid the CEO make a surprise visit? Were they being evaluated? Robbed??? Held hostage??? This was easily one of the most tension-filled restaurant experiences I've ever had. I mean, I felt uncomfortable, like me and my little devil were an inconvenience.\n\nJeez, all my lady ordered was The Strawberry Banana French Toast, which I got to sample and found to be rather worthy. Her sausage links may have been the pinnacle even.\n\nI mean that. I was shocked at their high quality. Melt-in-the-mouth now has a new definition. \n\nAll I bothered the waitress and cooks with was a Bacon Temptation Omelet, which not only includes a half-dozen pig strips and diced tomatoes, but also this STAGGERINGLY appetizing cheese sauce. It's so lush and sharp, it's magical and instantly put this egg blanket into my personal Omelete Hall of Fame. Ooof!\n\n\nAs for the triple wheatcakes (as Peter Parker would call 'em) I got by mistake, to be totally blunt, they were really nothing special to me. I have had better for sure. Then again, these were plain syrup-and-butter flapjacks, and as I said earlier, I really wanted to try one of their more elaborate griddlecake creations, but before I could, our set was cut short by the fire marshal so to speak. \n\nOh well, I saved a few dollars anyway. \n\nThat omelet and the fact that it's open 'round-the-clock gets it up to 3 stars but no more. \n\nI MAY be back to sample those Chocolate Chip Pancakes though. Until then, hotcake-wise, Dor-Stop has IHOP under its bootheel. \n\nIHOP, u hop, we hop, IHOP, u hop, they hop...\n\nI couldn't resist, could I?
