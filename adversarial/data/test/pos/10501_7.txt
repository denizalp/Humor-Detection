Dear bagels, \n\nI know I shouldn't love you. Your high-carb dough and the layers of saturated fat that are slathered onto you in the form of a delectable flavored cream cheese, such as honey almond or sun-dried tomato, are, in fact, quite bad for me. My arteries scream in terror whenever I pass your quaint shop with the friendly employees on Dysart. But I can't stay away. You are always toasted to perfection. You come in so many delicious flavors that change with the seasons. Pumpkin crunch? Don't mind if I do. Gingerbread? Dunk me. \n\nAnd your bagel sandwiches - - my, oh my. How I love a thick cream cheese base upon which my boring-yet-nutritious sprouts can rest their weary heads, followed by sliced tomato and deli turkey. Add some cranberry sauce to the mix and I feel like I'm home on the farm for Thanksgiving. If I had a farm, that is. \n\nBagels, it will never be over between us. You may think I've ended it, but I'll always be back for more of your sweet and savory lovin. \n\nLove, \nKate
