I've been at the Thirsty Lion 3 times during the day. This was the first time I dined at night. During the day is great, but the night crew are not professional at all. I'm pretty sure they are all new staff. We (4 people) got sat in the back patio and waited 10 min for a server. They got everyone's drink but mine, I waited again for 10 min. I tried to use the restroom and got yelled at because there was a \"private dinner\" going on. Its not so private when the guests are smoking right next to us. We only got one appatiser and that was okay. I will never come here again.
