I shop here often.  One of my requirements for a grocery store is clean aisles.  They keep their aisles clean here.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lnwUINj-K7f1ak7Dl1Y6ig?select=9W8LPv-Cr2FyMEUVAWdAIQ#9W8LPv-Cr2FyMEUVAWdAIQ\n\nThe staff is always friendly and greets you when you walk in and when you're at the checkout line....believe it or not, that doesn't always happen at other stores.\n\nThe prices are definitely a bit higher here than at other stores, but it's in Scottsdale, what do you expect?\n\nThe only thing I wish they had more of is a bigger selection of fresh Bread.\n\nOverall, it's an above average shopping experience.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%
