Never did I think that the words \"tofu\" and \"mouthwatering\" would ever be used in the same sentence. Although I've had different versions of Japanese food before, Raku takes the prize hands down. \n\nHidden in a strip mall way away from all the casinos and bright lights, Raku prefers to keep it understated. The restaurant only has about 10-12 tables along with a small room for groups near the back. I'd suggest calling ahead for a reservation, but since they stay open so late (someone tells me 3 a.m.?), chances are you'll be seated eventually. \n\nIf you've never had traditional Japanese food before, the menu is pretty overwhelming. I was lucky enough to dine here with a local and he did all of the ordering. Good thing, too, because I had no idea where to start. We definitely had the tofu (get it! so good!) and a myriad of small plates, including scallops and salmon- two fish that I normally turn my nose up at, but were SO good! These chefs know their sauces. That's all I have to say about that...\n\nGo here with someone (or a few someones) that you really like, order yourselves a ton of food and plan on \"oohing\" and \"aahing\" the entire time.
