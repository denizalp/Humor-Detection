Prices a bit high, unable to get me what I asked for (although I never went back to get it fixed, so I take part of the blame), customer service rather friendly.\n\nI've now gone twice to this venue, and all-in-all, I don't think it's right for me. The reason being is I asked for my hair to be cut so that it doesn't go in my eyes and in my ears, and both times that wasn't done for me.\n\nOtherwise the service was friendly. I'm a bit used to going to more \"affordable\" places where they have a set price for a haircut, where-as this place has a range of what they'll charge you, so I'm not sure how they determine how much to charge (maybe by how long they worked on the haircut?).\n\nI do kind of like how they sell antiques at the lobby of the venue.\n\nTypically if I wasn't planning on returning to a place, as is the case for this one, I'd give a 2-star rating. However considering I didn't go back either of the 2 times to get my hair fixed the way I initially asked for, I'm giving them an extra star.
