I've been here a couple times now. The  owner always takes time to come out and talk to the customers and his passion for his business is evident in his food. There's plenty of well crafted, well executed dishes on the menu.\n\nSirloin on sourdough - plenty of tender and juicy beef, nicely toasted bread; with a side of Bavarian potato salad that tasted heavily of paprika or a similar spice.\n\n1\/4 white chicken ($6.99) - breast and wing. I got it plain (for my kid) with the BBQ sauce on the side. Plenty of juicy meat and it came with one side.\n\n1\/2 rack of St. Louis style ribs ($16.99) - the meat wasn't fall-off-the-bone tender, but it was good, smokey, and very meaty. The ribs are smoked for several hours then finished on the grill with your choice of sauce. I loved the bbq sauce -- a touch sweet with plenty of depth in flavor. The meal came with one side.\n\nRed potato salad - plenty of acidity plus eggy-mayonaise taste. It was ok.\n\nHerb roasted potatoes - excellent. slightly crispy exterior\/soft interior, well seasoned.\n\nI haven't tried the sausages yet, but will soon. The owner mentioned that they're made in-house.
