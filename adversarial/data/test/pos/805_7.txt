THIS PLACE IS A SCAM. Highly not recommended. They give you incorrect information to lure you into visiting and getting you cleaned there. \n\nI've been only going to a dental hygienist over the years and decided to come here because my brother referred me. My brother got his wisdom teeth removed here and they did ok. So might as well get my teeth cleaned and be examined by the dentist regarding my wisdom teeth at the same place. \n\nHowever, from my experience, I have to say this place is horrible. I called a head asking for prices and if my insurance fully covered teeth cleaning.  The current place I visited had full coverage, I didn't have to pay anything at all. I told the receptionist this. The receptionist at this dentist office confirmed to me that I had full coverage for dental cleaning and procedures at their clinic too and I did not need to pay anything when I visit. So I decided to get my teeth cleaned here. \n\nOn the day of my appointment, I didn't fill out any forms before getting my teethed cleaned. I filled out the forms after my teeth were cleaned. The hygienist and receptionist was really pushy with making me get my X-rays done even though I told her I would like to only get the X-ray to check for wisdom teeth. I did not want to get the X-ray for cavities as I already took them at my other dentist a few months back. \n\nShe proceeded with the cleaning but I felt like she didn't clean my teeth well. She would  scrape a little and then rinse and then scrape and rinse some more. I felt like she spent most of the time rinsing and sucking out the water rather than actually cleaning my teeth. Overall, my teeth did not feel as clean as expected when you visit a dentist. \n\nBesides that, when I was done. The secretary made me fill out all the necessary forms and then charged me for the cleaning. I was not expecting this because when I called a week prior to my appointment they told me that my insurance fully covers the cleaning like my dental hygienist and I did not need to pay anything. The secretary told me the plan changed, but my insurance goes by yearly. So clearly they lied to me. There's no way that my plan changed in a week. They obviously are not full coverage but state they are. Pretty much lied to me and tricked me into coming to get my teeth cleaned here and the charging me. I even brought my boyfriend to get his teeth cleaned here too. In the end, I ended up paying around $70, on top of that they also charged my insurance. My boyfriend ended up paying around $80. \n\nI tried talking to the manger but she was not in that day. So my mom called to complain for me a few days later because it was their mistake. The manager offered to send me a credit. It's been about month or more since then. However the credit of about $70 never came in the mail. Clearly this place is a SCAM. The people here are not honest or trustworthy.  They lie to you to get your business. Avoid visiting this place at all costs.
