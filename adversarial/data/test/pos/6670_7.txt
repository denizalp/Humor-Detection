it's a great classes! BUT!!!!\nThey will ask from you only $77 dollars for unlimited 28 days workout. In the end of the month they will send you email with new prices ( range from $100 till $170). When I asked why I have to pay $148 (monthly payment for unlimited classes) instead of $77.. They told me that it's $77 per month it's offer.. IT DOESNT SAY ANYWHERE!!!!!!!!! It doesn't say that it's only first month or for new clients! After that I said I can't pay double price, they never get back to me!
