I write this as a Las Vegas native, born and raised, who is used to the small selection of farmer's markets that pop up around the valley on the weekend. And as someone who actively envies California farmer's markets, I must say Gilcrease Orchard is good as it's gonna get here. \n\nThis place is SO wholesome. Bring your own recyclable grocery bags and some gloves (optional), and spend the morning picking your own veggies. It's as fresh as it gets! When you're done, you pay by the pound and return any shears they so graciously let guests borrow. Also, you can cut off any unnecessary foliage (like chard on beets) to bring your price down.  Don't worry, I got you! I already sheepishly asked! And there's no waste here, because they feed it to the chickens! Did I mention how wholesome it is here??\n\nOverall, super fun thing to drag your boyfriend to. My boyfriend ended up loving it and we had a lot of fun doing a whole farm-to-table style meal.
