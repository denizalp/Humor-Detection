Wanted to treat visiting granddaughter to japanese teppanaki meal.  She had been to Benihana's in Scottsdale and while we had a good experience there, I wanted to surprise her with a new place. Spent over an hour checking out Yelp reviews and came up with Osaka in Mesa.  Had fairly good reviews and a nice drive never hurt anybody.  So instead of driving 5 miles to Benihana, I drove 20 miles to Osaka.  \n\nEnvironment:  Osaka is less dingy, more brightly lit and cleaner than Benihana.\n\nThe Soup:  Miso type soup with mushrooms.  It was more of a holograph of mushrooms.  Not bad tasting but not good either.  Not hot, lukewarm.  Benihana wins on their wonderful hot soup.  \nSalad:  Iceberg lettuce, one grape tomato, one slice of cucumber.  About the same size as Benihana's but Benihana's ginger dressing is delicious.  Osaka's dressing does not have a flavorful ginger dressing.  Kind of blah. \n\nCondiments\/Sauces:  Benihana serves a wonderful, strong mustardy sauce along with a ginger based sauce.  Osaka served a Ranch dressing type of sauce and a diluted, sweet ginger sauce.  Benihana wins.  \n\nFood Preparation:  Osaka seems to be off on the order in which food is prepared.  Fried Rice was done first so everyone had fried rice on their plates.  One couple who had a toddler with them ( parents paid for a kiddie meal which I will never understand why), ended up with a portion of fried rice which was twice the size of my teenage granddaughter's portion.  Literally.  Does that make sense?  \nThe chef  then put on the meats, fish and shrimp.  Cooked steak for those who ordered steak and served it to them.  My granddaughter who specifically asked for \"bloody\" and emphasized rare steak, ended up with medium to medium-well steak.  Does one send steak back at a Teppanaki table service?  I wanted to but my granddaughter did not want to create a fuss.  What a nice temperament.  I would not have been so nice.  So now everyone has fried rice and steak on their plate and I have only fried rice and the shrimp entree I ordered has not been served to me.  The shrimp are sitting on the grill while the chef does a few tricks including cleaning portions of the grill which had scallop residue on it.  Yes, please, go ahead and clean your grill.  I can wait some more.  I can graze on the fried rice and the ridiculous sauces you served with it.\n I asked him if I was ever going to get my shrimp. And suddenly a light bulb went off and he realized I was the only one with just rice.  So I am served my shrimp but only after everyone got their 2 shrimp appetizer on their plates first.  Did I say appetizer?  Doesn't an appetizer come first such as before the fried rice which was getting cold on our plates while the chef did his endless number of tricks??? I'm for the tricks don't get me wrong.  I'm no scrooge.  But you can't keep me from having anything substantive on my plate while you do your tricks and everybody else is eating their fried rice and steak.  He finally puts shrimp on my plate.  Hot shrimp, cold fried rice.  Oh, did I forget to tell you that the veggies haven't been prepared yet?  Oh, yeah. Go ahead.  Serve the vegetables at the end.  Alone.  After we have eaten our rice and protein.  Are vegetables a dessert so that's why they are served at the end and served  Overdone like mush?.  Benihana knows how to present food in such an order that everyone is eating their dish at the same time.  They serve the soup, salad, then the standard shrimp appetizer, veggies (while the meat\/fish is cooking) and fried rice.  All lovely like a ballet.  No ballet at Osaka, more like breakdance on the D train in NYC.
