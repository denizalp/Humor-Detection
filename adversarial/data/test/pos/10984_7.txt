Absolutely beautif-  No no no.. wait... I can't use one word to describe this place.. It's glamorous, chic, upscale, hip, fun and sexy sexy sexy... Wow.. From the moment I got out of the cab and walked into this property, I knew I was in for it. \n\nDuring the day, there's heavy foot traffic all over Vegas. Tourists are hitting up every spot from south strip to north strip. Cosmopolitan is the newest and hottest at the moment. The people walking throughout the casino are just regular folks, but then you start noticing that there's a slightly larger portion of physically attractive people. I'll get back to this in a bit.\n\nSo, we get into our room which is located on the East Tower. We had requested a view looking over the Bellagio Fountains, but the guy told us that we would have to wait until check-in time in order to see what they have available. But he offered a room for early check-in, which was one of the few rooms that were available right away. We took it.. It's not always easy to get a room early in a property that's normally 100% booked at 12:00 PM on day of check-in. So, my buds and I take a elevator trip (You need your keycard just to use any of the elevators leading to guest floors, awesome! Keeps the scavengers out!) We get into our room, and it's just immaculate! The rooms are gorgeous, two TVs, a balcony overlooking Aria and the Boulevard pool as well as Marquee Dayclub. Plush beds, couches, electrical outlets and USB ports everywhere. Separate bathtub, shower (If you happen meet someone, or you're with your significant other, that shower has plenty of space.. And if you're extra freaky, there's space for for about 3 more, lol, just saying). \n\nThe service provided by Cosmo was just impeccable! We must have called them on 7 different occasions just for random things and they're always happy to provide them and even give you a service call later to see if you received everything. On top of that, they have 24 hour housekeeping so you can request a clean room any time you want! We always left a nice tip to the cleaning ladies and had rooms cleaned above and beyond with even our shoes lined up and our own personal bathroom items arranged nicely.\n\nWithin the next few days, we took advantage of the Bamboo Pool and the Boulevard Pool. This is when I noticed that almost 90% of the hot people you see walking around Cosmo are staying at Cosmo and the rest are just people walking through. I've never seen so many hot bodies in one place in my life. Beautiful women lounging and strutting their goods all over the property. I would definitely recommend the Boulevard Pool over the Bamboo Pool because it's more upbeat and you can hear all the music bumping from its own DJ or from the Marquee Dayclub. Marquee Dayclub might have the most upbeat, but there's also cover to pay, so I'd rather just take advantage of what comes free with our stay at the property. The cocktails were good, but they ran out of mint leaves so they couldn't make any Mojitos.. BOOOOOO!! But that's OK. I had plenty of other drinks to make up for one lost one, lol. \n\nEvery single bar there is impressive, all beautiful with the glitz and glam, crystals everywhere. And of course Chandelier Bar was by far one of the most impressive sights I've laid my eyes on.\n\nIn short, my buddies were stunned by this property and we all agreed that this is the spot to be in.\n\nOn a side note.. This is a very lively property. You can hear music from Marquee in the whee hours when most normal people are trying to get shuteye... But everyone knows that Vegas is everything but normal.. The age range is mainly between 25-35, and there are definitely female beauties of all shapes, sizes and ethnicities (high maintenance as well) all over the place. The guys are a mix of frat dudes, pretty boys and a few meathead types. I mention these things because it may not be everyone's cup of tea. If you're looking for a more down-to-earth type of feel, this might not be the spot.  I like this place because it's not as boring and pretentious as Bellagio or Caesars, but it's not as as Douchebaggy as Hard Rock or Palms. This place is hip and sexy and it completely stands apart from any other property in Vegas. \n\nI look forward to making this place my hotel of choice on my next visit to Vegas.
