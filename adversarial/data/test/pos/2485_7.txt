Quaint neighbourhood bookshop that features a not-insignificant selection of sci-fi, fantasy, and fiction. It's tight in here, so lover of carbs are advised to be careful while traversing their thin book-filled aisles.\n\nThis place is positively loaded with tomes old and new. Some key finds include old-school volumes of Nancy Drew books and some brand new Asterix the Gaul and Tin Tin. They do have some non-fiction picks, but I think this is primarly a store for story seeking geeks. I spotted quite a few bound comic books and graphic novels too.\n\nThe prices seemed pretty fair as well. Put down that donut and pay them a visit.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: I DOUG it.\n\nMenu Readability: Great sign out front, but all the signage in the store is way, way too high.\n\nNeed to mention: They have a store rabbit named Bumpkin. He had a lot of heart.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: I like my fiction scienced.
