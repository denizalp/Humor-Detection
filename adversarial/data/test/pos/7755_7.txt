So I'm at the MSG\/Lynch Mob gig and strike up a conversation with a guy who claimed to be with Lynch Mob (booking? promotions? go-fer?) and appeared to become more inebriated the more I spoke with him. \n\nAfter Lynch Mob's set, he insists on taking me back to meet the band, calling me a \"good buddy\" even though we barely know each other. \n\nNow I couldn't care less whether or not I meet any band. They have enough people bothering them as far as I'm concerned, and in this case, I really didn't want to miss the headliners since that's who I was there for. MSG playing Pittsburgh is a rare, incandescent event. \n\nWhen I explain that, he says, \"Yeah man. But LYNCH Mob. F'ng LYNCH MOB DUDE!\"\n\nYa gotta humor drunks. If only they all smoked grass, y'know?\n\nSo I leave my ladyfriend behind before MSG takes the stage and go downstairs from the balcony to what seems like a basement. \n\nIt's weird how they have the bathrooms near the dressing rooms. \n\nCaptain Blotto (I can't remember the fella's name) takes me down to this crowded corridor, and I see an acquaintance with whom I strike up a brief conversation, which isn't enough to get me out of this predicament. \n\nI mean, I want out because I have a sinking feeling the guys full of, well, piss and vinegar, and will probably at least get cussed out. \n\nThere's a door that says STAFF ONLY.\n\nI say to him, \"Dude, you're gonna get in trouble. I don't want that. It's no big deal, really.\"\n\n\"No, chill,\" he replies. \"I KNOW these guys.\" \n\nHe opens the door a crack, and I hear a cacophany of voices and accents,some German (guess who?), some British, some American. \n\n\"For fuck's sake. We are shirtless! Very uncool, very uncool! GET OUT YOU DUMBSHIT!\"\n\nOut pops the heads of Michael Schenker, his singer Gary Barden, and his drummer, the legendary Carmine Appice; MSG, so NOT Lynch Mob! If you don't know who any of them are, you will probably recognize Carmine Appice as he's played with everyone from Rod Stewart to Ozzy Osbourne.\n\nHere, click around...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.carmineappice.net\/photos\/photos.html\n\nLook familiar? He still rocks the fluffy shirts. \n\nSo I was in a music video; a surreal one (aren't they all?) to say the least. I pretended as if I was just waiting to use the john since I didn't want my heroes remembering me as \"that jackass in Pittsburgh\" years later when asked in interviews about their strangest tour stories. Besides, security already had enough issues with fans wandering into dressing rooms that night. \n\nAnyway, the three principals pop back into the dressing room, and Captain Blotto tries to get back in.\n\nFearing that things might get ugly, I try to sneak off, but he starts following me. \n\nThank God for groupies. Well, she had that air about her; chainmail bikini top, tight, low-cut jeans, tats, ditzy, half-in-the-hopper demeanor. She was very young also, looking to be in her low 20's, tiny as a faerie; Tinkerbell's libertine tomboy grandkid, if you will. Little girl lost? \n\nYeah, one would think the groupies here tonight would be 30-40ish. It was as puzzling as it was heartening. This music endures and finds new fans despite mainstream support. \n\nI grab the girl by the arm gently and pull her in front of me, and then hold her by her tender, silky shoulders, again, gently since I lift weights, have rough hands, and she's a butterfly. \n\n\"Wooow...you look like that guy from Staind... or the one from Disturbed,\" she says with a rock 'n roll dreamland gaze. \n\nStaving off any feelings of flattery I may have been having at the moment, I quickly ask her for her name.\n\n\"Jaaaamiieee.\"\n\nThat's \"Jamie\" for those who aren't fluent in alcohol-induced slow-motion speech.\n\nI ask her, \"Do you like Lynch Mob?\"\n\n\"Fuucck yeaaahhh duuude,\" she replies \n\nI turn her around so her back's facing me (man she was a shrimpo!), and then spin us both around so that the two of us are right in front of Captain Blotto. \n\nBlotto looks at me and then looks down to ogle Jamie.\n\n\"She's LOVES Lynch Mob and is dyin' to meet 'em! Right Jamie?\"\n\nWithout saying another word, he takes Jamie by the hand with his eyes and mouth wide open and knocks and knocks and knocks and knocks on that dressing room door. Meanwhile, I make a quick getaway back up to the balcony to catch the rest of the show. \n\nAs I turn around one last time, I see the door open and someone yank Jamie inside before it shuts again. Captain Blotto resumes his knocking.\n\nWhew!\n\nA groupie saved me from embarassment and with that, my night. \nl'll never bag on the backstage queens again.
