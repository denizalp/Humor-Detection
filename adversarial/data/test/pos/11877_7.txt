They have a Yokohama Ramen on the menu .... anything named after my hometown is actually supposed to be Chinese (the regional delicacy is shumai dumplings, the sort you find in dim sum. Sold in bento sets on long long Japan Railways trips) ... but I digress. After the toxic waste dump that is Tampopo, I was excited to find a another ramen place even though I had NO idea who Nishikawa was (it is a common surname). The equivalent for an American would be to find \"Johnson Burgers\" in Recife or Pattaya which then begs the question ... Nishikawa who? What?\n\nSo I ordered the Nishikawa Black, a set of pork gyoza and some spicy garlic edamame, which should be a representative selection.\n\nThis place uses extra thin noodles typical of Nagahama Ramen ... which is a very fine flour noodle that absorbs flavors readily but is very easy to screw up because it's only supposed to be boiled for 90 seconds or less, which is typical of Kyushu ramens like Hakata ... very fast serving times with chewy, full bodied noodles. Not at Nishikawa where the noodles were completely OVERBOILED on arrival. The pork cut is a nice touch, the kikurage and nori are excellent. and the broth is supposed to be tonkotsu ... but it is stupidly weak and I can taste kombudashi so is this RAMEN or SOBA?! I've had better INSTANT ramen.\n\nSeriously this place is authentic HOW? The basic sake collection headlined by Shochikubai, the Rolling Rock of the sake world? The Okinawan beer (Orion) no one on mainland Japan drinks? The Maneki Neko in the corner with the upraised left paw telling me with its eyes \"I don't want to be here, help?\"\n\nI am betrayed once again by another one star disappointment in Japanese food in Phoenix, but I'm used to that by now. The food scene here is overall very good EXCEPT for Japanese of ANY kind. The search continues for Japanese comfort food in this state which DOES NOT SUCK.
