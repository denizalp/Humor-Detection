I feel like Haze can be summed up with one word.  Maybe it's more of an onamonapia.  Meh.  The only reason we ended up here was because we had dinner at a restaurant in the Aria and we happened to follow a group of nice looking ladies here.  \n\nSo why is Haze so meh you ask?  Here's the breakdown:\n\nDecor:  Less than stellar.  I couldn't really pick up on any kind of theme and really, it just doesn't look that nice.  In fact, it kind of just looks old and a bit run down.  Isn't this one of the newer clubs in Vegas?\n\nMusic:  Not great, not bad, just okay.  \n\nAmbiance:  The overall feel of the club felt a little off and disconnected.  From the random elevated platforms in the middle of the dance floor to the professional dancers up on stage, I just wasn't \"feeling\" it.  Ya know?\n\nWith that said, I did appreciate that the bouncers weren't douche bags making people wait in line for no reason other than to create a line.  I suppose I would come back here if I couldn't find another place to go but it definitely wouldn't be my go to spot and I definitely wouldn't wait in a long ass line to get in.
