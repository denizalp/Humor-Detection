I love this place.  Since I'm trying to get Shred Flintstone this year, I find myself in here for a delicious post-workout smoothie.  Get that joint with almond milk because consumption of unnecessary dairy may cause bloating and stomach discomfort.  \n\nI went here on a Saturday during Onestopananza and met IFBB pro bodybuilder Marcus Haley, he recommended some Met-RX CLA to help burn fat and build lean muscle.  I took his advice because I'm ready to look Andrew Diced Clay, totally Flex Luthor, brah.\n\nPlenty of products for peeps trying to lose weight, supplement their diets, or get Ripped Van Winkle.  The prices are a little higher than if you were to shop on-line, but you get knowledgeable staff who will help you narrow down what you're looking for and not continue to try to up-sell you like other chains.\n\nThere's always a clearance table you can stock up on vitamins or 'last on the shelf' items.  The smoothie punch card will get your tenth smoothie free, and the employees don't seem to have a problem combining cards if you forget yours like I do.
