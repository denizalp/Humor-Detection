Hell damn ass yes. I love this place and have pretty much never had something not delicious here. Their beer selection is one of the best in town, and their (limited) menu keeps calling me back for delicious burgers and moules frites. Their \"small plates\" are good for those of you couples out there, but bachelors like myself will be sitting in the corner eating an entire pizza by ourselves.
