North Vegas near downtown. \n\nMADE DAILY WITH FRESH CREAM AND EGGS \n\nThis is your standard pull up and order at their window type of place. No indoor place to sit. Grab your custard to go. Order your custard and pop back into your car to wolf down your creamy fresh treat. \n\nTheir custard tastes really fresh and you could tell it was minimally processed with high quality ingredients. Probably not enough processed ingredients in it for people complaining about this place as it doesn't taste like your standard low quality over processed dessert. I can hand it to this place their custard tastes distinct and unlike any other out there. \n\nI personally love this place and is a must have pit stop when in the area \n\n\nBonus points for this place as the parking lot is the cop car post lol.
