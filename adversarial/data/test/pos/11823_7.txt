WHAT TO TRY?!\n\nThe half moons!\n\nI think this bar is awesome for drinks and lounge around. It's a very unique bar in that the front looks like a regular mom and pop shop but little did you know, it's actually a bar through the doors. But this review is strictly about the food. \n\nThis bar has a lot of space to stand around in the middle but not a lot of tables for people to sit if you're just here for drinks and lounging, so come early to grab a table or else crowd around the bar. \n\nWe had tried the smashed cucumber, the half moon, the shrimp wonton and the eggplant dish. Other than the half moon which was kind of interesting, I thought the other dishes were kind of disappointing. \n\nThe smashed cucumber name is kind of deceiving. It's actually not smashed cucumbers but rather chopped cucumber chunks that was mixed with soy, crispy shallot and sesame. I thought this dish was really easy to make and I didn't think you couldn't make this at home. It's really simple! \n\nThe shrimp wonton didn't look like it was hard to make either. I don't think they make their own wontons, and other than a spicy taste, I didn't think it tasted much else. \n\nThe eggplant was the better of the dishes however it was a bit too salty and the combination with the mantou bun was a bit weird since the eggplant pieces were quite big cubes, and to put it on the small buns, seems like there wasn't enough buns for the eggplants. I somehow ended up eating the eggplant dish separately from the fried mantou bun. It was easier to eat it that way and both tasted good on its own. \n\nThe half moons were the most interesting dish. Reminded me of the Chinese fried pockets with pork inside that I get for dim sum. Same texture. Just that this half moon is flat vs the ones at dim sum is this oval egg shape looking dumpling. Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The ingredients inside were just right without it overflowing. \n\nLAST TIP?!\n\nI really think they will excel more with drinks more so than food. It's definitely not a restaurant to have dinner at, maybe a quick snack is more suitable. There's a semi private lounging corner near the entrance of the bar, so if you have a party of 5 or 6, come early so you can grab that area and enjoy a drink!
