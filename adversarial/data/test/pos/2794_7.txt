Excellent in terms of honesty, politeness good with most of the staff, price very decent (for oil change at lease).\n\nI went in for an oil change and managed to get the \"winter maintenance package\" which saved me $5, even though as per their website that offer expired at the end of the previous month. All I had to do was ask if they had any sales on oil changes ;-)\n\nAside from that, I knew that a number of things had to be checked\/done to my car at this point based on my car's maintenance minder, so I provided them with the list of items involved which corresponded to the message on my maintenance minder. They quoted me on the price of the oil change and told me that they'd check everything and get back to me to let me know what needs to be done and assured me that they wouldn't do anything without first confirming with me.\n\nSo when they had checked everything, they called me and let me know the work that needed to be done. Since the price was a bit high and I had the parts for some of the repairs, I ended up declining any additional work.\n\nWhen I came back to pay (I had gone home to wait for them to finish working on my car), the man whom I paid for the work ended up saying, \"Well if you can do the work yourself, why not do the oil change yourself too?\" I did not like that attitude, and this was in fact the only part of my experience with this venue that did not go well, hence losing them the 5th star.\n\nI have been to this venue before and have never had any complaints, and as per the reviews on here, it looks like everyone else is more or less on the same page. I would likely return to this venue, as long as I don't have to deal with the individual who made the comment in question.
