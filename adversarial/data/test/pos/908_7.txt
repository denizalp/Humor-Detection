This review covers the dim sum only.  Upon walking into the restaurant, expectations were high since the decor is notably more modern than the usual Chinese restaurant ambience and currently residing in Henderson, I was optimistic towards the prospect of a decent dim sum joint without having to make the trek towards Spring Mountain.  From start to finish, I'd have to say the quality of the dim sum was consistently meh.  My mom, dad, and sister joined me and I found it problematic that each dish had some undeniable flaw that found all four of us consistently in unanimous agreement.   \n\nTemperature: a marker of good quality (and signs of active turnover) is how hot the dishes are when they arrive at your table.  Virtually every dish was room temperature on arrival, and even after we requested a fresh one or that they reheat a dish, it came back lukewarm at best.  \n\nTexture: The daikon cakes were gelatinous and missing the crispy edges, the long flat rice noodle filled with shrimp were overcooked, and the shrimp dumplings (the benchmark for dim sum) had skins that were gummy.  Even the salt and pepper squid (pretty much a staple at any Chinese restaurant) was coated in a dark brown batter that resembled the KFC extra crispy batter rather than the air-y tempura batter that barely coats the the natural contours of the squid pieces.\n\nService: My sister and I had a recent discussion regarding the rise of Korean and Japanese cuisine in the states and the relative stagnation of Chinese food.  One of the things which are done well in the former two is service and it's almost an anticipated assumption that any decent Chinese restaurant will have either rude servers or mismatched silverware\/plates since as a cultural whole, neatness and courtesy are not heavily emphasized as you would normally expect when walking into a Korean\/Japanese restaurant.  Folks here seem apathetic and inattentive, which is all the more surprisingly considering the grand opening was within the past few weeks.\n\nMy mother, who usually can be quite forgiving towards Chinese food, summed it up best (paraphrased from Chinese):\n\n\"If our friends ever invite us to this place, I will probably have to make up some excuse for our unavailability so as to avoid coming back\"\n\nThere's dim sum, and then some....and this is definitely the latter.
