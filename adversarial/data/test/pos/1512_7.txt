I came here over this past weekend and got a couple sports apparel for such a steal...I'm talking $10 Packers hoodies, $10 Cardinals long polyester tees, and so much more...it was so awesome.  I get that football season is almost over, but still...prices were so bomb.\n\nThey normally do a 10% military discount also but only on regular prices items.  I'll definitely come back when I'm in the area to check out their other deals.  They were quick to process my purchase and pack everything.  They also have a decent variety of sports apparel so I really have no complaints except that things were a bit cluttered and disorganized.\n\nAnyway, check this place out if you guys are in the area and need some sports apparel.
