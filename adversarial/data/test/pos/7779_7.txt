Came here for dinner, 30 mins before they closed.  It was a cold night and needed something to warm me up.  The place is clean and shiny new.  The selection is a little limited compared to the other pho places that I go.  I ordered the #5 beef pho noodles.  It was good, not too shabby of a soup base either.  Coming back to try the other items!
