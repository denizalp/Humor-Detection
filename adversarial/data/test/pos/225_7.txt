These guys make the best Apple Fritter, and what is so totally awesome about this drive through donut shop, is that it's a drive through donut shop with a great apple fritter. Did I mention the Apple Fritter is to die for?\n\nHow about to DRIVE THROUGH...I'm there!\n\nNot too big, plenty of sweet apple, and a slight crunch, with a delicate, not too sweet of a glaze that gives that \"just right\" after taste...perfection.
