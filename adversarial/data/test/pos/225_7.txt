They consistently run out of food mid day. \nAlso they open and close on a whim, seriously Albert has been here (canada) long enough that it's past time he change his clock  off of island time. \nFood is generally good to ok\n\nI put off writing a review because this place has been apart of the hood for so long. I have always given this place a pass. \n\nMy hope is that this review and the many like it are used by Albert and staff to improve.
