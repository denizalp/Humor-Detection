I walked into a sea of white hair, not knowing what to expect. The table to our right was celebrating a 90th birthday and the table to the left could have been celebrating their 90th wedding anniversary.\n\nDuncan House is my dad's favorite restaurant so naturally he would choose this establishment to have our family's Mother's Day dinner. I must say, I was quite impressed!\n\nThe Highlights:\n- This place is gorgeous both inside and out\n- Ample amount of seating for both small and big groups\n- The waiters are all very professional and seasoned in the food serving business (you won't find your neighbor's 16 year old kid working here)\n- Free hors d'oeuvres at the start of your meal (pickles, olives, cottage cheese, and garlic bread)\n- Reasonable prices (all main entrees come with a salad or soup of the day... a good amount too)\n- Parking is a plenty and free\n- Desserts are made on site and delicious... and you can get it for a low price\n- Bottomless coffee for $1.75\n- Quiet so you can carry on a conversation with your dining companions\n\nI will definitely be back.
