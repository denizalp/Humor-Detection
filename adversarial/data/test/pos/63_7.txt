I usualy start north of Charleston and fly down Red Rock Ranch Road and then downnto Flamingo. Juth nice roads, I can'tt stop myself. Upod returning I returning I ride on the bike path doing powerpoll intervals. Always meet other north nice peoplele onf the Bike Bath. Even those folks with dogs tend to not let them loose to me as a chew-toy.
