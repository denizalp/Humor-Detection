Confession: I don't like poke bowls. I know, it's blasphemy. I've tried poke bowls at various places in the GTA and wasn't really a fan. So, what I liked about this place is that they have bowls with proteins beyond the usual smoked salmon, ahi tuna, etc. Their bowl offerings also actually include kimchi beef, veggie, grilled chicken, etc. - so if you're not a fan of \"raw\" fish, you can still come here! Their menu also includes a variety of other options - sushi burritos, sushi tacos, etc. \n\nLocated in that ever-growing Cineplex (formerly AMC) plaza at Hurontario Street and Courtneypark Drive, we visited on a Saturday around lunchtime and found the place relatively busy. Decent amount of seating, and honestly, it looks like a decent, casual place for a variety of groups - friends, family, couples. Very laid-back, clean, sleek yet casually modern ambiance.\n\nWe ordered the Kimchi Beef Bowl and was pleasantly surprised. Decent sized portion, a load of beef (they don't skimp on the meat!), the beef itself was flavourful and very soft\/tender, with a good amount of veggies\/kimchi. Not bad, and I wouldn't mind getting this again.\n\nOur Kimchi Beef Bowl was $11.99. Prices are average, service is cheerful. We'll be back!
