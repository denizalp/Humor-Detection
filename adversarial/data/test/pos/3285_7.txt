Wow! Need some work done on the pool and Maddy's wants to bill me before they even come out and see what is wrong. Huh, no one else does that! I can understand booking fee of a couple bucks to hold the appointment, but they wanted me to pay for the whole service upfront before any work was done.... Still shopping around!
