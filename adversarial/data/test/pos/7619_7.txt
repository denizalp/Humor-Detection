I have never been too fond of Korean cuisine. The only Korean food I usually indulge in is the Nong Shim instant noodles. But today I decided upon something new, seeking great flavours to satisfy my hunger. \n\nAfter a long day of school, my friends and me drove towards Arirang. We quickly received our tables and sat comfortably in a table booth near the windows. We decided upon the AYCE Korean BBQ.\n\nThe dishes of raw meats starting piling up on our table. Vegetarians beware- this meal just got meatier (forgive my terrible attempt at humour). Beef, pork, chicken and much more, arrived ready to be grilled. The meats were marinated in a Korean BBQ sauce. The taste, in my opinion, seemed to be lacking. However the meats tasted fresh and tender. \n\nSides of kimchi, seaweed and others arrived at our table along with the meats. The kimchi is spicy yet is too salty. If you eat the kimchi along with a bowl of rice, the saltiness subsides.\n\nFood taste better if you are not expecting much. Arirang changed my consensus on Korean BBQ. I will return again for more delicious food If hunger strikes you unexpectedly, race towards Arirang.
