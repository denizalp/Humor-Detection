Came here for a bachelor party stop because the groom to be wanted to see \"fully nude\". Well for sure this place did show everything but the question to be asked is did we really want to see it? When we arrived i had the same experience as other reviewers - whisked to the back where i was given the hustle but once i heard the prices i said i'd have to \"think about it\". After watching a couple of stage \"dances\" (a girl spinning around a pole taking one piece of clothing off each song) I gave the VIP room a shot. They gave me a \"local special\" - 3 dances for $100. The girl was cute but she really didn't do much - just a rather boring lap dance (just kinda sat there and grinded on my leg for one entire song) with some moments of panties down but never fully off. She was nice, just not $100 nice and I've gotten better for less in other clubs. The rest of the time there was spent watching girls on stage and not being really impressed. None of them were very attractive or seemed too enthusiastic to be there and the place was so dead on a Friday night it wasn't really interesting to be there.
