Don't use the restrooms, they reek of pee. The visitors are, let's say, from all walks of life.  I had the pleasure of sitting next to a toothless man that came over to my child who was crying and rubbed his shoulders. No pedophile man, get your hands off my kid. The cherry on top I had to hear pedophiles child bride drop the F-bomb like it was a D-day reenactment. The beach this park promotes is rocky so my tips are; 1) don't go here and 2) if you do go wear swim shoes.(Pic isn't pedophile man)
