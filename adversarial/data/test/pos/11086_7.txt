Dear Goldilocks,\n\nI waited to get a yummy drink JUST because I knew we were headed here after our breakfast at the Chowking down the street. Apparently you folks are not so consistent from location to location. Being from Cali and privileged to have tried your Avocado shake... I was super eager to have one in Vegas. Of course the people @ the counter thought I was crazy. Whatever! I guess the only thing going for this location is the all you can eat breakfast for about 5bux that was posted on the door. Please make the appropriate changes with what you read from me & other Yelpers!\n\nRespectfully, \nKriss P.
