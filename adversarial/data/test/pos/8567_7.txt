I really don't see how you can give this place anything other than a 4-star rating. Subtract out the fact that you're in Scottsdale and it's more likely than not that there will be one or more douchebags inside (i believe it's called a murder of douches when they travel in a pack) as well as some of the ironic hyperbole of the name, and the place is pretty damn good.\n\nI've had the carne asada (sober) and the california burrito (somewhat less than sober) and I have to say both were sold efforts. In fact, I have yet to find a clearly superior burrito in Phoenix (caveat: I am not a fan of the southwestern style carne asada that is very dry & heavily chipotle flavored). The burritos here are more Americanized mexican style and a little sloppy at times. But it's all flavor juice as far as I'm concerned.\n\nSo can I recommend this place? yes. Will I go back? Yes. Am I expecting a transcendent burrito eating experience in some little-known hole-in-the-wall gem? Nope, and I'll be sure to use the drive thru next time to avoid the murder of douches inside.
