Sketchers Factory Outlet is located in the Las Vegas South Premium Outlet Mall. It is actually very easy to find since it is just steps away from the food court (w\/ Wetezels Pretzels, etc.)\n\n(+) the store is large and spacious with plenty of stock. Always have a ton of footwear options at all price points. Great one-stop shoe shopping type of experience (which I love).\n(+) employees friendly and helpful.\n(+) good promos, such as buy 1, get the next pair at either 30 or 50% off. Always get at least 2 or 4 pairs of shoes every time I come here.\n\n\nI've only just discovered this place in the past few years, but I am so glad I did! Always a relaxing and pleasant experience every time I shop here. I will be back!\n\n4 stars.
