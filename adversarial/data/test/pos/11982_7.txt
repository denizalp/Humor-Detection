A part of the package of my stay was tickets to a certain event. They never mailed it to me and I called them several times, they assured me that I can pick the tickets up at the hotel once I checked in. Needless to say it was not there. If they promise you tickets or any packages to book with them. Be wary. \n\nAlso the hotel room I booked was not what they sold to me. I paid for a presidential suite and only got the luxury suite when I checked in.\n\nShady business, I go to Vegas every labor day with a large group. I will not use Las Vegas Suites to book my rooms in the following years.
