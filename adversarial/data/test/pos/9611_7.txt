UPDATE - Jim bought me a beer after our nasty OTG shirt exchange on Yelp. He is a decent guy for someone who is rich (not often found). Good luck.  \n\nThe new owners are from Chicago (what a surprise), but I have long given up on complaining about midwesterners invading Arizona because it is common and accepted. The place has been upgraded as evidenced by the fancy emblazoned OTG black shirts on the owners. It's not like we need another bar serving Chicago food, so at least they don't focus on that, but it is now more of a mix of Mexican and American stuff. Turkey Club with your chips and salsa?\n         I did love the Dos Gringos burrito and this OTG version is similar, but just a bit less exciting mainly due to the unusual rice (sort of a white\/yellow variety). They forget to put my chips in the bag, but overall the burrito was on point with solid white chicken and the usual stuff in the burrito including salsa fresca. The beans though, along with the rice, were not as good as previous visits, but they had $3 corona specials. If your looking for cheap tacos, this is no longer where to go to get those items.\n      The bathrooms now have doors (booo) and the male bartenders have ponytails now too. (Booo) The center bar is totally opened up and that area is a good place to sit, while all the inside TV's on the wall are gone. These two guys fell in \"love\" with Scottsdale it claims, so how come nobody from Arizona falls for Chicago and goes there and opens a bar? oh, that's right, Chicago is cold and dangerous and most of their sports teams suck.
