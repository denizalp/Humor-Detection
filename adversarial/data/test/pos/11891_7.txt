This has been a huge mess.  Here are the problems I have encountered since April 14th.\n\n1.)  Called to get balance and was told I needed to e-mail.  Okay.  Why don't  you all just make it available online\n\n2)  When I received e-mail I noticed there was no mention of my solid teak dining room table. Was told everything had been sold.  My table was missing\n\n3)  Called the store again.  They said they were having computer issues and that they knew my table has been sold and it should be on the list.\n\n4) Gabe (manager) asked me to give him some time to locate the table.  We talked once every week and every time he repeated the same story about computer issues.  Basically repeating the same story as if I had not heard it before.  He was clearly stalling for time.  He also assured me each time that he know which table it was.  That did not seem odd to me since it is a show piece a solid teak custom-made $4000 table.\n\n5) Many few weeks ago Gabe called me and told me a miracle had happened.  He located the table and BONUS it had sold for $125.\n\n6)  I said \"that table did not sell for $125.  You all would not be in business if you were that bad at pricing items to sell\".  He stated that is what it sold for.  Again I said \"that table did not sell for $125\".  He said it did.  We went back in forth with me saying \"that table did not sell for $125\" and him saying \"MAM that is what it sold for\"  Finally I told him to stop calling me MAM and to call me back when he figured out what happened to my table.\n\n7) Another miracle...he called me a few days later and again \"found my table\".  It had been in storage.  It was being pulled out of storage and would be sold for \"$795\", which still seems extremely low when I look at other items on their website.\n\n8) Several weeks have passed. I have not heard a word.  I sent my saga to corporate twice and they never responded either.
