Absolute waste of time and money!!! If you are a Marvel fan, stay away!!  The staff is incredibly idiotic. There were only adults on our tour and they still insisted on asking moronic questions: \"Who's your favorite superhero?\" \"Wouldn't it be neat if you could fly like Iron Man?\"\n\nYou have to download an app to interact with the paultry exhibit (or pay $5.00 to use one of the exhibits units). The wifi cut out 8 times on my tour. \n\nThere were only 7 people on my tour. Since a  staff member seems to feels the need to personally instruct anyone using an interactive  exhibit, most of the people on my tour, including myself, just said \"screw it\" and bypassed that particular exhibit. Then, at the end, you are herded into the \"photo area\" where you are not free to leave until a staff member opens a gate for you.\n\nGod help them if they ever get a \"crowd\" more than 7 people.\n\nPass on this one.
