Ok... I have never seen the show these owners were on and didn't know the story behind the bakery but... decided to try this place because it's by my house.  I was skeptical to pay $3.00 for one cupcake. To my surprise I loved it and since then have tried a variety of their cupcakes!  My favorites include \"the director\" chocolate cake with chocolate buttercream frosting and their German chocolate cake which is made for only certain times.  I've bought their cupcakes for friends and coworkers and we all find them moist, flavorful and delicious. They do have cookies and cake pops as well as a few other things but I have only stuck with the cupcakes.  My favorite cupcake place!
