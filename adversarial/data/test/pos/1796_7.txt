I have no idea what the big deal is about this place. The lines to get food belie the complete mediocrity of it. They should have stopped at 'Common Food...' in their motto. \n\nI ordered the grilled veggie omelet and was so underwhelmed that I was more fascinated by the fact that I'd never seen a grapefruit tree before. Now THAT was awesome. \n\nIt was overpriced and underflavored. I would go back and try other things, but I don't do heart attack food that well and I eat mostly vegetarian so I guess I'll never be back. Oh well.
