On my way to Ross J's for some Korean chicken I spotted this new restaurant with a grand opening sign and cartoon character. I quickly flipped a u up the hill in hopes to being the FTR but nope beat LOL. I quite don't remember what was here before but I've been here before just can't remember. Big parking lot and lots of seating. Maybe no room for chacha.\n\n13 iced flavor milk teas such as honey milk green tea, taro milk tea, rose milk tea.  10 iced teas such as bubble green or black tea, mango, plum, passion fruit, lychee. 6 fruit smoothies and 9 other drink that's 38 different drinks, crazy, and you can also add jelly for extra charge. YEESSS\n\nThey have roast duck so of course I had to get some. Owner recommanded the roast duck and wonton noodles soup. It's like he was reading my mind. As a lunch special its $7.95 and comes with an egg roll and choice of egg drop soup or salad. Loved the duck and wonton, the broth was between good and ok, and not a fan of the noodles felt packaged maybe!? It threw me off since it says \"serious noodles\" in their logo. But still the dish and price overall is pretty good.\n\nTheir whole roast duck is only $24 has to he a steal, half is $13, and regular portion $10. Their menu looks so delicious and yummy and want to try more but its just to far out of the way for me. I can't keep passing this area and not go Ross J's or Chicken Shack. \n\n17 lunch specials for $8 can't go wrong. In the theirs about 73 different choices on the menu, there could be more.  Pho, udon, ramen, kimchi fried rice, pad thai, mapo tofu, just check out my menu pics for all the details.\n\nCustomer service was good, very friendly.\n\nDown side is theres $20 minimum for using credit cards. So glad I had cash other wise I had to watch dishes LOL
