Almost passed right by this place on my way to the Old Port.  Glad I stopped in to see what's up.\n\nAt first glance, a used clothing store with free lemonade.\n\nOn second glance, also the cheapest coffee shop in town.  $1 including tax for a single espresso, prepared in a charming fashion.  Add in huge homemade cookies for $1 and we're already at 5*.\n\nI walked to the back with my espresso and found the cutest dog lounging on the couch.  He was happy to have a friend.  Then a random girl sat down and played a bit at the piano.  Awesome vibe to chill for a bit during a busy weekend.\n\nCame back again and asked the older gentlemen that works there, perhaps the owner, when they close.  \"Whenever... the fuck... I want!\"  Amazing.\n\nSix stars for this place.
