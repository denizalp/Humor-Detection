Our table looked like a grisly crime scene... Severed heads, legs strewn about and disturbing moans of satisfaction.\n\nUsually when a drop cloth is put down on the table and everyone looks like a surgical team donned in plastic gloves and bibs most people would run from the forthcoming mafia hit, but at Hot n Juicy Crawfish this is a good sign that tasty things are about to happen.\n\nTo say we enjoyed our meal would be a serious understatement. \n\nWe ordered the shrimp & crawfish with Cajun fries on the side. Our server JanJira gave a very thorough explanation of the menu and made sure we understood the sauces and heat levels, especially since we ordered everything spicy hot & juicy with a side bowl of extra spicy hot & juicy sauce. We like it spicy bordering on a nuclear meltdown - JanJira assured us we would be satisfied.\n\nThe crustaceans came out in unassuming plastic bags keeping them stewing in the juicy spicy sauce. \n\nThe crawfish were fresh with succulent juice filled heads. If you've never had crawfish, don't expect much meat, just delicious flavor. To order them anything but spicy would be a shame. \n\nShrimp o' glorious shrimp how I love thee. The shrimp are amazing. Heads ON! Flavor ON! Peel and eat, the side of extra spicy sauce was a good call. Much of the sauce is lost when you peel the shrimp, so the thick side of sauce came in handy to lacquer them with more of the garlicky buttery chili love.\n\nThe Cajun fries are some of the best ever. The fries are glass crisp on the outside and steaming soft on the inside. We ordered another after we devoured the first. The fries are perfect to give your mouth a spice break when the heat starts creeping up.\n\nAbout a half roll of paper towels later with our white plastic drop sheet looking like a crime scene it was time for the check.\n\nJanJira is a fantastic waitress, very attentive and made sure we had a great meal stopping by our table several times throughout the meal for a quick chat.\n\nNext time we will be taking on the crab and a double order of spicy shrimp!!!\n\nAloha!
