I am being generous with a three.\n\nthe place has the typical industrial atmosphere that I am sure get annoyingly loud if it is busy.\n\nthe staff was attentive but not very friendly (no chit chat).\n\nthe beer is ok but a little on the flat side.\n\nthe menu is compact and looks good.\n\nI had the chicken sandwich with rosemary and thyme.  the chicken was cooked well but the rosemary flavor was a little strong.  even with the herb flavor the patty tasted a little bland until I added salt then it came to life a bit.\n\nmy friend had the brisket burger which he said was also lacking (he didn't add any seasoning).\n\nthe fries are fresh cut freit style.  they aren't crispy but are not greasy either.  they were also lacking salt.  \n\nthe place is out of the way for me and there isn't much else around it so I doubt I will be back.
