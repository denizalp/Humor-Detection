I found this whole concept a little bizarre and a good representation of annoying Vegas clubs, with the bonus of being in more advanced states of undress. You get the privilege of paying to enter, paying quadruple for drinks, obscenely loud music, and plenty of drunk twenty somethings bouncing on the deck chairs. But hey, it's Vegas, it's hot as the surface of the sun, and Foxtail has a pool. So there's that.
