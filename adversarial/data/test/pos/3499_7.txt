Teri C.'s talk about rice cakes and our so-so experience at Koi Palace got me jonezing for some dim sum again.\n\nI believe their dim sum hours are 10am-3pm. The earlier you come the better the selections will be, and they do run out of dishes. We arrived at Noon and it was pretty packed, but lucky for us, there was a two top ready and waiting for us. It was kinda chilly outside, so I ordered some Congee with chicken, chinese donut, and century  egg. I gave Wifey a taste, and she liked it so much,  I had to flag the lady down again so she could get her own! Other dishes we enjoyed were the Soup Dumplings, Har Gow, Shu Mai, Chicken Feet, Beef Short Ribs, and Fried Shrimp Wontons with sweet Mayo. Be sure to ask for the Chili Oil to enjoy with your dim sum...it is more like a chili-garlic ketchup and is ADDICTING!\n\nThe sweet selections didn't disappoint either. Custard Tarts are some of the best in town, Coconut Buns and Custard Buns are tasty, and of course, the Rice Cakes...One of three places I know who have this, and KJ does it best. Stop in the next time you have a hankering for some solid dim sum in Vegas.  ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter: \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/   \\u   4.25\n\nYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014 (15\/365) \"Rice Cakes and More!\"
