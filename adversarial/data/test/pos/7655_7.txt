(Lyrics - Neil Diamond - Sweet Caroline)\n\nWhere to begin, I can begin with milkshakes\nBut then I know my appetite is growing strong\n\nStart with a scoop\nAnd the scoop became a double\nWho'd have believed it came along\n\nHot.....fudge sundaes.....\nReaching out, trying it, tasting it......\n\nSweet Republic (bop bop bop)\nGood times never seemed so good\nI'd be inclined (bop bop bop)\nTo believe it never would\nNow Bo Bites.....\n\n\nHow shall I start!  I love Ice Cream!? \n\nWell let's just say I'm one to have a sweet spot for some good ice cream!  Sweet Republic has that covered ladies and gents.  With funky flavors such as Kulfi, Jalapeno Avocado Bacon Brittle, Basil Lime Sorbet, etc.  Sweet Republic has 2 locations I hope this little ice cream boutique grows, even though the Shea location is close enough for me to visit more often than not.  However, my gut and love handles say NO MORE!  My mouth and eyes say just a small bite of Waffle cones and 2 more flavors!  They also serve up some interesting milkshakes and sundaes, which I can't wait to try!  Your ice cream could be served up in a waffle cone, cup, and even between 2 cookies of your choice! \n\nI came here on a hot summer day and ordered the waffle cone with Salted Caramel Butter and Belgium Chocolate.  I'm not too crazy for the exotic flavors; like to keep things simple.  Sweet and buttery ice cream slow oozing down my cone as I embrace every bite and lick.....gee I think I just had a foodgasm!\n\nOverall, the place is very welcoming like most ice cream shops.  It can get real crammed up in this shop since seating is limited, but lets just hope you beat out the crowd.  In the end, Sweet Republic's reputation is definitely well deserved and a must visit! - Enjoy
