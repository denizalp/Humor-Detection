I'm no history buff, but when I saw something called the Pinball Hall of Fame only a short cab\/Uber ride away in Vegas, I knew I had to see what this was about. My mind was chuckling at the ridiculousness of a building showcasing the development of pinball games, how they changed and developed over the years, and their impact on society. Who could be stupid enough to make this a museum? Or, better yet, was it worse than that? Was it some oddity of biographies of some kind of record holders for various pinball feats like a living, breathing Guinness Book of Pinball Records? I didn't know but I had to find out.\n\nThe Uber driver pulled up and it was nothing at all like a museum should look. It's some kind of warehouse looking thing. What the hell? The sign out front appears to be in a little bit of disrepair or a work in progress and the parking lot i pretty much vacant. Well, that last part isn't really much of a surprise since I think this place is just going to be an exercise in idiocy. I open the door and walk into the darkness, my eyes quickly adjust to see rows and rows and rows of pinball machines. After walking through them a bit I find that most of them actually work and I am in for one hell of a treat. It's not the disappointment I wanted, but rather a diamond in the rough - you could get into the Cave of Wonders with this thing.\n\nThe various pinball machines are all pretty cheap with most costing 25 or 50 cents. Not all work, but you'll be surprised at how few are in states of malfunction. There's a pinball machine for everyone here from Wizard of Oz to Nightmare on Elm Street and everything in between. Change machine is right up front, or come stocked with a bucket of quarters you won from Circus Circus. Whatever floats your boat. You're going to be here for a while.\n\nAs others have pointed out, there are also some retro cabinet games like Donkey Kong, Pac Man, and even Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (my personal favorite). This is the side of Vegas I feel might get overlooked by those that are not in the pinball scene (which I'm certainly not... is there even a pinball scene?) or those that fail to look past the Strip for entertainment options and, you know what?, they're truly missing out. I hope this \"museum\" stays open and functioning for many years to come, because if it does it has earned a permanent spot on my list for each and every return trip to Vegas in the many years to come. What the hell are you doing still reading this? Get your ass to Mars (or the Pinball Hall of Fame) and play some pinball, loser!
