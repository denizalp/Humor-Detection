What do you do when you order one thing and bring home something different?\nThe Pick 2 Combo of an Adult Grilled Cheese came home looking like a plain grilled cheese.\nIt is 830 when I walked in and they don't close until 9 p.m.  You would've thought it was 855 p.m. cuz they had everything put away and was working hard on clearing the rest.\nShe couldn't even find the cookies that go with the sandwich orders.\nYeah um, don't come into a restaurant to order food during business hours.
