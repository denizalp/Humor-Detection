Wow! Got all 4 of my impacted wisdom teeth removed today. It went 100% better than I could ever imagine! Thank you so much to the kind nurses for making me feel comfortable and calm, (pretty sure I told everyone I loved them when I woke up from the anesthesia and drugs ) and super thanks to Dr. Eugene Kim for doing the excellent job. I was scared for no reason! Will deff recommend this place to all my friends and family.
