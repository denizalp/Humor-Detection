I am speachless...I had a few items in my basket and put the basket on the counter at the checkout register.  The person at the register didn't touch the basket and asked me to take everything out and put it on the counter in order for him to scan it. I was shocked and asked politely why wouldn't he take it out? So he replied in a very mean voice that it takes too much time and it would be too hard for him to do it for everyone....I was so shocked that I had nothing to answer back to him. I would take my time and go complain to the manager, as how hard is to lift 300 grams of turkey? But guess what..this rude man was actually one of the owners of this very store. How dare is he treating his customers this way?????
