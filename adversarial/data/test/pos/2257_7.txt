All of the chefs are the bomb!  I've already went over the fantastic servers & Chef Kris so how about the rest of the chefs who make the food happen.  I mean you watch them cook right in front of you which is cool.  Chef Antonio is awesome!  I think I've seen him there the longest & always w\/ a smile on his face.\n\nAll of the soups are great.  I love the Pan Roast, Clam Chowder w\/ a Tabasco, Bouillabaisse, Cioppino & Miso.  Next time, I will be asking for extra Brandy in my Pan Roast lol especially now that it's soup season.  It's sweet & yummy!  Perfect place for locals.\n\nThe sushi chefs are awesome too so next time I'll have to leave them a review.
