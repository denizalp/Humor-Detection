Horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!. What am I speaking on? Here let me tell All,  the fact that the source ripped me off on my gram that i just bought.  Came directly home open to inspect,  low & behold what do I find one bottle has a gram and one bottle Might, seriously might,  have 1\/2 gram\nWhen I called I was treated as an idiot and basically brushed off. How was i, like this,  (you don't what your talking about we weigh put perfectly), OBVIOUSLY YOU DIDN'T,  LIEERS, CHEATERS\nNow I'm well aware of fraudulent people in world, and you just don't know who's lying to you,  got that, does this give right to treat All are ignorant, NO, HECK NO!!! The source could have at least consider a mistake on their part and apologized, maybe ask to compensate, I don't know, something, this is a business right, and satisfying the customer Is the goal to keeping business open,  yes here I'll answer for everyone, Yes!\nOK well I truly hope ALL who read this will pause before goin to \"the source dispensary\", because you WILL Not get proper service and you will Not get amount you are paying for, you Will get shorted and then they WILL not apologize or treat you kindly.  Good luck to all you venture to this place
