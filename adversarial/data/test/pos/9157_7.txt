This place will and has always reminded me of a used car lot. It's a franchise and the receptionists are friendly, fake and inexperienced. They were whispering, giggling and laughing while I was sitting in the waiting area (which led me to believe they were being typical young immature girls talking about me the customer). Not the 1st time I have heard from some other friends they experienced the same at this location. Whoever the tiny girl with black lined glasses was trying way to hard, more so pushy to sell me the membership. It's way to overpriced for the service you get, but I guess if you just go once or twice a year it's alright. The same massage would have been 70% less in cost from Groupon with another business. Not sure I will return!
