Best Auto Dealership Ever. \nWe recently completed the purchase of a 2014 Chevy Traverse (great car, had a 2009 that we traded in). The salesman we worked with was Robert Diggs. I can't say enough good about him. Robert is a real pro, knows the Chevy line backward & forward, knows how to help customers identify the best vehicle that will meet their needs, understands the concept of customer satisfaction, and on & on. Robert made the entire buying experience a pleasant and productive one. I agree that brand loyalty is half the battle, but in the past other Chevy dealers were so bad they made me wonder why they were in the business of selling cars.\n\nWe picked up our car on Feb 3, and noticed that the additional window tinting we asked for had  the odd bubble here & there. Right away Robert introduced us to Mike Fiala, Re-Con Manager, who assured us they would resolve the problem as soon as we wanted to bring the car in (it was late in the day on Monday so there wasn't enough time to work on the car then). On Thursday I brought the car in, waited in comfort in the showroom, and in a reasonable amount of time the window tinting problem was completely corrected. Mike was also helpful with information related to the Wi-Fi ability in my car.\n\nA word about the physical nature of the dealership....its attractive, bright, comfortable, quiet (no music or other intrusive noise), and very clean. This holds true for the workshop areas & parking lot. The overall atmosphere is welcoming & inviting. \n\nIf you are thinking of buying either a new or used vehicle, I highly recommend this dealership & Robert Diggs.
