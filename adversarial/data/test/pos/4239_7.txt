Had a fabulous $20 restaurant week lunch today. One of the better restaurant week meals I've had! \n\nAtmosphere: romantic, charming, upscale, whatever, check. Great views of the fountains. \n\nWarm bread basket was particularly good. I hate olives but I was eating the olive tepanade UP. It was so yummy. \n\nCourse 1: Calarmi and BBQ pork tart. The tart was just OK, but the Calamari was awesome! Some of the best calamari I've ever had. I'll definitely be ordering that if I dine at Olives again. \n\nCourse 2: Lamb and Tuna nicoise salad. My salad was nice. It had cool touches - the egg was hard boiled AND smoked (very unique!), and the tuna was decent. The lamb was better, however. Seasoned and prepared perfectly. \n\nCourse 3: Fruit Sorbet and chocolate trifle. The sorbets were excellent, but the trifle must have had crack in it. AMAZING. Dark chocolate pudding, Bailey's mousse, vanilla ice cream.. heavenly. The dark chocolate cookie they serve on the side was the only disappointment (crunchy.. and not so special). \n\nDessert took awhile (seems to be a trend lately!), but overall service was great. I look forward to coming back.
