I received a gift certificate to Carlitta's a month ago, the message was fantastic. My shellac manicure wasn't the best, lasted less than a week. However, the workers were very nice and wanted to ensure I had a great experience. The real problem is when it came time to pay, the owner wouldn't accept my gift certificate. She insisted I didn't mention I got the certificate when I called to make the appointment, but I very well did. I don't understand what is the difference from a gift certificate to actual money? The owner seems like a person who is always trying to make an extra penny and probably wanted me to have to schedule another appointment so she can make twice the amount. One of the worst customer service experiences from a greedy person.
