I still can't get over the fact that boba is called \"bubble tea\" here in the mid-west.\n\nAfter driving around for a while, my boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place in search of anything vaguely Asian.  Things are a bit on the expensive side -- 90c - $1.50 for baos, $1.10 for don tart.  We picked up a char siu bao, a milk custard bao, a don tart, and a starfruit \"bubble tea.\"  The char siu bao filling tasted a bit of American barbeque sauce... perhaps they ran low on char siu.  The don tart was pretty good, with a nice flaky crust.  I haven't had a chance yet to try the custard bao.  The bubble tea was passable, although I probably won't order that particular flavour again.\n\nThis whole transition from Irvine could be difficult.
