Oh my! Restaurant week 2011 .  This meal was a disaster! Terrible service...totally non existent  service. No beverages offered and we had to ask for them . There was a 25 minute wait for a reserved table, whilst 10 empty tables needed to be cleared. Food incredibly lacking in flavor . Lobster was NOT served....it was langoustine.  Steaks mediochre to be kind.  Excessively salty salad...could not eat it. Pecan pie smothered in caramel sauce. Honestly good pie ruined!  ONE WAITER HUMMED LOUDLY FOR THE ENTIRE EVENING. He wasn't part of the entertainment. Will never waste money there again. So many great restaurants in town.....THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM.
