THIS PLACES GIVES YOU A LOT.\n\nAnd when it comes to Cold Stone, I want A LOT. As in, fill this cup with deliciousness till it's teeming over the edges and beggin to be eaten. \n\nWondrous flavors this location often has? - mocha, pumpkin, marshmallow, and my personal favorite that was recommended to me by a super awesome employee: cake batter ice cream with cinnamon swirled in. Yes. It is glorious.
