FINALLY! \nLegit and amazing tasting and Israeli owned\/prepared falafel love!!!!!\n\nSide story:::::: I couldn't wait for husband to get home and honestly I usually go to falafel wanna be places prior to having him try it. We WILL be going back in a little bit after he comes home from a meeting...lmao. \nThis place gets my seal of approval and surpasses my expectations. \nHubs parents are from Israel so needless to say I have eaten my weight in falafel. Especially them dragging us all around California to try their favs...I have had everything from good to horrible.\nAlso this in law falafel party extends to my FIL making his own from scratch with me assisting. Hummus too. \nWell...I will get my baes opinion in a few hours, gah I'm soo full right now...but I'm pretty damn sure it's the best!\n\nFood:::::::::\nPita: disclosure: I don't like bread. I was hoping it wasn't going to be the puffed out pillowy floppy mess that doesn't hold the goods in. ITS NOT. It's perfection and you can taste the love. It held all of its contents and didn't split, break or start to goo. I have never tasted this type of artisan flavor. \n\nFalafel: holy garbanzo... it's perfect. It's not over fried, not too crispy, not too small, not too green...it's perfect! They give you just the right amount. Borderline kinda baked tasting. It's yellowish (the pricier style). No bullshit going on here!!!!\n\nSalad: the salad inside was not oily nor over seasoned. Perfection! Just like my MIL makes. \n\nHummus: the smear inside was flavorful and not oily. Upon going with my husband he will want a side with pita, so I will update and photo how it looks standalone. \n\nTahina sauce: placed inside, a mild flavor, not over seasoned and goes perfect with everything else. Not too much amount wise. \n\nFries: they are fresh cut and not seasoned. Just as they should be. !Do not get them to go (unless eating ASAP) and don't get them for delivery, they will become limp. \n\nThe owner and his sons are kind. Very sweet and smiley. They treated me like family. \nThe owner also mentioned about how you get a free Birthday combo. Spreading the love!!!! \n\nSee you again in soon Mother Falafel!!!!! The real mother of all falafel!!!!!!!!
