I had to write a review after seeing all of the low ball reviews that seem unfair. I have been going to this gym for over two years, and I started when it was still Urban Active. Sure, some things were a bit lost in translation during the transition, but these things have largely been resolved, especially as of late.\n\nThere is still a ton of space inside, and lots of cardio and weight machines. Most cardio machines have flat screen tvs, and the place has been very very clean lately (for the past few months). They now have towel service and a juice\/smoothie bar as well. These are nice additions.\n\nThe class selection is a bit limited considering the size of the gym, but I like the spin classes in general. Ekaterina is fantastic, and if you are looking for a great, sweaty workout, check out her classes. \n\nThe womens only area is a nice option because there are certainly a substantial amount of meatheads present in the evenings. Boo. But, there are options for women who don't want to be ogled: the womens only area, the cardio theater, and group fitness classes. I generally steer toward these options anyway, so I find that I can avoid roid-ridden creepers.\n\nAll in all, I enjoy this gym, and for the price, it's way more affordable than a yoga or barre membership, and there are tons of options to give you a lot of variety in your workouts.
