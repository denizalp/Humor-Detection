I am the type of person who doesn't really care too much about customer service as long as the food is good but the customer service here angers me and makes me wanna puke my food back. Waitress with the phone in her back pocket is extremely rude and occasionally gives dirty look to the customers. \nOnce she poured water into my ginger ale, when i confronted that its a pop, no apologizes were made and she went off to check whether i had a pop on my bill. Oh, not even gonna mention anything about how they DROP your dishes on the table. \nI am surprised how sturdy the plates are after seeing how they are handled.
