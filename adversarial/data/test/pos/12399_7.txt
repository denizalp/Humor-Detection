I don't know why it took me so long to try this place when it's so close to my man's house. I am still shocked that their breakfast prices start at $5.95! That's like fast food prices! I tried the chicken fried steak and it came with 2 eggs, toast, potatoes and lots of gravy. Sure, it wasn't the best chicken fried steak but c'mon at $5.95 you really can't complain.. The bartender was very nice and the food came out pretty fast. We sat at the bar to eat and it wasn't even smoky or smelly at all like how some bars are.. Can't wait to go back and try more of their bargain breakfast deals!!!\n\n\nHOT TIP: Breakfast deals end at 1PM
