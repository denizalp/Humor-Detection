Not bad pie but probably not up to NewYorker expectations...\n\nOrdered two slices and 20 wings (hot). One slice with mushrooms, one pepperoni. This Ray's uses canned mushrooms, which is ok, and they loaded it up for us, and the pepperoni was classic NYC style, thin crust with lots of grease. I'm giving them 4 stars but subtracting 1 star for the wings. Sorry guys. Buffalo wings NEED bleu cheese dressing and a couple sticks of celery... there is no other way. Do some research, ranch dressing doesn't cut it. period. The sauce was fine, but they needed to be a tad bit more on the 'crispy' side when cooking, other than that, they were good \/ ok. Would I go back? yea maybe, though there are so many more places to try... I not sure if I ever get back over on that side of town, but thank you guys... you have a good operation... clean & friendly, As a consolation they treated me to a refill on my soda. Thank you.\n\nHope you could make these small changes for your future customers ;)
