This is a small Giant Eagle, with a small parking lot.  But I liked it!  Maybe I am tiring of the super large stores with gigantic parking lots where the first 10 spaces or so are reserved, and where the market is so large you need to ensure you're wearing track shoes.  \n\nI needed just a few items, and didn't want to drive across town to where I normally shop, so decided to stop here since it was so close to where I was already.  I was able to park so close to the front door, which was nice.  Inside, there is no doubt the store is small and one part nearest Baptist road is actually a foot or so lower than the rest of the store.  You kind of go down hill to enter that part (which is where the hotdogs are.)  The ceiling is also lower in that part of the store so its a bit of a throw back to the 1990's and earlier.\n\nBut inside they've got everything you need just like other Giant Eagles.  The deli counter ladies were also nice.  Another throwback, they didn't act like people with a job but instead acted like neighbors who wanted to help you out.\n\nNo self check-out here, but no complaints from me about that.  The checker actually talked to me rather than ignoring my presence while continuing a conversation with other employees.  Nice!
