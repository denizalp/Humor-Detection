Now is the best time to enjoy the treasures of our desert in Phoenix!  I had not visited the Botanical Garden daytime in over a decade so this was a special treat.  They've embellished it, added sculptures, colorful artworks and added a restaurant \"Gertrude\" and a cafe on site.  There are plenty of water fountains and restrooms along the trails too.  I loved the butterflies exhibit adorned with its many  vibrant creeping flower beds.  The beautiful butterflies were too busy flying from petals to petals to notice our human presence. After visiting the garden, l went to their plant sale by the parking lot.  They have outstanding prices and a huge inventory.  I got an agave plant to add to my own collection.  Next l might start making my own blue agave tequila, Salud!
