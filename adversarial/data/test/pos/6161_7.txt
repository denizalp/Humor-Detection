3 criterias for OBJECTIVELY reviewing clubs: the temperature, the air quality (stuffy or well ventilated) and how packed it is. \n\nGiven those 4 criteria here you go:\n\nTemp: Vegas is schweating balls hot, outdoor clubs like Moon or Tao Beach is nice since it's outdoors but it's still freakin hot!!!... Tryst has this semi out door, semi indoor feel.  Since half of the club is outside, you don't have to walk very far to get some fresh air.  The indoor waterfall is also great for keeping the temp down.\n\nAir quality: Have you ever been to a club where you feel like you've inhaled the same air over and over again... eck.  Tryst s very well ventilated and the air doesn't get heavy.  For older men like me, we need air.  That's the only way we can keep up with women \"getting low\" without strapping an oxygen tank to our side. \n\nCapacity: Getting to the dance floor from the bar shouldn't feel like a human car wash.  I like a busy \"poppin\" club but OMG feeling like an ants in a colony ... not so much.  Tryst was nice.  The dance floor and the bar was packed but there were pockets of breathing spaces all around the club.\n\nGreat Place to party, but as always it's all about who you go with :)
