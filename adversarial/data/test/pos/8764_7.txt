I live in LA and I come to Vegas every year for New Years and this is the one spot that I have to hit up each and every time.\n\nFour words = AMAZINGLY ORGASMICALLY DELICIOUSLY GOOD!!!!\n\nI think by now I've tried all the tapas on their menu already and I would have to give each tapas 5 stars each so that equals out to hundreds of stars total for Firefly. :D\n\nMy favorite tapas are:\n\n-Filet Mignon Sliders\n-Empanadas\n-Fried Calamari\n-Chicken and Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms\n-Tuna Tartare \n-Crispy Duck Rolls\n-Ham and Cheese Croquetas\n\nEven their fries are off the hook because it has a hint of parmesan, herbs, and aioli and their Mojitos - I can get drunk off of that all day everyday. yUuMmMmmYlicious to EVERYTHING on the menu - no joke!
