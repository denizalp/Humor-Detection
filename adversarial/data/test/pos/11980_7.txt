I bought the Groupon for the $25 Mani\/Pedi like so many of the other one star reviewers of Vivaldi Salon Suites. So just a fair warning, this review is 100% for the scheduling assistant\/owner (I think they are the same person...?):\n\nI called to make my appointment after purchasing the Groupon on Feb. 1st. They could not fit me in on a Saturday until March 9th. I was willing to wait that long, and I figured that it would be nice to have a professional polish job for the start of open toe shoe season. \n\nWhile I scheduled this appointment, I was clear that I wanted to be scheduled at the Citadelle location on 59th and Utopia. I was under the impression that the scheduling assistant understood the words I said since she did not indicate any differently. Apparently, I needed say something different than, \"I would like to be scheduled at the 59th and Utopia location\" to actually be scheduled at the 59th and Utopia location.\n\nI didn't find out until 10:15am on March 9th (15 minutes after I should have begun my appointment)  that I was actually scheduled at the Park West location which was not communicated to me ever. I guess the scheduling assistant isn't very good with words or something.\n\nWhen I tried to call the main line to talk to the owner about getting my money back or some other appointment, I was simply told to call Groupon. No apologies. No help. just call Groupon. Great. \n\nSo I did. And I am not sure if I will get my money back or not, but I will not EVER go back to this Salon Suites again. \n\nAnd if the owner is indeed the scheduling assistant then she should do us all a favor and fire her self.
