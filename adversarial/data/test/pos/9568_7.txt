I had a really bad experience at another gym in town so I was hesitant to join another gym. But with the summer temperatures I didn't want to work out outside and this gym is close to my house. They gym itself is a nice facility and includes a pool and hot tub as well as dry saunas. The only thing I would say is unless you are interested in signing up for personal training skip the complimentary fitness intro because all they do is a hard sell on personal training. The front desk staff can be a little grumpy at times that's why I only gave 3 stars.
