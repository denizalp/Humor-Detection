It seems that things are changing around here. The change in music, the customer service, friendly smiles that don't accompany with horseplay. I can finally say that this now seems like a legitimate business, and not a group of college students fooling around. \n\nOnce again, I am beginning to like the ambience;  it's what a shop that sells drinks should feel like -- relaxing! It shows me that this KFT branch is one that's willing to change, that listens to the voice of the customers, and should always be given a second chance. \n\nMany people say that the drinks don't taste good compared to the original KFT. It baffles me as it seems as though they forget that both are branches of a booming business in the East, therefore, both should have drinks that should taste quite the same. I would imagine that all branches have a standard set of recipes which can be adjusted by the customer per request (such as in sweetness level). \n\nAll in all, this was a vast improvement Kung Fu Tea Rainbow. I can only hope to see more of what you have to offer in the future. As of now, a solid 4 stars!
