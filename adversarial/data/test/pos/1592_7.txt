Yowzah! I bullied my husband into trying this place and I am glad I did. He's glad too :) he just won't acknowledge it. \n\nI had to get the Moroccan chicken and hubs got the Adam and Eve. Let me tell ya... HUGE portions with HUGE BOLD flavors. Lip smacking deliciousness. I am sad we are just now discovering this place. It's so unassuming in a strip mall, I drove past this place so many times. But thanks to Yelp I knew such place existed and had to check out this place with has such great reviews. Never disappointed with the general consensus of Yelpers. \n\nService was wonderful. It is a family owned business where they have pride in what they do. Loved the twin sisters who are the daughters of the cook\/owner. They made us feel like family and very welcome.\n\nThe portions were so big, we had the leftovers for lunch the next day. Tasted great reheated too! Check it out and taste for yourself.\n\nDoes not take Amex though... Tis ok. The food compensates for not taking Amex :)
