DO NOT GO HERE!  The worst hack jobs in the industry. They will mess up your hair. I promise. It is all smoke and mirrors. Emmanuel messed up my beautiful color from another colorist out of LA and now I have to pay several hundreds of dollars to fix his mess. When I expressed my disappointment in my zebra striped orange highlights, he refused to fix my hair. Unbelievable. If you want nasty orange blonde fried hair and are planning on joining the circus, you will be very pleased with the outcome of this salon. I am a semi famous recording artist and know the difference of a good highlight.  Save your money and most importantly your hair.
