They need a seperate cyclist trail or ban the 10 speeds from flying down the road.  They are more dangerous than the cars with no regard for vehicles or pedestrians.  Went up to the observation area.  Of course there are people hocking jewelry, their kids tearing up anything that will come loose and elders sitting in the shade, drinking from paper bags. \n\nThe view is nice, and trails are great for exercise. People suck
