I read the 2 reviews this place has an wow... I wish this was the experience we had. We decided to sign our daughter up for a session of dance with this place and were assured it would be a great experience and our daughter would love it. Granted our daughter did love the dance class itself for the first week... All until one of the girls in the class was openly bullying all of the little girls including my daughter. I am the type of dad that will keep my mouth shut for a few minutes and see what happens but when the teacher sees it happening and says nothing and then the little girls dad sees it and just acts as if its not happening there is a real lack of management here. Multiple parents wrote in emails regarding the behavior and it just continued.. \n\nThe next week we show up at 5:00 which was class time and just sat there because they had apparently changed the class times and did not notify us at all.. Just one week after that we get an email from the owner who apparently is an absentee owner and she says that the remainder of classes are canceled indefinitely.. Normally I guess that can happen but the part that really blind sided me is that in her email to us she said she will send out refunds \"whenever she is able\".. Excuse me?!?!? When all of the parents signed up children In the payment section I definitely did not see an option that said \"Pay When I'm Able\"... I mean, really... Can I roll through a drive through and when they give me a total can I just tell them, \" Oh, Ill pay when I'm able.\" Are you kidding me. With this type of business practice I am not at all surprised they are canceling the rest of the classes.\n\nMy opinion is if you are looking for a dance studio place for your kids, avoid this place like the plague.
