Horrible, horrible, horrible.\n\nHad an appt for 1pm on a Tuesday, wasn't seen until 1:45pm.\nProblem wasn't fixed, so back in I went, this time Saturday at 12:50pm.\nWasn't seen until 1:40pm.\n\nAt least the MVD has a tv and lots of chairs and places to wait.  This place is the biggest cluster@#$@#, and there is absolutely nowhere to comfortably wait for your appointment to be called.\n\nSo yeah, thanks Apple Store, I now dread you more than the MVD.
