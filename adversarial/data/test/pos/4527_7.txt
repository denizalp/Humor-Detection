I was out shopping when it struck... the hunger monster. It started to lightly growl, then the roaring began... this is when my friend and I made a decision to try out Briggs. \n\nWe arrived around 6pm and were sat right away, which was nice. I am not sure who our server was because we had so many people attending to us but this meant that we were never without water or drinks. (Positive points granted!)\n\nAfter some careful consideration of the many delicious menu items we went with the seared scallops, roasted cauliflower, beets and the sausage platter. \n\nI was very impressed with the combinations of each. Mostly all had ingredients that I normally did not associate with each other but they were very complimentary.\n\nPricing was much lower than I thought it would be as well especially for how delicious all the food was, I will be coming back for sure to try some more items!!
