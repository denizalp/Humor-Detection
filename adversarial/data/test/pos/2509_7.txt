This is was a terrible experience! Went in yesterday morning to adopt a seven month old puppy. Three other people also were interested in the puppy. We all got time to spend with the puppy to see if we liked the puppy. The employee told us that after everyone got time to spend with the dog he would make his decision as to who he thought would be the best fit for the dog. The other three couples were a young couple that lived in the condo, an elderly couple, and two women who already had a dog that they brought with them.The couple that was picked was..... The two women that already had a dog!!!! WTF!?!. Before seeing the dog, we had to fill out a small questionnaire. At no point did any of the employees speak to any of the people who were interested in this dog. So how can they pick a person that they feel is the best fit when they don't even interview perspective dog owners? My kids were in school so I was unable to take them with me that morning and when they got home from school hoping to see a new puppy, I had to tell them that we weren't picked. Thanks for making my kids cry. I like the idea of your organization but how you run it really sucks! I would've gave zero stars but that wasn't an option. I'm telling everyone I know how poorly this organization is run.
