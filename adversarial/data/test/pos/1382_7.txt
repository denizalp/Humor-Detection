Love fresh seafood? This is your spot! \n\nI honestly can say that this is one of the best places for fresh seafood in the Valley. They have a wide variety that changes according to what is fresh\/in season and it literally tastes like it is right out of the ocean! Their cocktails are fab as well, they make a MEAN Moscow Mule! \n\nMy fiance and I like to sit at the Oyster Bar (shoutout to Mark, he's the best!). Mark always whips up an amazing seared jumbo scallop marinara for me (it isn't on the menu but he is just that much of a rockstar). I honestly crave it! The scallops are like butter, they melt in your mouth. My fiance always gets oysters and by his facial expressions and sounds, it seems that he is in heaven when eating them! Did I mentioned their warm, crunchy sourdough bread? OH MY GAWDDDD, I would come here just for the bread alone! It is SO yum. \n\nThey also have a wonderful sushi bar -- LOVE the Phoenix roll! The General Manager, Jeff is so friendly and makes you feel right at home. When we were leaving, the bartender even opened the door for us and told us to have a great rest of the night! It doesn't get much better than that! We will absolutely be back soon!
