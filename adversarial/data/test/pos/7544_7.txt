Wow, I was really blown away by my experience at Kazu. We were able to sit at the bar over-looking the kitchen, which is my favorite spot at most restaurants. I like being able to watch the process of creating dishes which happens at high speed in the tiny kitchen.\nWe ordered a number of dishes off the menu and off the wall signs. We started with the tender beef carpaccio that melted in our mouths. Then we dug into the bowl of fresh, soft tofu - which is only made on Sunday so make sure to keep that in mind. I found it deeply satisfying and comforting. Next came the shrimp burger which was subtle in its \"shrimp-ness\" but is something I'd love to eat while watching a football game even though it felt somewhat healthy. This was followed by the grilled lamb chops which made me really love lamb for the first time. We then had the grilled calamari and salad, which was the perfect consistency and evoked the feeling of freshness. The final touch was the sakura (cherry blossom) ice cream which was a sweet ending to a wonderful dinner. \nIt's worth the wait in line, the service is great and although you need to eat and go to make space for others, it feels like you're all part of special club. I can't wait to return!
