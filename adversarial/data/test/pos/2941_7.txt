We didn't pick this hotel, Priceline did, promising a three-star in downtown Pittsburgh. It was a last-minute deal ($80) and our first trip to the city. \n\nThe problems began at the door. We had too much stuff to carry up ourselves and I looked around for a bellhop while my husband parked the car in the public garage across the way (as other reviewers have said: expensive).\n\nNo bellhop. I asked the woman at the front desk and she spotted Jeff the bellhop and pointed him out across the lobby. I chased him down, and he said he'd be right out. He never came. I went int to find him and he'd done his disappearing act again.\n\nFifteen minutes later, as we dragged our stuff up in two trips (the elevator's hard to find btw--down a hall beyond the gift shop), we passed him standing at his podium, doing nothing excepting studiously avoiding us. I complained to the woman at the desk and she apologized on his behalf, so I let it go.\n\nThen there was the room: 540. Oh my. A black substance (mold? I sooo hope not) along the ceiling\/wall edge and in a giant blob near the AC vent, peeling wallpaper in several spots, filthy carpet, an off odor, and just an overall run-down look. It was late and we had just schlepped all our stuff in, but I wish we had asked for another room. Since we had prepaid, the front desk couldn't give us a price break so they comp'd us two full breakfasts. That's why two stars instead of one. They made some effort.\n\nThe front desk was marginally helpful about stuff to do on a Sunday night (\"nothing\" she said at first).\n\nIn the hotel, there were parties going on (football weekend) and, with the passing trains and worry about the black blob over our heads, I barely slept. I couldn't wait to get out of there in the morning.
