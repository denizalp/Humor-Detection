I finally found a Chinese restaurant that has decent, quality food. If you like eggplant, you must try the spicy eggplant dinner! The eggplant is cut in chunks with noodles and some vegetables. It has a great flavor; I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nAnother great entree we enjoyed during this meal was chicken egg foo young and beef and snow peas. The egg foo young consisted of thick pieces of egg omelets with chicken in a tasty sauce topped with chives. The beef and snow peas entree consisted of a lot of fresh snow peas, onion, watercress, and carrot. \n\nAlthough the food preparation is fairly quick, the table-side service (e.g., refills of hot tea, more napkins, check) is slow. When we were in, only one server was on the floor handling everyone in the small restaurant dining area. Regardless, she was nice and the atmosphere was comfortable, clean, and nicely decorated. This complemented the dine-in food experience.\n\nI will be back - next time for take-out!
