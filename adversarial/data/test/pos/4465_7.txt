Oyster bar is amazing if you don't mind waiting an hour or more to get seated.\nEvery time we come here there's a wait. I truly hope they change the rules and restrict large parties to sit together. Four or five should be tops. I mean come on! You're sitting at a bar how far away can you be from your friends or family members.  -__- \n\nAnyways, food is great.\nI always get the Pan roast w\/ extra green onion, rice on the side, spicy level 7. Be careful it's spicy. \nBoyfriend loves the Bulabaise with okra, spicy level 7. \n\nLove this place but not the wait, that is the reason why I cannot give them 5 stars.
