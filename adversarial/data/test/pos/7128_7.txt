Merrrr so apparently Tryst was the place to be on a Thursday night for my visit to Vegas so we decided to check it out. I wasn't impressed..\n\nWe were on the guest list but it still took sooooo long to get inside. The guest list line was just as long as the general admission line. I finally pulled one of the workers over, which took A LOT of effort btw, and asked what was going on and why we weren't going in even though we were on guest list. He immediately asked for the name of our promoter and walked us in. NEVER HURTS TO ASK!\n\nMaybe because it was the place to be which is why it was PACKEDDDD. I could barely walked anywhere. I felt bad for my girl friends, who trekked everywhere in their 4-5 inch heels. Poor souls.. Getting onto the dancefloor was virtually impossible and security was pushing us around to stay away from the tables... uhhhh can't help it.. seriously. \n\nOk, yes the club is beautiful inside and the waterfall is ginormous and amazing to look at, but my group couldn't really handle the overwhelming crowd in such a small space. It got to the point where my friend couldn't handle the crowd and cramped area so we had to leave early and just hang out at the casino. I honestly would want to give this place another shot. Until next time!
