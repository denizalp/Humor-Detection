Pretty solidly mediocre sushi. On a conveyor belt.\n\nThis was my first time eating revolving sushi. Pluses: no waiting for your food (in the beginning, anyway. After a while, you might be waiting for something you haven't tried yet to come around, or for a special request), sushi is REALLY inexpensive (we spent about half of what we'd typically spend on sushi). Minuses: average taste, sort of sad looking, not put together with very much care. \n\nWe enjoyed the Las Vegas roll the most and did not like the Hawaiian roll. \n\nWe were just passing through town and were hungry and the sushi counter at AJ's had already closed, so we were just glad to find something to eat. The place was slightly crowded and we had to wait for a seat at the bar (they didn't seem to be seating people at the tables) but we didn't wait long. Bigger parties had longer waits, and after we were seated it really filled up and people were lining the walls waiting for seats. We had to specifically request wasabi, because they forgot to bring us some. The sushi wasn't bad; it just wasn't excellent. I guess you never know how long it's been going around in circles. \n\nWe requested some eel, which was very sweet and very greasy and just sort of slapped on top of the rice. There just isn't a lot of attention to detail here. \n\nThere's something really unnatural about eating off a conveyor belt. I don't think the feeding process needs this kind of automation. The sign said \"fine dining\" but I'm afraid there's nothing fine about adding a labor-saving device more appropriate to a factory to ones meal.
