Despite what many people may tell you, Vegas is not the place to go if you are single and looking for girls (unless you are looking to pay directly for sex which I do not...I prefer to pay psychiatrists later to help cope with the grief and heartache I feel after the sex and subsequent relationships are over....).  None-the-less, many-a-cab-driver had assured us that this was the place to go for girls; so after winning $250 at some shit-hole casino, and being pretty drunk off of the gratis casino drinks, we (we being me and my partner in crime Colin) made our way to what would be our first Vegas club experience...\n\nNow I must preface that while I have a sense of style, it can be argued(and I often do) that Colin does not; much of his clothing bears Kirkland's signature on it; clearly not night-club-esque wear.  This night, however, we were two stylish gents, dressed in fancy suits; we obviously have both seen Swingers.\n\nStylishly striding towards the casino we came across a gaggle of young girls on a bachelorette party and we swooped them up.... I know how these club things work; if you have a positive ratio of girls to guys then you are almost guaranteed admission gratis.  Well we were rolling about 4:1 so I figured the odds were good.  Well all the girls got in free but the stupid bouncer\/host insisted that we pay.  \n\n\"Pay??!!?\" I retorted \"I just brought you a whole gaggle of good looking ladies and you want me to pay??!!\"\n\nArguing did no good so I threw a small pile of my nights winnings at him, turned up my nose, and went inside.\n\nOnce inside, the girls were quickly whisked away into a \"VIP\" area, which is really nothing more than a corner of the dance floor with recliners surrounded by a little velvet rope.  I tried to enter this area \"Hey I'm with those girls\" I told the large ape guarding the rope.\n\n\"Sorry this is a VIP area\" he told me.\n\n\"Girls help me out here!\" I protested\n\n\"No no no.... let him in he's with us\" a few of them said standing up to my defense.\n\nThe bouncer ignored these pleas so I just stepped behind him and then stepped over the velvet rope.  I thought hanging out in the VIP area  would net me free booze and make me even more classy than I already am, but as it turned out there was no free booze and I can apparently get no classier.  \n\nBecoming bored with the VIP area I went onto the dance floor to cut a rug.  The girls could not hang with my dance skills, and only lasted a few songs.  I was quickly snatched up by a large lady.\n\n\"Ooooo boy you fine!\"  She cooed.  \"You are like a little Justin Timberlake!\"\n\nNow I look nothing like Mr. Timberlake; some people say Robin Williams or Sean Penn but I have never heard Justin Timberlake.  Now I should have prefaced this little story by saying that my new found dance partner was black and I asked her: \"What?  Do you think all of us sexy little white boys look the same\"\n\n\"Ah ha ha ha!  You are cute and funny\"  She then proceeded to grab my ass.... tightly.\n\nShe must have seen the look of horror in my face \"What's wrong?  Is your girlfriend watching?  She getting jealous?\"\n\n\"Yes... she is staring daggers at me right now\" I said as I squirmed out of her clutches.\n\nI managed to sneak back into the VIP area but the bride-to-be had become Polly-Pissy-Pants and wanted to go back to the hotel.  Colin and I hung out for a bit and sipped ten dollar Amstel Lights (which was sadly the best beer they had) and listened to shitty music.... it reminded me a lot of PB.... they play crappy pop songs circa 2006 mixed with Lynard  Skynard.  \n\nBeing able to take no more of this, we left the club and came across some Amazon women in the casino who claimed to be models.  They were also black, and Colin loves the black girls almost as much as he loves anything Kirkland Signature.  Upon closer inspection, I came to the conclusion that they were a group of trans-gender models; I am from San Francisco and have a keen eye for spotting these types of things.\n\n\"Pssst.... that was a man you just gave your number to\"\n\n\"No way!\" Colin did not want imagine that he was flirting with a man.\n\n\"Yes it was!\"\n\n\"No way!\"\n\nThis went on for a few minutes until I finally decided to just go and ask them myself.  \"Excuse me, this may seem very rude so please forgive me, but are you ladies actually or at one time ever were men?\"  \n\nThey did not look that shocked and the leader of the group replied \"I am going to do the most lady like thing that I know how to do, and that is just walk away\"\n\nIf she was a real lady then she would have known that the most lady-like thing she could've done would have been to throw a tampon at me, cause everyone knows only the best trannies carry around tampons.... it is all in the details.
