Worst Korean food ever. Normally when we get soft tofu it comes out boiling but not here. It was just luke warm. There were only a few side dishes. But the table next to us (a few Koreans) had way more side dishes. \n\nMaybe if you are Korean you will get better food and service. Place sucks. Never going back. My family got sick after eating the soft tofu. It's just gross. No flavor in the soup. \n\nRuined our night.
