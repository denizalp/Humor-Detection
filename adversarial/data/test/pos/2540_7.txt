My dream in life is to schedule weekly spa days at the five star locations around the Valley and spend every Saturday like the one I recently had at the Westin's Agave Spa at Kierland. Sadly, I don't think this dream will come true anytime soon, but because of that I cherish anytime I get a spa day and I'm pleased that my visit to Agave Spa was everything I hoped it would be!\n\nThe Westin Kierland itself is gorgeous and flawless, but it has more of a concrete decor feel to it. It doesn't have the Old Phoenix feel to it like some, but it's clean, gorgeous and flawless just the same. The Agave Spa has just the same feel. \n\nWalking in, I immediately caught wind of the delicious signature scent of the spa. It smelled so good, I wanted to put the scent in my bag and keep it with me at all times. The staff was extremely friendly right off the bat and quickly showed us to the ladies locker room to get us settled. I like to arrive to the spa as early as possible in order to enjoy as much time there as possible. \n\nOnce I was settled in, I first used the gym to feel better about the pampering I would be doing later. As hard as it is to actually work out on a spa day, it makes me feel so much better and I've added it to my spa routine. But, I make sure I do it when I first arrive. The gym is refreshing because it overlooks the pool. The treadmill is state of the art, offered me way more options than I needed and even had a tv built inside. After my workout, it was time for the massage. The 50 minutes massage was just what the doctor ordered! The masseuse was friendly but not overly chatty which I really appreciate in a masseuse. The room felt refreshing and the music was soothing. The only problem I had with the room was that it was a little too bright for my liking, but then they put a scented mask on my eyes which helped. \n\nAfter my heavenly massage, we continued our girls day out and winded down in the jacuzzi, ordered lunch and drinks while we laid out at the tranquil adult's-only pool and used every amenity the spa had to offer. I decided to shower at the spa because the showers are gorgeous with the popular Westin shower heads and delicious Kai products. They even offer limeade in addition to water and tea to quench your thirst. The entire day was tranquil, relaxing and an excellent way to cool off during the extreme heat. If I could, I would have purchased every Kai Fragrance product they were selling, but the pocketbook wouldn't allow. It's officially on my wish list though! \n\nI will end with a special tip to all my fellow locals out there. Every Wednesday, they offer discounts for local residents including 30% off spa services and 20% off spa products! Now you know where I'll be after work on Wednesdays!
