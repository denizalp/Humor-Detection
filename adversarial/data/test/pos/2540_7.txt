I've been buying supplies here for years. This is the second location they've had. \nWarning: if you plan to shop here, wear safety gear!!! This place, like the prior one, is packed full! It is difficult to maneuver through and good luck finding what you need. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to the 'organization' of the store. \nI will say that prices are great and the two guys that run it are usually friendly, helpful and somewhat knowledgable about the nail industry and products. \nI will be back.
