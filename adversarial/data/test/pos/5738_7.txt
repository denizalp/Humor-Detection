Build-a-Bear workshop is such a cute place for kids...and adults!  It's a fun activity especially for little ones because they get to be a big part in putting together the bear of their choice.  \n\nThey get to choose pretty much everything about the bear, and even whether it's a bear or not.  They have other animals the kids can choose, and even those Shrek babies now too.\n\nKids choose the clothing they want their bear to wear, they get some stuffing and they're good to go!\n\nI made the mistake of taking this little girl I was babysitting here one day (I hope her mom doesn't read this) and it was one of the most embarassing moments ever.  She had this really weird specific idea of what she wanted her bear to wear, and of course, they didn't have that outfit.  She wanted a green princess dress with pink bows and when she found out that they didn't have it, she threw the bear and it hit one of the employees.  Then she threw herself on the ground and started screaming \"I hate you,\" to no one in particular.  \n\nThen everyone looked at me, and I had no idea what to do.  I tried to get her up off the ground, but that made her scream louder.  Then she started screaming that I was hurting her.  \n\nIt truly was Build-a-bear gone wrong.  I finally got her out of the store, but not before every single customer, including a few employees gave me and the little girl I was babysitting dirty looks. \n\nI vowed to never babysit again, but I will give Build-a-Bear another try some day.
