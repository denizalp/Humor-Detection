Among Toronto's vast plethora of must-eat destination lies Lee's restaurant, the Toronto brainchild of Master Chef Susur Lee. Located in the bustling, hip and trendy King West neighborhood, Lee's is a fine example of Toronto's diverse and world class cuisine. \n\nLee's lounge area was once Madelaine's, Susur's former restaurant. The two restaurants were successful yet they operated separate kitchens and different staff, it simply made sense\/cents to combine the two.\n\nLee's interior design is sexy and the ambience commands a younger professional crowd. The Asian and French inspired dishes scream freedom as they place highly successful modern twists on old classics. The Singapore Slaw is the most popular dish on the menu and for good reason, it will change the way you see salads. Boasting 19 different ingredients from edible pansies to rice vermicelli it is visually stunning with notes of sweet, savoury, spicy, crunchy and brought together with the game changing salted plum dressing. If you decide to add salmon sashimi to this dish do not be surprised when everyone else around you is adding seared tuna. \n\nThe Hunanese lobster ravioli with XO sauce and butternut squash pur√©e is a perfect example of Asia and France colliding on your fork. Susur is a master with pairings and many of his dishes examplify strokes of genius. The cheeseburger spring roll is exactly what it sounds like. As odd as you may think it sounds, do not beat yourself up when you have weekly withdrawals from it. \n\nThe Peking & Char Sui Duck is a play on the famous dim sum classic whereby you fill steamed mini tortillas with delicious duck meat, crispy skin, hoisin sauce and julienned vegetables. Only at Lee's, toppings such as red pepper jelly and foie gras pate make their way into the mix. \n\nThe menu is put together with experience, worldly knowledge, sheer talent and execution. This even spills over to the cocktail menu. The Oyster Caesar has twice as many ingredients as most and is perfectly balanced, for that reason it tastes twice as good. \n\nLee's is the perfect venue for a night out, drinks, first date, business meeting or full on feast. Always a chic crowd and always consistent... make a reso.
