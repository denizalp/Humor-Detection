This place has the best pizza at a great price. The medium is large enough to feed two adults. The pizza was cooked perfectly and the service was fast and friendly. The place was very clean. There's also a full bar stocked with high quality liquor.  \nI live 30 min away but I can tell you the pizza alone was worth the trip but I want to try the other items. I tried the white chocolate coconut cream tart for dessert and it was also great. I'm not sure how you go to this restaurant and write a bad review.
