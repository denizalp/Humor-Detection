I came here for a kids party.  The kids had a blast, there are plenty of seating for parents and the place is clean.  I'm surprised there are not more reviews\/photos on this place.   \n\nThe only con I would have is that the party was supposed to last until 2pm and the worker started wiping down the tables and slides around 1:45pm, which is fine, but the spray bottle she was using was a very strong vinegar smell which was a turn off for the kids and adults.  Maybe it was a way to get us out quicker haha.   \n\nI'm not sure the daily rate, but definitely a recommended place for the little ones.
