This place has RUINED all other salsa, for me. In fact, it's ruined most Mexican food for me, since my husband and I compare everything to Caminero's food, now. \n\nThe family that owns and runs this restaurant is so friendly, sweet and helpful. We tell everyone we know to visit this place and even had them cater our 10th wedding anniversary party (I didn't even get any food, because everyone else ate it ALL!).\n\nMy husband is here every weekday morning for breakfast (I'm more jealous of that, than if he was meeting another woman) and we've been known to eat here multiple times a week! \n\nFantastic food, fresh fruit drinks daily, decent prices and excellent service. Oh... and stop ordering Christmas tamales!!! They're all mine!!!!!!!
