Awful.  My husband got me as an Christmas present. The place was freezing, coldest morning in az, and the front door was open. During my massage, she opens the door. Talks to a man in Chinese, then after a few min. She stops and leaves!  Never says she is getting towels.  Horrible, horrible experience.
