GREAT BAR!  I have been here twice now and have no complaints!  The bar tender (Chris) is outstanding and nice to look at...He is great at keeping the patrons happy and keeping the conversation going!  The Lounge also carries my favorite gin (Hendrick's), which is not extraordinarily common in bars around here.  The atmosphere is pleasant and the people here always seem friendly.  It has never been crowded when I am there, which is fine by me.  I am almost afraid to give such an outstanding review, in fear of it becoming popular, because I like this little gem that Christina P. introduced me to just the way it is!
