AWG made a BAD SITUATION WORSE.  In summary, driver called me (the travel coordinator) to confirm (1) the cell # of my CEO she was picking up & (2) to say she was 10 minutes out.  My CEO calls me 10 minutes later to say the driver called him and said her car broke down, there's no one else available & and my CEO is SOL.\n\nThen the company calls me and offers to NOT charge us for the pickup that never happened - are you kidding me?  How freaking gracious.  \n\nAWG left a frequent traveler stranded w\/out offering alternate transportation ... and w\/ 60 minutes to make his flight.  They provided completely unprofessional service.
