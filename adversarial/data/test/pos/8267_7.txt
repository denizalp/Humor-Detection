So we got seated at around 2:30pm and I was hungry and tripping because they close at 3 and I wanted to order because I didn't want to be the last man standing and feeling disrespectful for being last.\n\nSo I waved my hand up in the air like \"CAN I ORDER\" and the girl raised her hand back up at me and was like \"YOU WANNA ORDER\"?? Ok b.... don't get sassy with me. Got you one star docked for that.\n\nWe ordered a variety of different items and shared. It was delicious and inexpensive. The red velvet pancakes were so good as well as the white chocolate pancakes. I don't think I will ever enjoy a pancake as much as I did here. What's the recipe?\n\nMy friend got the corn beef hash and it was so disgustingly salty. Had to break our sunny side up eggs on it and taint it with the potatoes then drown it in the disgustingly overbuttered toast that she forgot to bring out. Potato's were deliciously cooked and crisped to the T! Although it was extremely salty and almost killed my taste buds one bite of those pancakes drowned my sorrows away and I was back at my A game.\n\nThe Kalbi here was good too. Overall, I obviously fell in love at first pancake. There's like 3 or 4 locations nearby each other in Vegas. Share the love. Come to San Diego, CA.
