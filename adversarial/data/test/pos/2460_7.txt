Okayyyy, so I was visiting a friend who lives down the street from the cute little Downtown Gilbert area and I was so impressed with all of the delicious restaurant options that they have to offer. It is a lovely spot to spend an afternoon. They've done such a great job with this area! \n\nMy friend told me that Nico was owned by the creators of Virtu {one of my Top 5 Valley favs!} so I was immediately sold! I went all-in and ordered their rigatoni {homemade pasta} with slow roasted pork sugo, house made ricotta, and red wine. IT WAS TO DIE FOR. Like, i'm still dreaming about it a day later. Yup, I basically licked my plate and the portion was not small. My girlfriend ordered their grilled Caesar wedge and that was also incredible and a great portion size. It had a tasty char to it and the dressing was SO yummy. I would 100% get that again to start if I came back. \n\nAll in all, Nico was fresh, affordable, our food was phenomenal, and service was friendly. You better believe i'll be back! :)
