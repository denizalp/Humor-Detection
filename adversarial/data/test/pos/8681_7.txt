I've tried donut bar before, but I came here for the ice cream donut cone. They don't serve them til after 10 am, so plan accordingly if you want to try it. \n\nI also ordered the creme brûlée and strawberry cheesecake. The creme brûlée has a hard caramelized top that I think is way too thick. The filling inside was really good, however the donut itself was a little dry. The strawberry cheesecake had an ample amt of filling but the dough was also dry. Onto the reason I came here...the cone isn't really a donut. It's more like a pastry covered in sugar. The soft serve was good, but for $6, would I get it again? No
