Le Kitchen is really happily becoming a regular spot for me. After early yoga at Moksha next door this place is thankfully open early enough for me to catch a bite afterwards.\n\nServing up gluten free and vegan (mainly) bowls, smoothies, soups, wraps, salads, and baked goods, Le Kitchen does a great job of making breakfast and lunch fun for anyone health-conscious or with dietary restrictions. Their coffees are also wonderful. I do find their full-price fare a little costly (hence the four stars) however, if you show up early enough they've usually got great prices running on the day-old meals (which are soooooo worth it).\n\nThe space remains true to its industrial architectural roots but also stays really fun and inviting. The tunes generally range from 80s to 90s guilty pleasures at a moderately bumping audio level which pleases me greatly. Because it's an open kitchen you can see the staff all jamming out while making delicious noms, which is also fun. Counter staff is always thoroughly wonderful- the kinda folks that really make your day better.\n\nWhile it's not a sit down spot in the least, the little window seats have definitely made for a nice quick chill spot while I enjoy a smoothie or a gluten free & vegan bagel and cream cheese (which is effin' fantastic btw!).\n\nWorth a visit if you're in the neighbourhood.
