This Big Lots is a brand new store. The old store was at the other end of the shopping center and was much smaller. The new store is not only larger, but better organized, has more merchandise, has more check out counters, and is super clean.\nParking is ample and close to the door. The staff is helpful and friendly. Prices are more than a dollar store, but less than Targets.\nOne highlight for my family is the expanded electronics section. The only down side is that the more expensive electronics gadgets are locked in a glass case, so you need to find someone to unlock the case to look at the merchandise.
