As a poor college student who loves pizza, Slices is a good place to go!  Most of the time, they run the ASU student special [two slices and a drink for $6] which is great for those of us who have dire needs like books, school supplies, or want to shop at American Eagle Outfitters.  XD\n\nThey have a good selection of pizza [chicken pesto = fave!] and their calzones are delicious.  Sure, the place is a little dirty and seating is extremely limited.  Regardless, I love this place!  If only they had bigger plates...
