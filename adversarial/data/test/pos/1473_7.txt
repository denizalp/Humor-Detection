I work at the new animal hospital that opened in the same \"shopping center\" so I've been coming here a lot on my breaks considering how conveniently close it is. Yesterday I stopped in just for chips and a drink since I already had lunch and just wanted a quick snack. I went straight to the register considering I wasn't ordering a sandwich and the cashier or an employee who I thought was a cashier completely ignored me! She just continued to check herself out for lunch, and did not say one word to me, not even when I was in her way to swipe her credit card she just worked her way around me standing in front of the machine and kept on doing her thing. I even said \"no sandwich just these two please\" and she walked away with no words! After the real cashier checked out the guy she was making a sandwich for not me, she finally says \"welcome to subway, no sandwich?\" I'm not sure what was wrong with these employees and I know they are open 24 hours but wow. This experience makes me never want to return ever again I may as well buy the fake food at Dairy Queen next door.
