I rented a beautiful house with an abundance of flat, decorator paint that shows every mark and fingerprint, an ageing electric coil stove and cream colored carpet that was installed when the house was built new in 2007. I know that for a fact because I used to live in the house Right. Next. Door; this house was literally my shared wall neighbor.   (The carpeting is really starting to show it's age; time for the owner to replace it.  Maybe that old stove too.)\n\nAside from an inconvenient policy change that now requires me to drive to their offices after my move out to return my keys and then wait for them to contact me for a walk-thru inspection, which conflicts with what's stated in the tenant handbook I was originally told to follow, things have been okay...\n\nI was a model tenant; I paid my rent on time or early every month, I kept my house spotless and took good care of it, documented everything wrong with the house when I moved in, and I'm returning the house in even better condition than I got it in, except for that old carpeting.  \n\nSo far so good, but my opinion can change before this process is over and we see what happens with my deposits.
