we received a flyer in the mail for a new a\/c unit with numerous refunds so i went against my better judgement and called them (i would normally never respond to a junk mail letter, but out a\/c is over 30 yrs old so i thought what would be the harm). \nthe telephone operator was an expected overly friendly young man in tempe and he scheduled an appt that was convenient for us. the two salesmen showed up and were very down to earth, friendly, and not overly pushy. regular guys doing their job in my opinion. \n\nlots of options but after we listened to the whole spiel, the bomb was dropped at 12k for a new unit. with all the rebates (plus sales tax), the total came to just under 10k. for a similar but cheaper unit, 8k. our condo is only 900sq ft, so i found it hard to believe we couldn't get anything cheaper, but by now we had determined we weren't going to buy one. \n\nas with any salesman, they had to try. i'm not sure why they do this, but they kept pushing signing a 0% interest bank loan to pay for the unit. it was odd....to me anyway. it was getting late and when we found out we could sign and just cancel the next day, we signed. plus it was getting over an hour into this appt and we were tired and hungry and just wanted to spend the remainnig time after work relaxing. \n\nin all, i wasn't disappointed or satisfied. they were salespeople and doing what they are hired to do. i'm automatically defensive when someone is trying to sell me something...i always feel like i'm getting scammed. i can't really comment on the product because we decided against it, mostly because our old one still works and 10k can be spent in so many other places than an a\/c....for now anyway!
