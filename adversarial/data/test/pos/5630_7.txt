While I agree with Lauren and Katrina (the yelpers that wrote reviews of this Circle K location) prior to mine, I cannot bring myself to give more than four stars to a Circle K that has no gas!  Isn't that what Circle K is known for? Gas?\n\nGas lacking aside, this Circle K has become my latest go-to stop when I'm in need of a quick drink or snack while I'm on the run... I've found myself hitting up this store at least once a week to pick up a cold Diet Coke, Mountain Dew, pack of gum, nutrition bar, etc... I love that they have all different flavors of Emergen-C fountain drinks available too - this is the only place I've seen this.\n\nOn top of the fine selection of snacks and drinks galore, I noticed that they also carry dog food and various other random items that may come in handy if you don't feel like schlepping to a CVS or Walgreen's. Prices are comparable to most gas stations, at least for the items I've purchased here.  Best of all?  The guy that works at this location whenever I go is extremely friendly and seems very sincere every time I go in.  I'll have to get his name next visit - he really deserves to be mentioned by name for his superior customer service.  It's rare you find that at a (gas) station \/ local chain store.
