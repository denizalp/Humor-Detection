A must stop when in the area, the art is unique and varied and likely to have something for all tastes and budgets.   I purchased a large painting for my living room from the artist who happened to be working there that day which is now the prominent piece and draws favorable comments from nearly everyone who comes over.  The artist also provided  delivery when it wouldn't fit in my car.
