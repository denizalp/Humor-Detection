HOLY COW! If you really want to get your exercise on just stop by this airport cause you will get one hell of a workout. \n\nI mostly drive into Vegas so landing in this airport for the first time I was blindsided by the massive size of this place. Luckily I was in terminal 1 so I didn't have to take the shuttle\/tram thingy. \n\nThe moment you step out of the plane, you're welcomed with neon lights, smells of food and tons of people! I thought I stepped into Disneyland for a second. This place is crawling with folks from all over. \n\nJust walking to the baggage claim took a lengthy 10-15 mins darting in between folks with their carry on bags. Most of them looked like they were struggling just to drag them all the way to the outside. Where ever outside was...I passed by stores, restaurants and even more slot machines. Elevators here and there, escalators to unknown destinations...even trying to read the signs to \"baggage claim\" was a I-Spy game.\n\nThe baggage claim area was incredibly difficult since there is no main screen to tell you which baggage carousal was your's. and of course...it had to the be farthest one on the block. It looked like bowling alley lanes lined up side by side. By the time I found the carousal all the bags were already in rotation! Usually I'm waiting for my bag to come out of the shoot but nope, not at McCarran...your bags make it out before you even get there. \n\nAnd trying to find Ground Zero to locate your hotel shuttle is just the worse....after asking 3 staff members, we finally took an elevator down to some unlabeled area...which was not even labeled Ground Zero. oh the headache.
