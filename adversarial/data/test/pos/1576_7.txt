Great place for yummy crunchy doughy rolls with basic deli fixings or exotic combos like spicy chicken, cilantro and vegies.  The iced coffee is really really good too. Spring rolls taste wonderful too. And did I mention that the prices are the best in town for a deli sandwich? \n\nNote: do not go here thinking \"gourmet italian deli\" - this is more of a standard sub on a better roll at a better price.
