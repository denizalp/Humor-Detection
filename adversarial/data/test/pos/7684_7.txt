I guess you could say that these guys are a bit ahead of the curve on what appears to be a surfacing trend. Ice cream rolls are well known in Thailand, but have only recently started to garner up a buzz in the US. I'm guessing that, at some point, Thai restaurants will eventually start taking note and incorporating it into their menus. Until that happens, we have Nomadic to rely upon.\n\nTake note that it's not a stand-alone store, but a cart that's located within a hot dog restaurant. The restaurant itself, is located within a park that's across from a police station in an area that doesn't appear to have much else. I only say this because if you're not familiar with this area, it can be a little confusing.\n\nThe concept is admittedly clever. I'll give them that. But it seems to be more about the unique preparation than anything else. I guess I was expecting a different texture and taste to the ice cream, but it's essentially not all too different than what you'd find elsewhere. Not that I consider that a bad thing.  \n\nI ordered the Kit-Katcha and my girlfriend ordered the Duderino. Both were okay. My girlfriend was asked if she wanted nuts or sprinkles. She said she wanted to eat it how it \"typically\" comes. He again asked if she wanted nuts or sprinkles, so she reluctantly got sprinkles and I added nuts. In the end, we felt that we shouldn't have added anything, as it just interferes with the flavor of the ice cream.\n\nWe'll probably return at some point to try some other flavors. I suggest keeping your expectations realistic. If you're looking for mind-blowingly great ice cream, this isn't really the place. But if you're looking for something that's truly unique (at least in Phoenix in 2016), it definitely succeeds in that regard.
