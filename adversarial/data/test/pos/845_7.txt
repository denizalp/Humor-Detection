BEST Fish & Chips in Toronto - HANDS DOWN!  There is only one other place that I would go to and now, I probably won't go there anymore!  Fresco's is IT!  It was a combination of the service, the owner and the food that makes it amazing!\n\nThe fries are hand-cut and delicious, coleslaw refreshing, and above all the FISH was incredibly amazing!  Not too greasy, batter is out of this world (trust me - go for the extra crispy!)  Price is beyond reasonable - even for the halibut (and again trust me, the haddock was delish!)  I can't wait to go back and try their crab cakes and the lobster bites....oh yeah and their poutine!\n\nAll in all, all I can say is 2 enthusiastic thumbs up and 5 stars from me!\n\nThanks!! :)))
