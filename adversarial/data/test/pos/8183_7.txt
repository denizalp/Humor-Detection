So they say to stay away from deli meats when you're pregnant but i've wanted nothing more than a turkey sandwich as of lately! SO, my husband mentioned Capriotti's and how they have REAL pulled turkey on their sandwiches, not the processed slices. Yes, please! We decided to make a visit so that I could get my turkey sandwich fix. \n\nI have been a few times in the past (different locations) and ordered the Cole + liked it so that is what I went with again! NOTE: Their small sandwich is still LARGE! I believe it was about 9 inches. More than enough for one person! The Cole has their roasted turkey, coleslaw, provolone cheese, thousand island dressing, and mayo. I had a feeling it would be pretty saucy so ordered light on the mayo and dressing, however, I don't think they got the memo because I was basically eating mouth fulls of mayo and dressing when it came. We were hungry so I didn't send it back but it was honestly so gloppy with sauce. The flavor of the sandwich is great but next time I would ask for both mayo AND the dressing on the side because it is just too risky otherwise. \n\nI went to get soda from the machine and it had a rotten egg flavor - GROSS! So I dumped it out and went ahead and got iced tea instead. \n\nThis location doesn't have a ton of seating and the tables are VERY close together! It wasn't the most comfortable so i'd probably get it to-go next time as well. However, it is worth noting that the employees here were VERY nice!!
