Damn Tableau, was warm waffles away from possibly a 5.\n\nThis spot is located in this executive lounge area. If you have to use the pisser, you'll understand how serious they take that label.\n\nAnyways, I was hesitant a bit. I don't like to splurge too much for breakfast, maybe Bottega Louie, meh. Menu was limited but I said hey let's do it. Pretty good decision.\n\nOur table ordered the eggs benedict, which delivered. The complimentary bread was clutch. 1v1 cannot be defeated by any complimentary bread, it just can't.\n\nI ordered the waffles with that foie gras. At a +10 charge, I was worried about the quality of it, and well it wasn't the best, but for early brunch it was decent. The waffles blew me away, the batter was Aaron Judge clutch. The applewood bacon was applewood bacon, no rip offs here.\n\nService was cool. The opener did great, the actual server was alright but still left that 20% because of the first homie. Promote him! \n\nTableau is really good, any bad review might have come off ordering the wrong thing, or taking the cold waffles personal.
