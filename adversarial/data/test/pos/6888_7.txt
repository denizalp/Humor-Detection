Pleasant surprise when I walked by while shopping at the outlets. \n\nThier gelato rose topped with a macaron is what drew me in. Sample the gelatos they are all great. You can really taste the flavor.\n\nI went for the coconut, mango and strawberry topped with a caramel macaron! Delicious!!!!\n\nService was OK. They were super busy so that maybe a factor. I would go back for sure!
