Yum, yum & more yum! Fusion Bento Box is my favorite - I get it with regular fries & the mark's roll. \nTuna nachos - AH-MA-ZING!!!!\nMartinis are awesome too & only $5 on Tuesdays!\n\nYou'll love the decor - so hip & inviting.\n\nThe service here is phenomenal; from being greeted immediately, to the wait staff, & the timing of order to table.\n\nCheck out the bathrooms & learn a thing or two in foreign language!
