Maybe it's because I lived in north Jersey for almost half my 41 years and had an immediate selection of 5-star diners, but this diner was no where near a 5 star experience. They're really lucky I'm giving them two stars.\n\nWe decided to go there this morning, a Saturday, because we were looking for a good breakfast and willing to pay a little bit extra for it.\n\nThe place was pretty busy with older people so we were stuck in a tiny two-seater by the door. The table had a lot of clutter on it and it didn't leave much room for plates let alone anything else. \n\nThe menu is limited, no country fried steak, no meat in the skillets that I saw (besides the corned beef hash one) and you couldn't get lunch until 11 AM. Their lunch and dinner menus are also limited.\n\nWe both got 2 eggs and bacon. It comes with home fries and a bread of your choosing. I did sunny side up and a bagel. He did sunny side up and rye. Husband got orange juice and coffee, I got iced tea. \n\nFood came out fairly quickly. But when the waitress set down my plate, the eggs were literally raw. They were quickly fried on the bottom but jiggly and clear on the top. I scraped off most of the raw egg white that I could and used the bottom and the cold yolk to flavor my potatoes. Nothing had salt. Even the butter on the lightly warmed bagel was plain and salt-free. There was something that looked like paprika maybe on the potatoes, but you couldn't taste it. It was horrible. I asked the husband if there happened to be jelly packets on his side of the tiny table we were forced to choose because the place was busy for a Saturday morning, but he said there wasn't anything but what I saw over there. The girl never asked if I wanted cream cheese or jelly and she never came back during the entire time we were eating for me to ask her for some.\n\nHis meal was the same. It was horribly bland and we weren't even out the door before he said we were never going back there. \n\nWe both agreed the bacon had the most flavor, but my slices ranged from dark and crispy on one side to almost uncooked on the other side of the same piece. \n\nDon't waste your time or money unless you like bland, unsalted, hardly cooked food.
