Wow. Polished is great. I went today for a soft-gel mani, a pedicure, and I got my eyebrows waxed as well. As far as a one-stop shop for multiple beauty regimes, this is a great place to go! \n\nThe online appointment system streamlines everything for you. You can make multiple appointments at the same time. They are great here about keeping everyone on schedule. I moved from each of my appointments like clockwork. I have seen from some reviews that some people do not like this experience because it does not allow for any detours along the way. As for me, I personally like this style of doing things. If you specifically make the appointment for everything you need\/want then the technician should be able to do the work in the allotted time. \n\nCiCi did my soft-gel mani and honestly this is the best mani I have had in Vegas. She was very attentive to my cuticles and took her time. And she massaged my arms\/hands after the mani, which is nice because at my old nail salon they hardly spent anytime doing that at all! CiCi also helped me pick out the perfect shade of pink and glitter. All I did was tell her I was there to get my nails looking nice for my new job! She knew exactly what to do! For me, this was great because I am not super picky about my nails, I just want them to look NICE. So it was nice for the nail tech to take the wheel and just drive. Obviously CiCi knows what she is doing.\n\nMy pedi was very relaxing and I enjoyed the massage chairs here. The water temp was kept at a reasonable level. Mom did my pedi and she really did take the time to do a GOOD pedicure, nothing seemed rushed to me. \n\nAfter my pedi I was taken to get my eyebrows done. The room they have to do the waxing is almost like a closet so it's kind of weird, but oh well. That's really my only ding. Mom did my eyebrows and trimmed them too. She also noted I should get my upper-lip waxed as well, so I did that too. \n\nOverall I will absolutely return to Polished for my future nail appointments. Unlike other reviewers I did not experience any negativity from the front desk. I simply walked in, gave my name, and they told me to select my colors. Maybe I just got lucky.
