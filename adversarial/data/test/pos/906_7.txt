Dang, this place is SO GOOD. Why can't we have a place like this in Detroit? Well, now that I think about it, it's a good thing that it's not near me, otherwise, I'd be going there very often, and it probably wouldn't taste as good after a while.\n\nOn our recent trip back from NJ and NY, we stopped in Cleveland for a break, and Yelp directed me to this little gem. Skeptical that there were so many raving reviews about an authentic Hong Kong style restaurant, and after seeing the tantalizing food pictures, Husband and I decided to give this place a try.\n\nBoy, all the positive reviews were right!\n\nWe went with three dishes, though we wish we could have ordered more.\n\n1. Beef Chow Fun ($7.95): Not oily or greasy, the noodles were a nice chewy bunch that was balanced with dry fried beef slices, bean sprouts, and onions. The soy sauce coated each noodle evenly. My only complaint is that the noodles were broken up, and not continuous in long strands. Otherwise, flavors were on point.\n2. Jade tofu stir fry with fish fillets and vegetables ($13.95): HUGE portion! For the two of us, this one dish provided leftovers for 3 days!! The tofu was cut in small circular rounds and thinly fried, and the fish fillets were fresh and flaky with a light breaded coating. Sauce was a chicken base that wasn't overdone with cornstarch, and the vegetables were fresh, vibrant, and refreshing. Paired with steamed white rice, this dish was so flavorful without being salty.\n3. Three flavor Dumpling Noodle Soup ($6.95): Fresh and house made dumplings! This bowl of noodle soup was really special. The lady making the dumplings towards the front of the restaurant was so nice, and I couldn't believe how tasty these dumplings were! One dumpling was a pork and shrimp with chives mixture, another was straight up pork and shrimp, and the last one was pork, leek, and cabbage dumpling. Paired with egg noodles and a pork soup base, this was perfect on a cool, rainy evening.\n\nService was great, and it was a packed house. Our tea was refilled promptly, and the waitress was nice enough to accommodate our request for no MSG in food. The meal was finished with 4 slices of oranges (tradition in most HK style restaurants), and plenty of to go boxes.\n\nFinal tab was $30, and leftovers for 3 days. Crazy I tell you, but it was sooooooo worth it.\n\nSo, next time you're in the Eastern part of Cleveland, stop by this place! We will certainly be back.\n\nClosed on Tuesdays.
