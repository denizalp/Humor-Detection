Wanted to be treated like garbage?\nWant to get kicked out after paying your bill?\nIf so, Khao San Road is the place for you.\n\nI took my date to Khao San Road after seeing high number of reviews on Yelp. As soon as I sat down, I was embarrassed that I took her here. I saw the owner of the restaurant eating food with his bare hands between serving food to customers. It was disgusting. The food portion was very small and the service was the worst. The small portion kind of helped because it was really bad. It was insanely salty. I was thinking that this was really bad for my health. (I remember chugging down water all day after leaving Khao San Road). I always finish my food. In fact I always order second bowl of rice when having curry. (Curry lovers know what I'm talking about). I could not finish my curry. It was that bad.\n\nWhen it was time for me to pay the tip, I gave them what they deserved. I paid the bill. The owner then came upto me and demanded that I should be paying more tip. I refused as it was \"tip\" and I get to decide how much tip I should be giving them. He then kicked me out of the restaurant. It was freezing outside but I had no choice. He then told one of his employees to stay outside to watch me. He kicked me out and found a way to harass me even after I was outside.\nI had to go to the washroom after my meal, but I couldn't. My date was still in the washroom when I got kicked out. They would not let me wait for my date inside. She was very curious why I was waiting for her outside when it was freezing.\n\nThis place has unusual amount of reviews even for a well-known restaurant in downtown Toronto. I don't know what the owner did, but Yelp should do something about reviews that are not organic.
