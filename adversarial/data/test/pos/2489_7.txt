People: STOP TALKING DURING MOVIES! This theater wasn't that busy (there were only about 6 other people in the weekend matinee with us) but all six of them talked the ENTIRE TIME. I went to alert the employees and they came in the theater but nobody was asked to leave. I think talking must be a real problem here because it just seemed like the norm. \n\nThis place has been purchased by Regal Cinemas (yay!) so make sure you scan your Regal loyalty card for extra points. You can rack up free snacks and tickets quickly if you go to the movies as often as I do. \n\nThis is an OLD and outdated theater. It has \"stadium seating,\" but it's with those super old, super uncomfortable seats that don't move. The screen was on the small side and the sound was adequate but this is far from your state of the art moviegoing experience.\n\nThey have Pepsi at the snack bar but since most Regals have Coke, I asked and they said they would be switching over to Coke at some point. The popcorn was just \"meh,\" even though they had just popped it fresh. I did like that they had the self-serve butter flavored grease machine so you can load your popcorn with as much of that stuff as you wanted.
