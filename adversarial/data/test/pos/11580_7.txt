Initially we received terrible service from a lazy and rude server who even told us that they are not allowed to explain their menu any longer. After receiving the main dishes and salads not as ordered, we brought the poor service to the attention of the manager. She immediately corrected the matter and replaced the server with Justin, who was spectacular. I gave three stars because the service was only great after we notified the manger. The first server should not even be working at Flemings. Her skills were more appropriate at Taco Bell.
