This place is grand. Huge vaulted high ceilings in the Grand Hall with chandeliers that sparkle. It's got a lot of space and even though there was another event in the building, we never saw them. \n\nThe wedding ceremony took place in one of the partitioned rooms in the Grand Hall, and the reception beside it. \nThe cocktails were served in the lobby which was big enough for all the 200+ guests. \n\nThey had two bars set up, but wine was only available passed around, but was difficult to find. What I thought was most disconcerting was that when hors d'oeuvres came around, they would just walk by groups of people as if their goal was not to serve people the food but carry them around. I was standing beside one server with a tray, and they had stopped for the couple beside me. I reached my hand out, and they walked away!\n\nThe white wine (Chardonnay) was watery tasting, and the red (at least one batch) had a pungent smell. \n\nDinner was served promptly. There were so many servers, at least one per table I would imagine, maybe more. \nThey were expressionless, and other than serving food had a hard time doing anything else (like getting more water, or tea\/coffee).\n\nThe couple had a sweet table at the end of the night, and 3 servers were standing there serving cakes (which weren't finished by the end of the night) to people. I didn't think this was necessary. \n\nWith so many people working, it makes me wonder if the couple is paying for the servers by the hour, like so many venues make you do. I would be careful of this if you're thinking about booking the place. \n\nThe dance floor was big, nice and wooden in one piece.  The acoustics were a bit off (too loud most times) but not the fault of the venue, the audio guys. \n\nThe washrooms (2 sets on either side of the room) was very much to a high class hotel standard, without the attendant.
