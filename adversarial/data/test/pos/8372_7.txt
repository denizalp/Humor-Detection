Been here on the week day.... They had only two options veg or non veg thali which was kind of different ... Since the menu was limited I expecting it to be outstanding.. The cost of the thali was pretty descent 7$ but that budget shows on the plate ... Food was not fresh chicken smelled bad\n...  they just filled up the plate ... Even if they charged 2-3$more and served quality food I would have been really happy...
