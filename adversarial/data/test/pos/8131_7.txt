Guest of the Hyatt Regency for the last 5 days. Had an hour to grab a quick lunch. Ordered chicken tenders. The worst food I had ever tasted. Very dry, no flavor. Ate it anyway and left the roof of my mouth sore from the dryness of the food. Disappointed as I was hungry.  Slow service.  The final kick is when the waitress refilled my iced tea. She didn't wash her hands from cleaning up the other guest table because she left a mayo stain on my drink glass(see pic).
