MISS TACO TUESDAY WHILE ON VACATION? I DON'T THINK SO!\n\nRemember the movie \"Speed\"? Where the bus has to go a minimum speed limit, or everyone dies? My life is kind of like that. I have to consume a minimum of one taco a week, or I die.  Well.... I'm not totally sure I would die, but I don't want to take any chances so I just keep eating away. \n\nParadise Cantina happens to be located next to CVS, and since we were becoming regulars there, we figured we'd check it out! Our server Jax did a good job taking care of our needs out on the front patio. She brought me delicious, probably life-saving tacos.  We ordered a basket of chips and salsa, as well as some margaritas. The guac that came with the chips was delicious! The salsa was very fresh too. And the tacos weren't bad, albeit pretty messy! (I put a safety bib on the husband.)\n\nSpoke with some more friendly employees back inside on my way to the ladies room (which I happily found to be very clean!) I complimented their salsa and they informed me everything is made fresh daily. This pleases me.\n\nIn conclusion, let's think about the taco. MmmmMMMMmm; taco. \nThe word is the same in English and Spanish. How cool is that?!\nTaco.
