I'm giving this place a one star because it was the worst service I have ever had and we had a table. Our bottle service was sooo crappy and the girl was hardly ever there to check in to see if we needed a drink made or just wanted anything else. I went outside with friends because they had to smoke a cigarette and when we wanted to get back in they told us we had to get to the end of the longggg line when we had a table!! Ridiculous! If we are paying thousands of dollars for this table and bottle service I expect to get treated a little better than that. The door guys were so rude. \n\nThe place is so small, hot, and crowded. They really just need to shut this place down and put something better and bigger and have an outside area so that people can get out and get some air.
