We came to visit during lunch time. We wanted something quick and easy. Luckily for us, there were only a few people in the restaurant so we didn't have to wait very long. I liked that you order at the counter and pick up your burger when it's ready. For a custom made to order burger, the portion, flavor and price wasn't bad at all! I ordered a grass fed beef patty with bun, tomatoes, avocado, mushrooms, chipotle lime sauce, and some other stuff. Hubby ordered a burger too with ranch and we used the check in offer for free fries. The order came to around $22. \n\nHubby liked his burger. I thought mine was good but I thought the patty itself was a little dry and because there was so much sauce on my burger, the bun started to get a little soggy. The ranch was really good and I liked the fries. Service was friendly and quick. Restaurant was clean and I dig the decor. Overall, it's a great place to get a good burger quickly at a decent price.
