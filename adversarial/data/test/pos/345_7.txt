This place is the real deal. \n\nI know it's a horrible cliche` but when you enter an ethnic cuisine resturant and hear the customers AND the wait staff speaking the language of the cuisine ... you KNOW it's gonna be good!! \n\nI've been going to El Mesquite for nearly 10 years. The servers have been there forever and I think are related to one another. \n\nWhen you first enter you see some sterotypical posters on brightly painted walls and cutsey mexican pottery and plants. The resturant used to be only one room and has since expanded to two rooms. Another sign that a place is good! :) You are expected to seat yourself and will wait a minute or two before a bowl of paprika dusted toritilla chips that are served with TOXIC hot sauce!! Man it's killer!! but sooo good!! Just sprinkle some salt on it and ask for water and power through it!! Trust me! It'll get sweet after a bowl or two!! and when it does... MAN! that's good eatin!!\n\nI like the two eggs with beans and tortillas with a side order of fried potatos! it's the best vegetarian breakfast on the south side! For lunch, a yummy burrito will do! And for dinner, the combination dinners are KING! The beans a lil runny, but when mixed with the rice, are AMAZING!! I like their iced tea, it's very dark, almost like sun tea. and the cups are huge! \n\nAnd every meal is under $10! who can beat that?? Look out for the daily specials! they're rarely on the menu and are usually indulgences of a cook that gets bored easily! LOL! Today's was Pezole with fresh Pan. \n\nOne of the things that can be a little confusing is that the servers rarely give you a check. It's up to the diner to go to the back cashier register and pay. Usually, that's when the diner is told what the total is. I belive this is done as to not rush the patrons out of the resturant, which is something I appreciate. \n\nWhen you're on the south side and want something a little off the beaten path and like leiserly meals served rocket fast and with love super hot suce all for under 10 bucks a pop this is TOTALLY the place for you!! Seat yourself, order water and sweat while u dare to enjoy the salsa! It'll only take a second as your food will be ready in a flash!
