Specialty grocer, inceed. The Butcher's Market has #AllTheMeats and lots of amazing looking seafood, too. The meat coolers have lamb, veal, buffalo, alligator, boar and ostrich. Yes, really. And \"regular\" beef and pork and chicken. Sausages, fresh and flash frozen shrimp, some tuna and salmon that looked amazing. Fresh racks of ribs. Side dishes like twice-baked potatoes and cheese mashed potato.\n\nSeveral coolers of beer included local and micro-brew six and twelve packs. Great looking wines.\n\nSeveral displays of other local products including honey, marinades, sauces and such.\n\nI'm seriously impressed by the selections at The Butcher's Market. I will be back.
