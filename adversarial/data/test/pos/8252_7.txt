This place is beautiful and amenities are awesome, being close to old town Scottsdale and fashion square mall is convenient and that's about where it ends. \n\nI was extremely excited to move into this place when I first saw them going up, knowing a bunch of people living at their camelview property and how much all of them loved it their I was pretty much sold after I first toured these.\n\nStaff was very night and helpful, heather is amazing and there was another lady there who was fun to talk to all the time but she ended up leaving soon after starting there.\n When I first applied getting everything handlers was a pain trying to move in because the property manger was always leaving due to family issues, I get it happens. \n\nAfter move in and doing a walk through of the unit lots if little things needed to be fixed carpet seems were bad, trim above one of the closet was cracked, little details were annoying cabinet doors opened up to far and smacked the walls, water pressure in the kitchen sink is so high you put it on and water goes all over the counter and floor. Tons of little thing I could just go on about. Most of which they could fix they did. \n\nBefore moving in we were told there would be construction, and that we wouldn't hear much noise from it and wouldn't wake us up. And that also the units were built so sound wouldn't be an issues. The main reason I moved here was because I said I work on music, DJ and produce and don't want to have issues with my neighbors, and they said it wouldn't be a problem. Well it was, my front door didn't seal properly so you could hear my phone ringing on the kitchen doubter down the hall, so you can only imagine how playing music or even watching tv was.\n\nSoon after move in the the basketball courts flooded, which I found out later that it had happened before also. \n\nFire alarms went off ALL the time! \nMy neighbors smoked tons of weed so my unit constantly smelled of it.\nThe construction made having a patio useless because it had an inch of dirt on it at all times, as well as me having to constantly dust inside from it.\n\nThen when you think it couldn't get worse...\nPipe broke or who knows what happened they never gave us a straight answer. 20 plus units flooded including mine. So flooded unit, they gave us a $200 credit for a hotel over night, well old town Scottsdale last minute, good luck finding a room, The W ended up helping us out, props to them, but we still had to pay more due to having a pet.\n\nWe ended up transferring units because all the wanted to do was put blowers in the walls and carpet to dry out the water... Sorry water trapped in the walls is not healthy.\nThe new unit was right next to the new construction which we were told the started at 6am and wouldn't be that much noise... Well I work nightlife. Get home at 4am... They would start at 5 sometimes and let me tell you. It was like they were in my bedroom hammering away. When moved units they hired movers for us, but only gave us 4 hours, so try moving a whole 2 bedroom condo in 4 hours good luck. After the 4 hours was up the movers left, and we were left to do the rest, while the property manger said we needed to return then key and should have been moved out already....\n\nAnd then more fire alarms,\nGarage door downstairs wAs always broken...ugh\n\nThis has to be the longest review I've ever done, and I can actually go on longer. But I hope you can tell it was not a good experience, I'm writing this because I see a bunch of positive review from profiles giving 5 stars with no other reviews on yelp. Which are most likely fake. \n\nI would not recommend this complex to anyone, especially for the amount you'll have to pay monthly. Not worth it! I've attached some photos from the experience I had ones of my flooded doorway and another of them doing construction in the hall way replacing all the pipes...\n\n~B~
