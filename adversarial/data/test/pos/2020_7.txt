While I was on vacation in April 2016, I saw that Mike Tyson was performing at Brad Garrett's Comedy Club and being a boxing fan, I decided to attend.\n\nThey had various ticket options including a meet & greet with pictures of Mike Tyson being the most expensive (which I believe was an extra ~$150 from how much I paid).\n\nThe title of the show \"Mike Tyson - Undisputed Truth\" sounded familiar but since I watched a lot of boxing documentaries on television, I wasn't sure if I had seen this show before. I did in fact see this on an HBO channel about a year ago in Canada. I won't really describe his show beyond saying that it was a combination of his life story with some comedic elements to it (like when he mocked Don King). While I was waiting in line with my ticket, ex-boxing referee Joe Cortez was in front. I managed to snap a picture of him.\n\nGoing into Brad Garrett's Comedy Club, the room is fairly small or medium size so even if you purchased tickets in the back, you were still somewhat close to the action and Mike Tyson talking on stage.\n\nBasically no photographs, videos, or recordings of any type are allowed. There was a guy sitting a few seats away from me who was warned twice for taking pictures of Mike Tyson on stage (or maybe he was taking a short video) with his cellphone.\n\nIn any event, I thought that my experience in Brad Garrett's Comedy Club could have been better. It started with the cocktail waitress (receipt shows her name is Debbie) showing up prior to the show starting but after I was seated and immediately asked me what I wanted to drink. I quickly looked at the price list on the table and decided to get a domestic beer (in a bottle). I believe that it was around ~$7.00 and with tax, probably around $8.00 or so. She asked me if I wanted a tab and since I was only going to have 1 beer, I opted to pay right away. As you can imagine, it was somewhat on the dark side in the comedy club so when she returned with my beer, I gave her a $20 bill which was the smallest bill that I had. I verified the bill twice and made sure that it was a $20. She took the $20 without saying anything and continued to serve the other patrons\/guests at their table. She returned with the other patrons\/guests drinks and did the same thing with the other patrons\/guests within the general area of where I was seated.\n\nSince she didn't say anything to me, I wasn't sure if she realized that I gave her a $20 and the drink was $8. Yes, I know that in Las Vegas tipping is generally \"required\" (or more accurately expected) for everything, I wasn't sure if she thought that I was giving her an outrageous tip of $12 for an already overpriced $8 beer. When she returned after serving some of the other patrons\/guests, I lightly tapped her on the shoulder and said \"Excuse me\". Without me saying anything or mentioning the amount I gave her, she then turned around and snapped \"Yes, I know you gave me a $20 and I'll have your change for you later!\". She could have at least told me that at the beginning when she gave me my beer and I gave her the $20 bill that she would be returning later with my change.\n\nIn any event she returned after Mike Tyson started performing and handed me ~$12. I kept the $10 and was going to hand her the remainder but she turned around and quickly left the area as if she was upset with me lightly tapping her on the shoulder. I left the change on the table.\n\nAfter the show when I left, I looked at my bill for the drink and they AUTOMATICALLY ALREADY ADD AN 18% TIP TO THE BILL. I find the way that they automatically add an 18% tip to the bill underhanded especially in a dark comedy club setting. I'm sure most patrons who left a tip on the table or handed a tip to to their cocktail waitress personally didn't realize that they already tipped. \n\nMy 2 star rating is in no way a review on the Mike Tyson's show\/performance but is the result of what happened with the waitress (name on bill was Debbie) and the automatic 18% tip added to the bill which I felt was underhanded since most people after a few drinks won't look closely at their bill and the dark comedy club setting doesn't help the customer but helps the establishment. For Mike Tyson's performance\/show, I would rate it around 4 stars but I want to mention that I enjoyed watching it on HBO television over seeing it at Brad Garrett's Comedy Club.\n\nDON'T TIP AT THIS PLACE UNLESS YOU ARE EXCEPTIONALLY HAPPY WITH THE SERVICE AND BELIEVE THAT THEY DESERVE MORE THAN AN 18% TIP SINCE THEY ALREADY AUTOMATICALLY ADDED 18% TIP TO YOUR BILL (and you would be just adding to the 18% that you already paid\/gave).\n\nWhile writing this review, I looked at a picture that someone posted and Brad Garrett's Comedy Club does mention in very small print on the bottom of the table price list that an 18% gratuity is automatically added to the bill but just the way that they go about adding the automatic 18% gratuity seems underhanded in my opinion (very small print, dark setting, etc.).
