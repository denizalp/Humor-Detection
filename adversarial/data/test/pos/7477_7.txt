Wow, I just received the following comment from the business manager of this company: \n\n\"I do have to chuckle that you found it necessary to mention you're in Real Estate with multiple properties. We hear this same thing 3-4 times a day trying to get discounting with the promise of servicing their \"other properties\"... I am of the belief that if I do this I am doing my other customers an injustice. \"\n\nWhat's funny is that this never happened. The first part of his comment, regarding the details of the warranty, would have been sufficient explanation. But what a piss poor strategy in responding to a customer complaint, fabricating a story that I asked for a discount. I did no such thing, and my review focused instead on my opinion of this company's actual warranty policy. Now I think even less of Goettl.
