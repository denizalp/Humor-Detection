Another good ice cream spot.  Known for baking a fresh variety of cookies that you could mix and match for making ice cream sandwiches.  There's lots of value in this.  For about $5 you get a huge cookie ice cream sandwich (good enough for 2 people or one really hungry wife).  \n\nApparently on Tuesdays they have a promo called Taco Tuesdays.   Three scoops of ice cream filled in a taco waffle with your choice of optional toppings.\n\nA free cookie with check-in and a purchase as well.  The staff there is very helpful and friendly and they hooked it up with free toppings for the ice cream we bought.
