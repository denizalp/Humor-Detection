Went to see Penelope about a week ago and she was lovely. I'd been to see another psychic not long before but wanted to see how their reading stacked up. Although, they didn't hit the same exact readings, they were in sync on a lot of topics. I felt better talking to Penelope. Whether these readings are true or not is up to you to decide. Faith is based on the unseen and although I don't claim to be a believer 100% I can say visiting Penelope made me feel good and I appreciated any insights she shared.
