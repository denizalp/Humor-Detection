Our bachelorette party then crossed the Boulevard to...Thunder from Down Under. Where we sat in the VIP section, tables slightly angled...and watched the men thunder with their down unders, and drank our 7 & 7s. \n\nIt was exactly what I expected it to be: dancing men with hoops and whips...wait, no that's a circus... well, not too much different. Nice bodies, not-bad faces, and great, great humor. The songs were pop and predictable - but anyone who goes here expecting a surprise and something different than what the program sells, then, my friend you'll be disappointed. \n\nI loved it - I thought it was fun, silly, and a great freaking time. The guys reacted to the genuineness of the smiles and good times, making them give you that in return. \n\nThey know what they're doing - and that's exactly why you should go - they're giving you a good time.
