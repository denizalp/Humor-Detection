The food was OK and it didn't take too long to receive our food order, there wasn't a lot of people in the restaurant area and that was the highlights of our experience. Everything else from rude, not so friendly hostess, to a ok waitress that took our order, brought our food to us, and Never checked back with us to see how we were doing. All of our drinks needed refills and like I said earlier in this review there wasn't a lot of people in the restaurant area. The waitress seemed to like hanging out in the back talking with her coworkers more then serving her customers. Despite this horrible experience at the particular iHOP location, we still ended up giving her a tip for some reason and her attitude when giving tip was with a lot less gratitude then expected. I do not see going back to this IHOP location nor would I recommend anyone going there unless you lower your expectations down next to nothing.
