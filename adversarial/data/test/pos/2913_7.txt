Cool decor, good location and decent food.  That equals an A-OK in my book.  This place has funky dishes that are unlike anything you will find elsewhere.  I had the cuban sandwich and it was great actually, a little on the dry side but nothing too bad.  \n\nThe decor like a said is cool, but like and ecclectic cool, strange even.  I like that though and it kind of adds to the place.  We sat out on the patio which looked like it may have been under repair because of the loose construction material around.  \n\nService was a little shakey with them forgeting that we need utensils and all around a tad bit slow but it sufficed.  I'll be back probably.
