Another revolving sushi bar in town! I like those because there is the possibility of trying any type of sushi available without breaking the bank. As we walked in, we were greeted by a very nice hostess that ended up being our waiter. We tried just about anything on the menu and walked away full and satisfied. \nWhen visiting sushi revolving places, you have to walk in open minded. These places are like buffet restaurants. Some are very good but not top places. I will definitely return to Big Sushi.
