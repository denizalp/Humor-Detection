There's not a lot I can say about Eco Laundry that hasn't been said, but Lisa E. was spot on about it being the \"Cadillac of Laundromats\".\n\nThis place was NOTHING like the sketchy, muggy  laundromats I frequented during my college years. \n\nWith a variety of machines that can handle washes ranging from one load all the way up to six, you're good to go! \n\nFriendly attendants. \n\nI'll pop in here from time to time to wash and dry our comforter to save us a little time at home. \n\nThey even offer a laundry service at .99 cents per pound. Noticed a lot of families taking advantage of this service; heck, I would too if I weren't so damn particular about my threads! \n\nSuperb people watching. Wi-Fi for when you need to get a little work done. Clean restrooms, consistent air conditioning and easy access to several eateries and a grocery store for that coffee fix - I'll be back again and again!
