After chit chatting with the GF about her desire to play some Bingo, we decided to give it a shot.  I have played any form of Bongo since using lima beans to mark spots in grade school.\n\nSo we show up at the Sunset Station because Yelp says that this is the place to go.  Not knowing what the hell we were supposed to do, the clerk patiently attempted to explain what our options were in buying into the game.  We threw ourselves into it and walked over to a table carrying a bunch of papers with numbers on them.  Next we paid a visit to the dauber vending machine and were ready to play.\n\nWhile waiting for the 3:00 game I rolled up to bar and while they only have domestic beer, I was happy to hear that it was free!\n\nWhen they game kicked off I was absolutely lost in the sauce and feeling a tad frustrated due to my lack of Bingo prowess.  I thought that the experience would go the way of some church Bingo setting but was I wrong.  The games go on and you have to figure it out as you stamp along.\n\nWhen it was all said and done, I was mentally exhausted and covered in dauber ink after playing 13 games in approximately 50 minutes.\n\nBut I learned something............\n\nWho where those people I saw chilling out enjoying their drinks staring at their little black boxes while I freaking out over whether I heard or saw letters and numbers??\n\nThey of whom I speak had paid a little extra for the electronic Bingo option.  This excellent use of technology plays your cards on whatever game happens to be going on at the time.  It will chirp at you when you are one away and sing a little tune when you Bingo.  I don't know what Bingo purist think of the boxes but I did see some HARDCORE Bingo people playing the cards in addition to the Bingo boxes.\n\nSo we stayed for the 5:00 game and though we did not win a damn thing we stared at our boxes all the while holding hands and enjoying our drinks.\n\nNow addicted to Zombie electronic Bingo we stayed for the 7:00 game.  With each start time the room got progressively more crowded.  But even with a packed house it was amazing how quiet the room.  Only the sound of the caller, daubers, chirps and cheer of a winner or winners.\n\nAgain we did not win a damn thing but did get see someone win $18,000.\n\nWith my knowledge of Bingo houses being severely limited, I can only throw down four stars.  With that being said it was a damn fun experience.
