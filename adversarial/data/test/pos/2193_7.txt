Was really expecting to eat some delicious tacos. We stood in line for a good fifteen minutes while I pondered my choices and schemed how I would force the others to get more things that I wanted to steal. But just when we had moved up a bit in line, some worker came around and informed us that our line (which was one out of like fucking five thousand or something) was ONLY for al pastor tacos. That's about the most retarded system I've ever heard of. If you want to try more than one thing, you either have to pick some special super-secret line OR spend a few hours eating tacos while waiting in various lines. I'm not even sure where you pay. We ended up leaving, along with a bunch of other angry drunk people who didn't want to eat only al pastor tacos.
