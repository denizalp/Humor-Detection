Hey, it's Starbucks. The herpes sore is sure to pop up on every street corner of every city in every zip code of North America, right? This location is great because they're open 24 hours a day most days of the week....I think monday and...wednesday they close at 1 for some reason? Do call to confirm. The Wireless Internet is free for 2 hours daily with your Starbucks rewards card, though be mindful not to conduct sensitive business such as banking and whatnot as it is, after all, a public hotspot. I have fond memories of this place because of A) its proximity to the 24-Hr Fitness I used to frequent, perfect for a quick chai hit after a workout and B) it's a convenient after-hours spot, where I can do a bit of extra work on the laptop or read a book while zoning out to tunes before heading home. \n\nThe thing is, I don't usually go here for coffee...it's all about ordering a lite chiffon, getting a vitamin water, bringing an overpriced Dave Matthews CD to the counter....and producing a couple Java Monster Irish green cans and staying for 6 hours. Weird looks from the staff, but hey, I'm a paying customer. \n\nSpeaking of staff....I had some friends visiting from Portland and a shift manager at the time (wearing thick black horn-rimmed glasses, naturally -- the stripper heels of the barista industry) first mispronounced my friend's name and then started to phonetically make fun of her name, to much giggling from the girls at the counter, as he was calling out our order. I stepped up and called him on it in front of the packed house. He quickly apologized and said he didn't mean anything by it. 2 things in this life you don't EVER fuck with: 1) My friends and family 2) the latency of my broadband internet connection.  \n\nOther than that, no big whoop really. Getting worked up over a Starbucks is dangerous, like thinking that she's gonna marry you after the first Reverse Cowgirl. Get over it and move on with life.
