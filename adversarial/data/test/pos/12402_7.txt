BEWARE OF BAGEL FRAUD!\n\nUpdate: I ordered a bagel here one morning before my commute.  After I  hopped on the bus and pulled the bagel out of the bag... *GASP!* it wasn't a Bruegger's bagel!  I guess they ran out and decided to pass off some impoverished grocery store bagels instead.  Even the cream cheese was off.  Very disappointing (and dishonest, in my books).
