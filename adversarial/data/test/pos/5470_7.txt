These carpet cleaners are different from the others since they use a water-based cleaning solution that doesn't have any chemicals. I liked that since we have pets and I don't want them to be exposed to anything toxic. But it was kind of a pain since it took a day to dry so that meant that we couldn't put our furniture back in place that evening (versus the other places like ChemDry where you can put it back immediately). \n\nTechnicians were personable but they did try to do the typical annoying up-sell pitch... trying to get me to do more rooms and put on a \"special stain resistant seal\". I think the cost of carpet cleaning in general is ridiculous so I certainly didn't want to pay any more. Also, with this company you have to move all the furniture yourself (they did warn me ahead of time so that is good) and they give you a 4 hour window so you can't really plan your day since you are sitting around waiting for them all afternoon. They did call before coming but it was just 10 minutes notice. \n\nWhen the carpet dried, it had a weird texture to it. It felt very stiff and not soft on your feet. I have never experienced that with the other chemical-based cleaners. I think the real test is if the trouble spots and stained areas come back after a while as they do with the other cleaners. I may write an update in a couple months and raise it a star if that does not happen.
