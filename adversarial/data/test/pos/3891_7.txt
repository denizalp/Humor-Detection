To say I hang with people who have a sense of irony is an understatement. Hence, our evening out to Loco Leprechaun, the \"Irish Cantina\" in Westlake (in a strip mall, obviously). My friend Bobo and I were tossing ideas of where to meet up back and forth when it popped into my head. I could barely contain my excitement before saying the words \"it's both Mexican AND Irish.\" Stupid and amazing all at the same time. But, we were both hungry and actually wanted food we'd like. Was it a good night to let our love of all things warped guide our decisions? After some quick research I found the cantina's menu and saw it had potential. It was like this weird Mexican\/Irish fusion that took all the foods you love to nibble on when you're drunk and mixed them up. One stand out: Reuben Nachos. \n\nThe actual restaurant felt warehousey and sterile, not like a pub or cantina. It felt more like a storefront in a strip mall with murals of Leprechauns wearing sombreros painted by a Kent Stater busing tables over the summer. We also found little cards on all the tables telling us to \"ice your friends.\" The slogan, accompanied by photos of hambones drinking Smirnoff Ice, had recently entered our world, but we weren't sure exactly what it meant. Luckily, fellow yelper Matt M. arrived to explain it. Basically, hambones make other hambones drink Smirnoff Ice to humiliate each other when in public. Loco Leprechaun is that sort of place. Yeah. \n\nThe food is tasty and seemed fresh. While the atmosphere is void of soul, the food isn't. I dug the tacos with cabbage and the Reuben nachos.
