My husband's uncle suggested this little gem for beers and grub after a Pitt game and was super excited to introduce us young folk to a new place. He loves the spot so much that he asked me to write a Yelp review about it! :)\n\nWe arrived around 4pm but the kitchen doesn't open until 5. No problem - we were having a lazy Saturday and were happy to have a beer or two while we waited. You can tell this is the sort of place where regulars post up at their designated bar stools each night but are still welcoming to new folks. The dark woodwork of the bar and cozy little booths plus the dark green wall color makes the bar feel warm and dark, even on a sunny day. That's exactly the feeling that a good pub should give you, makes ordering that third beer in the afternoon seem a-ok! \n\nThe menu was way larger than I expected, but I decided to keep it simple with a Caesar salad and a side of pierogis. The salad was nice with a garlicky Caesar dressing, fresh greens, homemade croutons, and a sprinkling of delightfully crunchy fried onions. The only addition I would've like would be a few fresh anchovies to add more salty\/briney flavor but I know that is not popular opinion! The pierogies I believe were homemade and I thoroughly enjoyed them. Perhaps most impressive was that one of my very picky dining companions finished every last bite of his Boxty dish and is still singing its praises months later. We will definitely be adding Monteray Pub to our list of go-to places when we are on the north shore for events!
