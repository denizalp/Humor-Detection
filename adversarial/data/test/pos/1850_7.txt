***************************** 1343 ***************************\n\n     With a padded leather ceiling La Scarpa at the Bellagio is tucked away on the way to the pool and the Gallery of Fine Art side, just pass the main guest elevator, to the right. \n\n      It's a small boutique, odd display, and rarely busy. It carries a wide range of American and European designers such as Christian Dior, Cocobelle, Cole Haan, D&G, DVF, Kors, L.A.M.B, Michael Kors, Beverly Feldma, Stuart Weitzman, Twelfth Street and Via Spiga. There's nothing understated about this boutique. \n\n     I've been here a few times that they don't have my size, but this time I got lucky. I got myself a pairs of Beverly Feldman and mom a pairs of MK shoes! \n\n     What I like about it, is the sales selection and you get 15% OFF for being Platinum\/Noir MLife reward members on regular price shoes! And you can just charge it to your room!
