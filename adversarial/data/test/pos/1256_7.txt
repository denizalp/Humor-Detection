LISTEN UP YOU PRIMITIVE SCREWHEADS!\n\nTHIS SHOW IS FOR HARD-CORE FANS ONLY! IF YOU DON'T WORSHIP THE GROUND SAM RAIMI AND BRUCE CAMPBELL WALK ON STAY FAR, FAR AWAY!\n\nWe went to the Dec 15, 2012 11:30 pm show. It took a while to get seated so the show really started around midnight. The foul-mouthed MC who introduced the show really set the tone well for the night. This is for ADULTS only, do not bring kids.\n\nThe theater was only about 1\/5 full, with the front row \"splatter zone\" packed with the die hard fans. They got SOAKED many times during the performance, when they walked out their hair and clothes were drenched with the fake blood (the whole theater smelled of it in the end). We were 2 rows back behind the splatter zone and emerged dry.\n\nOther reviewers have mentioned that the only way to experience this is to sit in the splatter zone and they may be right. I think being high on something may also have helped but we all entered sober.\n\nI really like the Evil Dead franchise but this show just wasn't my cup of tea; it was bearable though only because I like the movies so much. \n\nThe production simply retells Evil Dead 1\/2 with a few lines from Army of Darkness thrown in. Some of the musical numbers were entertaining but overall it wasn't a good use of 2 hours.\n\nThe four friends who came with me all fell asleep at various times. They did not enjoy themselves as none of them are fans of the franchise. This is also partly our fault; we had a long day and were feeling pretty tired going in. We should have gone to an earlier show!\n\nThis show is to musicals as Evil Dead 1 is to the \"Godfather.\" It's cheesy and low budget. If you like really campy, silly shows you'll be in heaven. It tries to be clever at times but usually fails. The actors did put in a lot of effort into their performances, though. They were not \"phoning it in.\"\n\nOther reviewers here have complained about the audio. I could understand most of it, but during musical numbers when the background music was loud and all the singers were singing it became inaudible, but that's not unique to Evil Dead 4D. Many productions crank the volume level so high it becomes deafening; I often can only hear it clearly with earplugs in.
