Mariah Carey is live at the Caesar's Colosseum.\n\nShe sings 18 of her hit songs from beginning to ... well infinity and beyond according to her.\n\nI was expecting lipsync, but she actually sang and sang well.\n\nThey allow smartphones so bring your extra battery charger, clean up your storage and record the whole performance.\n\nIf you are planning to get the bottom floor, please try very hard to get isle seats.  There is a song where Mariah Carey will walk through the isles and the audience goes nuts.
