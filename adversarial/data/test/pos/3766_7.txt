Came here a few times and it's about time I write about it! Each time I have gone the line has been long. The best time to go, so I have heard, is 3am-7am. I once came here at like 8am and waited 30 minutes, another time came after 8:30am and waited like two hours. This time I  went around 9:30pm at night. The line was not moving at all... \n\nWhen we got closer to the front... 2.5 hours later... we realize it was because the chef was going slow. I don't want to be mean, but he was literally moving slow, prepping the food slow, washing the pots slow. It explains why the line was hardly moving. He had two servers helping him. It didnt help that the order before us was a to go order and it was like 12 dishes. I thought you could only order one or two per person but I guess not. When we finally sat down it was like 12. At this time a new chef, Ricardo (I believe, was starting and helped finish up the to go order. A new server also started at the same time, Bob. If it wasn't for Bob and Ricardo, I think it would have not been worth the wait. Bob and Ricardo were entertaining, funny, and easy to talk to. We were the first one who ordered but had to wait because of the to go orders. \n\nWe sat next to the oysters and made small talk with the chef about how big they were and how juicy they look. We instantly regret not getting any oysters to start. The chef laughed at us and was surprised we waited this long and not get any oysters. I guess he noticed our disappointment because before we knew it, he shucked out 5 big oysters (since we were a party of 5) for us. It was a kind gesture that made all of us remembered and want to come back. \n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered the Combo Pan Roast. MUST GET!!!!!!! So delicious! I got a level 4 and it was good, my boyfriend who eats spicier got a 6. I can't even begin to describe the food other than omg. So rich and creamy, and they don't skimp you on the lobster or crab meat. Had to order extra rice because it was so good. They charge you $3.99 for an extra scoop of rice. \n\nGot my bill and realize that they did not charge the people I went with for splitting a dish. I read some yelp reviews that they charge you for splitting. I also ordered two bowls of rice to-go to eat with my left overs and they didn't charge for that or the extra bread! Bob and Ricardo seriously made our night because before that, we were feeling pretty crappy about it - having to wait almost 3 hours in line. It sucks because you cannot even leave the line. All have to take turns. \n\nLong story short, I highly recommend trying this place (actually don't, you'll make the line even longer hahaha). Just be prepare to wait!
