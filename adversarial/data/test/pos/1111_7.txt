Oh. My. Goodness!  \n\nI was invited to this place on a first date.  I didn't know what to expect.  When my date began to explain the menu to me, my first thought was, this is going to be messy.   \n\nThe meat options that interested me were, snow crab, shrimp, fish and king crab.   My date and waitress recommended that I try the trifecta sauce since I was a first timer.  I went with the snow crab (in trifecta sauce) since it was much less expensive than the king crab.  King crab was $30 a lbs!!!  I had the option of adding red potatoes and corn on the cob to the snow crab which I did. \nWhen our food came out, I was surprised that our respective food orders were in tightly sealed plastic bags.  When I opened my bag, the delicious aroma flowed out. Wow!  I opened my bag by foldeding over the sides of the bag.  I looked around the table for my silverware wondering how I was going to eat this delicious smelling food using table etiquette Emily Post would be proud of.  As I was thinking my date said, \"Just put your hand in the bag.\"  Relieved, I put my hand in and grabbed a red potatoe, bit in and unknownly let out a mmmmm. Yes, it was perfect. I then moved on to the corn on the cob.  Equally delicious.   As I was reaching for my snow crab, wondering how I would crack the shell with couth, my date said, \"You have trifecta sauce all over your face.\" Embarrassing!!! He sensed my embarassment and said, \"It's okay. You're really cute making all those noises when you eat.\" Hahaa.  At that point I figured I was safe to really dig in to this crab.  As I dug in, cracking the shell of my crab, sauce and shell pieces flew all over us.  We laughed and enjoyed the drinks and atmosphere of this location.  It was messy despite using the plastic green bibs provided to us.  The food was amazing and filling.  Being an old school gentleman, my date paid for our meal and drinks so I cannot comment on the total pricing of our dinner.  I can say, I will definitely be visiting Angry Crab again!  \n\nFor those of you wondering, yes, there is a second date scheduled!  Score!!
