Big waste of money!!\n\nI decided that for my three year old's birthday I would take him and my other 5 year old son and my 10 year old sister-in-law to skyzone for a fun time....there was nothing fun about it.  My three year old is extremely energetic and I thought he would have a blast. When you first walk in you think \"wow, this is amazing\" until you actually get started. I decided to pre buy my tickets so that we wouldn't have to wait for a jump time and sign my waiver before hand so that it would take less time to get right into the jumping. This made no difference because all the staff move at the same pace........ Extremely slow. They also forget to mention that you then need to buy special socks. For one adult and three kids to jump for 90 minutes, it cost about $90. Which i was fine with paying, until we actually started jumping and I realize what I was actually paying for! \n\n** IF YOU HAVE KIDS YOU NEED TO READ THIS**\n\nSo here I am thinking that we are all going to have a fun family day filled with jumping. What no one tells you when you purchase your ticket is that no one can jump together. My three year old is not allowed to jump in the same section as my 5 year old, and I as an adult am not even allowed to step on the trampoline!!! So as my 5 year old is jumping up and down on a tiny square (because your not allowed to jump around) my three year old has to watch him from across the room while he jumps on his tiny square, while I sit and watch because we are not allowed to play together. The only time they are allowed to be together is the foam pit. That's another issue. They make out like they have this amazing foam pit but they don't!! You have to jump down the trampoline all nice and proper and then do a proper jump in the put and then get out and move to the back of the line... My 5 year old who is very optimistic and can find fun in anything, told me this was the most boring day of his life. You are Basically paying for your kids to jump up and down on one spot for over and hour. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY! honestly, my kids have 10 times more fun jumping on their bed.
