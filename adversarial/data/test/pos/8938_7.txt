I've dined here 3 times with family and friends, but the most memorable day I would never forget was on my birthday when my husband (who was my bf that time) surprised me with 12 dozens of roses and cake. Rose petals were spread on our table (sooooo romantic) and we had an amazing view facing Bellagio fountain. We enjoyed the food and the exceptional and outstanding service we've received! Kudos for my hubby for setting this up! :)\n\nWe had an amazing experience! :)
