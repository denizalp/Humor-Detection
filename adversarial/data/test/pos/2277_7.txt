I would leave a double zero negative review if I could. \nMy ex husband and I did some preliminary testing with our 10yr old son at Attention Center. They put you into an immediate whirl wind of test after test and they want literally thousands of dollars on the spot. \nWe had two appointments, a week later received phone calls saying we missed our testing appointment and that we were going to be charged. That appointment was never made. \nThen I spoke to our pediatrician who had totally different information than Attention Center. \nBottom line, if you want to spend $10,000-$20,000 then go there. Not worth it. Stick with a true medical diagnosis.
