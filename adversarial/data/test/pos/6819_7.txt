Mordern Art = I could do that +  Yeah, but you didn't. \n\nin my opinion.\n\nI'm not a fan of modern art, but I am a fan of this museum because they routinely bring in artists that my friends tell me are exciting and I love that the Mattress Factory is located in the middle of the North Side.\n\nI hate modern art, but I enjoy hating the modern art at the Mattress Factory.
