This is gonna be a short review. I guess I like this park a lot because it's my usual place to come to do sprints and various conditioning exercises. It's located right next to the Lone Mountain Trail, and across the street from a Metro Police Station. It is the in the Summerlin\/NW area so it's a little more of an upscale area than most. The best thing about this park is that they have a staircase that has about 106 steps(I counted them the other night). There is nothing more difficult than doing sprints up this endless staircase. I really recommend this place to anyone who get's sick of the gym from time to time.
