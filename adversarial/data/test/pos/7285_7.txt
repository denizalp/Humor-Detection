WE SAW ROACHES!!!!!!!!!!!!Health Dept needs to inspect this place!!!  My daughter and I have gotten food from here many, many times before. Side-note: someone stated that it is formerly Jimmy's. NO It isn't. Jimmy's had two spots one at Cheyenne & MLK which was in the back of the plaza and the other smaller store at MLK & Washington. Anyway On last Sunday we went to get something for lunch, the line was long and when we finally get to the top of the line we were looking to see what sides the had when all of a sudden a medium size COCKROACH CRAWLED over the counter where the food was and then crawled down the wall where the people were standing. I grabbed my child and left the store. Use caution with bugs when u see one there are always more.
