I may not have eaten at too many gourmet Italian restaurants so far, but this one is definitely great.\n\nGaetano's Ristorante is a dinner-only Henderson spot that claims to cook homestyle food with fresh ingredients. It also seems to offer discounts through websites regularly, and I took advantage of the $20 for $40 Groupon today shortly after they opened for service. Fortunately, I had just arrived from work and was dressed reasonably well - otherwise, the tablecloth atmosphere and vest-wearing employees might have made me feel a little uncomfortable.\n\nThe softly played music, which included some notable Italian tunes, opera songs, and Buble hits, helped me to relax more, as did the dim lighting (which did hinder some of my activities though) and the friendly service by the waiter, the bread server, the water server, and others. The waiter presented just the dinner menu, as I requested, and left me time to think about my options before coming back to rattle off the daily specials (and their ingredients) from memory. I'd been considering various dishes, but seeing the option for the Risotto of the Day on the menu, I inquired about that as well. After hearing his description, I ordered it as well as an appetizer.\n\nThe complimentary bread basket came out first, along with a bowl of olive oil with vinegar. This alone was enough to win me over because those carbs were so delicious. The long, triangular sesame cracker was crispy but had some body to it, and it also doubled as a second utensil at times later in my meal. The tomato focaccia had a rather moist chew and was delightful. My favorite, however, was the ciabatta. Crunchy on the outside and with a long-lasting chew (that wasn't moist) in the center, this bread served as both appetizer and dessert after I asked for more later in the meal. I could hardly get enough ciabatta, and I'll be hungry for more gluten next time.\n\nThe beef carpaccio came out next. True to its its flowery Italian name, the \"carpaccio con arugula e parmigiano\" ($14.95) had a full layer of thinly sliced raw beef tenderloin on the bottom, with a good portion of arugula on top of that and coarsely shaved Parmesan cheese above. It also had a light drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and some pepper flakes (to the server's liking, not necessarily mine). I loved the tender beef and the light bitterness of the arugula, and the cheese was surprisingly plentiful. I could see more of this in my future.\n\nFinally, the Risotto of the Day ($28.95) arrived. The server described it, once again, as a risotto with bay scallops, shiitake mushroom, parsley, and truffle oil. It was very rich and creamy, and it would have been piping hot if any steam had actually been able to rise from the plate. Be careful and save your tongues with this one! I don't typically like the bay scallop as compared to the sea scallop, but its meatiness worked well enough here, and the mushroom's contribution was felt throughout. My main issue, albeit a minor one, was that the rather large pieces of parsley required too much manipulation. They should just chop it up and mix it in for you so that you can also avoid getting a huge hit of parsley if you're a bit clumsy with your cutting.\n\nI'd already mentioned my Groupon at the start of the meal, so the waiter simply brought pen and paper over at the end of the meal to record my voucher number for input at the register. The check came shortly afterward, with the promotional value having been deducted from the subtotal. They did print a list of suggested gratuity amounts based on the original subtotal, which I much appreciated because that's how I learned it. (For the record, I tipped the 20% from the pre-Groupon price.)\n\nAfter this meal, I'm excited to come back to Gaetano's in the future to try more entrees. Several of the pasta dishes sounded enticing, and I'd originally planned to try the veal chop before I was lured away. This already seems like a great Italian restaurant to me, and hopefully I'll upgrade that positive praise next time.
