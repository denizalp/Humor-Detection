I haven't rent a car with Budget in ages. Costco had the best price on Budget so I've decided to book it. \n\nWhen I got to the Budget area, I've noticed there was no kiosk machine to check in to get a car. Which I'm used to for past several years now. Instead we had to wait in a line. Luckily they did have a separate line for Costco members. \n\nThe counter person was nice and informed us that we need to provide gas receipt if we're brining it full tank. Huh? He claims that people are dishonest and put water. Really? We did just that but upon returning the checker didn't care to take a look at receipt. Are you kidding? We insisted on giving it to him. But he didn't want it. \n\nWe were used to picking out a car at the lot with other rental companies. It's actually fun to pick out and look inside before choosing one. So, now we know. I'm not sure all Budgets are doing their business this way.
