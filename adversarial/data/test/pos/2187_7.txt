I believe in this spot! This physical location in Solon is tough - it has seen several restaurants over the past few years.\n\nPros:\n+ Pretty decor. Very inviting!\n+ They're on OpenTable if you want to make a reservation ahead of time.\n+ They seem to have a cute patio if you're looking to enjoy a drink outside.\n+ Well-made drinks! A good bartender is hard to find around this area.\n\nCons:\n+ All around us at other tables, their was confusion that guests wanted salad or appetizers BEFORE their entrees. Luckily, I caught our server to double check ours would come beforehand. She had time to correct it, but I thought that was odd.\n+ What is the ambiance goal here? For an Italian restaurant, the Spanish music playing was distracting (at some point it did switch over to English, and don't get me wrong, that \"Havana ooh-na-na\" song is catchy, but misplaced here.) Its also really loud.\n+ Salt overload on our dishes (especially the chicken marsala). No one came buy to ask how dinner was, and we had already waited for so long and were on a time crunch, so sigh.\n+ I agree with Cin P. that the rolls are odd. They give you a GIANT plate for one small roll that comes in a large paper bag which they tear off in front of you. Makes me sad to think of all the paper wasted.\n+ Amidst all this pretty decor are giant, plastic red cups that seem more fitted for a fast food joint.\n+ Strange layout. We were sat at a high-top table. These tables are way too close to the bar (where the servers also use as a path), and literally every single person that walked by hit my seat or shook the table. It was really uncomfortable.\n\nI'm sad to give any place ever less than 3 stars, but I think these are things that can be corrected. Sadly, I left with no impression of Rose Italian Kitchen, especially for spending $75+ on dinner for two. But know I believe in you, Rose. I would look forward to coming *one* more time to see if it improves but I won't be rushing back.
