Came here for drinks and dessert for 9:15 reservation on Christmas Eve. Made the reservation the day of and didn't wait long at all like I see a few other reviewers had to. \n\n*Ambiance: Mystical and charming with blue toned lights, bright paintings and art surrounding the walls, plush booths, and fantastic piano and live singing. When you walked in, almost felt like you were going through the rabbit hole as the reception area is so quiet.\n\n*Drinks: Moscow Mule, R.R.L. Old Fashioned and a Widows Kiss.\nAll the drinks were good and not too strong, but too much ice for your buck so it seemed like we would finish in a couple sips. Best drink was the Widow's Kiss - sweet yet has a bite with the Brandy.\n \n*Dessert: Chocolate Terrarium \nBeautiful representation like the forbidden rose in Beauty and the Beast!! Everything in the terrarium was edible and was tasty! However, I thought there was a big imbalance of the components. There is so much soil and is rather dry but not enough of the hazelnut ice cream or chocolate pudding to pair it with. There was also some marshmallow component that was delicious but again so little of it. We ended up finishing with about half the dessert left over and for $35, we felt it was wasteful.\n\n*Service: When our waiter found out we were just ordering drinks and dessert, he got very passive aggressive. Almost immediately after we ordered he was pretty snarky and then within 30 seconds we had servers crowding around our table taking away our silverware and plates. Started the vibe on a bad note and then he kept pushing us to order more drinks. At least it made for a topic of conversation! Maybe if only want drinks\/dessert, let the hostess in the reservation know.
