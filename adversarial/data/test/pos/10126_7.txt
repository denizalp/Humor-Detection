Came in on a Saturday for lunch, the place was packed! what a beautiful setting, I felt like I was back in California. Very open and windows everywhere!\nSat at the bar, with the bartender Mary. Wow what a sweetie. She was truly on her game. \nMy bf and I split a few apps. We had the hummus and duck tacos. Mary even had the chef prepare slices of the gluten free crust so I would have something other then veggies to dip. And the duck tacos, I could eat these everyday they are so good.\nGrilled duck, with cilantro, tomatoes, fetta and some type of cilantro sauce. Theyre amazing.\nWe will def be coming back here soon.
