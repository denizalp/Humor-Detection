Came here for brunch with few friends on a Sunday. Wait was a little too long for me but this place isn't really a big place and when people come for coffee they usually like to sit and talk for a while. \n\nThe caffeine was awesome. Nice selection. I decided on a Nutella latte which was pretty delicious. I really wanted to try the lavender latte but I thought that might be a little too daring for me. \n\nAs for food, I decided on the Arepa Benny. It's like Benedict. It was good but it really wasn't mind blowing. My friend did order one of their specials for the day.. I think it was called Mashed Yucca but don't quote me on it. That was probably one of the best things ever. My other friend got the empanada sampler which was alright nothing too special. \n\nBoth my friends got a Cordadito which was VERY strong. That may be a little too much caffeine for me and I took just 1 sip. \n\nOverall, the vibe is very hipster. The location is in the art district which to me is very hipster as well. The staff are nice. I probably won't be returning just because there wasn't really anything special on the menu that I would want to come back for. None the less, I didn't have a bad meal.
