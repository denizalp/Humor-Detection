Oh my poor tummy.. why oh why did I do this to myself?! The name of this place should have been called PooPoo's!! All 3 of us were pretty sick the morning after.. it wasn't pretty let me assure you! \n\nThe service here is great! Very friendly and fast.. the food well.. was hit and miss. The rolled quesadilla was pretty tasty.. a huge flour tortillas rolled with steak, peppers and cheese.. oh delish! Was thinking I would actually come back for this one. Then my red chile burro came.. looked great, nice and big covered in enchilada sauce.. then I took a bite expecting spicy goodness.. was bland and was almost all sauce, next to no meat what-so-ever.. you know how much I love meat! Dave took a bite and whispered to me \"it tastes like cat food\".. he's so wring sometimes and I thought I was crude..\n\nSeemed everyone here was ordering fajita's.. if I ever go here again (very unlikely, bad tummy sickness and way far) I would try those.. the smell was fantastic!!
