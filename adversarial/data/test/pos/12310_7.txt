I cancelled Direct TV over 2 weeks ago. I was done getting ripped off for these past years.\nWeeks later, I have yet to revive the last bill or the boxes they indicated I would receive\nI called Customer service, only to her someone in a different country who just continued to talk over me and not listen to my question.\nHe proceeded to tell me the account was in cancellation process and wouldn't be cancelled u till the final bill is paid. Mind you, I have never been late and haven't received a bill to even pay! \nHe said I'll continue to be billed Beyond the 7th until I pay a bill that's not even ready for them to confirm I owe! \nClearly, the intent of this behavior is attempt to collect as much money as they can from me. Absolute disgusting business practices! Deceitful contracts and customer service from people who do not speak good English and are capable of customer service!\nSAY NO TO CABLE! SAY NO TO DIRECT TV! Calling the BBB next!
