This review is ONLY based on their spicy thai wrap.\n\nEven though I go to VH! 3-5 times a week, I'm always in a rush and never have time to kill at Fresh Mama...... and well, lets face it, I always want something meaty or some ice cream after classes.\n\nAnyways, the boyfriend and I were done with a class and had time to kill before another class. We decided to try Fresh Mama. Shockingly, it was the BF's 1st time there, too; despite going to VH! for almost 2 years.\n\nI got the spicy thai wrap with \"bit-o-smoke\" dressing\/sauce. It. was. amazing! \nEspecially with their \"bacon bits\" which are dried spicy eggplant. In fact, I think I like this bacon more than the real bacon. It was crazy that it wasn't meat....it was crunchy and smoking like real bacon... but, without the guilt of fatness.\n\n\nExcited to have my roomies\/friends eat here as they're vegan\/vegetarian respectively.
