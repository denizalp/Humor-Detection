Why does one spend 5.95 on a piece of cardboard with glitter, a few words, and pretty pictures on them? This is one of the biggest scams out there. I think Hallmark invents holidays to sell more cards. Really?  Boss's Day cards? You can go to Dollar Tree and get 2 very similar cards with pretty pictures on them, some glitter and nice wording for a buck. After all, more than likely, the person receiving the card is going to look at it and toss it in the trash container. Big waste of money. \n\nThis store has tons of collectables, candy, and the Hallmark Christmas ornaments so many of my relatives collect. I admit freely, I do buy myself the yearly Star Trek starship they offer each year, not here though, i buy it after Christmas on Amazon at a greatly reduced price.
