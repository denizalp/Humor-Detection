DOWNTOWN SUMMERLIN'S PANDA\n\n   My brother and I had been walking about a mile from Red Rock Resort to Sahara Avenue exploring the new star of Las Vegas : Downtown Summerlin. In the days before the restaurants open in downtown Summerlin for the Christmas season, there are a few choices as of November 4, 2014. Exploring  the southern quadrant of Downtown Summerlin where it abandons the unique pedestrian oriented streetscapes north of Dillard's for an ordinary auto oriented shopping center, my brother and I were hungry and we wanted to eat now. With Red Robin opening in a week, there were a few choices that included Five Guys and a hero place. We decided on Panda Express. \n\n  In Panda style, the service was good. In reality the service was better than a couple of full service restaurants I reviewed. When I say good service, I state that the employees were friendly and helpful. From ordering to paying, I was treated decently. On the other hand Verizon provided bad service. There was an issue with the Verizon signal in Panda Express and downtown Summerlin that affected my Internet experience. \n\n  The major flaw with Panda Express is that when an entrée is empty, it's display tray changes into an unappetizing display of tin, crumbs, and cooking oil. Some locations are more affected than others. The worst I have seen is the Pecos at Windmill Von's location. This location is moderately affected by this flaw. I would have preferred to order the egg plant if the majority of the tray wasn't cooking oil. I have always been under the impression that Panda Express corporate needs to develop a sheet or blanket to cover the tray when it is more cooking oil than entrée . Of course the panda, who in my opinion is one of the coolest fast food mascots, would adorn the cover sheet or blanket. \n\n  Fortunately a fair amount of the entrées were presented nicely. I ordered a two entrée combo with string beans and chicken, sesame chicken, fried rice, and chow mein. I appreciate Panda's noodle based chow mein more than some of the local Chinese restaurants in Vegas that include China Go Go. Panda's chili sauce added a burst of flavor to the chicken. With a medium Pepsi beverage, Panda was kind of worth $10 and change. \n\n  What are my chances of returning to the downtown Panda?\n\n    Regardless that Panda Express is good fast food, I doubt I will be returning to this location soon. I am optimistic that several restaurants will be opening in Downtown Summerlin by Christmas. Before or if  I return to this  Panda Express, I would have tried a couple of Downtown Summerlin's restaurants. And Red Robin is on the cue of restaurants that I intend to dine in and Yelp. For now, I depart from the Downtown Summerlin Panda with three stars.
