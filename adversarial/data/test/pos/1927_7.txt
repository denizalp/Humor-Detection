This joint, smack dab in the middle of Korea Town, is not... Korean. But given its American comfort food, which by the way, is super filling and super tasty, it has it's own bold appeal that warrants another visit from myself, just as soon as I finish my left overs!\n\nEvery thing I ate in this kitchen was really good. The service is kind, informative and tends to you as they should. The atmosphere actually felt slightly less casual than I expected. Maybe it's due to the darker painted walls or choice of furnishings, but it felt colder than I imagined it to be? Not a problem, just a note.\n\nI ordered the half fried chicken meal, thinking that I was a 'real' man for ordering such a massive dish. But man-alive, it was a five piece fried chicken bonanza! \nComplete with deliciously buttered biscuits and fresh cut fries. The chicken was flavorful, crispy, tender and juicy all at once.  Definitely hits the fried chicken spot and is ironically sitting across a KFC. \n\nI also tried their homemade chips, which were crispy, crunchy sheets that were well- spiced and not disappointing. The vegan dish was packed with amazing flavor and  textures as well. I'd be happy to order any of the dishes on the menu. All sounds great, and from what I had, are also delicious! \n\nOverall, I'd return for their food! It's portioned well, prices are reasonable and service was attentive. Great date spot and also looks really idea for a brunch.
