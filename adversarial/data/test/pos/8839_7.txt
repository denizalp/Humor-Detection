Uh oh, looks like the \"Me! Me! Me!\" crowd got bruised. Sensitive flowers those ones are. Anyway, I can only balance their tears and venom with the true story of my couple visits (I live on the west side), which were absolutely fine. Good selection of bar food classics with an upscale twist, plenty of booze, friendly service. Quality businesses like this are what make communities livable, they'll be here for along time.
