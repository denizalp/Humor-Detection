A friend  and I walked past here last night on our way to and from the Moonlite Cafe.\n\nAgain, I felt like I was in the Strip!\n\nThey were cookin' tamales and tacos outside! And they smelled SOOOO good. \n\nWe ALMOST cancelled our plans. \n\nWe also stopped in, said hello the second time around, and found that they are nice, appreciative folks. Get to know them.
