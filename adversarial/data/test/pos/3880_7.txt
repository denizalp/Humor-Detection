Went here to watch the Heat game last night and it was surprisingly empty- there was maybe 10 other people in the whole place- I don't know if this location is struggling or what but I assumed we would have to wait for 45 minutes to get a table during play off games. \n\nNow, I have been to Bw3 before, so I knew what I was getting myself into: mediocre but cheap food and wings, but a million TVs\/cheap drinks. If that tradeoff doesn't seem like what you are looking for you probably want to go elsewhere. \n\nI will say that the TV situation was a little out of control. 90% of the TV's were showing hockey (bleh) or baseball (boring) which I didn't even know were still sports. The sound was also on the hockey play by play which is super interesting except the exact opposite. \n\nThe service was good- drink refills were brought in a timely fashion.
