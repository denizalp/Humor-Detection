I'm going to begin my review by doing something I rarely if ever have done... by defending the honor of a true professional and wonderful lady. I was shocked and appalled when I read many of the reviews posted here about Wavelengths Hair studio and later in my review I will address these concerns in greater detail but first my experience at this salon\n\nI recently decided to make the change and go with fusion extensions instead of having to clip in my extensions every time I needed long hair, which turns out to be a lot with the work that I do.\nSo I began to research my options both online and by phone; believe me I spent much time gathering info and comparing salons but Joice stood out immediately as she was one of the only ones who would quote prices on the phone and  the only one who provided a variety of options, catering towards quality but affordability. I called back many times with a barrage of questions which she answered politely and efficiently with a keen understanding of the care and consideration something like this takes.\nI eventually decided to go with one of the options she presented me with, which was to go buy my own hair (which would work out cheaper) and she would apply it. She quoted me a very affordable price and was accommodating schedule-wise so I set my appointment.\n\nThe salon itself is located on a little side street called Irwin with surprisingly ample parking as there is street parking and underground public parking just up the street. Small but tidy and quaint this is a full service hair salon with the specialty in Hair Extensions. As soon as I walked in I recognized not only the voice but the generally warm and friendly vibe I got from speaking with Joice on the phone. \nI came in with a bang, almost knocking over a mirror and chair in my clumsiness but she was her bubbly and accommodating self and made me feel right at home.\nShe explained to me the process and some info about care, maintenance ect.. but as she proceeded she noticed I had bought pre-bonded keratin packs, which she informed me wouldn't be the ideal option so she went with a shank method that was MUCH more expensive but because she quoted me a certain price on the phone she actually honored that. I was SHOCKED! Not only that but she really knew her craft and how to work the best she could with the materials provided. Throughout it all she was conscious of price and quality even making the move to space out my extensions because I had only bought 100g though she made it look full and natural. My hairstylist even went out of her way to compliment the job and I have trusted her opinion for a while now as she has saved my hair many a time from silly dye jobs and wacky cement hair styles. Joice even gave me a clip in highlight cause I was asking about pink highlights, really the generosity was incredible!\n\nThe whole procedure was no more then 2hrs in total, prob not even that and it was a pleasure to sit and chat with such a kindred spirit like Joice so the time passes by even quicker. After it was done I couldn't get over the feeling of the hair  it was amazing! So light and natural looking... blended perfectly and was literally invisible even with my hair up . The salon itself also offers a fantastic incentive for referral too, any guest you refer gives you 15% off your next visit now I have never heard of that before. She also gave me a very reasonable deal to remove them when it comes time and if I do choose to get them redone it will DEFINITELY be here!!\n\nNow I have never done this before but feel compelled to call out the two resoundingly negative reviews I have read here because I feel Yelp is a place for people to find TRUTHFUL, HELPFUL and HONEST reviews not petty, childish attacks at a business and persons reputation. These businesses are run by human beings that deserve the respect of decency and making personal attacks publicly and using yelp to slander or berate someone is not what this site is intended for. We as reviewers have an obligation to not only be truthful and respectful but be mindful of the consequences of  our words as these are peoples livelihoods we are affecting after all. So if your going to leave such a negative review\/rating be sure to give ample reason and try to remain objective.
