Restaurants all over the place throw around the words \"wagyu\" and \"Kobe\" these days and it confuses consumers.  It gives the false idea that some rural farmer in Japan prepared this majestic, gently massaged, beer-fed cow specifically for their plate.  Because of the lack of uniform rules on beef labeling, this happens regularly with zero repercussions to them.  They can say anything they want!  You think video poker bars in Vegas really have authentic wagyu beef in the form of sliders ready to be served at 2am for $10?  It's a name that catches the eye and allows them to charge more.  Just like \"super white tuna\".  \n\nAmerican tastes have come a long way from when lean meats were king.  They currently take a backseat to pork belly, the \"more white than red\" beef and even chicken thigh.  I didn't ask about the origins of Goong's product, or if they had any concrete proof that it was truly wagyu, but their quality is clearly a step above the standard Vegas KBBQ and that makes it worth going to in my book.  \n\nTo shorten time perusing the menu for our party of 5, the Goong special at $145 was the easiest way to sample it all.  This included a nice selection from pork jowl to prime flat iron to wagyu top sirloin.  The ribeye and short rib were my personal favorites and met all my criteria for great grilled beef, which is FJT (fatty, juicy, tender).  I enjoy a little blood, so no piece stayed on the grill for long.\n\nI am normally not very sensitive about service (perhaps all those Chinese restaurants I went to growing up dulled my senses), but the rushed, stop-go service left something to be desired.  I'd prefer the servers either put the meat on the grill and see it through to its completion, or leave us alone to do it all.  There was one point where a gentleman placed a nice looking piece over the fire, asked my friend if she liked her beef cooked \"medium\", she responded \"yes\" and then he proceeded to walk away from the table!  What did that mean? Was he coming back to flip it or leaving that up to us?  Should we just put more on the grill when we're done?  They make such an effort to present the meat so royally with the thick, uniform, labeled cuts in a classy and quiet dining atmosphere; it's a shame that this was the problem.  They were also more reactive than proactive when it came to refilling banchan as we always had to ask about getting something instead of them noticing the empty bowl and asking if we wanted more.  That's all fixable though.      \n\nConstantly losing track of which cuts were being eaten, which I blame on attempting to be social (ha), made some of the meat feel a little less special.  \"Wait.  What cut is this again?\" was said numerous times.  Maybe I need flashing lights that say the name of the meat.  Regardless, I'll be back here to satisfy my fix of good marbled beef. 3.6511111 stars.
