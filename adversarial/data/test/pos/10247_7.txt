Umm ya this place is open late enough that you can have dinner and go here for dessert instead.  What?  Ice cream you say?  On a what?  This place has enough irons to heat the place on a cold day perhaps...\n\nIrons to make cones, waffles, and yes they have the capability to make sundaes with toppings, banana splits and all sort of ice cream goodies.\n\nAfter a meal that didn't necessarily fill me up I who almost never eats dessert had one.  I don't count ice cream as dessert that's just me.  It's like breathing and I can inhale it because it's just too good to pass up and not optimize your stomach space to not make room for.\n\nI went with a sundae.  I wanted caramel and nuts and I went with an ice cream that would be appropriate so I chose chocolate peanut butter.  The sundae was 2.5 scoops packed into a tall see through plastic cup topped with caramel and a bit of whipped cream.  I didn't want that much whipped cream so I asked to go light.  They added a cute tiny Oreo to top it... much sexier than a cherry IMO.  \n\nThe spoon was small and hard to reach near the bottom of the cup.  The ice cream was dark and rich but it didn't seem to have too much peanut butter in it.  I was sort of expecting chunks but didn't necessarily get that.  The peanuts topped up compensated though.  It was a great sundae overall so I'm not going to complain.\n\nThe place has a wonderful old parlor feel that is both nostalgic and functional while matching exactly what this place is so you get what you see and vice versa.  It's comfortable inside to stay and have your treat and it's lit up like a lighthouse in a storm giving off the vibe that ya, you want to come in here don't you?  I did. I did enter the doors and it was a sweet treat and pleasure to make your acquaintance.
