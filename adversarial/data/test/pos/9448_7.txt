Okay, Stratta is a huge fail, but allow me to explain\n\nFOOD: 3-3.5\nPRICE: 1\nPORTION: 0\nDECOR: 2.5\nSERVICE: 3.5\n\nFor the record, the food isn't too bad. It's actually pretty good. But when you take into consideration the portion and the pricing, it's a HUGE fail. We came here because it was the only decent place open that didn't require reservations. Even with our already low standards, this place failed to make us happy. I got the goat cheese salad and my bf got the veal. Okay, I have to admit, I thought the goat cheese salad was YUMMY. It was warm, slightly sweet and really made me happy. However, it was LITERALLY, maybe 4 bites big. Wtf? Prisoners get bigger rations than that. For $12, I would like more than just 4 bites. My bf's veal was a big fat fail. Not only was it tiny, it wasn't even that good (although the sauce that it came with was pretty good), definitely not worth the $35 for 5 bites. And charging us $9 for 3 pieces of asparagus? What the hell. Even higher-rated restaurants give bigger portions AND better quality. \n\nService was okay, our waiter was pretty nice but he was also pretty busy so it was hard to get a hold of him. Decor is nice but it isn't anything special. It's just a clean look.\n\nPlease don't come here. I know it's convenient because it's open really late and it's right there, but it's still a big fail to me. The only reason why it got a 2 instead of a 1 is because I really liked my 4-bites salad but the portion and prices really make it a zero.
