Talk about getting my butt whooped on my first class. My endurance was shot. My arms were tired. More huffing and puffing than punching and kicking on my part.\n\nThe trainers (Lindsay, Katrina, Candace) constantly encourage you to work up that sweat and keep up your own pace. The routine's switched up every day, so each class has its unique set of punching and kicking combos and you don't get bored.\n\nTheir weekday schedule consists of a morning class at 9:30 and three evening classes at 4:00, 5:15, and 6:30. They also offer 10:45 class on Saturday mornings. Sunday's the only day they're closed, but everyone needs a rest day right?\n\nYou can get three classes for $20 or five classes for $30 and get a free pair of boxing gloves. After that, you can figure out whether you'd like an unlimited membership or a class card.\n\nAfter four classes, I've been able to last through most of the rounds and taking fewer breaks! There's definitely a noticeable change in my fitness and it's only with an hour of kickboxing a day. One hour. Get on it.
