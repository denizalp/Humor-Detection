This place is so bad, it actually becomes awesome. Oh yeah. This out-of-the-way (so far from my side of town) establishment provides some serious people-watching.\n\nI got a teeny bit excited when I heard the words \"country\" and \"line dancing\". I may be all J.Crew and Smashing Pumpkins, but I do enjoy a night of country and line dancing once in a great while (and by great while, I do mean like twice a decade).\n\nHowever, upon entering (and after paying the $3 entry fee), I didn't hear any country music. Sure, I saw some denim booty shorts, cowboy boots, and cowboy hats, but it all ended there. Nickelback is definitely not country. But hey, I guess it is low-class and redneck, so it worked for this place. Yeah, I just said that.\n\nThe place was pretty packed and full of energy. And hey, there's a mirrorball armadillo hanging over the dance floor! After getting a $2 Bud, it was discovered that the best place to saddle up was a table alongside the dance floor.\n\nAhh, the dance floor. So much awesome all at once. So many things going on and so many people to ogle. And I don't ogle in the \"he\/she is so hot way\". I mean ogle in the \"holy crap, are they really doing that\" way. Yeah. Oh yeah. There was dirrty (yep, two \"r\"s) dancing, solo dancing, woo girl dancing, hook-up dancing, and some serious \"OMG\" dancing. It was quite hilarious.\n\nAll in all, I would call this a night of some pretty cheap entertainment. And yes, by entertainment, I do mean people-watching.
