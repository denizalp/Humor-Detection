Um-m-m... Was there for 3 times in total: Very inconsistent experience, bordering on very disappointing. For the first couple of times I brought my shoes with me and everything was kind of ok (female employees was taking care of us) - not stellar, but ok. Third time wasn't the charm by any means: the grumpy man at the desk said that \"these shoes are not acceptable\" and when I said that they seemed to work a couple of times before, his reply was \"well, they don't anymore\"... I mean, really? :-\/ Needless to say, that I've never visited since then and not planning to in the future.
