I have always loved El Pollo Loco but this was the first location I have tried in Arizona.  I love that they have many lo carb\/healthy-ish items on the menu.  For lunch I decided to go with the Double Chicken Avocado Salad.  It was pretty good but the ingredients could've been a bit more fresh.  The lettuce wasn't super crispy and the avocado was already starting to brown.  This salad could've been so much better if it had been fresh. There were lots of other healthy items on the menu as well so I'd like to return and try something else when in the area.
