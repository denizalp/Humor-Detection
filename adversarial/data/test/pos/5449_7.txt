This is my favorite place to party in Montreal, as long as I've already had a few drinks in me before I get there! \n\nLa Boom is made up of 3 different rooms. There's the white room, silver room, and club lounge. The white room plays a mix of latin music. The silver always has great DJ's and plays an incredible mix of house, dance, and hip hop. The club lounge plays 80's, house, a little dance, and rock. My favorite room is definitely the silver room. \n\nGenerally, cover is $10 and gives you access to all three rooms. Drinks can be expensive, so if you don't see a drink menu on the bar; just ask for it. If you want a drink not on the menu, ask how much it is. I recall ordering a red bull and vodka from one bartender at $6 and ordered the same thing from a different bartender and it was $10. \n\nIn the silver room, all of the bartenders are fun and super friendly. The staff always seems to have a good time and dances around behind the bar all night. \n\nA cool thing about this bar is the boxes they have on the dance floor that girls are allowed to dance on. Just look out for the occasional falling drunk girl! It happens. \n\nCoat check here is required, but is super secure. It cost $5, but it was nice to not have to worry about packing it around all night. Some coat checks sketch me out, but these girls were great. \n\nThe bathrooms are always clean and plenty of room to check yourself out and reapply lip gloss. :) \n\nYou can catch some talented DJ's at this club and fun theme nights, so check out their website to see what they have going on!
