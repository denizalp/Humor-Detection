1 Word. Yucky.\n\nI guess I have \"high standards\" being from New York, but between the pizza and the grossly overpriced, watery sauced, rubbery \"Chicken Parmigiana\", I don't think I'll be making a return visit to this place.\n\nMediocre service. I've had much better, and in a climate with such fierce competition for the consumer's dollar - I think they should try harder.
