New to NC I've noticed that the majority of the people seem VERY friendly and helpful. I'm not sure what happened to this location, but they clearly didn't get the memo on friendliness or customer service. The lanky employee with glasses was not helpful at all and seemed overwhelmed with hardly anyone in the shop. \n\nTheir menu is very limited and the majority of the food items are gluten free. I asked for an iced coffee hoping it would be sweet and at least drinkable, but it was utterly disgusting! I took one sip and left the entire full glass on the table! \n\nShe had an Affogato which was also horrible! Bad tasting coffee with a scoop of ice cream which should be gelato. We also ordered a slice of their Nutella Cake which surprisingly was edible and not bad. Overall I would NEVER come back, and truthfully have had better coffee at Dunkin Donuts.
