I unfortunately ate here last Thanksgiving. The wait was crazy long... about 2.5 hours. I have to blame my parents for suggesting we eat here. They wanted variety, and while they got that, we also got mediocre food. Going in I knew it wasn't going to be great and my expectations were met with Asian food fitting for Panda Express, flavorless Mexican food, sloppy sushi rolls, bland pasta, and regrettable desserts.\n\nOn the plus side, the turkey was really good.\n\nIf we have to eat out again for a holiday, I'll have to make sure I choose the location. Sorry mom.
