One simple word, PAINFUL! People at Vegas swear this is an awesome show. My boyfriend, his dad and I went and none of us liked it. It's not worth the $60\/$70 you pay. The storyline was not consistent or easy to follow. People who rate this show as 5 star probably get paid to do so. Choose a Cirque show over this, trust me! I could not wait to be out of the show, and I'm not a hard person to please.
