Seize the day and get your hungry self over to Carpe Diem. While Carpe Diem is a little fancy pants to just roll into with jorts and a Dale Jr. tee, make the effort. It's a lovely restaurant- beautifully appointed and as Julia S points out - stellar service and impeccable pacing. \n\nI've taken many of visiting family members here and I've never had anything less than an extraordinary meal. It's not a cheap meal, but it's well priced for the quality and quantity. For two of us with a few courses and a bottle of mid-price wine we usually spend about $120-$150 (including tip). Some of my favorites...\n\nWarm Goat Cheese (salad): I mean, really, it's warm goat cheese over delicious greens with hazelnut crunch. It's so good you basically want to start fist pumping through the restaurant.\n\nCheese Plate: A very generous and tantalizing plate of cheese of the day. As Julia said - the accompaniments make it stellar. \n\nScallops: I've had them so many different ways here I can't even count. One time they had some vanilla essence another atop of risotto. Both times they were out of this world. Cooked and seasoned perfectly. Plus they give you a very generous portion of large scallops. YUM.\n\nDesserts: They special make their desserts daily and I wish I could remember what I've had here. I know I've had some delicious type of creme brulee and something uber chocolately. Regardless, I don't think anyone would be disappointed with their dessert selection!
