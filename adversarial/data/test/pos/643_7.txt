The best way to describe Blanco Tacos without the risk of insult is to say it is a white boys Mexican restaurant. The food was lacking in flavor and very dry. We started with the Nachos con queso with short ribs, and the meat was tasty, but everything was wrong. There was no sauce on it only black beans, chunks of bland cheese pretending to be crema fresca, and a few cubes of avocados. \n\nTwo minutes after the Nachos arrived our entrees were delivered. I ordered the tacos believing if it's in the name of the restaurant they must be good, boy was I wrong. I ordered two traditional carnitas tacos, and one crispy shrimp taco. I had to doctor up both versions by adding tomatillo salsa and limes. The carnitas was very bland and lukewarm. Rubio's had a much better discontinued carnitas taco. The crispy shrimp taco wasn't crispy at all, it tasted like reheated frozen shrimp you buy at a grocery store. It came with pickled onions and Fresno chili, both flavorless. And sadly on the way home the shrimp wanted one last chance at freedom and erupted all over the side of the road. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Green Chili Pork burrito enchilada style (smothered in green sauce, which oddly enough wasn't even green) he wasn't impressed at all with the overall appearance\/taste\/experience. Not to mention, the rice is actually a sweet corn rice mix which they failed to list on the menu, and the Charro beans tasted like dirt. \n\nI gave them One last chance to seduce me by ordering the sopapillas with local honey. Sadly, they were dense and stacked like a dessert jenga, so you have to use your fingers to catch them as they topple over with every try. \n\nIn my opinion I would bypass this restaurant and go to Filibertos, it's honestly much more of a decent Mexican restaurant then Blancos will ever be.
