A little patio with a little waterfall and little birds flitting about.\nA little bit different than your average local mexican, since it's NEW mexican style.\nA little bit of $ for a little more food than I could eat at once.\nA lot is how much I like Gil's food and service.\nA lot is how much effort the proprietor seems to have put into creating a unique, quaint, homey, and comforting menu and atmosphere.\nA lot is how much effort you should put into finding this little gem.
