not great cut, the layers are so choppy and gross I look like a a long haired poodle with rabies. HORRIBLE DYE JOB. I asked for a dirty blonde and they said that my hair would have some reddish undertones, but we would use a special dye to cut them. The dye did not cut them. As she was drying it i pointed out that my hair was orange not blonde and she was like what? you want it lighter and I was like I want it blonde. and she was all confused about what I wanted even though I had shown her a picture of it at the consultation.  It wasn't that I wanted it lighter, it was that I wanted it BLONDE not ORANGE. Anyways she bleached it basically and now its just a botched bleach job. I've been crying for the past 24 hours about it. SOS. i have never been more upset after a hair appointment. :'(. considering shaving my head.\n\nThey had exceptional customer service after my visit. I asked for a refund and they gave it back to my with absolutely no problem and were very nice and understanding.
