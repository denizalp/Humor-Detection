Interesting experience this time at Jinya. I am a local and I came here often but I've never experienced unfriendly service or slow food service till now. The ramen took a long time to come out , we ordered ramen and gyoza combo but they forgot gyoza and it didn't come till 10 minutes after ramen when we are about to finish eating. When we asked the server, she gave us excuse of having a lot of tickets and new chef even tho the place was not  full and busy at 12am. Server was rude and almost slammed my brother's food in front of him. Also after 5 minutes into eating, someone came again to offer us another bowl of ramen which was definitely not ours. You need to get your kitchen and server together. I brought my brother and his wife who came out of town with me this time and I was embarrassed by the service that you provided.
