My husband and I just returned to Toronto following a 23 month trip through Asia & Europe. We spent the bulk of those 2 years in Asia, and spent 5 months in total traveling and eating our way through Vietnam and we both consider Vietnamese food to be one of our favorite types of cuisine. We always said when we returned home that we wouldn't be those annoying people who eat international dishes and then scoff that it's \"so much better in country X\", but... here we are.\n\nWe visited Pho Vietnam last night with my parents to celebrate my dad's birthday. Given that we were going out for a special occasion, I really wish I could say something--anything--good about this place. If forced, I guess the price is reasonable for Toronto? $7 or $8 for a bowl of pho doesn't seem too outrageous for this city.\n\nBut honestly, you're better off just lighting that money on fire rather than eating anything at this restaurant. Between the four of us, we sampled summer rolls (goi cuon), a bowl of rare beef pho, a rice plate (com dia) with grilled pork, shredded pork, steamed egg omelet & fried egg, a vermicelli rice bowl with grilled pork & spring rolls (bun thit nuong cha gio) and a fried noodle dish that was described as Pad Thai. \n\nNothing was remotely authentic whatsoever, and every dish had clearly been modified or watered down for western palates. The closest thing was probably the rolls, which came out with the correct dipping sauce, but unfortunately didn't include fresh mint or any herbs within them as they would always be served in Vietnam. Also, I personally think $10.50 for 4 rolls is insane. The pho came out with just one stalk of basil, and the broth was horribly imbalanced: tasted intensely of cinnamon but nothing else. This is not what pho is supposed to taste like and I've eaten it across the 3000km length of Vietnam. Rice place used the correct rice, but didn't come with nuoc cham sauce, the steamed egg omelet had weird imitation crab in it rather than noodles & pork, and the pork chop (despite looking promising) was utterly flavorless, its marinade clearly comprised predominantly of red food coloring and nothing else; the shredded pork component was good and tasted as it should. The vermicelli bowl, featuring grilled pork, was also bland and didn't involve any fresh herbs. The Pad Thai is obviously not Vietnamese, but certainly wasn't Thai either and tasted like it was using some kind of sweet & sour BBQ sauce.\n\nVietnamese food is supposed to be light & flavorful, which the food at Pho Vietnam most definitely is not. I suppose I would give it a pass for not being 100% authentic if it was at least tasty, but it isn't. Most of the components in every dish were bland and one-note. While we were there, the restaurant was packed, but not with a single Vietnamese person, which I'm not at all surprised to find. It's disappointing that this is either what is considered good Vietnamese food in Toronto, or that so many people seem to think this is good Vietnamese food. I assure you, it is not.\n\nAs others have noted, the service here isn't great. True, the place is busy, but the service is still haphazard and distracted -- we kept needing to ask for more herbs, and we were routinely given incorrect silverware based on our dishes. You never go to a Vietnamese restaurant expecting fantastic service, but this was so disorganized and poor that it certainly couldn't make up for the lackluster food. \n\nI've racked my brains trying to think of a single thing to redeem it, but just can't. Service is poor and the food is insultingly bad, so who cares if it's relatively cheap? The hunt for good Vietnamese food in the GTA continues, because this sure isn't it!
