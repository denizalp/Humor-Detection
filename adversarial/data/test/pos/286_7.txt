Hostess said we could be seated at the high top table.  We didn't want that.  She said we could sit st the bar.  We didn't want that.  I asked her if we could sit at one of the empty tables outside.  She agreed and sat us.  We looked at the menu and realized it was a fixed menu for Easter.  Why didn't the hostess mention that to us?  And then we waited and waited for s server to come.  Nobody came to wait on us after a long wait.  I saw the sanitation score and it was s 91.5!  Nothing was hitting on any cylinder. So, we got up and removed ourselves from this restaurant.  Won't be back.
