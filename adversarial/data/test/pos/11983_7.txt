Probably one of the worst furniture shops ever. I bought a full sized memory foam mattress for about $500. When I received it was way softer than the displayed one that was in the store and I had to go back several times and sales person that help me set that if I paid $120 extra he would give me a queen sized one that had the same firmness as the displayed mattress I received that mattress today in which I paid $600 for and I'm pretty sure it's used. The outside of the mattress is very very firm and it is very mushy in the middle I'm very unhappy
