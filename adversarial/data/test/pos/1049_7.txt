I wish I could give zero stars the Manger melissa must be playing around with everyone else in there I sure heard a lot of talking and jokes but it wasn't funny when after waiting for my order for 25 plus mins someone was sent to the counter to let me know my wings where never dropped they skipped them and forgot. Total joke guess no lunch before I'm late for work today  11\/30\/2016 4:55pm
