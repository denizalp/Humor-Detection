This review is based on my kids' enjoyment, and not of mine. They are 5 and 8 year old boys, and they like anything fast. They have both already experienced a freefall bungee. First of all, they will let your little kid ride anything. My kids rode on the roller coaster, the slingshot ride and just about anything else they want. At six flags, they will have to wait at least another 3 years to ride the kind of stuff they rode here. Anyways, I don't think you could spend more than 5 hours here without getting bored, but for 25 bucks a person, you can't beat the value, especially in Vegas.
