Definitely not my type of event. My brother and I decided to go this year because we got free passes for donating blood in January. I'd never been, and I'm not much of a golf fan but I thought I'd check it out since it was free and to say that I've been. We went on Saturday, which is a super busy day with lots of people. We got there around 11 and stayed until 3:30. The instructions we had indicated that the parking lot was at Scottsdale and the 101, but it was a mile east of that. The shuttle services seemed organized and we were able to walk to it and get on the air conditioned bus. We walked around a bit and plopped ourselves on the hill at the 15th hole (the 16th hole is of course the most popular and the most crowded, the line to get in was long). It was pretty relaxing for the first part, then when the big name players came through, the crowds increased. One of the balls hit a few people, which was the most exciting part of the day (they were fine). \n\nLots of people come to drink, which is why this is not my scene. Plenty of people were loud and obnoxious, so there is people watching to be done. Wear sunscreen and bring your own water bottle. They had free chips which was nice. I wouldn't go back.
