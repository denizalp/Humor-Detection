I just realized that I have not reviewed Amelie's - one of my favorite-est bakeries around.\n\nLet me just tell you about my love affair with this French bakery. \n\n1) They have salted caramel brownies. Yup, you read it correctly. Absolutely delectable salty\/sweet\/chocolately goodness. It will certainly give you a toothache and you'll appreciate it.\n\n2) This place is open 24 hours. Holla! \n\n3) The croissants. Oh momma likes. My personal fave is the strawberry cream cheese, but the chocolate will do in a pinch, too.\n\n4) Great coffee. The kind of coffee that you enjoy outside the states,. No Folgers, here, friends.\n\n5) Free WiFi! Woot!\n\n6) The all around lovely atmosphere. Amelie's is just a cozy, breath of fresh air for me. The perfect spot to park with a laptop or stuff my face with umpteen pastries.\n\nOn a side note, I haven't tried Amelie's lunchy food yet, but I'm looking forward to it. \n\nAmelie's makes me (almost) love the French - it's THAT good.
