I love this gym, relatively speaking though.\n\nThis gym is cheap! \nOnly 4 people are there whenever I used to go there!\nThe poor lighting and the atmosphere felt insanely depressing. \nI specifically went to this gym to simply focus on lifting weights with no wait and no attractive women to distract me.  The last thing I want to do is get a hard-on during a bench press.\n\nKIDDING!\n\nWell, sorta.
