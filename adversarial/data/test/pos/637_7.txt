This place wins the award for...........worst bacon EVER!!! I mean the worst! It's basically like when you are cooking bacon and mess up so badly you throw it out, but instead of throwing it out, they put it on a plate and bring it out for you to eat. \n\nThe rest of the food is not that good, but not as bad as the bacon. It is all pretty basic, I have gone a few times and never left saying I had a great meal. There is one close to where I live, but I'd rather drive the extra few miles to experience a better breakfast.
