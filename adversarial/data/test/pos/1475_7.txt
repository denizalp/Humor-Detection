I know, I know. The general consensus is that TAO sucks. It's way too crowded and overrun with Asians. Even if this may be true, I experienced one of the best nights in Vegas I've ever had here.\n\nWe came because the birthday girl wanted to see Armin van Buuren spin and I'm so glad we did. Yes, the place was pitch black. Yes, the place was ridiculously crowded (I can't tell you how many times we lost our friends or were squished like sardines on the dance floor, pushed up again strangers' sweaty backs).\n\nBut eventually, we found our little niche in some corner between a wall and a table's booth, and danced the night away with our giant light sticks. I'm pretty sure we stayed there dancing for a good 3-4 hours continuously. The table we were dancing next to asked us to join them later in the night, so it was even better dancing on the booths, sipping on free bottled waters and alcohol provided by the generous table!\n\nRealistically speaking, I'm probably never visiting TAO again (majority always votes against), but I'll never forget the amazing night I had there.
