My Audi got some warranty body work done here, and the rep (Fil) was incredibly helpful and honest. The place is huge but doesn't feels like a high-end dealership and not a grimy garage. There was minor flaw in my paint job and these guys fixed in on the spot before I drove off happy. Overall a highly pleasant experience.
