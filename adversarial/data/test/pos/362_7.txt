I sat down with my wife to enjoy dinner and cocktails. At 9:15 while we're in the middle of eating and laughing some bar staff girl comes over and slaps a card on the table and says \"just so you know at 10:00 these tables are reserved and you'll need to be done. Are you fucking kidding me?? I'm drinking call drinks and Clase Azul and you're gonna make me feel like I'm being bounced after I've been here 45 mins??? 2 words.....fuck....off!!! And then the god damn bar manager comes over at 9:30 and says well you don't have to leave right away. Hey!! Eat shit you already walked me and threw a damper on an otherwise enjoyable night. Asshole...........\nThis was my bad experience, now for the good.\nSince the original post I was contacted by the team at El Hefe regarding my concern. They took the post and my rant and used to educate the staff on a better approach to what could quickly become a sensitive issue. I went back last night to get a first hand look and from my first interaction at the front door with Sean through my service and reviewing the changes with the GM (Rob) my son and I had a great dining experience. I sincerely look forward to returning again in October with my wife for some more tasty tequila. They get 5 stars now for addressing a concern and improving upon it.
