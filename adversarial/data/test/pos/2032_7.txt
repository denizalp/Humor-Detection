I mean, it's St-Hubert Express. For a fast food place, it's fine. I hate eating physically in the restaurant because it usually smells like sweat due to the other customers + the smell-absorbant, padded vinyl seats, but I get take out here on my way home all the time. The food and service here are pretty consistent and decently fast. If you're looking for fast food poutine, I'd recommend.
