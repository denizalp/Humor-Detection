Fellow Yelper, Shayna R. and I were wary of coming to Taza recently because we had planned on going for some happy hour drinks at Paladar. Unfortunately, we came when everyone else wanted some happy hour drinks at Paladar and we were absolutely famished. We stumbled (our bodies were shutting down at this point--we needed food!!) down to Taza and debated going in since we were in such a Latin mood, but noticed the $4 martini sign and decided to give it a shot. \n\nWe ended up incredibly thankful that Taza advertised their Thursday special so well! What a crowded blessing in disguise our original plan became!\n\nUnfortunately, we got seated at the quiet, hidden \"date table\" and felt like they were trying to hide us from the other guests--were we that sad and hungry looking?! We ended up moving a table closer to the dining area and bar to feel more like part of the group. \n\nOur waiter, Tom (I think) was perfect! He explained the martinis to us and made sure we knew what the best-sellers were so we could make some educated decisions. I went with the Taza-tini and Shayna had the Mango-tini. Both were good, but mango won when we ordered our second round. The pita you get to start your meal is fabulous. Warm, fluffy and SO good. The dipping oil was good, too, though we didn't know what it was...I still enjoyed it!\n\nWe shared the Lebanese Jibneh (cheese!!!) and it was probably the most delicious thing I've ever tasted. The pomegranate sauce was so good that I regretted letting Tom (seriously, I'm so sorry if that wasn't his name) take the plate; I wanted to soak the rest of it up with some bread. For an entree, we shared the Shawarma Fatteh. The shawarma was some of the best meat I've ever had--it melted in your mouth and was seasoned perfectly. \n\nWe also got to hear and sit right next to the live music! So fun! And the decor was very pretty and didn't strike me as gaudy or tacky, though I really generally don't like the \"garden\" dining seating. \n\nThe only complaint I have is that the entree was incredibly heavy. It was overloaded with chickpeas and pita chips and not as much meat, so we ended up super full and starchy, though that was an improvement upon our state when we arrived. \n\nI really hope they keep up the good food and service, because I *almost* feel ashamed of how quickly Taza won me over.
