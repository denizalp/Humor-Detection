I was a member of this gym when it was Oxygen, and then stayed when it was purchased by Extreme -- ie I have been a member for many years and was being billed month to month.    Last September I moved to the US,  and as part of the move changed my credit cards, including the card getting billed automatically by Extreme. I figured I'd get hit for an extra month's dues, then they would cancel my membership when the payments stopped going through. \n\nBig mistake.  Today (February 7th)  I stopped by the gym to formally cancel and they demanded full payment for all the unpaid dues since September.  They refused to cancel my membership unless I paid up ('the system won't allow us to').  They said they would continue billing me indefinitely until I paid their bill, and said that the bills would go to collection.  \n\nI paid their bill.  I feel like I was shaken down by the mob, and feel like an utter fool -- I should have just walked out.  \n\nYou have choices in this life.  Choose to avoid this gym and when you need to cancel your membership, tread carefully and budget accordingly.
