Meh.  I am just un-enthused about this place.  If you're going to spend your money on breakfast, at least make it a good one and go the Breakfast Club or Chompie's or something.  \n\nFirst Watch seems like THE spot for people over 60.  Every time I've been, I've been the youngest person there by far.  But it's not the clientele that matters, it's the food.  And I really think it's just okay.  Nothing really grabs me and screams \"this is the best damn pancake (or anything) I've ever had.\"  \n\nMy advice:  Skip it and spend your hard earned cash on something else...like booze.
