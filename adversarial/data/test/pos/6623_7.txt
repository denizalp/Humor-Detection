Not sure where to start. The good, the bad, or the ugly so I guess I will simply start at the beginning....\n\nWe drove by this place by accident as my daughter learning to drive and was too nervous to cross a heavily trafficked road.  We ended up taking a right going through a business area and neatly tucked into the corner of a strip mall that can't get much foot traffic let alone car traffic was a place called the Volcano Grille. \n\nThe Bad is the location the Ugly is definitely the decor\/ambience. Its barren at best. Hardly anything save the dangling lights hint at the Japanese culture this restaurant has at its core.\n\nIts late March in Vegas, Its just starting to get warn outside yet this place was easily 90Â° inside. I'm hoping that was by design and a play on the name and not because the store doesn't get enough business to expense air conditioning. We did feel bad for the employees which leads me to the good.\n\nEmployees were nice, knowledgeable about the product and to make suggestions based on our orders. The food was plentiful and tasted amazing but we were disappointed with the lack of shrimp we received in our orders. \n\nWe ordered the large meals and received a total of four shrimp a piece. While that upset us the seasoning they had was killer. I could have eaten another 96 or so more. \n\nThe sauces they had were good but for a place called Volcano Grille you would expect a sauce called magna to blow the top of your head off. It barely scratched my throat. The other hot sauce they had did get my noise tingling and had great flavor but wasn't all that hot.\n\nMy Girlfriend thought their Hot Teriyaki sauce was the best she ever had and wanted me to see if they would sell us a bottle of it (they wouldn't but told me to take as many to-go containers as I wanted home with us).\n\nOur price was shocking and deserves to be on the bad list as well. It was $35.00 and for that price you would expect a well rounded dining experience served on real plates not plastic throw always. If we go back we will definitely take another Yelpers suggestion and go to restaurant. com for a coupon. \n\nWe will also try another location just to see if the heat in the dinning area and poorly designed decor is a theme for this franchise.
