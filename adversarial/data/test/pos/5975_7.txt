Very nice salon with reasonable prices! I had the classic pedicure and enjoyed the fresh fruit plate and a bottled water that they gave me during my appointment. That was a great touch! I also enjoyed a long leg massage that was included with your treatment. \n\nI only wish that they would let you add a tip on your credit card since not everyone carries cash with them. My total was $32 which is a great deal compared to other places I've been to in the area for a pedicure. The salon is very clean, cozy and open which I liked. The cleanliness of a salon says a lot about the place. I will definitely be coming back again soon!!
