Yum. Quiche. Yum.\n\nThat was pretty much my conversation with myself the other day during my lunch at Terrace Cafe. And if you're wondering, yes, it was a one-way conversation. I know you're jealous of my communication skillz.\n\nAnywho, Terrace Cafe, a cute little cafe burrowed in the Piedmont Town Center. Truthfully, when I was seated upstairs and took in their menu for a few minutes, I wasn't wowed by their lunch selections. However, my friendly waitress told me about their lunch specials, including a \"healthy\" slab of quiche baked with feta, house roasted turkey, tomatoes, spinach and onions. This $10 special was served with a substantial side of greens and a generous fresh fruit cup. \n\nUm, YUM. I love quiche in general, but this particular slab (not exaggerating here) was creamy, well made and finished with a tasty crust. It was quite a nice portion for a ten spot, especially for lunch. The turkey was ridiculously good and I was really impressed with the quality of the quiche. \n\nI'd really like to come back and give their breakfast\/brunch a shot as the red velvet waffles were taunting me.
