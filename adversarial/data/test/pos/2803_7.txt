SKIP THE DISHES ORDER - \nSent us everything with pepper sauce (Tamarind chutney is a type of pepper infused sauce) then lied to skip the dishes and said everything has spices\/pepper already in it. Tamarind sauces and chutney can be made without pepper, your store just chooses not to.\nThis was our last order with Radicas. I am disappointed with their unethical behaviour.\nService is indeed horrible and they have no problem lieing.\n***They deleted their nasty response... so I posted a picture of it (I figured they would delete it after embarrassing themselves). The following was my response to their attack and proof of their stupidity.***\nShiva :- We always put the same message and there is never a problem. Learn to read the message people enter, it's there for a reason. The app from skip the dishes forces you to choose an option. We are forced to choose a chutney type (Stated 'forced' for a reason, as we know it's made from pepper. Guess I need to make things VERY clear to you, as the common sense you want others to have, isn't applicable to you. Lol. Note Feburary 11th order pic. You understood that day. Lol. Or how about the March 25th order from UBER EATS. You understood that day too...Lol) and the 2nd option is No pepper\/No sauces. You screwed up, take responsibility for your screw up. That's just common sense and proper business practice. You also lied to skip the dishes and said the items were made with the sauce in it and just lied further on here, so get your story straight.  \nIs it common sense to make something WITH pepper and then give the 2nd option to have no pepper or sauces? Maybe to you, but I don't want your level of common sense...\n** But since you brought up asking first, isn't it the restaurants responsibility to call the customer and clarify when they don't understand the note 'No pepper please'... Common sense once more for a business, just not you. All attitude and no basic sense. But as you can see from the February 11th and the March 25th orders, you understood just fine. Lol\nBravo on embarassing yourself.\nSince you brought this up. High school and middle school are free, you don't need to pay. You would have known that, had you ever attended and would have had a clear ordering menu for skip the dishes and uber to follow... had you had even a middle school education. You wouldn't be so low class (lieing) if you could afford to send yourself to business school, that much is painfully obvious. Lol\nAnd FYI... SKIP THE DISHES noted the issue with their app & the menu and I received a refund a while ago. Lol... The only loss was on your part, looking like a lieing, unprofessional, backside. Lol\nOH! SO YOU ADMIT YOUR MENU OPTIONS OF ONLY 'MILD, MEDIUM AND HOT' MAKE NO SENSE. BRAVO! LOL! So fix your stupid messed up options, it's not rocket science... well maybe for you it is.\nThe food is sitting here because he can't eat it, we even offered to return it to skip the dishes. Again more assumptions and lies.\nOnly thing 'cheap' about this is you refusing to redeliver the items you screwed up on, we never even asked for a refund. We were giving you the chance to redeliver the items made correctly. How Pathetic... lol. You can't even keep track of your lies (I wanted a refund for a free lunch or redelivery...pick one).\nIt's proven for everyone to see, your level of customer service and assumptions, as well as your sad intellectual limitations, if you even ADMIT the options you gave Uber eats and Skip the dishes make no sense, but continue to attack customers who have to use it. Lol *applauds* your level of idiocy is astounding, as well as concerning...\nAnd FYI - Just wondering if your the sad lady at the counter? My friends were just saying you screw up orders even when they place the order at the counter. LOL! You should focus on your customers, multitasking is CLEARLY not your strong suit. Thanks for the entertainment. Laterz and good luck. You should check out a business degree, or in your case middle school... it might make you happier not to be so simple. :)
