Tucked away in a little corner market is a cute little ice cream shop.  When I first moved to Scottsdale, I didn't live very far from here and i could see myself walking over here to have lovely treats and often.\n\nNow, as you look for this place, don't blink, because if you do, you will miss it.  It is not facing Miller Street, but faces the parking lot north of the building.  (I did say tucked away...)  \n\nI am not a person for sweets, but the kids that I took here LOVED it.  The loved the optional toppings, specifically the marshmallow.  I enjoyed the macarons!  They were deliciously sweet and tasty.\n\nReturn FActor: 65%
