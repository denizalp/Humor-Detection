I am 100% ok with paying high prices for a great meal. We had appetizers, the 2.5 lb Rosewood Wagyu ribeye and dessert. None of it was good, in fact the steak was almost gross. Both my boyfriend and I paid for it for hours to come.  Wouldn't recommend. The service and drinks were good. Like flava-flav says, don't believe the hype.
