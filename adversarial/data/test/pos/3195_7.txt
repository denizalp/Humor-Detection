I never even got as far as an appointment with these people, however my experience with their professionalism says it all. \nI booked an appointment 6 weeks in advance. and the hairdresser called the day before to cancel it. Actually they called to both confirm and cancel it the day before. I received the confirmation call but didn't receive the cancellation call until late in the night as I was setting the alarm for the next day. I had rerouted all my calls to voicemail and forgotten to change it back.  According to the message from Roxanne who was supposed to be the person I had my appointment with, \"the front desk person made some mistake in the scheduling and didn't schedule me for the appointment\". \n\nFirst of all, I would like to know  how they know to call me if the appointment was \"not scheduled\". I was a new customer so the only place they should have had my phone number would have been the actual appointment they placed. \n\nSecondly, I had called back  about a week after scheduling this appointment to see if I could also get a color at the same time I had my cut appointment and spoke to Roxanne herself. So she would have looked at the book at that point or else that is their blanket answer to any new customer. I have seen this technique before where a business will not schedule you right away for an appointment so as to appear \"in demand\". I think the latter is the case here. \n\nEither way, it is extremely unprofessional to cancel an appointment made that far in advance  the evening before that appointment. I had to rearrange my work schedule to accommodate this appointment, as I always do when making personal appointments.  I'm not a trophy wife or even a stay at home Mom with a flexible schedule, I am a working professional and my time is valuable and not very flexible. If your business respected my time and me as a potential customer, there would only be three reasons to cancel an appointment that was made that far in advance. You are sick, your family is sick or the whole shop is closed because of some emergency. By the message left, none of those apply. If my schedule had been screwed up, I would have been expected to work it anyway. My bosses reply would have been \"you had six weeks to figure that out\". \nIs there no hair dresser in the state of Arizona who is both professional and skilled?
