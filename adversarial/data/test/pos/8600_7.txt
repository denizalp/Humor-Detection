im not sure if this is the costco i bought paco at or  not. all i know is we went to one costco earlier in the day that did not have paco (new toshiba 499 dollar laptop) (but only mine is paco).   then we went to this costco later. if this helps you guys to figure out which costco it is, here is all i know: \n\n1. the first paco-less costco did not have kosher hot dogs, the one that did have paco did have kosher hot dogs.\n2. the irony in this is that apparently the paco costco that DOES have kosher hot dogs is in the goyshe neighborhood where while the paco- less costco is where all the jews go but cannot eat kosher (most of us eat bacon twice daily so i dont really get the kosher thing) (but i had to hear about the irony of this from my mother 8 times that day)\n\nAnyways, here is the deal. costco rocks. i dont like the requirement to join, but they give to lefty causes, so im a fan. if you know what computer you want, and they happen to have it, this is the place to get it. here is why:\nA. you get a free 2 year warranty\nB. you get a third year FREE if you charge computer on an american express\nC. it is cheaper than best buy or other places.\nD. you can also get amazing white fish salad immediately after purchase.\n\nSo far, I have the healthiest most functional relationship with Paco than I have had with any to date
