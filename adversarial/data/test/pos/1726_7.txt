Great Thai cuisine in a chic atmosphere. We've always enjoyed the service, their number one girl Ink provides. The food tastes wonderful and presentation is beautiful. This is a great place to go that offers a feel of the strip without the drive or tourists. I love the black pepper chicken and drunken noodles. A definite must try.
