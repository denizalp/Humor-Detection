This branch is one of seven or so in Vegas.  There's one much closer to home, but the hairdresser I've been using for years moved to this one, and I followed.\n\nThis place is BIG, modern and comfortable.  So far, I'm a happy customer.  I can't comment on the prices, because I'm being charged what I paid at her former location.  The prices may be up to the individual stylist, since they probably pay rent for their chair.  But the salon probably has a price list for new customers or walk-ins.  I don't ask and I don't tell.
