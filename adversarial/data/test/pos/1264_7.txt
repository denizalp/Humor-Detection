The last several visits the Dr doesn't bother to get here until more than an hour late.\n I used to like it here, but they've slowly going downhill.\n The waiting room is packed lately, where it used to be fine. \n The Drs are all rushed and cranky. I would stop coming here if ins wasn't so hard to cope with.
