***This bar is a hidden gem; located on a high floor in the Mandarin hotel (part of CityCenter), Mandarin Bar features a comfortable and upscale lounge\/lobby seating area where you can order food and drinks as well as enjoy great views of The Strip including Aria, The Cosmopolitan, Paris, and much more; because this hotel does not get major traffic (the Mandarin does not have a casino), it is often surprisingly easy finding an open seat here***\n\nThe Mandarin hotel, like most major hotels on The Strip, offers complimentary self and valet parking.
