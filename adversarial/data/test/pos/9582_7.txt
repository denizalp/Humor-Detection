If I could give this place 0 stars I would but unfortunately I have to give this something!\nTook my son to this barber shop because he needed a hair cut obviously! Walked in to see a bunch of a.a. Dudes sitting around talking loud. No one addressed me when I we walked in. And the atmosphere had me a little nervous but as a single mom I have to take my son to get cut. These men were rude, obnoxious and very hurtful. The whole time they talked subliminally about me. I was going to just walk out and take my son but I sat there and endured the verbal abuse. \nNever the less , the person who cut my son hair looked like he didn't even have a license to cut, like the owner just let him cut on the under! He left patches in my son head and cut him nearly bald! I tipped the guy anyways because he looked like he needed a hot meal! \n\nWill not return ever!!!!! Save your money and go elsewhere! Ghetto and unprofessional !
