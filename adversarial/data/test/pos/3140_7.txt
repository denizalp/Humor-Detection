This place is a disaster. They're trying, but I'm afraid that I just don't have time for them to get it right.  The owner is now smoking a little farther away from the entrance. They have no receipt book, my dog is still wet in some places, is shedding like a maniac and they sprayed her with some cheap scent without my consent. She smells like a 40 dollar whore getting ready for her next john.
