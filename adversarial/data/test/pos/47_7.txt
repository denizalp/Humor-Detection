\"I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind\n\"I'm building a still to slow down the time\"\n\n-----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-------------------\n\nIn A Sentence™\nFinally a Brasilian Jiu-jitsu (BJJ) academy in the Northwest valley with outstanding instruction and upstanding business practices that meet the highest standards of ethics one would expect from an establishment owned and operated by legitimate BJJ black belt.\n\nInstruction\nProfessors Bryan G. and Ronda A. are legitimate black belts promoted to that absurdly difficult and time-consuming rank to achieve (in BJJ) by Mica C., a respected BJJ black belt originally from Brasil. They have both been tested via the crucibles brought by the highest levels of international competition. Both can teach -- creating a game as well as improving where one already exists in the player -- from the greenest novice to the weathered, cauli-eared, crooked nose competitor. Personal anecdote: I have received help from both when at those points in my development, so I can confidently say (write) that they could do this for you as well.\n\nFacility\nMats nearly cover the entire suite -- as it should be -- and there are dressing\/locker rooms and restrooms for each respective sex. I've seen much larger mega-gyms with a similar, same, or even smaller mat space even though they have a company-sized element of students rolling and crashing into each other and on the verge of Dominick Cruzing each other at every practice. Gracie Humaita West Craig has more than enough mat space for everyone training to start standing, which is the way it should be. Their instructors are also cognizant enough of the benefits of this to actually permit that option when rolling (sparring). \n\nCleanliness \nCleaner than any other gym I've been to: fairly vital if seeking to avoid the dreaded staph or very common ringworm. Dressing rooms are clean, restrooms are clean, mats are obviously very clean. Storefront and mirrors serving rolling area are even kept clean.\n\nTourists\nNo tourists here -- naturally -- especially since, you know, it's Northtown (although merely a block to the East from the city limits [Decatur]). Tourists are more than welcome though. The space and instruction here is well more advanced than a gym I came across in Chicago (where tourists were actually not welcomed). I digress. Tourists are welcome at Gracie Humaita West Craig although it may be far from the corridor where the tourists stay.\n\nKids\nGood for kids. Absolutely great for kids. The kids programme -- the heart of any academy -- is robust and clearly soon to be a force to be reckoned with at local competitions. The lessons and character being built upon here is not something easily found in our modern day society. Perfect for girls and boys of all ages. \n\nConclusion \nThere is no remotely superior option anywhere nearby: come and train.\n\n-----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-------------------\n\nRating: Five-stars, \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\"
