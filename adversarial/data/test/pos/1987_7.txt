This little hole in the wall is serving up some very tasty Thai-Hawaiian home cooking. I'm sure you don't order a side of macaroni salad at most Thai restaurants, but I do recommend it at Plumeria. The mac is not too heavy on the mayo and I think there's some potatoes in the mix.\n\nMost of the dishes I've tried here have been too fishy for me (fish sauce and shrimp paste are not my friends), but I've found a few favorites that I will continue to order. The mango sticky rice comes with a huge portion of coconut rice. It's enough to serve 3-4 people. Try the sweet and refreshing Thai iced tea. The peanut panang curry is delicious. I really love that you can order sides of panang and peanut sauce. For $3, you get about a cup of sauce, perfect for adding flavor to some steamed veggies at home. The location is convenient and ordering via Eat24 is easy, so I'll be back for more.
