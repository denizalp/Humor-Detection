BACKGROUND \n\nAm I the only one who walks into a super high end business and wonders where all it all came from, who is behind it and what makes it stand out?\n\nSo I Googled Tommy Bahama and found out a lot of cool stuff. \n\nNow I know where Tommy Bahama headquarters is, if Tommy Bahama is a real person or not, and whether or not Tommy Bahama stock is publicly traded.\n\nBut let's talk about my experience. \n\nTHE STORY\n\nThe Mai Tai was pretty, but not my favorite. It's definitely for someone who LOVES rum.\n\nThe coconut shrimp were delicious. The Ahi Poke Napoleon was good, but the chips were so-so. \nThe fish tacos were scrumptious.\n\nSERVICE EXPERIENCE\n\nThe entire staff was outstanding. Our server, Polly, was very helpful and very fast. \n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe view and environment are stellar.\n\n5\/5 HIGHLY RECOMMEND
