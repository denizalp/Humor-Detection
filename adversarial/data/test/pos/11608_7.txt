Guise. \n\nAbout Thai Foon not being an authentic, traditional Thai fine-dining restaurant.\n\nIT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE!\n\nYou only make yourself look ridiculous -- rather than \"in the know\" or \"like a sophisticated foodie\" -- if you complain about how some dish at Thai Foon is not made the authentic Thai way. Seriously.  \n\nDude. It's a place in a strip mall. Called THAI FOON. Painted orange inside. With no Thai people eating or working there. With a glossy menu and stuff like crab rangoons. Dude. How can you come here and expect traditional Thai fine dining? Are you the guy who calls the Top 40 station and requests Sigur Ros? Dude. No. \n\nIt's Thai-inspired. And it's damn good. The noodle dishes are a bit like fried spaghetti. The soups are like Campbell with a kick. Nothing bland here, and if you just close your eyes and imagine we are now eating the cuisine of a country called Thaifoonia, you'll love it too. I promise.\n\nPrices are reasonable. Service is typical for high school kids who have no financial stake in the business. Decor is like McDonalds turned up a notch.\n\nBask in it.
