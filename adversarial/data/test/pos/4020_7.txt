I want to start by saving I love the fact that there is a BJ's restaurant in the centennial area. This place is usually crowded because of the limited restaurant options this side of town. BJ's is a traditional American style restaurant\/pizzeria\/Brewhouse and I've been coming to this chain for over 10 years (I've even been to this location a few times). I love the blonde beer and coming here for happy hour (half off mini pizzas). Came here with my brother for dinner and I have to say, we got 1 star service. First, our server BARELY gave us the time of day. She was already walking away while I was trying to ask for barbecue sauce on the side (she forgot the barbecue sauce btw). I ordered a mini barbecue chicken and side of fries and it took 30 minutes for it to come out! (I took a picture of my timer, the timer says 20 minutes but I started the timer after waiting roughly 10 minutes already). The server NEVER refilled our waters either. It was just frustrating watching the server give a lot of attention to all the tables around us, but would barely glance at my tables direction. If the restaurant was packed and super busy, I could understand the neglect, but the restaurant wasn't even busy(I took pictures to show all the empty seats around me). I wanted to order a pizookie (they are delicious) to end my night but was turned off my the service I was receiving so much that I skipped dessert. I love BJ's restaurant but every time I've been to this location I had a poor experience. I think this was my last time here
