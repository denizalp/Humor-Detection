City Barbeque continues to be a great place to eat.  The smoked pork and turkey are my favorites, along with the baked beans and banana pudding with hints of caramel.  I also had the chocolate cake a couple days later and man oh man, it is quite delightful!  The serving size is big so plan to eat only half and save the rest for later.  I am giving the restaurant 4 stars because the cleanup area was overflowing with trash and the filling station was out of forks and boxes.  However, once I mentioned it, it was immediately handled.
