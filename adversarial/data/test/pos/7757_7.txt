Came here with a friend, to get her car estimated for repair.\n\nWalking in, it was quiet and peaceful. No loud noises, no people, just the way I like it. \nThe customer service was good. They offered us magazines, coffee and water as we waited.\n\nThe woman, yes woman, who came out to work on my car was extremely knowledgeable. Straight to the point, and no wasting time. It was refreshing to deal with a woman instead of a man. Ive been a places where men talk down to you or ASSume you dont know what your talking about.\n\nOverall process took about 12 minutes max and she went and set up an appointment, faxed all the paper work to my friends insurance\/lawyer saving us time.\n\nUpdate to be seen soon!
