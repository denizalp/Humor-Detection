I was pretty excited to hear that there was a gastropub opening on Monroe! It's such a cute area that could use a bit more imaginative, creative food (not that I don't love Pizza Brutta, Gates & Brovi, Brasserie V, Jac's, etc).\n\nThis is not that place. Don't get me wrong, it was perfectly okay. The menu contains what looks like fairly standard German fare. The soups sounded intriguing, but I ended up getting the jagerschnitzel (pounded pork chop with spaetzle and cabbage). It was fine, if I was craving some sort of German meal, but the spatzele I've had at Heritage positively blew this out of the water. I did like the mushrooms on top. My friends both got the chicken, which the waiter, Sam, raved about. According to them, it was cold, and the flavor was just all right.\n\nOther than that unhappy recommendation, the service was very pleasant and Sam was helpful with the beer selections for the guys! They have a pretty extensive menu of what seems like a good variety of mildly unpronounceable German beers on tap (~30?). Since I'm not a huge fan of beer in general, I can't speak to it, but my friends said that they would come back for the beer if they were in the area, but not for the food. \n\nTL;DR: maybe this place hasn't hit its groove just yet, but so far, just get the beer.
