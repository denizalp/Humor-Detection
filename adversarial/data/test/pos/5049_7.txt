I heard about this place through friends and being a regular at the Linq. A fotobar? What was that? There were a lot of folks in the place. The vibe seemed great, the employees seemed engaged. Did this place serve alcohol? These are the first thoughts I had when I stumbled upon this place last night. What a treat!\n\nWhen you first walk in, you noticed this place is huge! Lots of table top seating with a bunch of computers. The place is packed with memorabilia, shadow boxes and other accessories for your photos. The walls were adorned with what else, Polaroid pictures! AHHH, this place was not a bar at all. You were able to log into your social media accounts and print out your pictures to Polaroids! THAT WAS AWESOME!!! It's a super easy process, you log in, choose the type of Polaroid, pick the amount of photos you want and bam! You're done! The photos I chose to print were only $1 each. Before I placed my order, I got the chance to add a caption, change the brightness levels, etc. This was great. \n\nWhen my order was complete, I went to the front counter and paid. The total with tax, came to $14 and some change. After you pay, the clerk tells you that you will get an email when your pictures are ready. She told me it would take about an hour. How it works is that they have their very own lab upstairs. Once they print your photos, they drop it down a chute behind the registers and onto a bed of Styrofoam. While we waited, we walked around the Linq. I kid you not, in about 15 minutes, I got a text saying my pictures were ready! Talk about under promising and over delivering! The photos were printed on a thick card board and looked exactly like a Polaroid picture, minus the shaking part (as explained by Outkast in Hey Ya). \n\nI really enjoyed myself at this place. It's a super easy, super efficient way to capture your memories. I went home last night with 13 amazing pictures printed on Polaroids  because of this awesome place! Thank you so much for the amazing time. It was truly and awesome experience!
