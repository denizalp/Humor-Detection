Party Cake is probably my dad's favorite bakery in Pittsburgh, and I have been eating cakes from here for years.  Ironically, I have never set foot in here!  I can't speak to the selection, but I can tell you that these baked goods are delicious!\n\nThey are best known for their cakes, it seems.  My dad always wants this cake for his birthday, and we have never been disappointed!  I've also enjoyed the massive pepperoni rolls, swirl cookies, and red velvet cupcakes.  In my opinion, the doughnuts are fairly standard in the Pittsburgh bakery game, but they are good too.\n\nEventually I will visit the store, but until then, you should check it out for me!
