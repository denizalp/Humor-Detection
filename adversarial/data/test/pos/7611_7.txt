My ladies and I decided to have a nice girl's day out, so we headed to Rachel's Kitchen for brunch. \n\nI was a little disappointed to find out this place was a stand up and order at the counter type joint. I'm not embarrassed to admit it. I like waiter service!!! We ordered and found ourselves a TINY little booth to accommodate us. The table was abnormally slim and not very practical. \n\nHeat kept wafting from the kitchen area, which I found a little annoying. I ordered the grilled cheese and a watermelon juice. My friends ordered the breakfast burrito. The food was pretty good, not nearly good enough to be worth the somewhat hefty pricetag, but I digress. The food was fresh and my friends loved the potatoes, although I found them to be a tad soft and underseasoned. I loved my fresh watermelon juice and highly recommend that, so refreshing. Whenever I see that on a menu I have to order. It's my favorite. \n\nAll in all, I've had better, but this place will do in a pinch. I'm definitely not itching to go back and if I'm in the area again I'd probably try any number of other restaurant options. Good option for healthy eating, though.
