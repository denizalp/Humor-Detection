These are one of those places I did not bookmark, but was hungry that I had to eat something, so I don't faint and end up being saved by somebody I potentially would NOT call a knight in shining armor... in Vegas... where they're probably just in costume cuz they work at Tournament of Kings in the Excalibur Hotel.\n\nMy point, this chicken served here kinda reminded me of the food plates served at that dinner show. I wonder if they order from here. Skimpy wimpy warm salad and no need for the tortilla. But the mashed potatoes a must! Can get a whole rotisserie chicken for less elsewhere - price comparison reasons. However, chicken was good. Nicely seasoned. \n\nAromatic food smells from the outside. The kind that makes my hair smell like BBQ. Don't take my idea up on that; I doubt it's appealing as a shampoo scent. May I suggest though, do try their chicken and mashed potatoes!
