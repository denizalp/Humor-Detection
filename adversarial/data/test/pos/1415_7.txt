-No FUNKY second-hand clothing smells here! The stuff looked pretty new too, surprisingly.\n\n-Prices were pretty decent, although I didn't find anything.\n\n-Merchandise was easy to look through, not too crowded at all.\n\n-I saw several people coming in the store with arm loads of clothing from their closet, so this must be a pretty good place for your unwanted duds.\n\n-Parking was convenient.\n\n-Next door to \"Well-Suited\" Men's clothing.\n\n-This is what a multi-million dollar revenue retail business looks like (per newspaper article 11\/14\/10). Impressive.
