Great gym! Private and has a decent amount if equipment. \n\nIts located in the business section of the Gramercy across from the restaurants. \n\nThey offer classes as well. They cater to the residents of the Gramercy as their \"apartment gym\" so its kept pretty private. \n\nYou can people watch as your doing your cardio and then enjoy a nice shake at portion control.
