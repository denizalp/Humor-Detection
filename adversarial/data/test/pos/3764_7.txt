If you are thinking of coming here, don't! Our incompetent waitress not only lost our credit and didn't tell us for over 10 minutes while we waited for our cab outside but she also CHARGED ANOTHER TABLES BILL TO IT AND GAVE THEM OUR CARD. When she finally came back we were understandably upset about it and she didn't care and refused to grab a manager and didn't come back to our table. Ridiculous! A  \"manager\" came over and basically told us \"too bad there's nothing I can do\" and walked away.
