The food was excellent, this is not a rating on the food as it would be 5 star. This is a rating on the overall experience which got off to a very bad start. Let's face it... with a dinner tab for two of $1,500 this is not a everyday experience and thus expectations are much higher than your average high end restaurant, rightfully so.\n\nI believe expectations are set by your price tag, and just because there is a high price tag doesn't mean you have the right be act or be pretentious. I have the pleasure of knowing many Ultra-Weathly people who won't and don't visit or frequent this type of establishment, I'm a foodie so it was a must visit for me.\n\nDo to the limited seating and the intimate setting, reservations are sometimes hard to come by. I contacted the restaurant directly and I was told they where 4 weeks out on reservations. Although, I spend a lot of time in Vegas, planning 4 weeks out for a dinner is not on my priority list. Instead of trying to plan that far in advance for a dinner, I opted to contact my MGM Host instead, he promptly returned my call and informed me he had arranged for a 5:30 dinner reservation.\n\nI personally think it is rude to show up late for an appointment or reservation, I don't believe in fashionably late, so I arrived at 5:20. I could see the staff and the hostess who was not at her station (granted the official open time is 5:30) you would think there would be some consideration that some guests like to show up a few minutes early. It took 5 minutes before the hostess recognized we had been waiting at her station, at that point it wasn't even a warm friendly greeting... it was a \"Can I help you?\" I said good evening, we have a 5:30 reservation for 2, she didn't miss a beat in her total disregard for the guests... quickly and rudely stating we open at 5:30 at which point I said, Ohh I'm sorry it is only 5:25 and the door was open so I assumed you were already seating. She again didn't miss a beat and said no, we don't begin seating till 5:30, please wait outside till then.\n\nMost people wouldn't tolerate that attitude in a $$ restaurant and here I was tolerating it in a $$$$ restaurant, my wife at that point wanted to just leave. My respect for my Host and that he went out of his way to get the reservation is the only thing that made me wait the 5 minutes.
