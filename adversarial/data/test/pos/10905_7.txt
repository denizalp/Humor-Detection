The Wife and I spend a decent amount of our recreational time in Downtown Las Vegas. Often after we volunteer at the Neon Museum (leading a guided tour), we choose to close out the night hanging out Downtown, whether it be drinks at the Beer Garden at the Plaza, playing 2\/4 limit poker at the Golden Nugget, or simply bar hopping while walking down Fremont Street seeing all the freaky freakies and degenerates falling asleep at slot machines. Though we are by no means high rollers, we gamble enough to catch the eye of casino marketing and get sent monthly offers for little things like a comped room (usually Sun-Thurs), a free meal, or show tickets. \n\nThe Golden Nugget marketing department graciously sent the wife and I an offer for two free tickets to see their resident headliner Gordie Brown on the night of our choosing. The only stipulation was that we had to request the tickets at least 1.5 hours prior to the showtime, and if we wanted specific seats, earlier than that is preferred. \n\nI chose to call GN marketing on Saturday and reserve two seats for the Sunday night performance at 730. I also desired to choose specific seats so I stopped by the GN box office (located in the lobby front desk area) on Sunday morning to pick our seats. \n\nThe front desk Box Office staffer was extremely pleasant and professional. He informed me that the reserved seats were for 3rd row center. I requested to change them to a slightly further back row with an aisle seat and he easily made the change and I picked up the comped tix. Retail value was $50 per ticket. \n\nWe arrived at around 7pm and took the escalators to the 3rd floor. The theater is intimate, but is strictly theater style seating. Every arm rest has a cup holder and you are permitted to bring in your own beverages. The seats are soft and comfortable, even for a portly gentleman or lady. The show started about 5 minutes late and Gordie Brown opened with a country song. \n\nIf you happen to have been lucky enough to see Danny Gans when he was in residency at either The Mirage or Wynn back in the day, you will have a basis for comparison of what kind of show this is. Brown is an impressionist and comedian and the entire 1 hour 20 minute performance showcases his vocal and musical talent by means of rapid successions of various impressions (some of which are significantly better than others) interspersed with comedic routines that are quite entertaining. \n\nGranted, though he has obviously added some recent pop culture references and impressions to stay relevant (most notably being Donald Trump) most of his show caters to an older crowd that will appreciate references to bygone stars like Bette Davis, On Golden Pond, Sammy Davis Jr., and other older entertainers such as Neil Diamond, Barry Manilow, and Neil Young. \n\nMy wife, who is 39, struggled to understand some of the references but still found the overall show to be quite entertaining and certainly worth our time to see (since it didn't cost us any actual cash). \n\nBrown is self deprecating, mocking the fact that the theater was nowhere near sold out and that he feels it necessary to announce what impression he's going to do next in case it isn't obvious once he starts. \n\nOverall, I'm really glad I saw Gordie Brown's performance at the Golden Nugget. He is certainly a hard working entertainer and well worth the affordable $50 ticket. I would probably venture a guess that on any given night that about 25% or more of the attendees are comped guests, but be that as it may, free or not, it simply is a great show that everyone should see at least once while visiting the truly revitalized Downtown Las Vegas.
