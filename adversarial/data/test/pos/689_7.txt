I work in the building that is connected to Cafe Siena.  There are literally hundreds of people who walk right past this place to other places to eat.  \n\nToday I found out why.  After looking though yelp for a new lunch place I found Cafe Siena and was reminded how close it was.  The menu looked good.  I went downstairs and went in.  Noone greeted me, so I walked up to the bar.  No bartendar,  but a couple people sitting at the bar having lunch.  I sat for a little less than 10 minutes browsing on my phone.  No greeting from anyone, it appeared that the staff was actively avoiding eye contact with me as they flitted about.  Finally I gave up when I saw another patron irritatingly having to flag a waiter down to get his check. Noone tried to engage me on the way out the door.  \n\nSo I went down the street to Cosmos, which is awesome.  They greeted me, took my order and had me taken care of quickly.  I suggest you do the same.
