I ended up here the other night after an evening art class.  I was starving as I had been crafting all afternoon\/evening and had just managed to spend $60 on more art supplies.  \n\nThe bean dip that is served with salsa and chips is awesome.  I am not a huge bean person, but it was good- I had to stop myself from eating it so I would be able to eat my dinner.  I love extra treats like that!\n\nI had the spinach enchiladas which were above average.  I ordered them just with rice which was also pretty good.  My margarita was on the okay side, nothing spectacular.  \n\nOur server was random- he was great at the beginning and progressively got worse.  Then, at one point, someone asked for some pico de gallo.  The bill came and we had to pay $2.25 for the pico.  Seriously?  You give us bean dip with salsa at the start at no charge but randomly charge for pico?  I find this ridiculous and irritating.\n\nIf I happen to find myself in Mesa and dying for some Mexican, I may go again, but I'm not sure I would because it was just an okay experience.
