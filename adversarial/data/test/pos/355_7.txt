Today is opening day at the sister restaurant of the Porch at Schenley. I was told that the two places are identical in their menu offerings.\n\nWhen I arrived I was greeted warmly and introduced to the manager Michael Damas. I learned that the concept behind this restaurant is to use local home grown ingredients and they are actually starting a garden in the back where they hope to use some of its produce. They also serve farm to table meals.\n\nI learned that until 4 pm which they consider lunch you place your order at the register, they give you a number and then you can carry it to whatever table you wish to sit at. They have two inviting fireplaces both inside and out-The restaurant is very beautiful with a firefly motif to it both inside and out. I learned that this motif was to capture the idea of seeing fireflies on your front porch while relaxing on a summer's evening.\n\nWhen they change over for dinner it becomes full service. Brunch is served on Sat and Sun. I also understood it is one of the Eat n Park hospitality groups.\n\nFor my lunch I decided to have the strawberry salad special with blue cheese. I decided to hold off on dessert not knowing my portion size. I got my food fairly quickly. As they told me the salad had a bit of a \"zing\" to it on the dressing but otherwise it was good. An item of note, if you want bread with your salad then please ask for regular bread because they serve a farm bread for $6.00. Expect to pay for this place. Lunch prices fall within the $11.00-$30.00 range. \n\nI did ask to see the dessert menu and learned that among their offerings they serve Millie's ice cream for $5.00 as one of the items. Currently they are only carrying two flavors-rhubarb and chocolate but they expect to get more once the business gets established.\n\nIf you want dessert and didn't prepay for it then you would have to go to the counter again to order it and pay there. I had the chocolate ice cream which for Millie's is always 5 stars in quality.\n\nThe staff is more than willing to attend to your needs. I found them exceedingly friendly and helpful.\n\nGetting here can be part of the problem since Siena Drive is a half intersection. I had a similar problem when Whole Foods opened here. My advice is to enter and exit off Washington Road across from South Hills Village. If you choose to go Siena Drive then you must enter it headed towards Washington Rd and if you exit that way you can only go to the right.\n\nAnother thing is there is much construction in this area since they are building some sort of mall complex and it is easy to find yourself in the middle on construction (as I did when I tried to find it) but once I had it down I could park easily.\n\nIn addition to salads they serve sandwiches with your choice of mixed greens or taters, pizza, a kids menu, and of course they have a full bar. The bar has a wine list along with beer and mixed cocktails. They also are BOYB but they have a $15.00 corkage fee.\n\nThe executive chef is Keven Hermann. This place seems nice but can get pretty pricey if you are bringing a family. Will give it another go round once things settle down with this construction nightmare surrounding it.
