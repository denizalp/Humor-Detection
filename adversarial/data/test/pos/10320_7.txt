I don't get all the mediocre or poor reviews for this place. My foodie cousins and I came here recently for dinner and we all had wonderful meals! Plus, our server was lovely! \n\nI know this is a chain (I think there are 14 locations in total), but this site is located across the street from the Centre Bell, and so I think it has a certain unique charm :). There are large screen, wall-mounted tv screens everywhere, so you know this is primarily a sports-oriented steak place. (We were there during the Olympics so we were happy to catch a few Usain Bolt races!). \n\nWe were lucky to get a decent parking spot on the street. I can see whereas parking could be a real issue. \n\nI know this place doesn't offer any contemporary food, or fusion cuisines, or fancy-shmancy, hoity-toity pretentious dishes. (Perhaps that may explain the so-so reviews of this restaurant). The menu is large and varied but it offers primarily traditional fare: steaks, salmon, ribs, traditional salads and desserts. This is why I liked this place; there's something to be said for tried-and-true dishes. Plus, I REALLY liked how the steaks came in a lot of different sizes! You don't see that a lot. I can't eat a lot and they offer a 5oz steak. This is SO perfect for me! And all main meals come with steamed vegetables (ours came with broccoli and carrots), with your choice of potatoes. The mashed potatoes were fantastic, and the steamed vegs were exactly what I wanted (no butter, no sauce. Just steamed. You can ask for accompanying sauces if so desired). My cousins had the ribs (which I sorely wanted to taste, they looked so good, but they were eaten with gusto too fast for me to get one!) and a larger steak, with Caesar salads on the side. Everything was cooked perfectly. I have to say, my little 5oz steak packed a flavorful punch: it was perfectly cooked (I asked for medium rare), and wonderfully seasoned and seared. It really was delicious.\n\nOur waitress was very attentive and so nice. We discussed all the horrible construction on the adjacent roads and she admitted, it was really hurting business here and in all the neighboring businesses. (In fact, the place was nearly empty when we were there). This saddened us, as this place - and all the neighboring places - don't deserve to deal with this crap. But such is life in Montreal, I suppose; with all the construction, it really does look like a war zone in areas.\n\nThe only downside to our meal here was the dessert situation. My cousins wanted dessert but all the kinds of desserts they wanted were unavailable. Our waiter said they were switching \"vendors\" and as a result, they were having \"issues\" getting some of their more popular desserts. That was a bit of a let-down. Other than this, though, our meals were delicious and I would definitely return here.
