Not impressed after my visit to this place and I ended up finding a Gastroenterologist in LA\n\nNegatives\n\n1. Location: It doesn't seem like a doctors office. It's setup in a strip mall and the staff are  dressed in suits and business casual wear? wtf. It's small and makes you feel like you are at a medical marijuana dispensary where they also treat gunshot wounds in the back.\n\n2. While the doctor and staff were friendly, the doctor is more concerned about making money which is an immediate reason for me to not come back. I mentioned my IBS symptoms and that I may have hemorrhoids, I was immediately asked to do a colonoscopy & endoscopy. The doctor did not take the time to do a physical examination and jumped straight to the high profit margin procedures.
