Decided to go here for lunch with my brother because we were craving for some Indian food and we were essentially stuck on the Strip so this was the perfect place to go to!\n \nThis place is a bit different since you have to pay upfront before going into the buffet. It is also easy to miss because it is located in the Hawaiian Marketplace Plaza. You have to go into the main building next to the Chili's and just ignore the rundown shops on the first floor as you ascend to the second level where this restaurant is located.  \n\nThey have a good selection of food like naan, butter chicken, basmati rice, tandoori chicken, and some other items. The naan is in the buffet so you can grab as much as you want when you want it! The only downer is that it is plain naan instead of garlic, but it still tastes fine since you can just eat it with the curry for flavor. \n\nI'd recommend checking this place out if you like Indian food and want a change of pace when it comes to eating on the strip. The lunch price with the Yelp discount was about $14-15\/ person which isn't too bad considering the food and location. Also, I saw a bunch of Indian people when we walked in so that must mean this place is good! The staff is also very attentive as they refill your drink and take away your plates in a timely manner.
