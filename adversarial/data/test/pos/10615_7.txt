A cool ambience and friendly, polite staff make this a nice place to eat out.\n\nAll their signature burgers are named after a national capital, hence the name. Cool. Depending on the burger, the patties are made of either beef, chicken or pork. Sadly, there's no more salmon. One burger has a vegetarian patty (I'm guessing tofu). They each come with a different set of veggies, cheese, bacon and condiments as toppings.\n\nSince I prefer beef burgers instead of chicken or pork, I ordered the Montreal burger (it has all of the above toppings like an all-dressed pizza) and tried their regular poutine while I was at it.\n\nAfter a modest waiting time, I was presented with my meal on a black rectangular plate on a metal tray. Why the poutine was served in an aluminum pan when I wanted it to eat there instead of to go, I don't know. It would have been better served on the plate.\n\nTasty chewy fries in a poutine gravy with cheese curds; the way it's supposed to be. The burger was all dressed, well cooked and tasty. Not sure about the missing dill pickle another reviewer had mentioned, but otherwise yes, more mayo would have been nice.
