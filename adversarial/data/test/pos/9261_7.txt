Let me lick you up and down, til you say \"stop\"! Let me do all the things I want to do... \n\nGet your mind out of the gutter because I'm talking to the ice cream I got at Melt!\n\nIce cream. Melts in my mouth. Melts in my hand. Melts my heart...\n\nThe most unique combinations are at melt. I had the Lemon Cookie and the Chocolate Rosemary Pistachio ice cream. It was so good and the taste was nothing I've ever had before! \n\nThe next time I'm in the neighborhood, I'll make sure to head over to get a dose of some finger licking ice cream!
