Even though I am generally reluctant to dine at any of the upscale, non sushi-centric Asian restaurants on The Strip, I usually end up leaving pretty happy with the meals.  On a recent visit for my wife's birthday dinner, Andrea's continuously hit high marks, plate after plate after plate.  Yes, it costs more than Spring Mountain, but there's a quality of ingredients here that is unparalleled to most spots a few miles southwest of Encore.  \n\nThe ambiance is really nice - the cool lighting, upscale late 70's furnishings with accompanying music that dabbled into the 80's as the night went on made me feel like this was the kind of place to pregame before going to Studio 54.  Andrea Wynn's eyes all lit up behind the bar were strangely soothing.  The 3 cucumber\/gin cocktails only enhanced that effect.\n\nWith a party of 8, we opted to go omakase family style.  The waiter asked for a per person price to adhere to along with any items we were not interested in (ah-hem....$9 miso soup) and then we awaited the surprises from the kitchen.  \"Seafood on Ice\" may sound like the worst ice skating show ever (ok,ok a gigantic oyster doing a triple axle might possibly awesome), but these treasures from the ocean were excellent.  The slow poached prawns were shrimp cocktail for kings, and the initial bite of the marinated bay scallop totally wowed me with its freshness.  Crab legs, oysters, Maine lobster and tuna poke made life even better.   \n\nThe \"Steamed Sea Bass\" was exquisite.  It started tender on the outside and got tendererererererer as you got to the center.  The ginger, garlic, mushroom, lemon and cilantro made for a simple but divine combination for such a fantastic cut of fish.  I bet Roger Federerererererer would like this.  Everything else was very enjoyable including the tuna+crispy rice, rock shrimp tempura, hamachi sashimi, sliced prime New York strip, adobo crab fried rice, and the Saikyo miso black cod among other items.   \n\nIt was impossible to say no to the Mt Fuji dessert.  I mean....how do you NOT take photos and videos of this behemoth of sugar as they pour the Bacardi 151 and set it on fire???  I found it to be a bit too alcohol-y for my taste, but totally worth the \"show\" factor.  It was a great ending to the meal.  Color me reluctant no more!
