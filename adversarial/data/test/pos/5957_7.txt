You walk into this place and you literally have stepped out of west Phoenix and into Bosnia. Cafe Sarajevo is THE place for the substantial Bosnian community in Phoenix (who knew there was one?) to hang out at, with Bosnian television constantly on the tv and old Bosnian men sitting at tables shootin' the shit while drinking strong Bosnian (aka Turkish) coffee.\n\nI've been here a couple times for lunch and had the cevapi, a sandwich made with Bosnian sausage, soft  fluffy lepinja bread, diced onions, and a pepper spread. \n\nExcellent food, paired with a jovial, friendly owner make for a great casual lunch experience. You don't find much of Bosnian anything anywhere in the States, so if you're ever around this neck of the woods, swing by and check it out. They also have a small market with Bosnian goods in the back.
