Rolled in a few weeks ago looking to replenish some of my vitamins.  A tall, athletic looking gentleman was on point and took me around the shop and pointed out everything I needed.  I was impressed given that I can go online, read some sites or reviews, and I am almost certain get some sort of discount.\n\nI thought about going online this time around when my multi's ran out.  I was in the area and given the exceptional customer service I had previously received, thought I would visit the shoppe again.\n\nI walked in and this time it was a female who initially greeted and assisted me.  She asked what I was looking for and I told her multi vitamins.  She held out her hands and gave me a quirky look as they were right behind me.  My bad.  Given the response, I did not ask nor was I asked specifically what I was looking for.  Thoughts of retreating back to the comfort of the internet flooded my mind, as I did a 180 to search through the immense selection.\n\nF*&^ that!  Like I previously stated...I can research and purchase at home.  I decided to seek the advise of the same vitamin specialist that helped me the last time.  I told him what I was looking for and he scanned the rows.  He offered up his recommendation and I purchased.\n\nHad this been a first time experience, I would have dropped a two star.  Given the previous experience, I did an average.  Maybe I will be back or maybe I will seek out the many different options I have available in cyber space.
