In a half hours time I searched yelp for mesa wifi spots, drove to \"The Bungalow\" and am now enjoying an egg bake with a pomegranate ice tea. Couldn't be happier to put off working a few minutes to give this lovely little place 4 stars.  I may upgrade my rating after trying the sweets!! Peace\n\nOk,  I've now tried the brownie...  It's ridiculous.  I ate the whole thing save 2 bits just to kid myself.  It was good!
