The French really is for lovers...and Pamplemousse is exactly the kind of place you bring two lovebirds together.  \n\nSeated very cozy in a corner booth, lights are dimmed perfectly to only enhance the lovelier features of one's face.\n\nNot only is a printed menu presented to us, the waiter recites the specials of the day.  Do pay attention because there are quite a few and you do want to hear the details of each.\n\nWe love to sample and taste a variety of foods, so what better way than a few appetizers to indulge our French desires?\n\nA complimentary bucket of fresh vegetables and a dipping sauce satisfy the lack of greens in decadent dining.\n\n* Scallops appetizer - one of their specials.  Two giant scallops in butter and lemon that just melts in your mouth like a perfectly cooked scallop should.\n\n* Frogs legs appetizer - blah.  Nothing can help these dried out legs with no taste.  Tough pieces of meat and just a disappointment. Do avoid.\n\n* Escargot with fresh Garlic and Parsley ($14) - It's not the snails that are so delicious, it's the butter and garlic concoction that has you dipping your bread into each little pool of heavenly goodness.  And don't be shy about mopping up all the tasty drippings, the waiter will be sure to bring more crusty bread just for the occasion.\n\n* Homemade terrine of fresh Foie Gras ($18) - Reminisce of our trip to Paris...a side of peppery arugula leaves to challenge your palate.  The salt and pepper mixture only complements the foie gras that leaves you wanting more.  The cooked apples were unmemorable in enhancing this indulgent dish.\n\n* Grand Marnier Soufflé with Vanilla Ice Cream and Whipped Cream ($13) - Beautifully presented tableside with the soufflé popped and ice cream and whipped cream are scooped on top as they melt and drip into this not-overly heavy dessert just perfect for sharing.\n\nService is top-notch with beverages refilled without requesting and silverware brought out for each dish.  Don't bother coming with a large group, enjoy this more romantic atmosphere with someone that you plan on getting intimate with! \n\n(Photos of our appetizer journey posted!)
