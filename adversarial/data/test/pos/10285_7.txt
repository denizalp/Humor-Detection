Phoenix should really take a lot of pride in this library because it's fantastic. I can't say that I've ever been blown away by a library but this place is awesome. Four floors of awesomeness (I admittedly only made it to the first two) but the cd\/dvd area made me think of the old Tower Records in Brea, CA which is sadly now gone. But it's really great because beside Best Buy or Target, there is no place to get cds or dvds any more!\n\nThe pond and fountain in the central atrium really give a calm peaceful feeling. I plan on coming here a lot more to read a book or get some work done. \n\nThe staff are friendly and helpful too. Really a fantastic place and one of the few examples where I see my tax dollars going to good use. \n\nWell done, Phoenix!
