A Mex restaurant in the Desert Ridge area. I was very unimpressed with my $15 shot of Azul Blanca clear, the tequila out of this one bottle had 'Zero Alcohol Burn.' I could compare the shot to a strong glass of water. My $7 well Margs were OK. \n\nI just finished with a client and was happy to leave.
