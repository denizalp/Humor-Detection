I am definitely a fan of Fiamma! My friends and I all jumped on their prix fixe meal. Salad was fabulous and fresh. For an entree, I had the raviolis stuffed with rib meat in a light cream sauce. It was almost a week ago and I am still thinking about how amazing those raviolis are! I think I might have a little crush on those raviolis and will think about them for years to come as that one beautiful night in Vegas that was meant to be, but not meant to last past sunrise. Those raviolis alone will get me back into Fiamma on my next Vegas trip.\n\nThe server didn't even ask us what desserts we each wanted. Instead he decided to bring us an array of desserts for all of us to share. Tiramisu, sorbet, and a chocolate torte. I love that! I love it when servers make wise decisions for a table b\/c we had a great time sampling each dessert. I also appreciated that he asked if any of us had any food allergies before prepping the surprise desserts. \n\nHad a great time and pretty impressed.
