Bad, bad customer service. We have to go through these guys because of our home warranty - makes me rethink the whole home warranty thing!\nCalled home warranty Friday because our house was 85 degrees inside. Was told that Cool Blew was already closed, but we should hear something first thing in the morning. Of course we didn't, so I called Cool Blew directly Saturday afternoon.\nI got the feeling that I was bothering them trying to schedule my appointment, and was then advised that someone would come out Monday between 2pm and 5pm.\nMoved my work schedule around so I could be home by 2 to wait. 5:30 comes around and finally get a call from the office that the tech is still at the other job and will be here shortly.\n7:15 rolls around and no one is here. We called Cool Blew and the guy my husband spoke with said he's trying to get ahold of the tech, but the tech isn't answering his phone. He'll call us back when he gets ahold of him. He called back a few minutes later and said that the tech still isn't done and it'll be awhile longer.\nAt this point, we just cancelled the appointment. It's not worth it, and the level of unprofessionalism is blowing my mind! Yes, it's Arizona and yes an A\/C repair company will be busy - get more staff! Get people to answer the phone who aren't bothered by customers. It's pretty simple. Keeping in contact with us and being proactive could have avoided a lot of this frustration. If our home warranty company doesn't have another option for a different company, it looks like we'll just have to switch home warranty companies! What a joke!
