Grilled Mexican chicken. Don't waste your money on chemicals in El Pollo Loco's franchised nonsense- go here. Basically the same cuisine, except none of those white-ified salads and avocado-based dishes, and none of the chemicals.\n\nThese guys literally throw the seasoning on your meat, toss it on the grill in front of you until it smells like straight-up heaven, then serve it with rice, beans, and tortillas. For rock-bottom prices. \n\nLove their daily specials: Wednesday you can get 12 pieces for like $10, Thursday they offer a 10 piece taquitos deal, etc. That's right: they also do tacos, burritos, and tortas. Everything is well priced, but the chicken is what really shines.\n\nIntro to the salsa bar: not sure it'd bass health code inspection, as the ice has melted to water, but the heat and spice in each sauce probably keeps away both bacteria and the Chupacabra. Suggest the red with chopped veggies and the verde. Be careful of the other red salsa, it might kill your extended family by accident it's so potent.
