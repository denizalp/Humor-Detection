Sweet Pete's is probably one of, if not my absolute, favorite bike shops in Toronto.  \n\nTheir service department has always treated me well, their bike selection is good and reasonably priced. \n\nThis would be a 5-star review except for 2 things:\n-Don't go there for clothing - stupid expensive\n-One of the sales staff who's there frequently, a short doe-eyed young lady, I find really ambivalent and less than interested in giving a good customer service experience
