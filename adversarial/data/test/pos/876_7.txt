My review of Jack Astors overall is reflected in the one star rating.  Terrible service, pushy, couldn't understand the male server, poor English.  Very unfriendky server. Then the nachos arrived. Very lame looking nachos, not even real cheese , prepackaged fake melt out of a bag  cheese only on a few nachos. The toppings were terrible.  In addition we ordered the 2.99 guacamole which was horrific! Tasted like some green burnt concoction. It didn't even taste like avacado made guacamole.  This was mothers day and supposed to be a special occasion for us and the server made us feel like we were a \"burden\" to him for being there. The beer and wine were served in warm glasses as well. We will never ever go back there again. Bad service, terrible food!
