I do not understand why people are saying this is the best carne asada they've ever had.This place is really horrible! \n\nIt was like having my old high school cafeteria making me tacos. Absolutely  no flavor in the meat! No flavor in condiments on taco or taco shell, or sauce. The amount of meat was very small. The chips and salsa was like it was from taco bell or something. The only flavorful thing I had there was the mexican bottled coke that was way overpriced, $3!\nEven the ambiance was low grade. Uncomfortable chairs and no personality.\nI am actually angry about this place getting good reviews. It is soooo easy to take beef, marinate it and grill it up and make it delicious. \nMaybe the people who think this is the best carne asada should go to the closest roach coach and get a real carne asada taco, it would be cheaper and 100 times better.
