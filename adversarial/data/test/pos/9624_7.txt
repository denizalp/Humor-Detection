I like this place for breakfast on the weekend.  The prices (aside from the \"Can't talk Eating\" breakfast mentioned by Roy) are average.  They also serve fresh squeezed OJ which is a breakfast must have for me.  The main advantage that this place has over other weekend brunch joints is that you can actually go there and have a meal without a 20 minute lineup.\n\nYou will be elbow to elbow with hipsters talking about politics though so suck it up.\n\nIncidentally, there is a guy that lives next door that makes a daily trip to the store in his bathrobe, slippers and dangling cigarette.  Extra points if you spot him.
