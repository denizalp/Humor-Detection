Came here for the first time on a Friday evening with some coworkers and I enjoyed myself. I arrived just as Happy Hour was ending, but that didn't stop me from indulging in a few of their martinis. Trust me, it was much needed after the work week that I had!\n\nThere is a lot of seating outdoors and heat lamps too, perfect for the colder Vegas nights. I noticed a dance floor and multiple bars inside. The bathroom was hard to find at first, but a kind employee pointed me in the right direction. \n\nMy martinis were delicious. Of course I had to order a Blue Martini, their namesake. Van Gogh Blue Vodka, Bols Blue Cura√ßao, Sour, and OJ served on the rocks. If you're a fan of  L.A. Water or an AMF, you'd like the Blue Martini. The Starburst was just amazing! I couldn't get over the fact that this martini tasted exactly like my favorite pink Strawberry Starburst candy! Bacardi Dragonberry Rum, fresh lemons and limes, Cranberry, and Sprite make for the perfect drink. Definitely one of those drinks that will sneak up on you!\n\nOur waitress Jillian was fantastic. She took care of us and kept us laughing! Loved her outgoing personality.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the atmosphere at Blue Martini and my coworkers and I had a great time. It's a cool spot to come with a group of friends to wind down, or even for a date night drink with your special someone! It's a good alternative if you want to avoid a crowded nightclub on the Strip. I'll have to come back for Happy Hour soon! The appetizers look great!
