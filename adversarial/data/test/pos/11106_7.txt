Wow...I can't believe there are any negative reviews here, because my experience was so far from what Erin K's party has outlined below. Brandon was nothing but helpful, friendly and professional throughout my months of dealing with him. \n\nI shopped around quite a lot, and our Bride got a little more demanding about our Vegas plans as the trip got closer, so I didn't actually lock in our party package until the day before. Even with this, Brandon was incredibly flexible and communication was very good. \n\nAs for the night - \n\nWe started with a pole dancing lesson, which is where I finally got to meet Brandon, settle the remaining balance and get our Chippendales tickets. The stripper\/pole dancing class was great fun (especially after a few drinks), and we each received a cute little tank top. \n\nAfterwards, we had some time to get dolled up at our hotel before heading out to Chippendales show. As most people can attest...getting a group of young ladies ready by a certain time is no small feat, but our host for the night (Tammy) waited for us, and called to let us know where she was and if there were any issues. \n\nThe limo was so much fun, great loud music and a stripper pole. Tammy rode with us, and she was a lot of fun and easy to get along with. Perhaps this is one of the reasons the below reviewers were so negative - I believe ordinarily the hosts sent out with you are young women, which definitely made sense as Tammy was one of us, and it made us much more comfortable dancing on a pole in a moving vehicle than if we had of been there with Brandon (no offence, Brandon!). \n\nChippendales was great, we had a table up the back, which meant the bride had to wander down the front to enjoy the more interactive bits...but given that I booked literally 24 hours beforehand, I'm just stoked that we were seated together in a full house. \n\nAfter Chippendales we got the limo to Chateau where Tammy got us in very quickly and got us set up with our bottle and mixers. Now, Chateau may not be the most high end place in Vegas, but it was still a fun, unique setting under the Eiffel Tower and as long as you're with your girls and you've got that bottle, it shouldn't matter where you are. It also didn't have a Tier A price tag like that of Hakkasan or XS, which was a relief! \n\nAll in all, Brandon ensured we were well taken care of, and the package and service we received (and the price!) was fantastic. \n\nI would definitely recommend Brandon to anyone looking for Bachelorette packages that take the pain and fuss out of the equation, and I myself would definitely use again (though I really hope I don't ever have to attend another Bachelorette in Vegas......but that's a whole other story!).
