I really hate to do this, but today was a serious wtf on behalf of the Slider Truck.\n\nGot to the Lakes location at 5:55, they were supposed to be there at 6 PM. There was already quite a line, but it didn't look like more than 30 minute wait. We didn't wait 30 minutes. We waited 45 minutes and only moved 15 feet with about 20 people ahead of us still. Matt and I did not get food tonight. \n\nYou know why we didn't get food? We overheard that some lady up front ordered TWO DOZEN sliders. When you are a business that makes items as they're ordered and you see a crazy-long line, you have to draw the line somewhere. Seriously, it should be 6 sliders per customer, period. TWO DOZEN. Who the hell needs 24 sliders?? You should not be ordering for friends or family, you need to drag their butts down there so you can stare at all the people glaring at you for holding them up from eating. \n\nI don't think we would have been served in an hour and a half, and there's no way that the Slider Truck is worth that kind of wait. Half hour tops. And that is usually all I have to wait if not less. But once it gets past an hour, it gets ridiculous. \n\nI'm seriously thinking about selling my Groupon that I have for them because the wait times have gone up like crazy and I don't think I'll be able to use it anytime soon. \n\nOh and P.S. Anyone who cuts the line at the Slider Truck, you have a separate circle in hell waiting for you.
