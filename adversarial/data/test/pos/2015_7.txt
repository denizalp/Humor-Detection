When the burgers are this good, nothing else really matters. Not the ambience, not the service -- which, to be fair, were both perfectly fine in my book though I've read some criticisms. The dining area is small and crowded so there may be a wait during peak hours. And this isn't your run-of-the-mill burger joint so the prices are higher. That being said, whoever came up with these delicious burgers infused with Asian ingredients certainly knows what they're doing. \n\nThis was my first time so I went big. Really big. Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger ($13) is a tower of burger perfection, much as the other options I saw pass our table appeared to be. The toppings on this one are chili mayo, fried egg, furikake (a Japanese condiment that includes sesame seeds), caramelized bacon, and onion rings that are lightly breaded and crisp. All in all, one of the best burgers I've had in a long time. Bring your appetite!
