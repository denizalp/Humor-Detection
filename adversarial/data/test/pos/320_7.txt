It's unfair to rate the service based on one St. Patrick's Day visit, so I won't tell you about how our waitress forgot to bring me water and took 15 minutes to fetch a draught.\n\nThat said, the fries were good and my sister-in-law said the sliders were good too (as served with au jus?).\n\nAlso, I think the tanktop-clad, eye contact-avoiding DJ from last night is from Jersey Shore. Could be wrong.
