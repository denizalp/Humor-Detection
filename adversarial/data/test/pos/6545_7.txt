Made same day brunch reservations on New year's day for 4 people. \n\nThe diy brunch bloody Mary bar was on point with shrimp, Bacon, peppers, mushrooms, etc...\n\nI ordered a coffee with Bailey's, but they did not have Bailey's so I got Kahlua instead. I think I'm now changing my brunch drink of choice to that, so thank you for being out of Bailey's! \n\nI ordered the potato pancakes with poached eggs substituting Bacon for the sausage. It looked like a play on a bird's nest with the eggs. The dish was expectantly very greasy, but I did feel like the potatoes were slightly overdone. Also the sour cream was in one spot for decor, I assume, but it would have been better evenly allocated or on the side. \n\nThe bathrooms were impeccable.\n\nThe service was excellent, constantly refilling waters and checking to see how we were doing. The prices of the brunch menu were an excellent value, and I would love to come back for dinner.
