Although this place caters to women, the clothes they have for men are super stylish. The styles will be acceptable for clubs and bars. They have skinny jeans you can't find at Macy's, Nordstrom, jc penny, kohl's, Hollister, Abercrombie and Fitch, American eagle or 90% of other clothing stores.\n \n They have fitted sweatshirts for guys who want to show off muscles. I'm a huge fan of fitted clothing because I believe they fit and look better on most young men (I'm straight btw). I personally shop at asos online store and found out that Topman have the variety of different clothing styles. They have the extreme skinny jeans that are extremely comfortable, the long t shirts fitted that you can't get at any store except asos from my experience. \n\n The clothing caters mainly to women, but the small section for men are very unique. You can get studded belts of highest quality, boots made of different materials. The fitted shorts of ultra slim, extreme skinny, spray on and slim bootleg. That's a lot of variety of styles if you ask me.\n\n Although Topman is part of the store, it branches into topshop which is 90% women clothing. Anyway, the only Con of this place is the prices. Everything here is top of the line but costs can  be heavy for the leather coats in the 200$ range. Most of the clothing though for men are 50$ or close to it. What's to like you ask? Pretty much the styles because there are so many specific sizes it will make you scratch your head.
