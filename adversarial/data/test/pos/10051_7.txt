Had the privilege of sampling their burgers, chicken fingers, waffle fries and milkshakes the day before they opened. Those hand scooped milkshakes are worth coming back for like every day. So yummy and I may or may not have been back for one already ;)\n\nThe burgers are juicy and delicious. Love that the chicken fingers are real chicken - so good! The waffle fries are the perfect combination of salty and crispy.\n\nGreat experiences here already and they've only been open a couple of days.
