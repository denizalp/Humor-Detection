Was hopeful with the great reviews when the wife and kiddo walked into the pet store next door.  I was in severe pain in my neck all day and can not barely move as it feels like a bad pinched nerve in my lower neck or an out of aligned vertebrae.  Long story short I seen this place in the parking lot and was super excited so I didn't have to endure this pain until Tuesday.  Granted I walked in 18 minutes before close, but another gentleman just walked in before me.  I was turned away and told \"well here is our hours tomorrow\" and that was it.  It says walk ins welcome.. I guess you need to be there before they want to close up shop early.
