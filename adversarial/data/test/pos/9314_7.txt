I just had the weirdest experience at this place.  Heads up apparently they are not open on Mondays.  I walk up knock on the door because you know sometimes to restore locked doors... And the woman on the counter and dives to the ground to hide.  Then a dude comes to the door when I knock again and tells me they're closed.  No problem but weird I guess I'll take my watch repair work to the Santan mall!! Heads up don't dive for the ground when a customer knocks on the door.
