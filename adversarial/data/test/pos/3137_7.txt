I was at the auto shop near by and was looking up and down Main St for breakfast at 9am on Saturday. There was nothing! I found Dutchman and their red Open sign. The hours on their door said 8am. They were not open at 9am. There was a tiny handwritten note saying \"open at 11\". For a coffee\/bakery joint, 11am is pretty ridiculous.
