During my Vegas trip stay at the Fremont Hotel and Casino I came to the Paradise Buffet to have my breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  Vacation Hawaii provides food vouchers to use at this buffet. Also B Connected Players Club may offer promotion for free breakfast or lunch buffet (check the kiosk daily to see if you have promotion offers).\n\nBreakfast\nFruit bar offered bananas, cantaloupe, honeydew melon, peaches, pears, fruit cocktail, and jello.  Restaurant customers may also choose ham, bacon, sausage patties, little sausages, scrambled eggs, potatoes, rice, biscuits, toasts, miso soup, cold cereal, and other items I can't remember.  LOL. There is the omelette station where you can order your omelette any way you want or order easy over eggs.  The chef, Juan Rios who was April 2014 Employee of the month,  managed to cook the omelettes for the customers as well as replenishing the hot pancakes. \n\nLunch\/Dinner\nSpaghetti, dirty rice, mashed potatoes, roast chicken, fried chicken, ribs, fish, and some other items were offered as well. Carving station had the prime rib and the chicken. Many choices of pies for dessert or settle for soft serve ice cream.\n\nWait help\nI had three different people as my wait help when I had my meals. One waitress (Monday\/Tuesday breakfast as well as Monday dinner)  and was really friendly and always checked up on me. She made sure that my coffee never ran out. The waiter during my Wednesday visit for lunch was also was friendly and he too checked up on me. The second waitress during my Thursday breakfast did not even checked up on me nor did I get a coffee refill. \n\nOverall my experience eating at Paradise Buffet was average. I enjoyed eating the hot pancakes and omelette for breakfast. The miso soup was a bit too salty. The fried chicken was a bit too dry. The mashed potatoes was delicious with the southern beef stew over it. \n\nNext time I should try the cafe side of Paradise Buffet and Cafe.
