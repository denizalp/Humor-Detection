This location is a perfect spot to get work done. \n\n1. There is a lot of space. \n2. It's not too loud where you can't concentrate on work. \n3. The staff is extremely friendly. \n4. Bomb.com drinks!\n\nCurrently, I am obsessed with their Iced chai latte. It reminds me of Christmas...but in the summer time. Sounds crazy, but Sambalatte has me returning every morning for the past week.\nI order this with almond milk and 2 shots...so it's actually an extra dirty almond chai latte. \n\nOpera cake is also amazing!!! Not too sweet and just enough to satiate that chocolate craving.
