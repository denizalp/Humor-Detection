OK, clearly Red Rocket heard my pleas for better music because today it's been a rotation of Daft Punk's Alive 2007, Simian and Ratatat. It can't get more kickass than that.\n\nAlso, I just housed the best date square I've ever had in my life. It was slightly chilled, tart, soft and not too crumbly. I hate it when there is too much powdery crumble on top and this was the perfect amount of crumble. It's called a \"Satisfying Date Square\" and boy was it ever. $2.95.
