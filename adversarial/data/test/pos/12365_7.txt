I want to warn customer to check your bill before you paid, they don't write the price on the bill. We ordered 4 XL pho for 4 adults and a child but when we received the bill, noticed we got extra charge on bill and asked the lady, she was rude and raied her voice said because we were sharing 4 bowl of pho for 5 people, she tried to protect herself pointed us to see the note on the menu (only on the first page). They also extra charged if you change dry to fresh noodles. I had never heard exta charge on sharing dishes anywhere else.\n\nOne time i called in just for a take out, they charged extra on the take out container. Really don't understand the purpose of take out or i should bring my own containers.\n\nBoth ladies are running a robbery restaurant. It was horrible experience overall. I definatly not going back again and not suggest to come eat here.
