The ambiance here is nice, somewhat chic like, but they also have a large screen tv by the sushi bar for some MNF action. For a sushi joint in the middle of the desert, they had a lot to offer on their menu.\n\nBut my first two questions alone confirmed the fact that having a sushi joint in the middle of the desert may have some issues.\n\nHows the toro? Sorry we dont serve toro during the summer time.\nOk, how about the halibut? No halibut here, only during winter.\n\nSo that's a great start there. And yes both items were on the menu; that's why I asked how they were. Oh well.\n\nAnyways, I ordered some tuna nigiri http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/v4qyBRpTBvOO55M4IAqNNg?select=CTl0wonkUIRRANoVogG2BQ, salmon nigiri http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/v4qyBRpTBvOO55M4IAqNNg?select=BvZ7OBpRxsxtH0bF7KE1ug, albacore and yellowtail http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/v4qyBRpTBvOO55M4IAqNNg?select=grNHXCPTzT-ZLcDw75TgwA. They obviously used the best pieces here, nice, vibrant colors and fresh. The rice was a bit off though.\n\nI also ordered their spicy salmon roll. Very hot, they pretty much drowned the fish in siracha sauce. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/v4qyBRpTBvOO55M4IAqNNg?select=HlM6L-jLtZEclnVUc_h2pg\n\nFor dessert I ordered a banana tempura with jack Daniels sauce, with ice cream chocolate and whipped cream. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/v4qyBRpTBvOO55M4IAqNNg?select=yZnUTrSRlcDT3SdD2Hb3zg Not bad, nice and sweet.\n\nThe service here was neutral. I was the only person at the bar, and maybe like 10 other people in the dining area so it was pretty desolate as it is, but it took some time to get some decent service here. And if you're looking for the best (ie toro, halibut) they may not be there. But then again, this place is in the middle of the desert.
