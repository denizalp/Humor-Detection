Just got back from lunch here on their second day open and I'm so pleased to have this truly delicious new lunch spot in the area. There is so much good stuff happening up here, and Pumpui puts me over he moon. There was no wait when I got here today just before noon, and although they are definitely having some opening-week anxiety and mix ups and some menu items weren't available, I was totally delighted with my vegetarian option - a thick and creamy red curry with big chunks of lovely tofu and squash and crispy tart black tomatoes, served with a plate of rice. Service was warm and thoughtful, and the decor is lovely and relaxing and does feel like a loving ode to Thailand. I worry about the cultural appropriation piece, it all feels so full of love for authentic food and culture that I think Pumpui's heart is in the right place, but it will be for Thai people to judge. Meanwhile I'm thankful to be introduced to more authentic tasting and complex Thai dishes and happy to see diversity coming to Little Italy.
