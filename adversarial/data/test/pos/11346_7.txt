We used to only go to fresh and easy for groceries, however, this has changed.\n\nOver the last few months, I started to notice that they wouldn't clear the spoils. I know I should have looked, but I have bought expired products from them. \n\nWe enjoy their coupons, $5 off $25 and what not, no one else really does that, and this is the only place where I have been able to find \"plum sauce.\"\n\nHowever, I just got back from there tonight with my husband (the exterminator) and they have something going on. There were flies\/gnats all over the produce. Even in the bagged potatoes. \n\nWe asked an associate if there was a manager we could notify, and he said there wasn't one on duty (?)
