I'm going to go against the grain a little here and say I don't like In-N-Out. It's not this location or the price or that the service is poor, it's that the food isn't so damn good to justify why it's ALWAYS packed. It's like a weird cult of people who don't realize they're eating a basic cheeseburger and \"eh\" fries.\n\nWhen I hear people go like \"OMG we HAVE to go to In-N-Out!\", it worries me. That place is like the Scientology of burger joints. I get it though, they have their own special lingo so people feel like they're part of a special group. If it worked for Starbucks, why not this place?\n\nAt the end of the day I'm on my lunch break... I don't want to wait in unnecessary lines to get a burger. I could get a Whopper quickly and not think twice about it.
