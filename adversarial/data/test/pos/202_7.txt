Bloom you are my girl and baby, daddy loves you!\n\nOff of Park road, you will find me buying my groceries on Sunday afternoon cause Bloom is my girl now. It is amazing the the child of Food Lion could produce such a hot offspring but girl you know it is true....cue the Milli Vanilli....cause Girl you know it is true!\n\nThe produce section is fair....but I am really picky about produce. The meat section is small but has all the basic covered. The prices are pretty good and compared to the HT smoking! The beer section is very uber cool. You can make your own 6-Pack for $8.99 out of hundreds of beers to chose from. So you won't get stuck with that lame sick pack from gut hell. \n\nThe staff here is friendly, the parking is convenient and of course the shoppers are hot which doesn't hurt when you are new kid in town. Hey, grocery stores are the new pick up spots in the 21 century! \n\nEveryone has to eat and nothing is sexier than a momma that knows how to cook. So what are you waiting for? Get your cart over to Bloom today!
