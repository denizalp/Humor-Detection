After canvassing the valley for a new bedroom set a couple of months ago, I was about to give up all hope when I finally wandered into Z Gallerie. Problem was, I didn't know exactly what I was looking for... I wanted something simple, but not too simple; something modern, but with a retro twist; something cool, but without looking like it's trying to be cool... Not too much to ask, is it? Not at Z Gallerie, where I found exactly what I was looking for - at what I consider very reasonable prices ($600 for the bed, $300 per nightstand). In addition to the furniture in the store, which in addition to furniture included lamps & artwork, we were shown their catalog, which contained an even larger selection. After not finding anything I liked anywhere else, I found myself now having to choose between several different bedroom sets.\n\nService at the time of purchase was pleasant and helpful. Once I made my selection, I waited patiently while the cashier called the warehouse to find out if the items were in stock or needed to be special ordered (longer delivery time). I was informed that my items were in stock and would be delivered within 2 weeks. Sadly, this did not happen. In fact, nothing happened. I never heard from them again. When I called them I was informed that my items had to be special ordered, and would not arrive for 3-4 weeks. I was assured I would receive a phone call from the delivery company within that timeframe. 4 weeks later, I called back to find out what was going on. I was told a manager would call me back. I left three additional messages over the next three weeks (each time providing my phone number), before finally speaking with a manager, who informed me that my furniture had arrived the week before. The problem? She said they had wrong phone number on file. If I hadn't provided my phone number 4 times, this could have been a valid excuse. But I did. Each time.\n\nMy furniture finally arrived this afternoon (8 weeks later), and while I love my new bedroom set, the customer service experience left me with a bad taste in my mouth. \n\n4 stars for their furniture, 2 stars for their service.
