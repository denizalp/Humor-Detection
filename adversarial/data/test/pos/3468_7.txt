On our road trip through the Carolinas, we had dinner at Sakura Japanese Steak House in Rock Hill since my friend was really craving some Japanese. This is a good sized restaurant with a sushi bar, lounge, and many hibachi tables (they cook your food in front of you) in several rooms. \n\nWe arrived here around 6:30PM on a typical weeknight and we were seated at the hibachi table just in time with  two parties already seated, a young couple and a larger party of 4 with kids. We looked over the menu which offers hibachi style entrees (steak, chicken, shrimp, scallops, filet mignon, & lobster), sushi, appetizers, soups, and salads. Children's menu is offered, as well as beer, wine, and sake. The prices are moderate, most entrees in the $9 (vegetarian)-$36 (filet & lobster) range. This sounded pretty good, eh?\n\nAppetizers: The Tako Sunomono ($6) was decent which had cucumbers, shredded crab, sesame seeds, very little octopus, and an oily vinaigrette. The Shrimp Tempura ($6) was disappointing for the price tag, 5 small shrimp, deep fried in a light batter (greasy) and served with a soy sauce for dipping.\n\nOur entrees included clear broth and salad. The salads had iceberg lettuce topped with a cold and clumpy ginger dressing with a very sour taste, no good.\n\nThe hibachi chef cooking at our table seemed inexperienced compared to the other chef at the next table who was doing all sorts of tricks. Our chef did not show off his skills that much, he pretty much just quickly banged the spatulas on the grill, cooked the ingredients (vegetables, fried rice, & meats) on the table with lit a wall of flames. AFTER serving everyone at the table, the chef attempted to light an onion tower with little success? I was expecting the onion tower trick while our food was actually being cooked and not AFTER everyone was served their food and eating. \n\nThe entrees Chicken & Scallops Combination ($16 each) tasted good including the fried rice, grilled veggies, tender chicken and soft scallops (not many, I counted only 2). The food was very hot and not too salty.\n\nAfter all parties were finished eating, no one at the table ordered dessert and we were presented with the checks. All parties handed over credit cards (3) with the checks to the server for processing. Moments later, the server handed back our credit cards accompanied by the wrong slip\/checks, a mix up? We definitely did not order $70 worth of food! The server took our credit cards and slips back and re sorted with apologies. I think they got the totals corrected, but I will be keeping a very close eye on my credit card statement soon.\n\nOverall, the appetizers and starters were okay, some disappointing. The hibachi entrees we had were good, but not the greatest we've had. The hibachi show was missing some elements including no egg juggling with spatula, no flipping the shrimp treat into mouths of diners, and no fiery onion tower presentation \"during\" the cooking session. The credit card and checks mix up was unnerving, but mistakes can happen.
