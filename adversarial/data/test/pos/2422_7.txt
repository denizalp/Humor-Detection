I really like Ruth's Chris. I've been to a few different locations, and I've always been impressed with the food & service. This Scottsdale location is no exception.\n\n(+) One of the finest Filet Mignon steaks you're going to eat, brought out to you sizzling in butter. *drool*\n(+) Order the Barbecue Shrimp appetizer. Trust me. Just order it.\n(+) Order the Stuffed Mushroom appetizer too. What, you'll have no room for steak? Dude, make room! Splurge!\n(+) Attentive, professional staff. You won't want for anything. They'll serve and clear on the proper side of the table. They'll place your dessert spoon horizontal to you. You know, all the fancy details.\n(+) Yes, that table bread is delicious, and you'll need it to sop up the sauce that the Barbecue Shrimp came in. ...You did order it, right?\n(+) Great wine selection. And they're honest with their recommendations too (unlike some restaurants that will say anything about a bottle of wine if they think it'll help sell it).\n(+) If you come here on your birthday, they'll sprinkle confetti all over their fancy white table cloth...just for you. Feel special.\n(+) No room for dessert? Yeah, you're gonna have to order the Creme Brulee anyway. Really.\n(-) Super spendy (...for mortals like me anyway). Makes this a special occasion sort of place; but you'll be well satisfied when you do go.
