I don't understand the people who have caused the rating of this place to be so low.  I am not a Thai person, but I know delicious food when I put it in my mouth, and this place is great.\n\nFirst the atmosphere: This is a fairly small place with a warm, pleasant feeling.  It's usually not crowded, so it's not a bad place to go to have a little dinner conversation, and maybe get a little bit romantic.  Maybe move in close with your lover and get some kisses in before you order those spicy dishes.\n\nThe food is great.  Fantastic flavor, good spice (I order 'medium' which is just enough to make me keep reaching for my drink), and reasonable sized portions.  A hungry person can go away fed but not bloated, and someone with a little appetite can have a little to take home!\n\nI pretty consistently order the Beef Drunken Noodles (without onion, because I am a lover and have to keep that fresh breath) which have incredible flavor, and are a dish which I haven't been able to find at a lot of other Thai restaurants.  I definitely recommend it, and if you don't like it then you probably don't know what good food tastes like!
