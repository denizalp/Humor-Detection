Easy enough to locate and navigate, the Tower City RTA station is completely underground. It's in the center and underneath a small shopping center with clothing, food and coffee vendors about. Decent enough signage to find your way down to the tracks area, though I'm glad that I wasn't trying to find my way out the first time I used the station. It's not completely easy to get from the tracks to the right part of the Tower City building.\n\nOn a weekend without the usual heavy traffic, the folks hanging around seemed a little sketchy. But if you keep moving along and ignore the panhandler or two, you'll be fine.
