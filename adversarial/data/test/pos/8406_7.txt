I have a very awesome 1944 WW2  Career Girls Corp folder with photos , pamplets , special coupon for the girls , directions on hand signals , paperwork in how to procedures , drill , news paper articles and more . ALL ORIGINAL.\n\nThere isn't another collection like this out there. \n\nI took it in to the Pawn shop thinking they LOVE history. Bot was I WRONG. \n\nTHEY wanted NOTHING to do with it. Wouldn't even look at it. \n\nI was told , unless it was related to someone famous .\n\nWhat a shame. They could of had a piece of history.
