This review is of the Orange Tree GOLF course and management.  This is NOT a review of the resort\/hotel.\n\nSad to say but very true -- expect a 5 to 5 1\/2 hour round. Calling for a ranger to come out and help move play along brings a tsunami storm of rude treatment from the ranger and the pro shop. It is not a golfer\/customer friendly experience. It's supposed to be fun???  We payed $69\/per player for slow pay (quit after 9 holes -- at times there were 3 foursomes sitting at a tee waiting) and very poor treatment.  Best advice - avoid this place. Too many great courses in the area with quality customer service to waste $$ and time here.\nVisited October 2013
