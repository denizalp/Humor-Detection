Keep it short & sour like my experience. Came in looking for a particular lager with 5 employees on the floor. Not one acknowledged me or asked if I needed help. I finally approached cashier and she looked up and just pointed to approximate location...guess it was too much to ask her to actually find it for me.\nI walked out and crusty old guy at cashier didn't bother to look up to see if I was smuggling liquor out or anything.\nLAZY, LAZY, LAZY!!\nI'll give my business and reviews to Total Wine from now on.
