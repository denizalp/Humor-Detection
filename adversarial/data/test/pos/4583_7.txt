Pros:\n\nThe best bartender in Phoenix, Jonie, is now at the Turf.\nIt's not nearly as dirty as Seamus.\nThe patio is nice.\n\nCons:\n\nWhat's with the feeling that it is a music venue. The most empty space ever. \nIn no way do I feel like I'm in an irish pub. It would be better fitted in say, DC Ranch where old douches could hang out and feel \"Irish\" before they go home and bbq in the back yard while listening to Jimmy Buffett.\nThere is no soul, feeling, or unique aspect of this place whatsoever.
