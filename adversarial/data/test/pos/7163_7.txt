Great spot to eat when the weather is cold, rainy, and if your feeling blue. It had a nice cozy intimate atmosphere with their dim lighting. Very welcoming, friendly service too. However, the seatings are all wood with no butt cushion (ouch) - puts a damper to my back -__- \n\nI recommend: \nSpicy chicken ramen - delicious \nCrispy chicken - double delicious esp with the\nSpicy creamy shrimp tempura - yumm \nLycheetini - tasty alcohol treat!
