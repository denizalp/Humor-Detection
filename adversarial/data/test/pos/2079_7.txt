I have visited other Petcos in the Phoenix area and have always had a great experience. After taking my pets to get groomed at this location for a couple of times I was not satisfied and would tell the staff about what I was unhappy about. They would then do fix what they did wrong. The last time I called to schedule an appointment I was refused service due to the fact that I was never happy with the service. I was refused service due to the fact that I demand my money's worth. It seemed the heavy set woman was the one that wrote in my file not to service me anymore. Very bad experience.
