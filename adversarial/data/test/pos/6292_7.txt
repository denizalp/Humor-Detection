Although better than most fast food options at the MGM food court, Tacos N' Ritas is standard Mexican food.\n\nGiven my frequent visits to MGM Wet Republic this past summer, I have been (un)fortunate enough to try all the food options at the MGM food court.  If I could, I would give the Tacos N' Ritas a four star because relative to the other options in the same food court, it is definitely above the pack.  Plus, considering the amount of food you get, I would say that it is also a pretty good deal.  However, is it four star cuisine?  Not really.\n\nAfter another hot day out at the pool, my friend and I decided to eat here.  Similar to Chipotle, you choose how you want your entree served: burrito, burrito bowl, taco salad, taco, nachos, quesadilla.  From there, you choose your meat to be used.  For example, I chose the taco salad with the chicken meat which was basically an open faced burrito with tons of lettuce.  Again like Chipotle, they asked about different beans, rice, and salsas to add on top. As I mentioned previously, it was solid food with decent flavors.  However, whether this is four star cuisine is highly debatable.\n\nEven with the long line, the service was pretty fast and efficient. \n\nOverall, Tacos N Rita's is better than most, but still just your average Mexican fast food option at the MGM food court.
