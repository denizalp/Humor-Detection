Review number 777. The divine number. This review will be cryptic in nature with numerological undertones. \n\nChina Jade is another restaurant that colleagues have brought me to. If not for them, I probably would have never seen this place or tried it. I am glad I did. The service is terrific. The guys I work with have been coming here for years and they are remembered by the staff. I actually really like the vibe of the place. The front entrance is pretty cool because once you set foot inside that threshold, you have no idea what to expect. It reminds me of Funkadelic \"Standing on the Verge of Getting it On\". Now I will quote Good Thoughts, Bad Thoughts because these lyrics have been heavy on my mind and in my heart:\n\nTravel like a king\nListen to the inner voice\nA higher wisdom is at work for you\nConqering the stumbling blocks come easier\nWhen the conqueror is in tune with the infinite\nEvery ending is a new beginning\nLife is an endless unfoldment\nChange your mind, and you change your relation to time\n\nYou can find the answer\nThe solution lies within the problem\nThe answer is in every question\nDig it?\nAn attitude is all you need to rise and walk away\nInspire yourself\nYour life is yours\nIt fits you like your skin\n\nThe oak sleeps in the acorn\nThe giant sequoia tree sleeps in its tiny seed\nThe bird waits in the egg\nGod waits for his unfoldment in man\nFly on, children\nPlay on\n\nYou gravitate to that which you secretly love most\nYou meet in life the exact reproduction of your own thoughts\nThere is no chance, coincidence or accident\nIn a world ruled by law and divine order\nYou rise as high as your dominant aspiration\nYou descend to the level of your lowest concept of your self\nFree your mind and your ass will follow\n\nThe infinite intelligence within you knows the answers\nIts nature is to respond to your thoughts\nBe careful of the thought-seeds you plant in the garden of your mind\nFor seeds grow after their kind\n\nPlay on, children\n\nEvery thought felt as true\nOr allowed to be accepted as true by your conscious mind\nTake roots in your subconscious\nBlossoms sooner or later into an act\nAnd bears its own fruit\nGood thoughts bring forth good fruit\nBullshit thoughts rot your meat\nThink right, and you can fly\nThe kingdom of heaven is within\nFree your mind, and your ass will follow\n\nPlay on, children\nSing on, lady.\n\n\nChina Jade is not a bad place to go to lunch with co-workers. If I had a family, I would probably take them there.
