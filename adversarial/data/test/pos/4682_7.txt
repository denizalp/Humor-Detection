I've been to many hookah lounges, and on a Thursday night decided to check this place out. My overall experience here was great. The staff is professional, and the service is FAST. The lounge feels modern and they had comfortable seats. I ordered a pineapple mint hookah and their kabob. The hookah was great, and the kabob was the best I've had in any hookah lounge.Definitely coming back again.
