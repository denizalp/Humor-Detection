OMG. Where do I even start with this place? There were so many things wrong with my dinner tonight. I am actually writing this review while still in the restaurant just so I don't forget the numerous culinary horrors that I have succumbed to. Well that...and I am doing this to actually avoid eating more food in hopes that my boyfriend would eventually make rest of the food disappear. OK....enough romance, here are the problems:\n\n1. Misleading menu descriptions: I ordered some chicken fried rice because I love the buttery taste of hibachi style fried rice and the menu promised that it was going to be a small bowl.  What arrived was a mountaneous plate of MSG fried rice.  It was like booking Kate Moss for a fashion show and getting Rosie O'Donnell.\n\n2. Sashimi was warm and poorly cut.  There was actually a small piece bone that was still attached to the salmon belly (which is \"salmon toro\" on the menu - something like this is really insulting to customers' intelligence). \n\n3.  All grill items were overcooked and smothered in the same sauce.  The grilled mackerel was especially terrible; something was definitely not right over here.  The texture of the fish was hard as a rock as if it had been semi-prepared ahead of time and had dried out.  I don't want to spew out cliches like  \"it tasted like cardboard\", but there hasn't been an instance that this simile has been truer. Another dish that proved challenging to my teeth was the negi beef roll.  The green onion used inside the roll was so tough and would not give in no matter how hard I chewed.  I felt like one of those animated cows in a Disney movie that's always chewing disenchantedly before something suddenly happens to which it reacts by widening it eyes.  The only difference is that nothing exciting ever happened to me during this meal.\n\n4. Everything was just kind of stale.  I'm not going to make the a list but this statement is not an exaggeration.\n\n5. This is a little off topic but the music was really off-putting.  I felt like I was in a Chinese rave bar.  I understand that restaurants like to use fast music to get customers to eat faster thus increasing the turnover rate.  However, seeing how the other Japanese restaurants in the area had long waits and Noka was barely half-full despite the the cheap promotional AYCE price, they should try to make the guests stay longer just so it is not obvious that they are getting crushed by the competition.\n\nAll and all we could not finish the food and we were charged for our leftover which we did not even protest to.  This is food that we would pay just to avoid eating it.  I am a seasoned forayer in the world of AYCE sushi and I can say that I have never been charged for over-ordering before. So either I got too excited this time or the quality and quantity ratio was tragically mis-proportioned.  \n\n*On a side note I must say kudos to whoever manages their Facebook account because it makes Noka seem like a place that tries.  After my visit tonight, the only way this restaurant is trying is deliberately sabotaging itself.  I did not come with high expectations and they were not even met half-way.
