I don't drink coffee, but every other month or so I'll need a hot Chamomile tea with 5 agave before I walk into my office. In cooler months, like now, I need a soy milk hot cocoa, no whip (aka vegan hot chocolate), and\/or their hearty blueberry oatmeal (with 5 agave).  \n\nBeing that I only get the hot cocoa seasonally, I do tend to forget how to order it vegan when that time of the year rolls around again.  Sometimes I get a really great and friendly guy who is more than happy to help me. Sometimes  I get the sourpuss dude, who probably hates vegans because his last significant other was vegan and it brings back bad memories or something, so he is annoyed by my vegan requests and my requests for 5 agave. \"5?\" said with an attitude. Yes, 5. Shall I help you count them out? 4 isn't enough, but I don't like the # 6, and 7 is too many, so 5 it is.\n\nTheir hot oatmeal is a solid, healthy breakfast choice. They use water, not cream\/milk, so it's dairy-free.  The agave is an awesome natural sweetener (too little agave and it's not edible for me). I also love the fresh blueberries that come on the side with the Blueberry Oatmeal.  They have a classic oatmeal available if blueberries aren't your thing. \n\nThe worst thing about this location is the location.  The parking lot is so small\/tight that if you get there at the wrong time you're likely to be either sticking out in the middle of the street (and you KNOW these PHX drivers will hit you and flee!), or fighting for your rightful place in the drive-thru line with some car that came from nowhere and is trying to bombard their way in front of you.  They need a  bigger space.
