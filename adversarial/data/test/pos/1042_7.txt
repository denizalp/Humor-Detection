My dining companion and I visited This store around 5 pm.  As we entered, the cook and a server exited the building with individuals who appeared to be friends of the staff.\n\nImmediately after sitting down, our server asked if we were ready to order or if we needed more time.  After telling her that we needed time she quickly walked away, without taking a drink order.  I watched the parking lot and saw the server having a conversation with someone at their car; the cook had to be summoned inside several minutes after our order was made.  My companion and I were the only customers in the restaurant.\n\nOnce the three person team was reassembled they were invested more in personal conversation rather than the task at hand.  At some point, we lost visuals on the servers and when the cook hollered \"Order up!\" the servers we nowhere to be found.  He brought it to us, annoyed, after about a half minute of him calling for the servers.\n\nMy companion ordered a side salad, bacon and a strawberry waffle.  I ordered a triple smothered, covered and capped hash browns.  The salad was full of yellowed iceberg lettuce and over ripe tomatoes.  His waffle was overcooked and the strawberry sauce inside crystallized making pebble like pieces.  However, the most shocking part was my hash browns.  The platter full of beautifully browned potatoes was horribly scarred by a single slice of processed cheese that appeared to have encountered a nuclear melt down. There were no onions.  When I brought it up the server admitted that she did not write it down.  The cook did offer to correct the mistake but I was far enough into the dish that the lack of onions was less heartbreaking than the deception of smothered in cheese. \n\nIn retrospect, we should have left.  We witnessed the servers play with a puppy in the parking lot.  We overhead gossip.  My iced tea refill was simply a cup of tea. The salad had browned leaves hidden within.  Any time I tried to get the attention of the staff they were busy doing something other than work.  \n\nWe left confused and stunned as to what really transpired during our meal.  I am a customer who enjoys a relaxed environment however I still have the expectation of manners.  If I don't text during my meal, my expectation is that my server will restrain as well.  I expect a quality of food that's equal to or BETTER than what I can make at home.  My expectation is food that's better than what you can find in a frat house, especially from an established budget eatery!
