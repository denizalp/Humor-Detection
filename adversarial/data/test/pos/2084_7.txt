I love this chicken joint!  The only disappointment in this place is its so far from where we live and it's the only one in town. The chicken, mayonnaise and cranberry is the bomb!  The drive thru is a tight squeeze coming in and out but when the food hrs my taste buds I forget about the drive and the drive thru.  That's all I have to say about that.
