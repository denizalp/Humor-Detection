Second visit! Be warned they don't take reservations so be prepped to either wait or grab a drink in the meantime. Me being the boring individual that I am, I opted for going to grab drinks at the Peculiar Rabbit next door. After all, turn down for what?\n\nWe received a text promptly at 7:45 as promised (approx. 45 min wait) and we headed on over. We were given the choice to either sit in a booth or at high top table. Our server arrived immediately to get our drink orders. I had a Moscow Mule (vodka, lime and ginger beer) which was absolutely delicious! \n\nFor tapas we got: Rocky Mountain Oysters, lamb lollipops, ahi tuna skewers and the Napoleon roll. Between the tenderness and seasoning the lamb lollipops are definitely a dish I will get again! (Sorry Mary, we ate your lamb). The sesame and soy drizzle on the seared tuna was delicious, I felt like licking the skewers! And the sushi consisted of tuna, cream cheese and jalape√±os lightly fried...OMG it was the best sushi roll I've had in a while. Now step lightly with the Rocky Mountain oysters because you might just get tea bagged! No seriously, they are the TESTICLES OF BULL CALVES! These are not for me (I'm a texture person and these were NOT firm to say the least) but rumor is a lot of people enjoy them here routinely...if it wasn't for the ranch...hmm testicles in ranch...yeah I'm going to leave that one there. To each his own! \n\nOverall the food and drinks were absolutely amazing! And the atmosphere dim and intimate, while the elevated music put off a nice vibe! If you're looking for a great time, Soul is where it's at! \n\nYou're welcome.
