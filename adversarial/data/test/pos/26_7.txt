I had some time to kill before the doors opened for Something Rotten. Was in the mood for some coffee so I stopped here briefly. All Starbucks are virtually the same. I noticed that you can preorder through an app on your phone. In addition to their expressos, lattes, teas, coffee and iced drinks they have grab and go food and various pastries for sale.\n\nI asked for the Verona blend which I knew was the Valentine blend but they were closing so I ended up with Pike's peak. They do have the Verona blend for sale. This Starbucks has a very small seating area.\n\nFortunately since the place was closing soon there really wasn't a line so I got my coffee and sat and relaxed. I normally get the small size which is just enough for me. It tastes like regular coffee and it warmed me up on a chilly night.\n\nThis Starbucks is around the corner from the Benedum Center. They close at 6:30 so it is not a place to hang out before an evening performance. Still it met my needs and was quite pleased with my visit.
