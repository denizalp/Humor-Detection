In a casino full of great bars, this is my hands down favorite.\n\nWhen you walk in, it's like walking into a litebright...there are LED's all over, and they move with the music that is usually being spun by a great DJ.\n\nEvery bar in The Cosmopolitan has it's own specialty cocktail menu, all their drinks are hand crafted and run around $10. The service can be a little slow at times, but it is a great place to sit back and enjoy a drink.\n\nThe bar is right on strip level, and if you get a table or couch that looks at the front windows the people watching can be quite fun.\n\nAnother highlight of the bar is the Go Go Dancers, above the bar, facing the strip are 5 large areas where they lift Go Go Dancers up into the sky and they dance it their own little sphere.\n\nI have been here a few times and have enjoyed it every time, this is one of my go to spots in the Cosmo.
