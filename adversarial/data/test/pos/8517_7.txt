I just can't anymore...at least not for coffee.  Maybe for a protein box and spritzer.  We stopped in to this location while in the area because we had a gift card.  The location was pretty cool.  There aren't many stand alone Starbucks out there so that made this somewhat unique.  Unfortunately, it isn't located in the best area of town.  It does have a nice patio with misters as well as a pretty cool conference room, so the establishment itself deserves a star.  Unfortunately, our orders didn't quite hit the mark, as usual.  Our caramel iced coffee with cream tasted like iced milk and I should know better by now not to order one of those nasty premade breakfast sandwiches.  Basically, Starbucks is the McDonalds of coffee and I'm not quite sure why I keep going back.
