I am at this hotel a lot for work.  The folks at the front desk put up with a lot with all of us.  Our contract offers them a steady income but we get the rooms for a discounted price - so at some hotels we get treated with a tiny bit of disdain.  Not here!\n\nJust about every time I come Thurman is at the front desk,  I've said this in previous reviews, my ancient history includes having been a Dir of HR so I always notice customer service.  Thurman is exceptional.  He treats all of us with the utmost professionalism and I watch him with all the other guests and he is always professional.\n\nI've had a few glitches while staying here and Thurman always listens and responds immediately.  With a solution\/fix and a sincere apology.\n\nIf i were traveling for pleasure, in this area, I would def stay here.  The rooms are nice, clean, there is a good restaurant downstairs and it is close to a couple of good restaurants and convenience stores.  They have an airport shuttle that runs frequently.
