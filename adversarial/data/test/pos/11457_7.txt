Ew.  All I can say is ew.   I want to preface this review with the concession that I have only been here three times.  I am going to harshly criticize the barrista I had on my last two visits, and I recognize that others may be better.  But she deserves to be mentioned, and I think that I am not the only one that had this problem.\n\nOk, so I went in on Labor Day. I get it, she wanted to be at home with her bestie drinking a margarita by the pool.  I would have preferred that myself, but I had a huge test on Tuesday morning, and I was using my day off to study.\n\nI order a coffee.  I ask for a large Americano.  She puts a large paper cup in front of me and I ask her if I could have it in a ceramic cup, I'm staying and I don't want to use the resources.  She tells me that she doesn't have any clean cups.   I am the only one in line, so I tell her that I don't mind waiting, I will sit down and get situated, and she can wash one. She points to the room behind me, and tells me that it's Labor Day, she is alone in here and it's packed.\n\nOk, lady. I get it.  Full house.  But everyone is drinking their coffee, there is no crazy line at the counter.  There is no line at all at the counter. I can only assume that if you are out of cups, the very first thing you are going to do when I walk away is wash some.  I am letting you know that I am willing to wait. \n\nBut I don't say this, I say, \"There are ceramic cups right behind you.\"  \"Those are mediums,\" she says.  \"You ordered a large.\"  She is really, really not getting the big picture.  I just want a damn coffee in a freaking ceramic cup, so I can feel civilized while not making a bigger carbon footprint in the process and study for my anatomy exam.\n\n\"That's fine\" I say, \"I will have it in a medium cup.\"  She gives me a quarter back, which is apparently the difference between ad large and a medium.  Turns out choosing the medium cup was a mistake, apparently Lola bought her coffee cups based on style, not function.  They are ridiculously wide and shallow,. so it's kind of like moving a huge saucer to your lips trying to slosh some coffee into your face. I used about five napkins trying to wipe up the coffee that spilled all over the table (so much for not wasting paper) when I tried to set it down.  It tasted terrible, probably due to the horrible taste in my mouth left over from dealing with the barrista-from-hell.  \n\nSo after finally settling in, I realize that this is the worst place in the world to study. Or to sit, or to read, or to talk to someone.   Too tall, no sound absorbers, I can hear every single thing being said around me.   I don't know how to descibe it other than bad energy in there, kind of...uptight.  Like everyone else felt as uncomfortable as I did. \n\nI actually got up and left a full cup of coffee (minus what spilled).  The whole thing was just so bad, I wanted to get the hell out of there.    Even though it is right down the street from me, and it looks beautiful, I will never, ever go back in.
