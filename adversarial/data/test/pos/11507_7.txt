Yeesh. The server was friendly and the place was open at 10pm. But it looks tired and dirty. From overuse not neglect. You have families with babies who drop fries all over the floor, spilled drinks, you name it. As for the food...must you ask? It's all the same, Chili's, TGIF, Applebee's, they get all their stuff from the same supplier. If you're a tourist, it's edible.
