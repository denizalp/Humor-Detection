I am very happy to see a rocket fuel station in the area. Located just off the 215, the drive thru seems to be in proper working order.  The staff is friendly.  The coffee is all I give a damn about.  It's quality is that of any other DD.  The building design is rather funky as it shares the same building as \"Molly's.\"  You need some caffeine assistance at what ever the hour of the day it is, DD is there to assist.
