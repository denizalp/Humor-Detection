I've done several arrangements with Flora Unique now and it's nice to say this place still rocks. I unfortunately know these things because I am a very frequent patron of the doghouse.\n\nRachel is very helpful, and will be more than happy to do arrangements with a more modern feel that really set themselves apart.
