This place is disgusting. Why is this restaurant still open??? They are basically promoting obesity by offering free meals to anyone over 350lbs!!! How can serving a burger called \"triple bypass surgery\" be appetizing??? With all the obesity in america the last thing we need are people eating burgers over 9k calories!!!! This is a disgrace and I am shocked people even think about eating at this morbid place.
