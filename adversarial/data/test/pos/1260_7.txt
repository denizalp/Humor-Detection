Rented from 09\/08\/14 thru 09\/16\/2014. Pickup from EA was poor. The vehicle was not available and a wait time of 45 minutes was incurred. The response from the one person working was \"a big storm hit and no one rought back cars\".  Seemed odd with no flight delays or cancellations from the big storm. \n\nThe return was terrible. I will take responsibility for leaving some of my lady's jewelry in the car. Yes I was in a hurry due to flight changes at the last minute. When we boarded the plane she realized that she had left the jewelry in the center console.  As soon as we landed I contacted National and was referred to the LV location. I contacted them and left several messages describing the items, car, rental agreement, etc. after two days we received a call back and provided the same info again (this call was received after multiple messages were left).  Finally we received National's response:  no items were found in the car, have a good day. \n\nBasically I understand I am responsible for the items but come on.  I am sure that if it was a GPS or cell phone the item would have been located. But it's nearly impossible to trace jewelry. If your cleaning crew are so underpaid that they have to resort to theft, consider offering them a higher wage to avoid these incidents (I am sure that there are many unreported incidents Iike this) in the future.
