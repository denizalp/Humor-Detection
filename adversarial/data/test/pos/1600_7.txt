I used to go to this sandwich shop all the time in Planet Hollywood. Last night was my first time at the Downtown Summerlin location and it wasn't close to as good as I remember. I always stick to the All American; Turkey, cranberry sauce, American cheese, and ranch on their signature bread. This time dining here last night the sandwich wasn't hot like usual, it was Luke warm at best and I think I got a touch of mild food poisoning. Andy also felt bad after he had his Italian Sandwich. Not too sure what happened here but I'll give this location 1 more try in the future.
