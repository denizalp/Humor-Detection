This small Tim Hortons counter shares the space with the gas station across Hotel 10.\n\nPerfect location for me to walk across the street each morning and bring back coffee and donuts to fuel up on for the day's vacation fun.\n\nTasty iced and hot coffee, and of course pretty good donuts. Some other pastry items like muffins, cookies, and a few other things to munch on.\n\nFast and friendly service too. The station and some characters around it can seem kind of sketch but harmless enough. No tables to sit at anyway so it's just a grab and go joint.
