Don't waste your time or money at this place. I also read the reviews & tried to give it a chance. The meat sandwiches are just meat & bread only with their logo burnt into the bread. The meat was very dry. The loaded baked potato was not too bad. No direction, no greeting, just staff that didn't know what was going on. 2nd trip was today. Ordered the loaded baked potato again, to go. Got home, & found out that I just paid $9 for a plain potato with little to none brisket on it. That was it. It was not loaded or what I ordered so I called to speak to a manager. I heard the man that answered tell whoever that this lady wants to speak to a manager, he repeated it & then hung up on me, on purpose Cuz when I called back, same thing happened.\n\nThen I get a reply from the supposed manager. Talk about lies! Lol and southern hospitality? You're kidding me. More like lack of. I'm was not trying to sink your restaurant you fool, and like you wrote, a free world so my review was the truth & advising people not to waste their time with your rudeness. Now, have a nice day and no, I will never be back and will continue to share my experience and show people your comment back to me.
