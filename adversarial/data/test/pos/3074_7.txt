Are you people insane this was the worst sushi bar I have been to in my life.  Really every roll has imitation crab! Really how good is your fish if you have to pair it with fake crab.  Half the rolls had the very Japanese ingredient of Mayo.  Maybe they hope the sushi newbs will be too drunk off sake or distracted by AYCE that they don't notice that fresher fish can be had at Little Darlings.  SO DISGUSTING!  \n\nI sent the spider roll back. \n\nThe veggie rice was butter rice.\n\nThe soup was mysterious in the way one wonders if fluffy is missing.  \n\nYou know why it is empty because most of their clients are sitting at the home throne hoping to forget Krazy Sushi.
