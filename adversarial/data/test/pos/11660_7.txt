I have never had a good experience here. ALL of the employees are condesending and belittling. Today I walked in, was not greeted, was not offered any help or anything. Just stared at by the employee. When I told him I need a new tube he says (verbatim) \"Do you want me to install it or what?\" \n\nI may be new to cycling but I don't need to be treated like some sort of child. \n\nThe time I was there today I had a similar experience. No help offered. No help received. Just belittling and asshole employees. \n\nTAKE YOUR TIRE PUMP AND SHOVE IT!\n\nI will never step in your store again.
