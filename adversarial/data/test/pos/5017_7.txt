If you'd like to find all of the \"Real Housewives of Summerlin,\" just stop in here on any weekday!! I was in there on a Wednesday morning at 9AM and this place was poppin'!! I couldn't even believe it.\n\nAll jokes aside, it's a really nice space. It's very large and you don't feel like the stylist next to you is on top of you while doing their client's hair. Homa is my stylist there and she visits about once a month from LA to work out of Atelier. She is super busy while she is there and she is also totally amazing!!\n\nOverall, I really like the salon and luckily I am not very high maintenance, so I don't have to travel that far (I live in Henderson) very often!
