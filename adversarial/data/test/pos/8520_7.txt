I've been looking for a bar like Beerhaus in Vegas for a while, if only it wasn't on the strip! Beerhaus has an amazing selection of beers (if only their ciders list was longer!) with many being straight from the breweries here in town and from Reno. The ones from in-state are even printed in a different color for easy ordering! How could you come here and not want to try one of our local brews? \nThere is a ton of bar seating, indoor and outdoor tables. The best part of Beerhaus is their selection of games. Two cornholes outside, jenga and connect 4 on almost every table, a ping pong table, shuffle board and even checkers. It's the perfect spot to come with friends and hang out. The beers are on the cheaper end (for the strip, of course). $6-12? They have  happy hour from 4-6P and 10P to closing. $4 featured beers and snacks during the 4-6P, $4 snacks during the 10P- closing. \nI played cornhole, jenga, checkers, shuffleboard... okay I played everything. The bar was pretty empty on Tuesday night and we didn't have to wait to play anything. I'll have to come back to try the snacks- you have to order them at the counter on the side, they won't take your order at the bar! Park at the New York New York for fastest parking- don't forget they're charging for parking on event nights!
