Excellent customer service and expert work!  This place is well worth the drive to have your tint done right the first time.   \n\nI recently had a bad tint job at a place in Gilbert.  My four roll down windows were okay, but the tint on the top of the front windshield and the rear windshield had gaps where I could see daylight.  I paid a lot of money and was pretty peeved about the gaps.  Luckily, they were very professional and admitted that this was the best they could do and offered to remove the tint that I was unhappy with as well as refund me $200 and included a gift certificate. \n\nLucky for me, Stewart from Smart Film said he could do the job right.  He did verify the other company's story about it being difficult to install tint on the rear windows on a truck like mine and that my truck's windshield could break in the process of removing my rear view mirror which is why the other place had to leave a gap. \n\nI took my truck to Smart Film yesterday and I am thrilled with the results.  Installation is perfection...no gaps or bubbles.  He didn't want to charge me as he felt bad for my having such a bad experience, but I insisted he at least take the $200 I got back from the other place.  \n\nI'm so glad to have the job done right after having to take my truck into another shop 3 times.  The truck looks great.  My faith in the goodness of humankind is renewed and I found the best tint shop.  I will forever be thankful, hail praises and recommend them to everybody.  They take great pride in their quality work and have superb customer service.  \n\nStewart and his staff were very friendly and welcoming.  They have a nice waiting area and are located on the NW corner of McKellips and Power in the Home Depot parking lot next door to Port of Subs.   (I mention this, because I was without my cell phone and accidently drove past it.)
