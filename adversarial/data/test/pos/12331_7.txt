My gal pal and I decided to stop here after dinner to get a boba drink. I had not been here previous and was a bit nervous as to what I should order. I was praying that I did not order a boba drink that I may not like and that would be disappointing.\n\nLuckily I finally decided on the rose milk with boba after reviewing the menu which has a lot of beverage options.\n\nMy drink was the perfect amount of sweet and I truly enjoyed it which was really like a perfect dessert after just having ramen for dinner.\n\nThe prices are for sure high for what you get, my \"small\" rose milk with boba was 5.75 which is more expensive than my favorite \"large\" drink at Starbucks, ouch!!!\n\nI will be back after I hit the Lottery or a Vegas Jackpot so that way I can order a large drink to enjoy!
