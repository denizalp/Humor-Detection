Understaffed. Wait time to purchase clothes, lately, has become so incredibly long and painful (only one register open). Crappy, loud, music and a claustrophobic store layout only adds to the aggravation. Their Sales signs are sometimes vague and misleading...so \"watch out\"...Check your receipt before you leave. :(  We liked the store at first but have come to realize the clothing  is cheap in quality but still overpriced\/ marked-up approx 500 Percent. We can find similar stuff online without the pain of waiting in endless lines, so ...We give up trying to buy stuff here.
