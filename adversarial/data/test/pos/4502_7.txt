I love french food and really wanted to like Le Cirque.  I would say my experience here was consistent with the experience I had with Le Cirque in NYC.  Its a good place to have a quiet, intense conversation where the only thing you really want to remember from the meal is the conversation.\n\nWe came here as a party of 3 to try various dishes.  We all thought the meal was fairly forgettable outside of some pretty instagram pictures.  The presentation was 5 star. The taste was 3. The cost, we felt, was inflated by the yelp reviews and its michelin namesake from NYC.\n\nIf you're inside Bellagio, would recommend booking Michael Mina instead (which, though not french, has a ton of hudson valley foie gras).  If you're yearning for french food, try Bardot at the Aria.
