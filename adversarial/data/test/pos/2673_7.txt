It was pretty confusing.  There are separate lines for different types of meats or fries.  Stand in the line of the meat you want to order and don't be a noob like me and stand in the shortest line.  I realized there were separate lines once I looked up and noticed that there were signs haha. \n\n\nVAMPIRO:  I ordered an asada vampiro. It's kind of like a tostada with melted cheese and a special salsa.  It was really good.  The crispiness of the tostada and the taste of the melted cheese is an awesome combo!!\n\nCARNE ASADA TACOS: A safe choice.  And I wasn't disappointed. These met my standards and were comparable to the taco trucks in LA.\n\n\nIt's pretty cool to experience and it's pretty affordable.  As chaotic as it gets in there, they have a decently organized system.  Seating is available outside under their covered patio.  Parking can also be limited, but we got lucky during the time we went. I definitely want to come back and try their carne asada fries!!
