Completely awful experience! My appointment was for 9:30. My husband and I arrived at 9:20. After giving my name I waited about thirty minutes for a check in and it was not until 11:30 that we saw Dr. Rimoldi. Anyone considering to go see him, DON'T!!! He shouts at you, asks you questions, while you respond he cuts you off, and never even gave me the opportunity to ask any questions. He used the same scripted talk with me as well as the person before me. We could hear everything he told the person prior to me and then heard it again when he yelled it at us. I highly suggest nobody go see him. I definitely would never even allow him to give me a shot let alone a serious surgery.
