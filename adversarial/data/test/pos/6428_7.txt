There are many things I like about Zada Jane's - in concept.  They're in my neighborhood, which means when I wake up craving brunch I don't have to drive across town.  They have a variety of vegetarian options (I'm not a vegetarian, but I'm not a heavy meat-eater either).  They use local sources for their food.  They have a funky and eclectic d√©cor.  They have free coffee while you wait for a table.  \n\nUnfortunately, whenever I go there, the reality tends to play out like this: I wake up craving brunch, but when I get there the line out the door.  It's so chaotic inside that it takes me ten minutes to find someone to put my name on the list.  I fight my way through the throng to get some coffee only to discover there aren't any coffee cups.  Then I wait so long for a table that by the time I sit down I could have driven across town, eaten somewhere else and gotten back home again.  And that's not even counting how long it takes for my food to come out.  When my food finally does arrive, every other time it's overcooked or undercooked, or it tastes like someone spilled a whole salt shaker in my hash browns.  But I eat it anyway, because there is no way I'm sending anything back and waiting for it to be cooked again.  And then I wait....and wait...AND WAIT for my server to remember I'm there and bring me my check.  By the time I leave I've lost three hours, and I'm not even fat and happy.  (Just fat.)\n\nThere's no denying this is a popular place, but sometimes I wonder if other people are having a different experience from mine, or if they've decided they love it so they put up with the slow service and the inconsistencies with the quality of the food.  \n\nWhatever the case may be, my husband and I have decided not to waste our time on Zada Jane's anymore.  We've had too many broken-hearted brunches to let ourselves be hurt again.  We've found a new brunch spot - Foskoskies on Shamrock.  We have yet to be disappointed there.
