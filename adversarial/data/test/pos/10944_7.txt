The place screams average. Portions are small and don't match the price. The food is not fresh. For e.g. they have their chicken cooked and a \"bucket\" of butter chicken\/paneer sauce sitting on the counter which they add on the chicken\/paneer when you order. Shouldn't they be cooking the chicken in the sauce? No wonder the flavour is not there. The food is loaded with cayenne\/red chili powder, gave me heart burn the rest of the day. The owner is not friendly. And the worst part, there were only 2 tables occupied in the restaurant and still they took 25 minutes to bring us our food. (we ordered 3 rolls in total) I don't understand why they take that long when they don't even cook the food fresh. Much better options in the area. I'd choose Kothur any day over TKRE. They're just across the street.\n\n********************************************************************************\nEDIT - The owner (presumably) sent me a personal message the same day I posted this review. Please read :)\n\nLove how he comments on my appetite and guts. Lol. \n********************************************************************************\n\nDear Mr Vin,\n\nSorry to know that your experience at Kathi Roll was average.\n\nYou dont have a picture so I dont when did you come to our store.However I was keen to reply to your review :\n\nThe place screams average. Portions are small and don't match the price. \n\nWe have priced our portions very competitively,though we cant contest an appetite.\n\nThe food is not fresh.\nThe Food is 100% fresh,and that contradicts your review  it took us 25 minutes to bring your food.Why would we have to sit on your food for 25 minutes.\n\nThe food is loaded with cayenne\/red chili powder, gave me heart burn the rest of the day. \nButter Chicken doesnt have Cayenne Pepper,as we know the spices that we use.\n\nThe owner is not friendly. \nWould like to understand ,why do you feel so.\n\nMuch better options in the area. I'd choose Kothur any day over TKRE. \nYou are more than welcome to choose any other option over us as you have formed an opinion.\n\nWe welcome reviews ,criticism and suggestions.Because of our customers ,their suggestions ,understanding their needs and providing them service,we have been able to reach this far today with over 100 k rolls sold withover 60 k customers in our store.\n\nHowever we cannot appreciate the customer who doesn't have the guts to come and talk to restaurant staff directly,to let them know about their service & their product,and give them an opportunity to rectify their mistake if any.You may be perfect,we are not ,we try to do our best and try to succeed most of the times.\n\nThanks,\n\nKathi Roll Express
