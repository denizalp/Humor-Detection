There are some great places to eat at in this place - Craft Steak and Shibuya, so we of course came here on a recent visit. The hotel is older so don't expect the ventilation to be the best. I'm still bummed that they ditched the lion habitat back in 2011. The casino floor is massive and I feel like the signage is poor. It's difficult to find the monorail and restaurants. This location is a bit too far down on the strip for my liking to stay but I'll be back to eat.
