To start off, what really upset me right away was the sign that says 15% gratuity is MANDATORY (obviously on the full amount of the package). I have immediate dislike for any place that makes a tip mandatory. If I like the work, I tip, if I don't then I shouldn't be obligated. So before we even started I had to pay extra $25 and change PER PERSON in tip and taxes.\n\nThe other factor is that the place is tiny. That's one of the reasons they have to bookso far ahead - because they can literally only take two people at a time. Due to some miscommunication, we thought that they can take three people - while one is doing the mani\/pedi the other two can do a massage, then switch. No, turns out the third person would have to wait their turn. And then the first two would have to wait for her to finish. Thankfully, they had a cancellation for the weekend after and we managed to get a third person in for then to minimize the lost time.\n\nAs they havevery little space, the massage tables are in the same room. I was there with my sister and mom, but what if I was there with a friend or a colleague? I don't know if I would be comfortable being almost naked in the same room with them! Anyway, got the massage, it was ok.\n\nAs we left the massage room, just outside of it is a little niche with two chairs. Imagine a size of a car's interior - that is the size of that niche. With the two chairs right next to each other. Two water containers - one in front of each of the chairs. When I asked whether we are doing mani or pedi first, they said, well you are going to sit in that chair and soakyourfeet while we do the mani - then finish off the pedi. Sat in the chair and on top they put one of those laptop\/snack portable tables with the hard top and cushion-y bean-y bottom. And then they use that to do the mani. So imagine it - your feet are in a soaker, and on your knees you have a porta-table where your mani is being done. Any movement, shift the knees, etc, and everything wobbles. Then after they are done with the manicure, they proceed with the pedicure, but the wall is so close behind them, they can't really push back far enough. For someone tall like me - it was TORTURE to sit there. Everything is so crammed in, that every time they look for tools or what not, they run the risk of smudging the nails - which is exactly what happened.\n\nAnd as far as the quality of the mani\/pedi, that was really sub-par. The cost on their menu is $20 and $40 - and I would never ever pay that much for their mani\/pedi. I get better quality in my neighborhood for $25 for both.\n\nA) Do not like the fact that the tip is mandatory (and I do know it is not included, I just want it to be left up to me to decide how much l like the service)\nB) The place is so tiny it look like a hole in the wall\nC) The quality of mani\/pedi is not worth it\nD) The entire place just has a sub-par feel to it.\n\nI have to say the girls were sufficiently nice, but just not a good quality spa.
