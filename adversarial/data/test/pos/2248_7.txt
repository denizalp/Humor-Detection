Salad was as good as always and the bartenders who were taking care of us were very nice, but we had a few mishaps.  Our stuffed mushroom were undercooked, but they put them back in for a few more minutes so the cheese was nice and hot and toasted and then they were perfect!  I really enjoyed them!\n\nUnfortunately, my chicken marsala tasted burnt (not the actual chicken, but the sauce) and I had to send it back.  At that time, it was getting late, so I didn't want anything else.  My husband had the unlimited pasta and chose the fettucini with meat sauce.  He said it was ok, but only had one plate.\n\nWe will come back for unlimited salad and breadsticks.  Never disappoints.
