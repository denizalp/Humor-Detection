Do you need to wire money to Nigeria while eating a delicious burrito and shopping for a new bong? This is your dream store! Do you need brass knuckles, a digital scale that looks like an iPhone 3 and Carne asada fries that will knock your socks off? Come on down! This place seriously can do everything you've ever dreamed of. The service is top notch. Dine in, carryout, holidays, mornings and evenings. If I could count how many times I've eaten a 5 dollar double cheeseburger while cashing paycheck here it would be a lot.
