Nice laid back store that is neatly stocked.  Fresh produce and the meats are as well. You may run into a few panhandlers out front, but I'm sure by now you're used to that in many locations.\n\nThe cashiers are friendly and heck they even have a slot machine room in the front of the store.  Go ahead and turn that twenty dollar bill into a 5lb bag of potatoes. \n\nThe aisles are wide enough, allowing better traffic flow than some freeway bottlenecks and the floors are shiny clean like you like them. \n\nAlbertsons is A-OK.
