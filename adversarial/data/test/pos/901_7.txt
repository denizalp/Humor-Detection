I came out on Friday night for karaoke, and ended up having some drinks and food.\n\nFirst of all, Chris, the bartender, was awesome.  He let us know about their specials, and he mixes a great Cinnamon Toast shot! (try it, you'll love it.)\n\nMy fella was hungry, and so he ordered the Arancini, which was a fried risotto ball, with meat and cheese inside.  Oh. My. God.  I shouldn't have had any, since it isn't on my diet, but...I had to try it!  It was amazing.  (I really wanted to say \"amazeballs, because they were risotto balls. he he.) So flavorful!\n\nOur server was a sweetheart too, although I don't remember her name. \n\nThe place itself is HUGE, and really nice.  I loved that they have a stage set up for karaoke, and for live music nights. \n\nI only have one tiny \"complaint\", and its more of a note, as a way to improve...I'd LOVE to see a trash can next to the bathroom door...germaphobes like me like to open the bathroom door with a paper towel and it would be nice to be able to dispose of it next to the door.\n\nOther than that, service was spot on, prices were reasonable, and the food\/drinks were great!  Can't wait to come out again for another karaoke night!
