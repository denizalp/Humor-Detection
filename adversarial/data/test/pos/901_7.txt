I'm a little baffled- a place named for seafood has fairly lackluster reviews for their sushi and seafood items. Others have complained about pricing but most rolls average $12 or less, didn't feel like anything was inappropriate. \n\n I wholeheartedly agree with Reggie that the GARLIC BASIL EGGPLANT dish is to die for! Awesome takeout option for Meatless Monday or just when you're craving something lighter- contains several cloves of garlic, crispy for texture and high on flavor. $10 gets you a portion with rice that is easily two meals.
