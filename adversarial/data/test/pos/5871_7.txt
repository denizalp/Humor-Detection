What a complete waste of my time.  I drove 30 miles round trip from Chandler to look at and test drive an X5M and an Infinity QX80 they had listed on Cars.com.  I sat in the lot for 15 min in 100 degree heat with my wife and kids waiting for someone to help us.  They were more interested in dealing with their car deliveries than their customers.  They took another 15 minutes to find the keys.  I could tell the BMW hadn't been driven in a while for very far because the rotors had rust on them and now I know why.  I asked for a test drive.  Justice, the sales manager, said he would only take us around the block.  I thought he was kidding.  No, this is for real.  They apparently will not let you test drive any cars except around the block, no freeway speeds, and they refuse to let us test drive more than 1 car.  What?  I kid you not.  He said either we can test drive the X5M or the QX80 but not both.  I had to make a choice of which car I wanted to take on a test \"drive?\"  So first, why would I (or anyone for that matter) EVER buy a used car you can't drive at freeway speeds?  I just wanted to check for rattles, suspension issues, etc.  Nope.  Not allowed at this dealership.  Second, why would anyone buy a car from a dealer that would only allow you test \"drive\" a single car on their lot?  I have never heard of anything like that.  What a joke!  Justice, the sales manager was completely rude to me.  I finally just told him to forget it and thanked him for wasting my time.  Seriously, I would go to any other dealership than this one to buy a car.  I have been to a lot of dealerships and I have never had as terrible of an experience as I had here.  The sales manager was unhelpful, unfriendly, and un accommodating.  It almost seems like they aren't even interested in actually selling cars, just collecting them.
