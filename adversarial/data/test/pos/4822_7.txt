Great Karaoke 7-days a week right in old-town Scottsdale. Thousands of songs available, and a great place to go with a group of intoxicated friends. This is my favorite karaoke place in town - It can be hit or miss (crowd wise) during the week, but I have had several memorable weeknights here.\n\nDecent food on the patio upstairs, and another bar to get you ready to perform downstairs.\n\n*Note: very, very, very busy on the weekends after 9pm! IF you want to sing a lot go during the week...
