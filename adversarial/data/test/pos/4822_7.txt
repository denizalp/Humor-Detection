This review is about nothing other than the food.  Service = 5 stars.  Management = 5 stars (there were a few fruit flies buzzing around and the manager personally apologized and said they are trying to fix it.. super professional).  Cleanliness = 5 stars.  The only reason I gave the 3 star rating is the food is just food.  Pizza can be done a million different ways that different people enjoy.  That being said... when you get a pizza... you'd expect the toppings to be 'kinda' fresh.  \n\n  We got the Aloha pizza.  Crust was fine.  Sauce was sauce.  Cheese was cheese.  The ham was obviously out of a bag and obviously the ham used for salads.. the little squares.  The pineapple was out of a can.. mushy and bland.  I don't expect the world to stop when I order pizza but this was just normal bland pizza.  Probably gonna stick with Marcos like we usually do in the future.
