I don't know...I really like the MGM Grand Buffet!!\n\nI load up on prime rib and crab legs here with tons of melted butter!!  Oh, yeahhhhhh...sooooooooo, gooooooooood!\n\nThe first time I ate here was about 6\/7 years ago.  We were staying at the MGM for a week, and we ate here for brunch and a late dinner.  Filled my plate with deep fried chicken, mash, prime rib, lasagna, crab, shrimp.....you name it, I ate it!!\n\nI was relatively in shape checking into the hotel...but HOLY COW~!!!!  Upon returning home and weighing myself...I put on a whopping 12 pounds!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Un-freakin-believable!!!!
