This is a wonderful little hole-in-the-wall.  Next door is a laundromat, so it smells soapy fresh when you step outside.\n\nMy burritos came fast and they were really, very tasty.  If you're driving by and you're wondering, \"Should I eat here?\" you should.  For two burritos, I spent a little over 8 bucks.  Not bad at all.
