I live downtown and loved the idea of a new, cool coffeehouse and am still waiting for one to open.  \nOn my first (and only) visit to PublicUs I ordered a cup of coffee and a yummy looking pastry. I was asked how I wanted my coffee. \"Black\" I said. I then started looking for the customer coffee prep area. There didn't seem to be one. I asked and was told that they will prepare my coffee for me.   How do I know how much sugar I want until I taste it for strength and temperature. Hey, coffee is a personal thing. \nThey wouldn't let me prepare my own coffee, so I cancelled my order and left.\nI dislike establishments that think they're better that their customers.
