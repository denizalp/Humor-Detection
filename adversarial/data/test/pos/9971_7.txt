I'll start my review with a warning: If you're on some sort of diet, don't eat here. They give you a ton of food here and all of it is anti-healthy. You're gonna develop your very own Buddha Belly if you keep eating this stuff. I swear my love handles are growing as I type this.\nAll this food doesn't come cheaply of course. It's actually very pricey. I spent about $24 here today (including tip) for my Sloppy Joe, Japanese Curry Fries w\/egg, and a fountain drink. I would normally be Ok with that if the food justified it but....\nEveryone knows I'm a tough critic when it comes to Asian food. It takes a lot for me to go ape-shit. I thought the Japanese Curry Fries had a very \"odd\" taste. I've been thinking for the past hour or so on the right word to describe the taste but I just can't put my finger on it. It doesn't taste like Japanese curry, doesn't taste like fries. The egg tasted like an egg however.\nThe Sloppy Joe also had an \"interesting\" taste. Now I want to be as fair as possible, so I'm gonna say that it could be just my personal taste that is not accepting this food. The person next to me (who wasn't Asian... Don't know if that matters) told the server that his sandwich was the best he's ever had. So.... the fairest thing I could possibly say is try it for yourself. It's definitely worth one visit.
