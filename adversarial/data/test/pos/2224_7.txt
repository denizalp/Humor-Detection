Oh my. Pistachio-crusted Arctic char, plated at just the right temperature and paired with a light, crisp 2013 La Vieille Ferme. What's more, I couldn't pass up this dessert: maple pecan pie with vanilla bean mousse. Mmm. I haven't had a fish entree executed so well in some time. Big Fish is appropriately named! Stay away if you don't like fish. Seriously.
