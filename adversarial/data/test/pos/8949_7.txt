(Lyrics - Ice Cube - Today Was a Good Day)\n\nJust walking to Delux gotta thank god\nI didn't know they serve sushi that's kinda odd\nNo parking from streets, no prob\nAnd they're cooking up some burgers with plenty of hogs (or bacon!)\nI got my grub on, but didn't pig out\n\nFinally got a some yam fries that I wanna try out\nHooked it up for later as I hit the shots\nThinking will I live it up, for another happy hour\nDon't wanna go cause I had me some beer flights\n\nAnd if I hit the streets, I can get a DUI\nHad to stop to get another bite\nLooking in my mirror and was redder than a beet\nBut everythings alright\n\nI got a mini burger, and it's for happy hour all night\nCalled up the yelpers and I'm reviewing y'all\nWhich soup, do you want to try out at all?\nGet me in Delux and that's no trouble\nLast week Yelped around and got a duo burger\nKetchup and chipotle sauce all the way\nYou gotta believe today was a Delux Day\n\nA Delux day all day everyday!  Yes, Delux is staple burger joint of Phoenix for some times now and now serving Sushi!  Located next to the Biltmore area, Delux burger is known to have a great happy hour and late night eats.  \n\nThe place is always popping when I attend.  The blue lighting totally weird me out, but it's alright.  I've never came here for breakfast or lunch; needless to say I'm sure it's pretty damn good cause I know the late night menu is awesome.  Craft beer and flights is a must and your fries come in a mini shopping cart!  Don't understand the concept behind it, but it's a whole lot of fries I tell you that much; generally served with a side of ketchup or chipotle.  The burgers here are no joke and one of the best in town.  Nice and moist and the condiment pairings are second to none!  Overall, Delux is a great place to hangout for drinks as well as enjoy a great meal. \n\nService here is always the best and always a welcoming smile. - Enjoy!
