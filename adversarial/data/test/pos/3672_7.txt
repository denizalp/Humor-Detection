I had only been to this gym a handful of times, and I can say that it's not bad! \n\nIt's not the mega-gym and full of douche that the typical Scottsdale fitness facility will have, like, say LA Fitness or 24-Hour, but the gym has everything you need: cardio, weights, classes, etc.\n\nMy first experience was a visit for a class, and it wasn't as challenging as I would have hoped, but that's ok. I can always do my own thing in the gym. The owner seemed quirky, but rather friendly.\n\nThen, I started work next door and got a free membership here. I had a chance to visit a handful of times before I got the hell out of Dodge, and the gym went through some nice upgrades. \n\nIt's a little far from where I used to live in Scottsdale, so that is why I didn't pursue a membership here, but if I lived in this area, Fitness Experience would've been decent spot for me to get my swoll on.
