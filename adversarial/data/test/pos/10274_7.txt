Thanks to Cox Cable, the Coyotes v Blackhawks playoff games are only being televised on Fox Sports AZ Plus (whatever the hell that is). I am an optimist though, so while I won't be able to watch the Stanley Cup Playoffs this year at least I have the Lifetime channel, which makes my $100 monthly cable bill totally worth it! Long story short I had to go to a friends house to watch the game. On my way over there I decided to stop and pick up a pizza. My friend is a vegetarian so I had to pick something tasty yet humane that we would both enjoy while watching the ensuing hockey bloodbath. I ordered a large Julius & Darius with Feta Cheese, Assorted Olives, Tomatoes, Roasted Peppers and Saut√©ed Onions. It was fantastic. The ingredients were nicely balanced. Every bite had subtle hints of each flavor including the sublime tomato sauce. The Coyotes ended up winning, the pizza was great and the Tecate was cold so if it wasn't for my crazy dog pissing on my friends carpet the evening would have been perfect.
