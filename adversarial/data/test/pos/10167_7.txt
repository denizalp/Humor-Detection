Since I was starving in the early am after clubbing, I needed food asap. I thought I could make it up to the room and pass out without eating, but I was sorely mistaken and started feeling sick. Right next to the elevator bay was Grand Lux Cafe, and I ordered a chicken sandwich and fries before the kitchen closed. \n\nMy order took what felt like my entire life. I told my friend that they must have raised and slaughtered the chicken before preparing it for my meal, because that was the only reasonable explanation for the delay. \n\nWhen it was ready, I grabbed the bag and ran upstairs. I ate it in bed and fell asleep directly. I woke up to a bunch of cold, uneaten fries, so they were apparently not that good.
