Not a bad Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup...\n\nFrom yelping around in Las Vegas, looking for a place that was still open late night, and targeting restaurants that had noodles...this establishment was the one that I chose for our intoxicated food adventure.\n\nI was lured to this location not only because of the high ratings, but because of their advertisement of hand-made noodles.\n\nThe noodles were guud, indeed, they were very guud (especially because of the inebriation factor). The soup was flavorful and not very oily. The prices were very fair and the location is open till midnight. Service was very quick and pleasant.\n\nIm usually a PHO-type of guy when it comes to drunk munchies, but after eating here, this place isnt a bad substitute.\n\nRECOMMENDED!\n\nUNTIL THEN!! ^-^
