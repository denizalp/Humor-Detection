Well, when travelling to a foreign country on a budget, my family just learned a nice lesson. Pictures and reviews can only do so much, you've got to experience it first hand.\n\nI wish I had gotten a photo of their marquee that indicated 'Renovated Rooms! Whirlpool!' and other lies. I think the extent of their extensive renovations may have been new bed linens from the thrift store, a fresh coat of paint on the walls and new caulk on top of the old in the bathroom. We discovered there is a whirlpool but it is located in the honeymoon suite after we arrived. There is no food offerings here (not that I would eat them after seeing this place.)\n\nRoom smelled stale and, despite us having a non-smoking reservation, all of the linens smelled of smoke. One of the two beds in our room had about a 3'-0\" in diameter (about 1m for the locals) \"hole\" in it where the springs were just ... gone. You would roll to it and settle in at night. Worst night of sleep I have gotten in a long time ... would've moved to the floor if I wasn't afraid of it. \n\nThere was a nice new refrigerator that we used for a couple of bottles of water, and the microwave looked alright but I did not dare open it.\n\nThe worst part, at least for our family, was discovering the hardcore porn channels just sprinkled in while channel surfing during our wind-down time after a day on the city. Our son was just clicking the channels and then ... BAM. And we aren't talking high-class here. It was filthy and after my wife stopped screaming, I went to the front desk for an explanation and was given only 'Oh yea. It's on the satellite feed. We can't control it. Just don't give the kid the remote and stay from Channel 67 or whatever it is.' For the record, it is Channel 42, which we discovered again by accident when cautiously scanning the channels the next day. There are some other ones further up than that but we were too scared to go beyond our comfort zone of channels 2-32. While it did provide a strange and hilarious memory for our trip, I'm sure the almost criminal negligence on their part of not warning us ahead of time would go over a lot worse with some more conservative guests. \n\nThe second morning of our stay, we discovered our remote missing entirely after the maid left, and in our subsequent search I think we did more moving and searching than the cleaning staff had ever done. I turned up several empty food and beverage containers, a couple phone chargers, a shirt, a sock, an empty condom wrapper, a not empty condom wrapper, a lighter but no TV remote. I also became even more repulsed by the room. We got a replacement remote from the front desk and just tried to stay positive.\n\nBut it wasn't all bad. Some reviews on here and elsewhere on the web allude to the low cost and its location, which were both positives for us. You really couldn't beat the price and the location to the Gardiner Expressway made travel downtown very simple, but the actual stay itself was so bad it really took everything we had to stay. \n\nI'd love to say that we argued for a refund or went elsewhere, but the short time we were there (3 nights) and the obvious lack of concern from the staff made it obvious we would've been arguing with a wall.\n\nWe lived and we learned. Consider yourself warned.\n\nThen again, if you're a single person with few expectations or a seedy politician looking for a quick overnight spot, this is your place.
