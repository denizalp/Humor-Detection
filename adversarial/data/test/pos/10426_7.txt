This is my review of 'Beijing Chinese Cuisine' (as other yelper mentioned before),,,the one right next to Sin City Sushi :P \nI am very pleased to write this review(even though it's past my bed time-.-;;;;) I FINALLY found a great place to taste Korean-Chinese cuisine in town. I've been tried so many different places in the past but I couldn't find the one that has the genuine taste of Korean-Chinese dishes in Las Vegas. \nI was highly recommended this place by good friend of mine to try some Jjamppong, Jjajangmyun, and Mandu! \n\nGrowing up in Korea, I have early memories of eating Jjamppong, Jjajangmyun, & Mandu all the tme. It was a ubiquitous dish, not to mention cheap. Occassionally, my family had ordered it for delivery, the delivery man would carry the food in a big tin box with handles, on a motorcycle :P The noodles came in actual bowls, so after finish eating our delicious meal, we'd have to put the dirty dishes outside by the door(usually don't need to wash the bowls for them), so that the delivery man could come back for it later to pick up. I assume this is no longer the case in the State, haha :D \n\nSome people might ask,\"What is Korean-Chinese Cuisine?\" Well, it is originated from traditional Chinese dishes but has been influenced by local ingredients in Korea. Because of the closeness in place, most Korean-Chinese dishes are traced from Northern styles of Chinese cuisine such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shandong cuisine and these three are the best known regional cuisines of Northern China. Korean-chinese cuisine was born when Chinese immigrants settled in Korea in the 19th century, and 2005 marked the 100th anniversary of this popular dishes, according to wikipedia :) \n\nOk,, now the highlights of K-C dishes~ \n---Jjamppong(a spice noodle soup flavored with all the vegetables, Seafood, meat, & chilly oil): You can ask a server how spice you want from mild to very spicy :) It was a perfect right amount of spiciness and rich flavor of the broth. OMG!! \n---Jjajangmyun(a steamed noodle in black bean sauce, with diced pork, onion, potato, & garlic,,serves with cucumber pieces on top): not salty at all, all the ingredients were blended well together and gave a perfect taste of Jjajangmyun! \n---Mandu(home made pork dumpling or goyza :P, either boiled-Mul-Mandu, steamed-Jjin-Mandu, grilled or fried-Gun-Mandu): I recommend these dishes to try with a dipping sauce of soysauce and vinegar that you can easily find on the table. I tried their Jjin-Mandu. I really loved their Mandu!!!  It was a real homemade dumpling that my mom and grandma would make it back home. It seemed like they put right amount of pork, cabbage, onion, garlic, scallion, Korean leek, clear noodle, tofu, & etc,. \nAs might be expected, it came with pickled radish (with a splash of vinegar) and kimchi, yay \n\nThe people next to me, they were looking at my Jjajangmyun and asked what I was having...All of a sudden, they put aside their menus and ended up getting the same dishes as mine. I was glad that they also loved their dishes admitting first time trying out Korean-Chinese Cuisine for them. The owner came by the table a couple of times and was very friendly. According to her story, she is a main chef and now she has been teaching her son to be a good chef of Korean-Chinese cuisine :) If you eager to have K-C cuisine that you usually tried back home or simply you are craving for some good K-C cuisine, go for it!
