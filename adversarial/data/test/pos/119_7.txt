If the Triple Threat offered at Cafe Phipps is any indicator of Prantl's caliber, then we have one imposing bakery on our hands.\n\nThe Triple Threat consists of a Chocolate Mary Ann, a White Chocolate Raspberry Cup, and that Burnt Almond Torte people whisper about, each shrunken to a size that takes 2-3 bites to finish.\n\nMary Ann, the brunette, was my favorite of this terrific trio, but I've always had a thing for brunettes, so perhaps I'm biased. The flawlessly fluffy choco-frosting and choco-cake collude to make your mouth fall in love with The Girl From Uptown of Pittsburgh's pastry scene...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=M14TkoMhiV8\n\nI mean, Shadyside's high rent, man. She'd never go for me. I don't have the slightest shot. \n\nThe WCRC (is that a radio station?) came in a tight second. The raspberry jam on top was accidentally eaten in one bite, so Kay didn't get to taste that, but I did and feel privileged for that. \n\nBAT lived up to her hype, but she's not as easy to talk to. \n\nI kid the desserts and upper-income ladies. BAT lived up to her substantial reputation. Icing as white and light as a blouse, toasted almonds crunchy, ablaze like expensive jewelry. She's wearing a fur coat, and people love to hate her for it, but to be close to her is utter luxury. She's Ivana Trump with the looks of a Victoria's Secret model.\n\nThat's what it tastes like, and no I do not use hallucinogens. \n\nSadly, I only got one bite of each...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YDdQn5w2t68
