Ahhhhhhhh idk. \n\nI've stayed here like a bajillion times. My mom loves this hotel. Its a love\/hate thing for me. It's the opportunity cost of having a great location for the cheapest price but how much cleanliness and quality are you willing to sacrifice??? Personally, this last visit did me in. Hairs all over the shower...really? Also there were tootsie roll wrappers under the bed... which is funny bc last time I stayed here I also found tootsie roll wrappers under the bed... I think Paris has tootsie roll parties in their rooms or something bc tootsie roll wrappers are all over the place lolol.. \nI'm not happy about the quality of cleanliness or standard of presentation. With that being said, I've never ran into an employee that was anything less than curtious, kind, and hospitable. But the overall \"tone\" of the hotel has some overhauling. \nThey're in the process of revamping all their rooms- which is great bc this place was getting dated. \nI love that the pool is huge and CHILL. A get away to nurse your hangover. Also, they allow dogs which is clutch and why they get 2-stars.\n\nEither way, there's a 60% chance I'll be back.
