This is my first experience with Brooklyn V's, so I will be specific to what I ordered, in fairness to menu items I have not tried.\n\nOrder - \n14\" Margherita pizza\nAntipasto salad\nCannoli\n\nLet's start with the delivery - 90 minutes at least, which may have been a fluke, but almost always means cold pizza.  :(\n\nThe salad was extremely bitter - it tasted like half of the salad was giardiniera - perhaps they made it wrong.  It was barely edible as a \"salad\" - it tasted like edible garnish.\n\nThe pizza was predictably cold, so I warmed a slice in the oven a little.  First off, the only reason I ordered the pizza was because the picture showed a solid looking Margherita - fresh mozzarella SLICES, fresh green basil, etc.  Once you have had a real Margherita, your life will forever be a littler brighter.  What I got was a 17 buck \"freezer box\" quality pizza.  \n\nThe cannoli were ok, but nothing to write home about, and certainly nowhere near restaurant or deli quality cannoli, of which there are plenty around.\n\nI feel like I wasted half a Franklin - that's never fun.
