The reviews don't lie:  Eco-Tint lives up to the hype.\n\nAfter I needed just one window tinted after my driver's side window was shattered, I made an appointment for a recent Friday morning.  From the time I entered the building, the customer service was on point.  I was given an estimate of 45 minutes to complete the work.  I was able to bide my time in a clean waiting area with a TV, magazines that weren't two years old, and even a cooler with free refreshments.  The best part was that my window was tinted in 25 minutes, matched to the other windows just right.  \nIf you ever need a tint job, I join those who also highly recommend Eco-Tint.
