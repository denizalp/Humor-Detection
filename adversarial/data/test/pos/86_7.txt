You guys...Sushi on Bloor really is good. Yes, still. \n\nAlthough the wait can be long, yes, and it can be loud, but honestly...the food is fresh and generous and the prices are reasonable. The wakame salad is hands-down my fave in the city, and one time I saw Ryan Gosling there. \n\nI'll remain forever a  firm loyalist in the ongoing debate of SOB vs. New Gen, and everyone knows you must only choose ONE.
