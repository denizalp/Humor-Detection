I am not a gym person. I have never belonged to a gym. I have probably not been in a gym since high school. But there comes a time when a person needs to keep up a regime - or let the ravages of time run wild. So we signed up for the Y last winter. And I have to say, after initial hesitation, I have grown to look forward to my 2 to 3 times week here. I like the crowd here. It is a real mix of the young, the old, the hip, and the hip-replacement. A mix of languages rings out in the changing room and there is definitely a community feel to the place. I don't do much other than hit the elliptical, and swim lengths - so I have no authority to comment on the many different classes and machines they have here - but I think the Y on College is pretty swell. I try to avoid the place at peek times but even when it is busy it ain't so bad. I know there are some machines and stations that are popular and it might get annoying if you always had to wait but I have never had that problem. After an hour at the gym I emerge feeling fairly virtuous, which is worth the price of admission alone.
