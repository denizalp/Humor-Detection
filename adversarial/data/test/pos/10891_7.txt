I can understand the theme of the restaurant is sarcasim, but when you book ahead for a table of 11-12 people, that are wanting to do nothing but get trashed and spend lotsa money there.... don't turn them away just because we're 10 min's late, and 1 person short...  \nThat's what happened to me, to top it off, it was my BIRTHDAY....  The host there was horrible-and seemed like she was enjoying every minute of being rude, she gave my table away because I was 1 person short and cut me off while I was trying to talk... I can see why she works there, cuz she couldn't be hired anywhere else with that kinda attitude and big ears...
