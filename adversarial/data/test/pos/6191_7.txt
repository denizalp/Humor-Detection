I gave them a bit of pressure because I am Miss Teen Spring Valley and Kai kept his cool and did a great job. Though he had to get help on the bangs since they just weren't right, it still came out very nice and I would have to say thankyou for not messing up my hair like the other salons. LOL \nGreat job. :) will be doing a shout out for you guys on my Facebook fan page. :D
