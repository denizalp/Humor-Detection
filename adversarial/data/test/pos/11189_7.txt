I appreciate this ice cream parlour because they carry flavors that are exotic and\/or familiar. I grew up in the Philippines and I loved it when they had corn ice cream. It's so good, and made me a bit nostalgic.\n\nI also love the lavender honey (or was it honey rose?) ice cream, and salted caramel. \n\nActually, I love everything. \n\nIt also helps that it's next to a bakery (Asahi) that serves green tea cake. So after you have that dinner at The Vig across the street, head on over to Sweet Republic.
