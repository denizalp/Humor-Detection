This store is under heavy construction.  That being said, I walked in and thought I was in a bomb shelter that just took a bunker buster.  To be fair I didn't spend much time in there, but that's because I was scared that zombies would come lurching around the corner at any moment.  \n\nPerhaps I'll go back sometime when the construction is over, and I'm feeling super adventurous, I just hope I don't step on any forgotten land mines.
