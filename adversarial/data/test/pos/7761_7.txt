Honestly, pretty gross. \n\nThe only reason I decided to eat here was getting a 50% off coupon in the mail. The meal wound up being about $6.\n\nEven at $6, I'd rather have eaten somewhere else. I wasn't going to go near the questionalbe seafood, ie: shrimp and raw oysters. The oysters looked like rubbery bits on ice but I decided to try the shrimp because how can you f* up shrimp? Well, they didn't taste right and were rubbery. They took forever to shell. The shells kept breaking off, and honestly they smelled fishy. \n\nI suppose if you're only into pre-made generic, faux asian fusion\/buffet sub par Americanized Chinese style grossness, have fun! This is just the place! \n\nOur waitress was really nice, and we tipped her well! Other than that, yuck!
