5 girls were hungry and wanted a bite before we started our journey back to the OC so we pulled over @ the bellagio...after we smelled the lovely flowers we saw the line for cafe bellagio...long but it would have to do. LUCKILY as we stepped into line a hostesss came around saying \"5?? 5?? anybody have a party of 5??\" thats when i jumped out saying \"5 here!!!!!\"\n\nso we got seated QUICK. our table ordered a pulled pork sandwitch, french toast & sausage, steak & eggs, caramelized grapefruit, yogurt parfait, and my penne pasta.\n\nour server was a really sweet lady and she claimed my pasta was the BEST CHOICE!!\n\nthe pasta was....alright.. the sauce wasnt out of the world plus (I HAVE SOME BAD LUCK WITH PASTA!) the pasta was a tad overcooked. as the girls tasted it they confirmed i wasnt crazy and it was a lil mushy...blah but it was edible\n\nthe brownsugar coated grapefruit was yum and the parfait had the yummiest fruits & granola!\n\neveryones food looked alright. the lady substituted my friends toast from steak & eggs for a bread basket for the table which didnt rock nebodys world...it was MEh bread.\n\ni expected more from the food. but service was superb!\nbtw iono whats goin on but wen i got home i saw i did get charged the $70 on my debit now i check today and that charge is gone and now im charged $12 for cafe bellagio...wtheck?
