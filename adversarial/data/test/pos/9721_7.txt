[Out-of-Towner Review]\n\nConcourse D...\n\n...for DAMN, I only have about 20 mins before I need to get on my connecting flight home. Even though the other spot looks good, their to-go section didn't look as great.\n\nSo, after perusing La Grande Orange, then coming back to it...I walked away with a Pepperoni Pizza and a water. Of course it's overpriced, but it was pretty tasty. And by tasty I mean so oily it had to be good. For real though, it was tasty, but it literally comes with at least a liter of oil.\n\nThey had a bunch of drink options, salads, burgers, and a slew of other options. However, the pizzas are literally there for you to grab, pay, and go. Which is exactly the criteria that is needed when you only have 20 mins before your next flight.\n\nIt's decent, I was happy, but damn that box makes it hard to travel with. I'm pretty sure your fellow passengers will be envious of your food, so eat it coyly...as best you can with a pizza box to maneuver.\n\nGrab more napkins than you'd think you'd need for ten pizzas, then grab a few more...
