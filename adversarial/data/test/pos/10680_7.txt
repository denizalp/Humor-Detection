I am inspired to add another star to Crepe Cellar....why? One reason expressed in three words:\n\nBananas. Foster. Crepe.\n\nYes, the food is solid, the service is always sweet and efficient but this crepe. Oh mama. It's sublime. Excellent. Magnifique! \n\nIt's exactly what you want in a bananas foster crepe - delightful bananas folded into a sweet crepe, with plenty of fantastic buttery, rummy foster sauce and running all over it. Plus a giant dollop of whipped cream. And for God's sake - get it with a scoop of ice cream. Go big or go home, kids. \n\nGo get one and perhaps share it with a spouse, a friend or, hell, I'd share it with a stranger if someone let me put my fork in it.
