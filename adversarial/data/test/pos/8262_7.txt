We had Desert King do all if our windows. 33 Windows 2 story house. They were excellent. Installers are very experienced and meticulous. Made sure everything was perfect. Cleaned up inside and out. Took 5 days to install all but it was done perfect. Owner on site several times to check work and always available to answer questions. They are lower in price from several I got estimates from. I went with them because the owner came out himself and worked with me. I highly recommend them if you are looking to have your windows replaced. They do great work and our electric bill was cut in half. Patrice Kreitler
