I think I have found my new favorite date night sushi joint.. Last week the illustrious David B.  was recommending Hana to the ole plus one and I .. being the adventurous couple we are ,we invited our sushi friend Paul and family to  join us to try somewhere new.. First Note : Hana is small groups are not their forte..although they nicely accommodated our large 7 person group.  After being seated we took in all the specials on the board and began making sushi plans .. Second Note  : Our waitress had a difficult time understanding our order, not sure if it was language barrier, ordering a little unusual , the larger party or what... daughter doesn't want any wasabi or garnishes on her sushi...  after getting order ins  , it wasn't long before some lovely  sushi began coming our way.  Unfortunate Waitress did not understand daughters order and it came with ta daa  onion garnishes .. the owner (?)  came out and rectified the situation with finesse..\nWe ordered for hubster and I : Hana roll  a tasty roll with friend shrimp sticking up all over  good stuff, rainbow roll  clean and traditional,  Vegas roll , nice touch because it was fried but not doughy or overly  breaded like some places get it , and a tasty  hot volcano roll  , not the fave but still  a good roll, we also had tako salad our favorite extra at japanese restaurants , theirs is a sweet yet vinegary concoction  that me happy loved it.. Friend   Paully ordered  a seared maguro dinner that looked tasty.  All the food was refreshing and delicious  but here is where it went wrong  Third Note , traditionally in a restaurant when you have a big party of people done with their food  and they are staring at the wait staff and fidgeting with the empty plates and suck on the ice cubes you bring them the check ...guess our waitress did not get that memo... we sat and sat.. finally the womenfolk took the kids across the street for Mary Coyle ice cream to let the men wait in peace. Fourth Note, how do you negotiate the 20% gratuity already added in when the service wasn't up to par?   Well once again owner ? Lyn came to our rescue and rectified the situation .. Hats off to Lyn who did an outstanding job of smoothing over a bad situation.  Because of her we will go back and give Hana another try  just with a smaller group and not the same waitress. \nOh and BTW  they use Sweet Republic for their ice cream .. got give that a try next time...
