Ugh!!!! Terrible service!!!! An hour wait...it's not packed.. Brought the food out without any utensils...get the utensils five minutes later. They acted like we were bothering them! Messed up two of the four orders! Food is swimming in oil. Yick. I know it's Denny's and not  Ruth Chris' but dang!!!
