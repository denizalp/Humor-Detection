My FAVORITE pool party of the weekend! Talk about a Sunday Funday! \n\nI LOVED that there was finally a party with house music going on in Vegas....everyother party, be it day or night, always had a mix of hip hop and other music, which isn't a bad thing at all....but this lil\" Miami chicky was ready to dance to some goood house music all day\/night long after 2 days of the other stuff in Vegas and Tao Beach gave it to me....THANK YOU, TAO BEACH!!!! \n\nI loved that this wasn't at 1,000+ person pool party and I loved that we could exit the area and go take a dip in the regular Venetian pool when we needed to cool off (not for nothing, but I wouldn't stick so much as a toe in any of the pool parties' pools....talk about universal toilet...ew). I also loved that there was a saxophonist and percussionist jamming along to the beats. The Tao-Tini pitchers were also delicious, refreshing, and buzz worthy ;) \n\nIf you are looking for a good \"pool\" party, good house music, and a non gangster crowd...this is your place to be on a Sunday, hands down. \n\n*************** \nOh, side note, a group of guys that were on a lounge chair\/couch next to us did the most ridiculous thing I had seen all weekend....they literally threw hundreds of dollar bills into the air and \"made it rain.\" They then started TEARING up the money and burning it....needless to say, the whole dollar bills that fluttered our way quickly made their way into our bags and into the cleaning man's dustpan. LOL ;)
