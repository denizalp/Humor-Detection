This is pretty good for Markham food. \nAfter recently turning vegan again, I decided this would be my farewell to meat\/dairy\/animal products because I can't go without trying the one place that is soo hyped in Markham.\n\nI came in and sat down within seconds, because 0 wait! Woooo! Communal tables are not my thing. It's a cool concept but eh.. my social anxiety can do without it. Glancing at the menu, I realized there is nothing I can eat here when I become full-vegan.. shame. :'( The menu isn't big by any means and the portions remain the same as the downtown location- tiny. After picking out the pork belly and egg out of my tonkotsu black ramen, I was left with a salty and rich broth that totally screamed 'sodium is running through your veins tonight, girl!' The noodles had a nice chewy texture that I found to be quite enjoyable. For some reason, I liked it a lot more than I did the downtown location. The restaurant is a lot bigger too and can definitely seat a lot more people. They also aren't understaffed like the other location, which really helps make a dining experience better. \n\nAlthough I won't.. or can't.. be eating here anymore, I highly recommend doing so because it's one of the better ramen joints in Markham.\n\nShoutout to the kitchen staff for doing a great and fast job. Especially you, Tim ;)
