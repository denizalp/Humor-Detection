You park at the bottom. You pay at the bottom. You ride to the top. You come back down.\n\nI honestly believe $4 roundtrip is too much. The ideal situation would be $2 roundtrip and a free hot dog. I'd go everyday.\n\nGoing up, I was scared for my life. The car seemed hesitant especially at the top drop off point. I must admit that the highlight was taking pictures. It was too cold to walk around, but I may take advantage of this site in the summer with or without the hot dog deal. (I hope with.)\n\nOn the way down, the car was jam-packed and so very awkward. We saw a proposal occurring in the opposite car, which caused a couple to bicker. Now that's true romance.
