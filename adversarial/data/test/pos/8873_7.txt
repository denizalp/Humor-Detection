I stopped going to this place quite a while ago, but haven't had the chance to put up a review and explain why. \n\nFirst and foremost, this place is in decline. I went there for a couple of  years, especially when I worked in the area, and it has gotten more an more vacant with each visit. I didn't understand why, given all the awards they have littering the dinning area, but I have come to realize that no matter how good your food is, poor service will be the end of you every time. Such is the case with Greek Town. \n\nThe owner, George, is borderline obnoxious. I don't know if this is a culture thing or what, but he seems to be able to offend just about anyone in your party at some point. Sadly, at the same time, he and his wait staff have no clue about proper service, a fact that appears to be well reflected in other reviews here. I have many, many times, had my drinks run out, ran out of pita\/bread for dipping and so on, all the while the restaurant is practically deserted. When you have three servers to support an restaurant that small, and empty, you have no excuse for that kind of abandonment of a table. \n\nFurthermore, George and everyone else in that place seem to be brusk and snobbish. I used to be given a run down of the dinner\/lunch specials when I was seated, but more often than not in the last half dozen visits or so, I had to ask what the special was. That wouldn't be so bad, but the response I got was almost an eye-rolling vibe, as if I'd made some horrible offense by asking what the daily special was. \n\nSecondary to the service problem is the food. My earlier visits were flawless, but more recent ones have been replete with problems. I get gyros delivered with empty bowls of dressing on the plate. Empty bowls on the plate, how does that get past the person checking the food? How does it get past the server? The preparer? Nobody catches this, really? And before you ask,  yes, even George himself brought food to my table this way. \n\nFurthermore, I've gotten actual bad food there in recent visits. Calamari that was still pink and uncooked, for starters, how gross is that? Other times it has started to come out very soggy and spongy, rather than the crisp taste I'm used to from much earlier visits. Going back to the service problem, when George and his staff saw that we didn't touch the calamari, nobody asked and nobody cared. For the way they price it, I find it unacceptable that you bring me raw, pink calamari (soggy at that!). \n\nAll in all, I finally grew tired of the behavior of the staff, the ridiculous level of service and the fact that now, even the food was in decline. I can handle so-so food or so-so service, but I can't take both of them from the same place. Discussed with my wife and decided to find a new Greek place to dine at, so we're never returning to Greek Town. \n\nIt's a true shame, as the ambiance and the decor, the nice booths and the quiet atmosphere really, really won me over initially. I used to love this place and went there often with colleagues from work and with my family. I'm sad to see them go and to strike them off my list, but they've been given enough chance and nothing has changed. My personal prediction? They'll be out of business within a year if they keep this up.
