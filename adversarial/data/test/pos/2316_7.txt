I'm talking about a Service Plaza going westbound around mile marker 139 on the Ohio Turnpike. The Ohio Turnpike AKA the \"James W. Shocknessy Ohio Turnpike\" is a 241 mile-long, limited-access toll highway in the U.S. state of Ohio, serving as a primary corridor to Chicago and Pittsburgh. \nI travel this road frequently, day and night,  and I am very grateful that Ohio has used its resources to build these exceptional top notch service plazas across the extent of the highway. Overall there are fourteen of these, seven westbound and seven eastbound.\nThis one like many is new, modernly constructed, very clean and comfortable with great amenities. Some of the services and amenities here are: a Sonoco Service station 24\/7; a Starbucks (can't beat that); a Popeye's; a Burger King; a Great Steak and Potato; a Hershey's Ice Cream; a Panera Bread; a Manchu Wok; a Truckers Lounge with couches, tables, separate restrooms and showers (pretty special); a gift shop; and ta da... very large and clean public restrooms.   \nFew highway rest stops I have been at can beat what Ohio is providing. Thanks Ohio. We can all know that great service is always just a little ways up the road on the Ohio Turnpike.
