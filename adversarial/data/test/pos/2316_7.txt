Never ever again. Happen to come into Vegas w\/o reservation on a busy weekend. Last place in town with a room was this place. Had to pay for a week since they didn't do nightly rates. It's ghetto, dirty, and smells like a crack head lived in the room for like a year and never left. I wouldn't sit down on anything without a towel underneath me. I felt just so nasty staying there. It completely traumatized me. I look at weekly apartments completely different after that experience.
