If you've ever wondered what it would be like to spend a night in prison, just book your next Vegas stay at the SLS.  Cement walls and ceiling.  Overhead lights that resemble a mental institution.   A tiny window (no bars on it, not yet anyway). A bathroom with no sink. Seriously.  The sink is outside of the bathroom...and here's the kicker:  The bathroom door is a sliding door, that, when open, is actually closing off the sink at the same time.  Yep, you have to close the bathroom door to use the sink.  Eff this place a thousand times.  \n\nOh yea, not to mention this place is basically in another County, it's so far from the rest of the strip.  You will walk to nothing, except to a cab stand, which, incidentally, had absolutely zero cabs on Sunday morning when people were trying to get to the airport.\n\nCasino floor is nice-ish, albeit small.  Restaurants are fine, but nothing we don't have in LA.  Foxtail Pool gets you guys an extra star.  A really good spot.  Other than that, never again.
