Traveling through Scottsdale and decided to stop and see if this \"nightmare\" was really so bad! Walked in, and Sammy was right there! He was very nice and sat us at a table and we picked out some desserts. As it was the middle of the afternoon, not many people were in and we just decided to get desserts. After looking at all the beautiful cakes, we decided to get the Creme Brûlée and a Piña Colada cake. First bite and we loved it! Nothing like the disaster we thought we were walking into. Amy even came out to say hi and later we asked to take a picture (they had no problem with this and seemed quite used to it after the show). Great experience and if I'm ever in Scottsdale again, I will be sure to stop in and get a sweet treat!\n\nLove, the Texans!
