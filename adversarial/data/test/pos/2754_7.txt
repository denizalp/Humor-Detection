I recently started really getting into Yelp and I kept seeing the people I follow rave about the Crêpe Bar in Tempe.\n\nI don't even remember how many reviews I actually saw, but it seemed like everyone had been there except me. \n\nMaybe I just had crêpes on the brain.\n\nAnyway, I went to try the Crêpe Bar and it was closed. I guess they're closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. \n\nI went back a few days later and wasn't even sure I was in the right place. \n\nI had seen so many pictures from Yelp, I was expecting something with a bit more \"wow factor.\" The Crêpe Bar, however, is in the middle of a strip mall on the North West corner of Rural and Elliot.\n\nThe inside was super busy and reminiscent of a hip European café. \n\nIt was a little confusing at first how to order, but obvious once you figure out their system.\n\nAt the counter, they have amazing homemade daily treats on display.\n\nWhen I checked in on Yelp, I immediately won a free tea or drip coffee, which was pretty cool. \n\nI ordered one of the meat crêpes and one of the dessert crêpes each visit. \n\nThe first time I had the breakfast burrito crêpe and the vanilla bean with marinated strawberries (total under $15).\n\nThe second time, I had the Papa K and maple butter with bananas brûlée (total under $20).\n(see pics)\n\nThe flavors of the mixtures were unbelievable. \n\nAnd the quality of the crêpes is outstanding: \nLight and flavorful.\n\nCONCLUSION \n\nThe environment is small and unassuming, but clean and a super cool place to have an amazing breakfast and hangout.\n\n5\/5 RECOMMEND \n\nOF NOTE\n\n*Hours:\nWed - Sat 7am - 2pm\nSun 9am - 2pm\nMon\/Tues CLOSED\n\n*For more information: crepe-bar.com
