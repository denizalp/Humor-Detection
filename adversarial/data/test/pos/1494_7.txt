Are you ready to rock? You better be when you come to see this show!\n\nI didn't really know what to expect from the show. I haven't watched the movie, but was excited to see what was in store for us. The show is so much fun and hilarious. So many great rock songs from the 80's are showcased in this show and all the characters are a blast. They have great voices and even better comic timing.\n\nThere isn't a slow moment in the show and they keep it rocking the entire time. I'm a big fan and I can't wait to have the opportunity to see it again.
