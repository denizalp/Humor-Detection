very convenient and the place is perfect for a quick bite.  nice little place with relaxing atmosphere.  The place is well set up and organizec and the staff is quite friendly and helpful.  I was really impressed when the cashier came over and gave us more change as she accidently charged us for an extra pizza and she noticed the error herself.  \nSo we went at an off hour and the place was empty.  We got the lunch special for three of us which included a nice salad, a drink and a personal pizza.  But oh my we shared the salad and the pizza was enough for three of us with some leftover! Great deal! the pizza was nice thin crust with small slices and well balanced with cheese and sauce. We got extra cheese as you get one topping with the lunch special but i like how they tell you the crust is not made for more than 3 toppings.  \nThe salad was nice as not soaked as well.  The food was definitely a hit.  \nThe only reason 4 stars is a am  a NYer and I still haven't found as good of a pizza out here......do we blame the water?
