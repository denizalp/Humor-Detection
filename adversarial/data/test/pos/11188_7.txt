11\/13\n\nFinally checked out Showstoppers Live, despite having the opportunity to do so for the past five years!  The show consists of 5 acts performing sets of 15 minutes each.  (Actually, Elvis, Garth Brooks, the comedian of the night (so funny!!), and Donna Summers each had 15 minutes, while the last act, The Four Tops, only did 10 minutes due to having to introduce the other musicians that made up the back-up band.)  There are many other tribute acts, so it pays (pun intended!) to call the box office ahead of time to see who may be performing that night.\n\nThe show is complimentary, but there is a two-drink minimum- both of which have to be ordered before the start of the show.  I wouldn't have minded this rule so much, if it was there to prevent servers from blocking the audience's view of the stage in the first place, but apparently it is not- I can't recall how many times my view was blocked for what seemed like forever!  (Remember, these sets are only 15 minutes long.)  If I have to watch servers bring drinks to the tables AFTER the show has started (this was well into the show, too, not just in the beginning), then I'd rather order my drinks one at a time throughout the show... I might even get an inspiration to try a drink I spied from across the room!  I think I'll wait 'til the new resort, w\/ its new, larger and improved, Showstoppers showroom to check out the other acts... Maybe I'll have more luck (ha!) at seeing the stage!
