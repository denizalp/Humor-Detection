Lemieux is an all-natural soap\/shampoo place, having several locations throughout the Montreal area.  Besides carrying local handmade soaps, body butters, face moisturizers, and lip balms, the store also carries their own line of shampoos and body gels - you can see these all in big large tubs, stacked on racks by the walls.  Those who have sensitive skin, they have products that are free of dyes, perfumes, and colors.  I purchased a Savon & Plus soap in lavender and in aloe vera - both smelling quite lovely!  Prices are a little steep, compared to other stores in the area, but for a one-stop shop of stocking up on some all-natural soaps and shampoos, Lemieux is the place to go to.  There is also a baby\/infant clothing\/accessories section in the back for gifts and such.  Staff members are friendly and informative.\n\n+all-natural soaps and shampoos\n+carries local soap businesses' products\n+friendly and informative staff
