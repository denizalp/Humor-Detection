This nightclub\/restaurant which adjoins the Staybridge Suites on Hurontario, seems to function reasonably well as the former and not at all in the latter category.  \n\nA Friday night found a pretty chilled environment with two DJs who, although they had enabled the \"AUTOMIX\" function on their Ableton Live software, picked the right tracks to keep the smallish crowd dancing.  Drinks were good, if a little pricey.  Service was slow and pretty much devoid of even the most basic of pleasantries.\n\nThe true nightmare comes to the food portion.  If you go DO NOT ORDER FOOD.  No, it's not the worst food ever - but every single dish was just - off.  As in - not at all right.  Not bold choices by a chef, rather someone with ADD flipping the pages on \"Cooking for Dummies\" waaaay too fast.  \n\nIf you do go, eat first - you'll thank me.
