I stopped into Glaziers today after a brief work meeting craving their spicy shrimp salad. I saw an older Asian woman who assisted in scooping and packaging 1lb into a small plastic container. I told her I greatly appreciated it and continued on to the checkout line when I saw how awesome their strawberries looked! I did not have a basket because I was only expecting to grab my salad. As I was adjusting my hands to carry both items the salad slipped and the plastic container cracked down the side allowing maybe 3 shrimp to fall on the floor. \n\nI backpedaled to the salad section and said to the same Asian woman, \"I'm sorry this slipped from my hands...\" before I could get another word out the Asian woman's eyes darted to an older white woman with long grey hair gathered in a net who threw her arms into the air and shouted, \"Well, WHERE DID IT SPILL.\" I continued on to tell her it was \"just over in the produce..\" she cut me off and said, \"Well is it  a lot or a little.\" *again throwing her arms in the air* I told her it was very little. I have never seen someone so frustrated over a spilt salad! It was as if I had ruined her whole day!  \n\nI did calmly tell her I wouldn't mind paying for it.\n\nShe continued on pointing to the baskets saying, \"why don't you go get one, they're right there, go get one.\" Giving me directive as if she was my teacher in school reprimanding me for a perfect accident. \n\nAt this point I even offered to clean up the spill to which she turned her back on me and SHOOK her head NO continuously as if I couldn't see her. I thought she was about to have a mental break. \n\nAll this attitude over a spilt salad? I have never felt so unwelcome in a place of business. \n\nWho is this woman and why is she so miserable and sassy with customers.... Furthermore, why does she think it's okay to wear her inconveniences on her sleave?\n\nTossing her hands at me, shouting at me, reprimanding me, turning her back on me, shaking her head in disapproval at me. Who does she think she is? \n\nI smiled and was polite the entirety of the interaction. I understand it may suck you may have to pick up a few shrimp from the floor by why the sass? I EVEN offered to do it myself, or at least pay for it. \n\n.... The Asian woman finally handed me a new salad without a word and I continued to the check out where I did express that I had spilled a salad and again offered to clean it up. i also expressed my interaction with the woman to a supervisor who was very polite. I am not usually a person to speak with a manager but I was so thrown off by my experience and how someone could be so upset over a salad that I felt the need to. \n\n- - - - \n\nI do enjoy Glaziers for there extremely fresh produce, fish, and poultry. I also value the other workers in the store, they give great assistance and seem to be very cleanly. \n\nIf you run into this woman, forget about getting yourself some fresh salad and keep it moving!
