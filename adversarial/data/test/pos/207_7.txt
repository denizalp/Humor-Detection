The airport BLOWS. Only in a state full of cheap ass old folks could you have such a POS excuse for an airport. Where to begin?\n\nA) 2 pathetic terminals that look like they were decorated in the 80's. ZERO signs that tell you where to go. The individual airlines have put in small flight monitors for their flights, but there are no monitors that show where flights connect airport wide. Wow. Thats fucking pathetic and sad.\n\nB) Transport between the terminals? Well, theres a shuttle bus, or you can walk. The walk is only about 200 yards. Except that you have to exit security, and walk OUTSIDE to get there. WTF? Really? You pathetic jackanapes couldn't pony up a few extra bucks, and build a proper sky bridge?\n\nC) Food\/Drinks.....dear LORD. Heres the deal. You can forget Starbucks, or any other outside commercial food. This place is literally like an airport in a communist country. The food\/drink contracts were sold off to the lowest bidder. So all the food service inside is from no-name restaurants and bars, likely all the same contractor.  And holy Jesus jello on a stick, do they suck donkey balls. Seriously. DO NOT order food in this place.\n\nCongrats Phoenix! You (joining LAX) have just made the list of 'Its better to chew your own arm off rather than fly through this wretched hole' airports.
