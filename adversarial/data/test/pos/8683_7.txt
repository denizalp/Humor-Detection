\"Hi. Hello. How are you? Be right with you.\" Any of these words could be used to greet someone when they come into your store. How unfortunate that I was not greeted at all yesterday 1\/31\/15 when I walked into this store. So I walk in, there is a girl making a sandwich, we will call her SM for sandwich maker, and she looks right at me but doesn't day anything. There is another girl who is at the register helping some guy, she looks at me too and says nothing. Eventually she is done helping the guy and looks right at me, and walks away. I stood there for a good 5 minutes without anyone saying ANYTHING to me. I was about to walk out, but luckily SM FINALLY said \"I'll be with you shortly.\" Still looking directly at the sandwich board, never making eye contact. \n\nAt this point, another lady has walked in to order behind me. Finally SM is ready, she asks us both what we want. Why?? We are not together and she knows this. So I tell her what I want and the lady also tells her what she wants, which happens to be 2 sandwiches whereas I am just getting one. SM proceeds to cut all of our breads and slices all of our meats and cheeses at the same time. Then she asks us what toppings we both wanted. What the hell! I was there first, waiting like a dumbass way before that other lady, so my sandwich should have been made first. I also should have been talked to directly instead of with this stranger. It was akward as we both were shouting out toppings and sauces. That pissed me off. Meanwhile the other girl is no where to be seen, but I can hear her chatting in the back. These business owners really need to think about the people they are leaving in charge to run their store when they are not there. The sandwich was fine, but the shitty employees running this place will make me not come back.\n\nYelp 2015 Review #24
