The portions are small for the price, but that's a good thing because the food is mediocre at best.\n\nThe brisket is chewy, and the coleslaw has no flavor. The meal comes with bread, not even toast. And the bread was stale. I was expecting Texas Toast, maybe. We were here at 4:30 pm and they were out of ribs and pulled pork from the lunch rush. I don't see where there would be much of a rush. Another member of my party said the chicken next door at Canes is better.
