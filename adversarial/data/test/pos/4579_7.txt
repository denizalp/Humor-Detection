So what am I doing when I am not on a Hot \"Yoga\" Date practising yoga and be Zen or eating Ethiopian veggie platter like baby food?...ommommmm \n\nI am feasting on Meat! To be precise Smoking Hick's BarBQ of Ribs, Pulled Pork and Beef Briskets.. done their way.. which definitely better than my way.. \n\nSmokin Hick's BarBQ is straightly a takeout joint... as the interior is set up in a way that you know you have no option but take it somewhere else to eat.. no tables... just bare walls...and the food your ordered would be all packed to go.. but where to eat? \n\n1\/2 Rib and Beef Brisket ($16.25) with South Carolina Vinegar and Pepper Sauce choice of side and a buttermilk biscuit \n- Just sinful to look at how the beef brisket is soaked in oil and sauce... sinfully delicious.. as it is soft and tender.. \n- When I opened up the box to see this huge dried looking rib.. I felt like whining and complaining..but trust me, it was just cooked perfectly.. as I rip the ribs apart with my bare hands... \n- the sauce which is sour and tangy compliment the heaviness of the protein.. while I watch my yelp buddy dipping every single ribs and enjoying the flavour.. \n\nThe Smokin Hick Pulled Pork Sandwich ($7) with Sweet Kanas City BBQ sauce \n- Slices of homemade bacon, cheddar, lettuce, tomato and onion \n- Pulled Pork is nice and tender... not dry or chewy at all \n- The tomato based BBQ sauce is sweet and tangy at the same time \n- The fatty bacon does give the whole sandwich extra flavour \n\nThere are a lot of different choices of how you can dressed up your BBQ meat sandwiches at Smoking Hick's.. Greek, New Orleans, Mexican, Philly style.. \n\nThe server\/cashier was really cheerful, helped me with the selections and gave advice of the different BBQ sauces they offer... All their sides are \"homemade\"... where is this HOME?
