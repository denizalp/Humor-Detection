Usually I take my pierogis with a side of old lady at a deli counter on Roncy, but I believe in all carb pockets, so I won't discriminate. \n\nI got stuffed at Loaded Pieorgi yesterday for lunch, and it was sour cream-y deliciousness. I got the classic, half fried and half boiled. Surprisingly, I prefer the boiled, but everything on my plate was caramelized, cheesy goodness. They appear to have a full bar, so think I might return soon for dinner.
