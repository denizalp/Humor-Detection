My very first visit to Island Sushi & Grill and I can't wait to be back. \nI had plans to take my daughter and her friends to another AYCE sushi business but since it was my daughter's 21st b-day the night before, her friends were up, drinking and partying til late, that they woke up pass 1 pm. The original business had already closed for lunch.\n\n I remember Island Sushi & Grill, when a high school classmate posted pictures of the food on social media. From Yelp ratings, reviews and pictures, I had a mother's instinct that my daughter will love Island Sushi & Grill. It was last minute decision and we just walked in with a party of 12. Since my daughter and her friends are locals and living away from the islands for college, I think this restaurant would be so perfect. I actually recommended they do the the AYCE but everyone decided to order off the menu and besides we dined so late for lunch it was actually Happy Hour, so they also ordered sushi off the HH menu. \n\nWhen we arrived, we waited awhile for a table, I understand, we did walk in with a big party and it was last minute w\/out reservations. We got our table and we did received great service. The menu consisted of tons of local foods. Everything sounded so great. I had a hard time deciding on my order. We finally order and WOW, everything looks so good. I looked at everyone's order and I wanted to try it all. I ended up getting the Saimin deluxe , since I was really missing saimin. I needed a saimin fix and this order just did it for me. I loved everything in the saimin and the noodles is like the real kind saimin noodles. While eating, I thought to myself, this saimin actually taste so much better than a popular business back in Hawaii. Everyone enjoyed what they ordered, especially my daughter, main thing, since we are celebrating her special day. My daughter and a few of her friends got the Teishoku set, I know what I will order the next time I visit. \n\nThe Teishoku set, no substitutions, includes  4 piece California roll, rice, miso soup, edamame, salad, dessert with your choice of saba, chicken katsu, fried scallops, garlic chicken, mochiko chicken, salmon katsu, mix sashimi, shrimp tempura, teri beef, teri chicken, teri salmon, vegtable tempura, or gyoza. For choice of 1,  11.00, Choice of 2, 14.00 & Choice of 3, 17.00. What a great set!!  \n\nAll in all, Island Sushi & Grill has such great food. Lots of varieties. This place reminds me of all the local business that is in Hawaii,and all of it combined in to one = Island Sushi & Grill got it all. I will def. be back to try the Teishoku set, besides I paid for loyalty card and I already accumulated lots of points, I want to redeem my rewards. I will be back.
