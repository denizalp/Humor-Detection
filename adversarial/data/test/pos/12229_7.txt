I don't get it. It's a lame hotdog in a soggy bun with annoying seeds. It also had neon green relish that had next to no flavor. I ate it because I was hungry and on the way to the bar. But otherwise I would never come back. We also ordered fries which look like the frozen Oreida kind you get in the super market and make at home. They even have the nerve to charge you for ranch dressing for the french fries! Nuts! \n\nNot returning.
