You know, I thought I had witnessed the many expressions of a worker who wants to kill themselves but I was wrong - McCarran International Airport, specifically the Delta area, is host to workers sporting 80's hairstyles and 1940's Holocaust facial expressions. Our flight was delayed and while I understand what it's like to be asked stupid questions consistently, I can at least do a great job of pretending to not be annoyed. These people looked like they were just on the verge of taking a gun to their heads. Rude and impatient are not adjectives that should be used to describe customer service but here we are! \n\nSecurity is ridiculous. We were asked to take out chapstick if we had it. Not even at LAX did I have to deal with such stupid inconveniences nor did I have to deal with such rude people, and I was coming from Los Angeles. \n\nFood options are overpriced, underrated, and once again, the good people who work in these overpriced greasy places look like they're ready to end their own lives. \n\nThe entire place is outdated. I was in desperate need of a shower to wash the sadness and stale smoke off of me. \n\nThat's a hard NO for me.
