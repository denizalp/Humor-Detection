Summers in Arizona can be tough; both for kids and adults.  It gets hot and miserable and there's only so much time you can spend in the pool... or inside.  There are a lot of camp options, but they are not all open to 4 and 5 year olds.  Seth Korey's Tennis Camp to the rescue... \n\nWe found Seth Korey's Tennis Camp this year as one of a few camps to keep our two kids busy over the long hot summer.  My son (5) and daughter (4) have already enjoyed a few weeks of camp, and are now looking forward to more later in the summer.  \n\nSeth is easy to work with and we find the camp to be fairly priced.  The kids stay entertained and busy doing much more than just tennis.  In addition to building their skills on the court, they are making new friends, doing indoor sports, swimming, encouraged to eat new foods (and there's no need for parents to pack lunches), taking field trips and more!  \n\nMy kids love the theme days and doing after care at AZ Airtime.  The counselors \/ coaches definitely have their hands full, but are doing a great job... shout-out to Alan, Kenny, Bella, and the entire staff for taking good care of my precious little ones.  See you soon, and hope to explore more tennis options during the school year as well!
