My family had such a horrible experience due to Hites that we will all be scarred for the rest of our lives. Summerlin Hospital referred me to this terrible place after my twins were born premature and rather than send them to the NICU, forced me to watch them DIE. I felt manipulated into using this place by nurses who wanted me out of the hospital as soon as possible. This felt bad from the get go but I was in deep grief and coerced into this living hell. This was the worst experience of my entire life and Hites made it WORSE with their apathy and carelessness! \n\nI was forced to call Tom the funeral director while I was still hospitalized, just hours after my second twin died! It's been almost a year now and the anger and hurt is still there. This wound won't ever heal! \n\nThey kept my twins over a month before cremating them and refused to answer my phone calls, emails to the owner. Nada! They let Gaby Foster from Jalen's Gift Foundation, who is not licensed to handle dead bodies, take photos of my twins after they had been dead over a month! She said she thought the photos would give me some comfort! \n\nGaby Foster called to let me know I could pick up my twins' remains! Nobody at the funeral home ever contact me in any way! I was supposed to get keepsake necklaces of my twins' hands and footprints but they \"forgot\" to do it! \n\nI went to the so called funeral home which is a disgusting shack and Tom Cropp, the funeral director practically throws the box containing the urn at me! Does not give me death certificates and tells me he's busy with another family! Then he turns around and walks away! They were supposed to have a funeral for my babies! That never happened! \n\nThis place should be shut down and every person there should lose their license! I later found out they cremate all the babies from area hospitals. The hospitals and doctors donate to Jalen's Gift Foundation to cover up their medical mistakes! No exhumation of remains if there's no body! I don't know how these people can live with themselves!\n\nI would never recommend anyone use this place! I'm even wondering if the urn contains my babies' ashes because it was that bad!
