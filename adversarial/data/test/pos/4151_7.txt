I dropped into Hummus Xpress after work to pick up a quick dinner. Wow! I was not expecting such a flavorful meal! \n\nI ordered a rice bowl with chicken, broccoli, roasted red pepper hummus, tabbouleh, tomatoes, cabbage, feta and tzatziki. I think the flavors marinated together even better as I drove home. The chicken was tender and juicy and paired perfectly with the other components of the bowl. On top of that, the employee who made my bowl was beyond friendly and welcoming! \n\nI will definitely be back for more!
