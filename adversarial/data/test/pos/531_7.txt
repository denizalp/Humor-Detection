Best breakfast\/brunch in Las Vegas. Now that Pura Vida is closed for good...I rank this place my new fav brunch spot. \n\nWhy? Quality. \nFarmers market local veggies and homemade everything. Attention to detail and custom orders are no problem. My kind of restaurant!\n\nWe were running errands or we would have biked from our place Downtown. Easy location to get to. It's near The Plaza parking lot on in the bottom of the City Parking Building. City electric cars and car chargers line the bottom of the garage and the parking is only $3 on the weekends. \n\nI drink my coffee black. They serve LavAzza coffee and have raw sugar option on the tables. Two wins in my book.\n\nI must confess I do not like breakfast and being vegan on top of that there are hardly ever options in brunch type places...not MTO. The vegan items are clearly marked on the menu.\n\nOn our first visit we ordered half our meal a la carte. Saut√©ed fresh mushrooms, tomatoes, avocado and hash browns minus the mash (I think the mash browns have cream). Tossed all together it was a huge portion that hubby happily devoured. \n\nWe also ordered the carrot coconut vegan pancakes. Like I said I don't like breakfast and can't stand the smell of syrup of anything remotely close to honey. For some reason the pancakes were the one of the best things I have ever eaten. Ever. They were warm, fluffy, sweet and soft in places from agave nectar. Wow. They have changed my life forever :)\n\nI ordered the vegan falafel wrap. Yum! It has a dressing of which I guessed it to be a citrus and tahini base. Stephanie of VegOut makes a similar dressing on her massaged kale salad and it's also similar to WILD's kale salad dressing. Inside this huge portion wrap are long pieces of falafel. It's not traditional like my inlaws make, it's more of a creamy mash mixture that I want to guess it baked instead of fried. It's very good. Also inside is romaine and greens, red onion, cucumber, and roasted tomatoes. I subbed the side salad for hash browns minus the mash again (no possible cream). \n \nAmazing.\n\nWe got there at open at 8am on a Saturday and it was not busy. But I imagine that weekdays are packed with the City Building being across the street. \n\nBelly full of fresh goodness we were very pleased with our meal and will def be back to the little Downtown spot!
