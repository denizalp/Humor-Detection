So I spent like, $20 on a meal here and it was just OK.  $20 is sit-in fine dining!  $20 is Mandarin all-u-can-eat buffet on a Friday night! THIS is not a $20 meal.  U think ur burgers\/services are wicked cuz u serve free peanuts??  Keep ur chinatown peanuts and I'll keep my cash.  I'd gladly eat a Hero Burger\/Big Smoke Burger\/The Works etc instead.  Then at least I wouldn't feel like I was dying after; physically AND financially.   Not a fan.
