The fall fun fest is worth the drive. There are so much to do for babies who can walk. I recommend bringing tots who are steady on their feet. This place is like a huge farm-themed playground.\n\n1. Multiple giant parallel slides and single slides\n2. Hay-stack \"playground\", swings, tunnels, poles, runways, etc\n3. Tree house (very sturdy), with wobbly bridge\n4. Corn maze \n5. Tractor ride: you buy the tickets at the \"apple barn\" then take the tractor to the playground. For my tot this is the highlight of the day. So you will be quite far from the car park- make sure you bring everything you need \n6. tractor race tracks\n7. Barn-slide\n\nI recommend have lunch at the picnic table at their store location. Next to picnic tables there is a climb wall and more swings, slides, huge tree house to explore.
