Found this place on an app while looking up bars that show UFC ppv, called & found out there don't have a cover charge & that happy hour was doing on during the prelims before the actual ppv starts.\n\nThey have great happy hour prices, appetizers were half off, beers prices were as low as $3-$6. The chicken strips were probably some of the best I've had, & the seared tuna was pretty good too. \n\nThey located right off the strip behind the Caesars palace area of the strip, and catching an Uber\/lyft here is a breeze.
