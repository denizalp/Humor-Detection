Met my friend for brunch on a colder Saturday morning, you can line up inside which is a definite plus and you don't feel like you're standing on people trying to eat. The decor is typical L'avenue style and it's on point. \n\nThe food we ordered was a 50\/50 we both got eggs Benedict, mine was really good.\n(Asparagus green peppers, onion and mushroom all chopped up to make it easy to eat!)\nMy friend got the duck confi√© Benedict, he found bones in it which threw him off. \n\nWe ordered filter coffees; not included with the breakfast but good coffee none the less, we also got two bloody ceasers, they used crushed ice so it melts too quickly, Also too much horseradish and smoothie straws. They were HUUUGE! I got an orange on my ceaser (weird?) but pickles thankfully came later :D they've got like 8 hot sauces they bring to the table upon request, so definite PLUS.\n\nI believe our waiters name was Rolando, he was very nice,  friendly and attentive. Great vibes all around! \n\nVERY disappointed with ONLY French menus. \n\nI would have rated it three stars because they've got a few kinks to work out however I went with four because it was an over all good experience. Will definitely go back!
