This will be my first and probably only review that is not based on food. New hair salon in time square plaza on the 2nd floor. I came here to get my hair cut for my upcoming wedding. The service here is top notch. They wash and massage your head before cutting. The equipment and design of the place is top of the line. I got my hair cut by Mitchel. His master hands made my hair look the best its ever been. After the cut you get another wash and finally blown dried and gel. I look 10 years younger with my new hair cut. Refer to the pic.\n\nLook for Mitchel....he is the best!!!
