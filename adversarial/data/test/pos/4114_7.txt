Are there guidelines to what ramen should and should not be?\n\nNiu-Gu is an outlier to what traditional ramen styles are, but would closely resemble to Tantan-men or Dandan noodles. The broth is clear like much of traditional Chinese\/Vietnamese noodles, cleaner and not as heavy (better for the summertime, or when you're sick in bed and don't want to eat much). The lemon pepper broth sounds strange but its really similar to Northern Chinese noodles. The bowl is brought out on a cart and then a hand torch is used on the onions to give it a char flavor perhaps. Comes with a couple pieces of charred short rib slices that are soft, a little smokey, and melt in your mouth good.\n\nThe Niu-Gu Rib items (short ribs and lamb) require you to call ahead of time, and seems to be a bit of a hassle to order and the regular lamb chop I believe has a 15-20 min wait time, so consider calling ahead if you're here for a quick meal!\n\nNiu-Gu is different than traditional ramen, and maybe some people would consider it fusion or a new style, but with so much resemblance to old school Chinese noodles, maybe its really the ORIGINAL style.
