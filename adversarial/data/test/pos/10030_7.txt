What happened to claim jumper? I used to think it was the shit! (in a good way that is). It was good but not as good as it used to be. \n\nMade a reservation for 630 pm for 4 adults and a child. \n\nWalked in was seated right away, with a really sweet waitress. She offered my daughter apple juice and a booster or high hair. For the first time ever we chose the booster (dun dun dun) and it surprisingly worked out. \n\nWe ordered an app, fried calamari, which was a small sized portion and came with a side of asian peanut salad. I wasn't a fan and it didnt seem to pair well with fried calamari. \n\nI asked if they still had the salad bar, which i was a huge fan of but nope they discontinued that. BUMMER! That was one of the main reasons why we came.\n\nI ordered the tri tip dip, which has caramelized onions, roasted peppers and monterey jack cheese. Hold the au jus please, and add a side of ranch. YUM. It came with string fries. Pure perfection. Probably the best dip I've had (except in CA where the dip was invented in downtown LA)\n\nHusband got a bacon burger with fries. They majorly messed it up. he asked for the meat to be well done and instead it was medium rare. He still ate it after I told him to return it, he doesnt like to return food. he swears cooks will spit in it (As i roll my eyes). he said it was okay, nothing special and he wouldnt order it again. he told me he wished he had ordered my dip.\n\n Our guests both got pasta dishes. They liked them and got sides of the soup. I noticed the soups were tiny little soups and the pasta dishes were half the size that they used to be.\n\n\nMy daughter got the kids meal, which was mac n cheese, oranges and french fries. it was huge! No wonder kids are obese now adays. She ate half of the mac n cheese and a couple fries and was full. It was good though because now she had a meal for the next day :) She loved it, them again she will eat any pasta thats smothered in cheese. \n\nOur food took about 25 minutes to arrive, not bad for a super busy friday night.
