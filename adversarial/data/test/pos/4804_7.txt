I'm a fan of Topgolf, and this was one of the better spaces I'd seen at a Topgolf in a while. I'm very much on the casual side of the golfing spectrum, but it's always a good time to drink some beers and hit golf balls far away. This served as our day activity during a bachelor party weekend, along with watching the evening college football games on the many TVs they had around. They had a lot of the games on, and it was just a marvel to be able to watch so many games during the downtime of not blasting golf balls into the colored targets. \n\nI would say that the important difference between Topgolf and a regular driving range is that Topgolf stresses precision and accuracy more than sheer distance, which is pretty cool. The technology behind the Topgolf system is pretty impressive, and even if you don't particularly enjoy golf, there's a lot of stuff for you to do. Make sure to get a reservation in advance for weekends. Also, know that it is a bit on the expensive side, and with food and drink, the tab can really add up.\n\nI think the only thing that was sub-par was the service, and it was definitely sub-par. We were constantly asking for drinks, and they got our food orders wrong 3 or 4 times, sending us things we didn't order, and forgetting things we did order. It also just didn't seem like they were trying very hard, and we didn't seem to have a dedicated server, so there was just a lot of confusion. The food was decent, although just a little higher quality than a typical gastropub. \n\nThe facility is top-notch and modern, and it's just a really cool place to hang out and hit some golf balls, but the service has to improve. I'd recommend it if you haven't been before, or if you reaaallly like golf, but for the super casual golfer, it might be worth it to explore other options.
