Your standard Dairy Queen. Ordering was no problem and our orders came out quickly. I had the S'Mores blizzard which had a good amount of chocolate but I wasn't sure where the marshmallow part came into play, and I couldn't taste enough graham cracker in it. The parking lot is situated in such a way that you have to dodge drive through traffic to get to the entrance door which makes it a bit of a hazardous experience if there are a lot of cars wanting drive through orders.
