If I don't know how to pronounce it, I will order it. Enter: Bicerin. \n\nIsn't everybody else doing the Mayan hot chocolate thing anyways? Here' some sort of \"Italian hazelnut milk chocolate\" with a shot of espresso. Rich. Hazlenutty. Chocolaty.  Real whipped cream. Cute little glass that looks like it's for port. Long spoon to get at all the goodness. Woah. \n\nCombine it all with the Distillery, Soma's sturdy tables, vast selection of chocolate (still an understatement), the up-coming gelato bar, how does a place like this exist? And when can I move in?
