We hit a lot of local places in Bridgeville looking for a quick bite. Tired of our usual haunts, we decided to try out Big Jim's. \n\nWe will be back. We enjoyed the home made food -- bread, soup, salads, pasta and a steak hoagie. French fries were a little limp though. Prices were amazingly low.\n\nMore interesting were the two waitresses whom I named Marge and Betty before they even introduced themselves. No rattling off of specials with ingredients most people cant pronounce, no walking around with a giant pepper mill. Instead we got suggestions on how ordering a pitcher of beer would be better, details of their trip to the casino the night before and how the bacon cheeseburger could possibly induce orgasms in the one waitress. Although amusing, the banter with the waitresses could turn some people off.
