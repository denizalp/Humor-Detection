I went to this McDonald's with a buddy while we were taking the Nevada CCW course at the Gun Store just down the street. The food and service wasn't bad, but some of the people in and around the restaurant will make you wish you were packin'. Keep an eye on the toothless, zombie-looking meth heads that hang out in the parking lot and the car wash just behind this McDonald's. They also tend to loiter and congregate in the side dining room that you have to go through to get to the restrooms. Seriously, head on a swivel if you decide to eat here.
