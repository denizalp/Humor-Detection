I want so much to mention all the wonderful things about this grocery store, and I will, but firstly I have to mention that this was one of the most stressful trips to the grocery store in my recent experience. I actually was really looking forward to visiting Lucky's. I had heard tons of good things from people in the neighborhood, and given that I'm somewhat of a grocery store nerd, I couldn't wait to check it out. I saw a lot of complaints about the parking situation beforehand, but I didn't have a huge issue on my visit. It's likely that you'll have to wait a couple minutes for a spot to open in the adjoining lot, but honestly I find that's most often the case for all grocery stores during peak shopping times. After entering though, I could tell immediately that getting around the actual store was going to be an issue. The shopping lanes are really, really close together. To be honest, 2 carts in the same aisle can barely get past each other. In addition, there's not a lot of logic in my mind to how the lanes are sorted, which isn't a big deal, but what's annoying is the setup of the store. Most of the areas where folks have to line up to purchase (deli counter, ready made foods, prepared foods, coffee bar) are also in the path of people trying to get in and around aisles, so there are bottlenecks happening everywhere you turn. Not to mention people walking around with pints of beer as if you're grocery shopping at a street festival. I honestly don't think there's a single place in this grocery store where you could stand and not be in someone's way. I also grew incredibly frustrated after waiting almost 10 minutes at the deli counter (no numbering system even on a busy Saturday) and when I was called up to the counter thinking I was next, the gentleman told me he could only help if I needed prepared foods because there was a backup on the slicers for deli meats. There were only 3 people ahead of me, which seems a little ridiculous that the slicers were \"backed up\" with only that many people. I walked away without my lunchmeat and headed over (very, very slowly because again, traffic is an issue) to the produce. I was dismayed to find that most of the staples I had come for such as garlic, kale and cilantro were completely sold out. I did ask the gentleman working in the produce section about the issue, and he was kind enough, but basically they were understocked for the amount of customers it seems. I ended up leaving getting only half of what I needed, and I didn't feel the prices were as much of a \"deal\" as they want you to think it is. There were some decent deals on Lucky's branded products, but it wouldn't be enough to make me want to endure the stress of visiting this grocery store again. In addition, knowing that stock is an issue, I'd much rather go to a different grocery store where I know I won't experience that. \n\nAll that being said, I did promise I'd mention the good, and I think there are some perks to this grocer. Firstly, is obvious: the location is a benefit. There aren't a lot of decent groceries in this part of Lakewood, and Lucky's definitely fills a gap in that way, thus the likely reason why it's so busy. The second is I LOVE the idea of their grocery bag discount\/donation program. I always bring my reusable grocery bags when I shop, but who doesn't love a little extra incentive? At Lucky's, you can get either $.10 off your bill, or you can turn that $.10 into tokens to be donated to one of three local nonprofits of your choosing. Little incentive programs like these are far more valuable to me as a shopper that the ability to drink beer while I shop...but to each his own. Lastly, I will say I did like their bulk section. They had spices, grains, nuts and candy in bulk, and an easy weighing machine. It's nice to know I can bring sustainable containers to a place like this and stock up on pantry items. \nOverall, I think Lucky's does fill a much needed gap in Lakewood, I just wish they would have thought of the user experience in a more practical manner, rather than just focusing on the \"bells and whistles\" to get customers in the door. Hopefully after a few months, the mad rush will slow down and things will become more systematic, but after my stressful visit, I definitely won't be returning anytime in the near future.
