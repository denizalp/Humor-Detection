You wanna feel like a MAN?! Then when in Vegas, you do not need to go to a lousy strip club, where the girls are aged like bad beef. You do not need to go to the sexy glitzy Vegas shows, where the girls are hella fine, but way outta your league. \nAll you need to do to feel like the red blooded fat American you know you are is to visit this place. There are several locales, but since we had a car we went to the original off Sahara Ave. \n\nThe food here is large, enough to kill a small Asian tourist. \nBut do not share, oh nonono. You all order individual plates and try to finish the mountain of food that stands before you.\n\nHad the sage fried chicken benediction and it almost tore me in half. Or at least my ass when I was done. No need to say anymore, as this place is extremely popular among yelpers.
