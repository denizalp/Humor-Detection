I had bookmarked this place to try quite awhile ago but didn't get around to trying it until a couple of days ago. I ordered three carne asada tacos. When the guy told me the price of less than 4 bucks I thought to myself that I should have ordered another one. I was right. The tacos were small (i.e., think three-bite taco) but tasty. I was disappointed when I first saw them because they had a red sauce on them and I'm a green salsa type of girl. However, the sauce had a nice smoky flavor. Not my favorite tacos ever, but I think I'll give them another try.\n\nThey had a salsa bar with red and green salsa, pico de gallo, radishes, onion, lime, and pickled carrots. I got some of everything. However, I didn't end up eating the salsas because the tacos were already very flavorful. I only got like one piece of carrot because the container was about empty. I don't think the guy at the counter spoke a ton of English because when I told him the carrots were about empty he just smiled and nodded.
