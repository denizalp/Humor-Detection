I came here on a Tuesday night (at 7pm mind you, they close at 8pm) as the a$$hole that needed something tailored by the same Saturday.\n\nMy needs were well received and they were very friendly as they catered to all my odd adjustments and trying the garment on and off so they could get the fit exactly right. \n\nEven though they were tearing at the seams with business,  they offered to have it ready by Thursday! \n\nWith taking in a lot lengths,  a few alteration work, fixing straps,  and seams,  my grand total came to be about only $40.\n\nAND they have great hours!  Open until 8pm during the week days!  No one has hours as convenient as this. They are also open on Saturdays. \n\nGreat prices,  awesome location close to home for me (they are in the same strip mall as Maharaja Restaurant and located next to Ceicil's)!
