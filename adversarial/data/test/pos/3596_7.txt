This place is money. Seriously ginormous amount of space, It reminds me a little of  a terminal at Sky Harbor for some reason. It is actually very close to where I live, but because my daily commute doesn't directly pass it I often forget about it. This place has the best baguettes in town and everything I have had here is amazing. \n\nI forgot that they default to American cheese on the European sandwiches, so specify that you want another kind. Side note: Why is American cheese the crappiest of all cheeses?...discuss. \n\nThey also do homemade ice cream which is very good. \n\nSandwich, chips and a drink for lunch was about $8.50, but the sandwich is 2 servings for most normal human beings. I always wrap up half for another time. \n\nIf you are a bit more adventurous, try the Vietnamese sandwiches which really is what makes this place shine. Great bread, great meat, great veggies. Everything I have tried has been fantastic.
