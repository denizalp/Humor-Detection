I was supremely irritated by the airport security chick who nearly ran us over with the metal gate to stop pedestrian traffic for the taxis! I hate to be that conspiracy person, but are there kickbacks involved? Why the rush to push more cabs in the already full cab line while nearly mauling civilians???
