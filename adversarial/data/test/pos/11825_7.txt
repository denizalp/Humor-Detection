Uh Can you tell me again why I'm paying for it?  BECAUSE I CAN!!!!  Nah it's alright. This was actually my first strip club. I spent a good 400 dollars because I must have brought my box of NEWBIE...Yea so I got 6 dances from some one who I was rough with me...and then I got few from this chick who looked like Buffy the Vampire Slayer. So yum...Nowadays...I dunno. The girls were aggressive...I mean do people still leave with money. Crazy Horse has gotten a bad rap for a lot of shady stuff lately. But I don't like that I'm a local and there's no local incentive to get in. Drinks are over priced. Strippers will pimp you for drinks. So watch out when they get a 10 dollar water. Grrrr. I'm much wiser now. I wait till they're passed out before I.....wait did I write that or think that?
