I love this place. If you are from SJ AND like the music from Temple this is the place to be. The size of it isnt that large as places like Marquee or XS but definitely a great atmosphere. We went on Saturday and if you go through the host Gio he will get you guys in for free. We had 9 girls 6 guys. He will skip your group to the front of the line. We also got bottle service at a really good deal too.  Oh yeah and Chromeo was the dj that night so the original cover would have been 40 for guys and 30 for girls. Go through a host its worth it.\n\n\nGios instagram is: gio1oak\n\nDo not take videos in there. You will get caught lol. They will just tell u not to.
