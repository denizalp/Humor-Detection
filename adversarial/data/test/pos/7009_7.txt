OK so after going to the nightmare which is criss angel I needed to be magically redeemed. I had never seen copperfield before. I liked his show very much. I liked his presence on stage,he came across as genuine and friendly.Unlike angel who is a preening ass. and his show sucks badly. anyways,back to copperfield. He did some great tricks and he had a really nice piece on a bit of fantasy and his father was really nice and not what you might expect from a show of this type. I will say that they did have table service which feels like going back in the time machine to dinner shows,they didnt serve dinner but as you know today you dont get jack at these shows. The only other thing i can say is that the theatre is dated and is in need of a revamp.Otherwise it was a nice evening.Hakkasan for dinner and copperfield for entertainment. Life is good ! :)
