Classic Bistro food with a twist\nThe Calamari was outstanding! I have never liked Calamari due to the \"chewiness\" that you get with it. These were completely different. Soft, supple and amazingly delicious.\nWe had the Sliders along with the Pepper Fries and it didn't disappoint.\nIf you're in the area, swing by, you won't regret it!
