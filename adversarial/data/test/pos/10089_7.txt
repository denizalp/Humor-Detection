Pretty cool spot for a night out with friends or a day with the family. There are tons of games, bowling, food and drinks (for the adults ). We have been here a few times and each time of course the kids left very happy (and tired, thankfully). They have games for tickets which can be traded in for prizes in the end as well as a room full of computer\/video games. Games for everyone! \n\nThey have a few pretty good deals for games only but the one we took advantage of was the unlimited play for an hour with an entree. \n\nThere was some miscommunication between how to purchase the deal and we got sent around to 3 different people so that was a bit frustrating. Only other downfall was the service in the restaurant. We waited for almost 10 minutes before anyone came and greeted us or got our drinks, then another 30 minutes for our food. I'm not a master chef but I don't think our nachos, cheese pizza and burger takes that long to prepare. Also, our server was less than attentive. Nonetheless, I know people don't go there for the food its just an added incentive while you are there to play games!!!! \n\nCool spot again to drink and play games, maybe dine at another nearby establishment though.
