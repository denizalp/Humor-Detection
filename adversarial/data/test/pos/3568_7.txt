A less-than-hygienic caricature of George Costanza worked the grill. Upset that he was carried to term, he directed me to the back of the dive to order fries, something seemingly impossible to do from the main counter, despite the fact that they were also being cooked there at the time. \n\nThe hot dog was a shriveled mess--a circumcised member that spent too much time in a swimming pool, which could explain George's disgruntled demeanor. \n\nThe fries were hailed as one of the \"best french fries in the U.S.\" by CNN's Laura Kiniry--I can only assume that continence must be her strong suit. The fries were bland, starchy and undercooked; better fries can be found at Butter Joint, Winghart's, and every single other restaurant that I've been to in Pittsburgh that serves them. Those that voted these fries as Pittsburgh Magazine's \"best of\" are of niggardly sensibility.\n\nThe milk shake was vanilla and fine.
