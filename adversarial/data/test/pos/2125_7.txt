Great date night spot! It looks a little run down from the outside, but inside is a whole 'nother story. Personalized service (ask for Hector!) and great Italian food, hard to go wrong. Prices are on the high side, but the family-style portions are gigantic- definitely start with an order of the bruschetta! \n\nWe ordered the veal parmesan and the linguini with clams. Dishes were large enough to be two meals each! Clams were plentiful and the garlic-white wine sauce was just what I wanted. My date enjoyed his veal, the red sauce was classic and comforting. We shared the tiramisu for dessert, very creamy and not too sweet. Dinner with a drink, tax, and tip, was $100- more than I expected to spend here but a great dinner nonetheless.
