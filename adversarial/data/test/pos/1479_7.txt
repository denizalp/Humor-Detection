This is my to go place whenever I crave Thai food. Especially the Panang Curry, the spices and coconut based sauced is seasoned just right and pairs well with rice. Another dish I enjoy is the Pad See Ew, flat rice noodle with a soy sauce based flavor and Chinese broccoli and the option of protein or tofu. A great option from the popular Pad Thai that most people are accustomed to.\n\nMy only complaint I have is the customer service. At times the service is great and other times it's been lacking. A few times we have been ignored or the order is wrong. The management needs to take the initiative to communicate the entire staff on how to handle customer service. I have a few friends and neighbors complained that the posted time doesn't correlate to the actual operating hours. I still remember we were turn down at 9:28pm and the posted time was 10:00pm. The staff member on duty told us that the kitchen is closed. This is very misleading to the public and doesn't reflect a professional business practice. I recommend that you call ahead if you plan to arrive later in the evening. Overall, delicious Thai food at a reasonable price point!\n\n2017 Yelp Review #84
