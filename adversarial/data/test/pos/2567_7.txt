ah the Glory.\n\nA friend of mine told me about this place.\nI went.\nI told my friends.\nThey told their friends. \nNow other friends tell me about this place like i never knew about.\n\nIn all seriousness, if you need meat - this is the place to be. \nTheir buttermilk deep fried chicken puts all other deep friend chicken to shame.\nTheir smoked chicken (if you're lucky enough for it not to be sold out) tastes like pork but white meat.\nTheir bbq smoke ribs - well i would go to bed with them.\n\nEverything else is also bloody good. Always always get their side day special vegetables becuase its always been great and i've ordered it more than 10 times. \nThey don't serve their ginger lemon homemade ice tea anymore, but i've been promised it will come back in the summer - wait for it and buy the damn jug if i were you (although it is a unique taste).\n\nAnd the best part of it all, i've never spent more than $25 there.
