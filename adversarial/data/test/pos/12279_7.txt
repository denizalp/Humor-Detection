I don't find myself in the area often, but I was in the area visiting with one of my friends who I don't see nearly as often as I should I remember the buzz about the brunch options here. \n\nWe arrived around 11 and were seated quickly. The layout of the restaurant is just awkward. The aisles are tight to say the least and the booths were even tighter. As we were sitting the wobbly table bucked up and nearly fell over. Lesson learned, hands off the table. We sat and waited quite some time before anyone approached us for a drink order. This was fine since we were catching up and distracted after not seeing each other for so long. \n\nEventually a waiter came by to take our drink order but it was hard to get his attention with any more questions since the aisles were so tight as he was talking to other tables. We again sat a while, trying to figure out exactly what to do since no one told us where buffet was and we were tightly crammed in a booth across from a large family that had a child in a high chair that took up most of the aisle. Finally, we headed to the buffet area. It was jam-packed and there was quite a line. We waited patiently, but we were constantly having to move aside to let people pass and vice versa. The line was pretty slow, but we eventually filled our plates and headed back to the table. The food was ok. Nothing amazing, but I did quite enjoy the fresh tortillas and unlimited margaritas and mimosas. I didn't drink too much, but felt I got my money's worth. I think they need to have a better organization process for filling up the buffet as it got pretty sparse with the crowds of people waiting in line. Not sure if they could situate it in a better place in the restaurant but it was definitely in an awkward location since the walkways were narrow and the buffet is also on the way to bathrooms which makes for quite some congestion while people are waiting for their food and while the waitstaff is trying to transport drinks from the bar (which is also in this same small area) to guests.\n\nThe food was pretty good and I was happy with the meal. Service was slow to begin with but as we sat there longer the servers finally started coming by with refills more often. I'd come back but maybe a little earlier to avoid the rush and request a table in a more open area of the restaurant, like the bar area, that was easier to get up and down from. I'm actually kind of surprised they didn't try to fill the bar area that is closest to the buffet with those partaking in the brunch and trying to put more a la carte guests in the back harder to get to booths. That's what I would suggest for better flow in the restaurant.
