The house was packed last night. There was a wait list so I told Mat put me down for two. \n\nI gave him my first name and last initial, because this tells Mat we are yelpers and that is a good thing. We head on over to the bar which was packed and in a moment i was acknowledged and ordered two beers off the black board live alerts. I also asked if there was a cask tonight, \"next week\" the sweet gal replied.\n\nBeer number one: KÃ¶nig Ludwig Weiss draft poured into a clean shaker glass, this beer is an easy-drinking, satisfying wheat beer with emphasis on predominantly hefeweiss yeast. The flavors are heavy and saturating on the palate, but clean and refreshing. An 84 point beer $6.\n\nBeer number two: Green Flash Trippel poured into a large brandy snifter, hazy orange gold with a tall white head. The beer smells of apples, pears, spices, and malt backbone. The taste is that of a classic trippel. The hops do add some nice balance throughout the beer and the alcohol is well-hidden in the flavor. 83 Points $7.\n\nWe walk on to the patio and have a seat while we are waiting for a table to dine. Outside is very comfortable with views the Downtown sky scrapers. There is a quarter moon in conjunction with The Westward Ho tower. It's pretty nice.\n\nMat comes and finds us happy and chatting away. We walk in and are seated on a two top. I begin asking my neighbors what are you eating. They were super friendly guys and began to show me their food. Drum sticks called Smokin Legs $9 that looked great and a near finished burger$9. Most interesting looking item on the menu was the Bison BLT in a blanket. $8.5. a bison hotdog topped with bacon, seasonal greens, tomato and house made mayo. My gal got herself a Churchhill grilled cheese $8.5 smoked mozzarella and fontina cheese, honey drizzle, seasonal greens and pesto. Side of fries. I ordered more beer.\n\nThe house is in need of acoustics. The party was loud but super fun.
