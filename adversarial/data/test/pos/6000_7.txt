Juice. Me. Up! What a great spot and wonderful organic juices with so many fun flavors.\nThey have a coffee one i sampled that was yummy and I ended up with electro melon and my friend got the nutty monkey.\nThis is in an industrial area and they do stock and sell cold refreshing juices here. They also sell ecommerce and have delivery too.\nI just recommend you research and find the best way to get your hands on some.\nI am not the health nut but I love good refreshing juices in the desert and them being organic and good for me is a total bonus.\nGreat quality and fantastic flavors. I  plan to go back this week and pick up a 3 day juice cleanse as i have always wanted to try that.  Tasting a few of these...I can totally do it and detox a bit from all the stuff I eat that isn't good for me.\nThanks Karma!
