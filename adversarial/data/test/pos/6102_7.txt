Thai food is one cuisine that I never get tired of and Vegas has lots of spots to go to when nothing else sounds good.  This Pin Kaow has been a mainstay in my rotation since I used to live close by for years, even before I started Yelping.  \nIt may not look like much on the outside since the restaurant is in a non-descript shopping plaza on the corner of Lake Mead and Rainbow.  Once you enter, though, you will find yourselves in an inviting atmosphere with wooden walls and accents throughout, as well as Thai d√©cor.  It does get busy at night, but I've been lucky enough to not have had to wait for a table yet, usually arriving around 6:00pm.  \nMy favorites are their Mango Salad with fried tofu, cilantro, cashews, red onions, and Thai lime sauce.  This is a refreshing dish that helps you cool off in the summer time.  I also like their Pad Thai as well as their Satay, either the beef or the chicken.  Service is attentive and the food is always satisfying.  Even though I no longer live near this location, I'd still make the drive to eat here.
