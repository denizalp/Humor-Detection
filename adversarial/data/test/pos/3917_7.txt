Worst customer service at this post office. I come here a -lot- and the workers are always rude. Today was no exception as I had a very unpleasant experience with one of the staff members. I also pop in a lot to just drop stuff off (which can also be a challenge given their chute is jammed half the time), but today I needed to see a teller and am glad I will likely not have to do that again anytime soon. Rude rude rude!!
