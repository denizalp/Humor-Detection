All I have to say is hello shakes!!! Oreo shake overloaded with goodness?!! OK!\n\nWe visited during a bachelorette party on a sunday morning so we were all incredibly hungry. Burgers, fries, tots.... Everything was great!\n\nService was even just as amazing. Our server was attentive and friendly. It was a great way to start our Sunday fun day!
