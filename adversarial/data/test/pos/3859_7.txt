5:00 movie for the kids.  Drop 'em off at Harkins.  Pickup at 6:30.  One errand to run (I'm getting a self-sealing spare for my bike this time.  Sheesh already with the flats) and then we can have a nice dinner out...alone.  Not time to go far...where to eat?\n\nWhat's around here (S. Gilbert & the 202)?  Hmm.  They're all chains.  We're just not up for chains tonight.  What's around here that isn't a chain?  *smell of wood burning*\n\nWhat about that place, Red, White and Brew?  OK!  Not a chain!  Winner!\n\nSo we head over to R,W & B.  The service was pretty good.  I would say it almost extended into the parking lot.  We were about 20 feet from the door and someone was holding it for us, welcoming us to R,W & B.\n\nAfter we ordered drinks and perused the menu we settled on sharing an appetizer and splitting an entree.  We shared chicken empanadas.  They were little fried pockets filled with spiced chicken and a little...I'm not sure what else was in there.  Not bad, lacking a little in complexity.  Fresh and piping hot, we received these within minutes of ordering.\n\nFor the appetizer we shared chicken marsala.  The portion was pretty large, good for sharing.  R,W & B's chicken marsala was not as robust and flavorful of a sauce as I was hoping for.  The chicken was tasty and tender but marsala is normally such a profoundly flavorful sauce that I was a little disappointed.  It was served with carrot spears and a choice of mashed potato or rice pilaf.  We ordered it with mashed, it came with pilaf.  No problem.  We tried the pilaf while we waited for the potatoes.  The pilaf was nicely flavored but troubled by occasional grains of uncooked (or dried-out) rice.  The potatoes arrived and were very standard and on the salty side.  Again, portion was large.\n\nThroughout our meal we were seeing baskets of little cheesy looking rolls arriving at nearby tables.  We finally asked what they were as we had not seen anything like that on the menu.  Our waiter informed us that they were bread sticks and that we had to ask for them.  Alright, can we have some bread sticks too please?  R,W &B should consider the novel approach of offering up bread sticks when you are seated like...every other restaurant I have ever seen that serves bread sticks.\n\nIt was then I remembered reading Christy T's review of R,W,& B.  At least it's not a chain.
