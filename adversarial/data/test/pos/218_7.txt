This was my first experience with professional piano movers. Up until now I have used my uncles or brothers or friends to move my keys. Very professional two man team! So far so good! Pick up of my piano went swimmingly. Drop off was wonderful. The guys even checked on me after to make sure that everything was indeed intact. Great price. They quoted me more than the actual cost to move, so that is always a plus. Quick and efficient. I will definitely use Safe and Sound Piano to move again! Thanks guys!
