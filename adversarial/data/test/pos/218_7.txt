Love this breakfast spot .. modern dining area, fast service and yummy food!! \n\nOn weekdays i stick with the Snooze Classic.. 3 eggs (cooked your way), ham (or bacon, sausage, chicken sausage or soyrizo for the vegetarian in your group), hash browns and toast with the most amazing jam!! \n\nThe pineapple upside down pancakes though are my favorite!! With caramalized pineapple and cinnamon sugar!!\n\nThe pancake flight allows you to select three pancake flavors .. in case you can't decide!! Today's pancake of the day was chocolate chip. \n\nThis location is always busy so get here early or allow for waiting time. The servers keep your coffee cup full and check on you often.
