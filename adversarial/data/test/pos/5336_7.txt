Oooh, it makes me happy to know I'm one of the first three reviewers of this place because, well, I Yelp alot. Ha. I was dying to go there prior to the opening just so I could review it first. I know, lame.\n\nAnyway, I was invited to go club at Marquee, prior to its official opening to the general public on 1\/1\/11. Because it's owned by Tao Group, employees of Tao Group & their guests could get in during industry nights. I went on 12\/29\/10 & I was first in line.\n\nI don't know how it will be when it opens, but I was by myself because my three friends hadn't shown up yet. I just stood in the guest list line by myself & chatted with one of the security guards for a long time. He told me I could walk around if I wanted until my party arrived & that he'd let me right back in the very front, no matter how long the line got. Good deal, but I knew my friends would probably be pretty late & I might as well just go in when the club opened. \n\nOh, we didn't line up on the first floor where it says \"Marquee;\" the line is actually upstairs, so go up the escalators, & get in the lines up there. After you are let in through the line & get your two stamps, a bouncer will check your ID & point you to the elevators next to him. You'll get in one of three elevators that will take you to the club. These same elevators take you back out of the club - you'll be let off on the second floor again, even though the club entrance & the same elevators are one floor down. I don't know what's up with that. \n\nUpon entering the club, you're let off in a room with a bar & signs to The Library on your left, The Boom Box to the front right of you, & the main dance floor to your direct right. I went to check out The Boom Box first, which you have to walk down two flights of stairs to get to - good luck if you're drunk. It was only opened for a viewing so there was no music playing. It is a pretty decent sized room with a bar, tables & a dance floor. \n\nLater during the night, I went to The Library - good luck if your feet hurt or you're drunk, because you have to go up six flights of stairs & a hall way behind the two story main dance floor screen to get to it. There are pool tables & books (only bottle service tables to sit at) & a bar. There's not really any dance floor but there is music playing. There's also a balcony that is covered by sheer panels that overlooks the main dance floor. I was intrigued most by the lighting equipment & the gels they used. (Gels are what you put over theatrical lights to make them look colored, FYI.)\n\nThe main dancefloor actually has a smaller dance floor separated by a walkway for overflow - it is sorely needed. Dancefloors are ALWAYS too small in these clubs, which sucks. The overflow dance floor is next to the main bar, & has doors leading out to the outside, which isn't open yet, but is absolutely gorgeous - tons of chaises & heaters. There is a second bar (it is the first bar if you enter the dance floor by entering left out of the elevators - the whole club is a big circle.) The second bar is where you need to head to find the (ugly but large) bathrooms & a lounge area that has FREE SEATING. Yes! Because I was there for a promotional industry night, there was a free photo booth by politeinpublic.com, Moet Chandon & Seven Magazine where our pictures were taken, printed out, & given to us in a press pass necklace. I like free, so... cool.\n\nThe main floor music was the same as it is at Tao & Lavo - a little less house music than Lavo, actually. They played Too $hort & E-40 so I was happy. The Library had techno\/house. The crowd was more white than any other club I've been to thus far, which I'm not knocking, it's just a fact. This is of course probably because it was only open to Tao Group. There were a lot of older people there (50-60's.) I'm assuming they're investors with their wives\/mistresses\/hired hoes. Will they be there when it opens, probably not. The rest of the crowd was like Tao's - young people & business men. \n\nOne side comment, I really disliked the videos playing on the two story screen. There was one they kept playing of girls in black underclothes, with white stoic masks in a dark room touching all over each other or walking up stairs, or standing at attention. I'm not buying the avent guard \"art\" BS. I'm more than well versed in political and pop culture symbolism and that immediately stuck out to me as sex slave psychological abuse, especially when I saw the masks. Basically, it's a psychological tool used to make the victim disassociate during a sex act which aids to break down their sense of self during abuse. It's a way to take away an victim's identity so that they're basically just a shell of themself and can be abused further without resistance. I'm not some typical drunk clubber who thinks I'm just looking at art. I know what it is they're showing, and I don't think it's cute.\n\nGood music, interesting design but I don't care to go back.
