While \"Three Cup Chicken\" is a Taiwanese restaurant staple that is usually a surefire hit, this is the only place in Vegas that I know of that also does it with squid.  Defreakinlicious!  The stainless steel bowl served full of inviting tentacles, heads and other parts only a marine biologist could identify with basil and the 3 cups (sesame oil, rice wine, soy sauce) surpassed expectations.  The squid heads were my favorite pieces and acted as the perfect vessel to naturally hold the delicious sauce in.  Couple this with a big bowl of white rice and I could have probably been left alone, unattended to for an hour.  It's definitely not for everyone, but you'll love it if it is. \n\nFeeling the need to balance out the meal with some greens, we ordered the \"Chinese broccoli with mushrooms\" anticipating a simple stir-fried dish in an oval plate, but what came out looked fit for a king.  OK, I exaggerate, maybe a mayor of a mid-sized town, but even still...I said \"wow\" as the vegetables were nicely arranged around the center of nicely sauced fungus.  It was large enough for a party of four.\n\nNot one to shy away from more carbs in life, the excellent fried rice topped with very tender slithers of pork, bamboo shoots and scallion was brought to the table along with a generously portioned bowl of \"ma po tofu\", which was also very pleasing.\n\nThere are definitely high hopes of returning soon to try the fish filets, dumplings and noodles among other items.  I'd easily choose Chef Ching's over most other Chinese options on this block.  The C-pop jamz also make everything taste better :)
