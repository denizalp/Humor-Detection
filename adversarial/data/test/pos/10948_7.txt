Just came back from a lacklustre night at Nuit Blanche. Sigh. After last year's debacle, walking around the yonge street area, and feeling disappointed at the large ratio of distance + actual art installations. Also, I didn't like that the Yonge\/Dundas and environs was mainly full of just kids causing trouble, as opposed to actual Nuit Blanche searching for art. \n\nSo my new strategy this year was to go straight to the Queen West area. Well, Since I live at Bloor and Spadina, I thought seeing some things up here would be worthwhile. \n\nThe Nuitblanche website came out with a great way to organize your night and plan your route. They also have an app, but I still prefer the old school paper. You get books and maps along the way, but be careful, the description sounds so much better than what it actually is. \n\nSo to tonight - I'm Not sure if I'm getting old, or what, but already walking to Queen street, I was already tired and ready to go home. But no, I forced myself (and AT) to trudge through to my planned route on Queen St. \n\nUnfortunately, there were huge gaps of nothingness, and you lose your motivation to see any more. I felt bad for dragging my first timer friend and gf out on this. The maps are deceiving, and not to scale. It makes it seem like things are close together, but in fact they're not. And I realized, anything good to see, there's usually some sort of line up. I hate line ups. \n\nWe made it to Queen and Spadina, and discovered a few things. Like some art galleries, a maze made out of tin cans. But nothing really stood out (except the multiple art installations at the Gladstone, and a gallery with magnetic sculptures). But again, walking all the way to Landsdowne, it was more walking than actual passing by of art. I was searching for things, and when we found it, there wasn't enough explanation to make it meaningful. One place was supposed to have a performer, who left. \n\nAt least the crowds in the Queen West side are more to my liking and not just out to cause trouble. \n\nI look at the map again, and see most of the COMMISSIONED art projects are in the downtown core. but I can just see all the crowds and who knows what chaos might brew over there. At the same time. ALL the ones that I picked on Queen st was independent projects. but they were a little disappointing. It's unfortunate that they all sound great on paper, but in reality could be hit or miss. \n\nDammit. I wanted to give the festival another try. This is my 3rd year going, and last year wasn't any good either. Although, despite the crowds, I do feel we had a more interesting time. \nThe 1st year was the most memorable. Things were close together. I remember most of the exhibitions. Queen and University, there was something - Queen and Beverly. - Harbord and Beverly - 401 Richmond - U of T had a lof of random things - and Liberty village was full of things. What happened to putting things that were within walking distance? Isn't that the point of having Zones in the first place?\n\nMaybe next year - the strategy is to go to only the commissioned projects. It's probably that the artists are renowned for something, and likely worth seeing. I guess I will just have to prepare for the crowds. \n\nAnd staying up til 6am, is just not something that I can do anymore! It's only 1:30am and we've only been out since 8:30pm. Omg I've getting old!
