Holy Chuck has now landed as my favourite burger thus far in the GTA. The first bite I took from my Big Chuck (their interpretation of Big Mac) my eyes got wide and I started smiling in utter satisfaction!The burger was perfectly cooked with a little pink inside. It was crispy on the outer surface, but the inside of the burger patty was so juicy and tender that it just melted inside my mouth! The bun was also perfectly toasted and held up to the juices from both the patties and the fix ins. This size of the burger was also just right. Not too big where all the stuff inside starts to slip out, and not too small where I feel like I'm being ripped off for a $10+ burger. \n\nHonestly, burger alone I would have given it a 5 star eaaasilly. I am holding back that final star due to the large wait times. One may argue that this is due to the burgers being made to order. But honestly there are a lot of burger joints that make their burgers to order so that's a bit of a flimsy excuse. Luckily though, Holy Chuck's burgers were well worth the wait and I will for sure return the next chance I get! (If my arteries allow it...) And when I feel like a ballin' adult in the future, that foie gras pancake will be MINE!\n\nTIP: After your burger, St. Clair subway station is pretty much just across the street for you to go home in your food coma. Press yellow emergency strip if heart attack ensues ;)
