Visiting My Sister's Closet can be a hit or miss event.  On a particular day you may not find anything you like.  However, if you bring your patience and a sense of adventure you could find something fantastic!\n\nWhile I have never had the opportunity to work my way through each rack and display case (but would like to someday!), I have found my favorite brand of jeans (7 for All Mankind) a couple of times at what I think is a great price.  I have brought in items to consign as well.  Once you establish an account, the process is fairly quick and easy.  I don't dwell on which items sell, or the price, since I would have otherwise donated the clothing.  Any store credit received is a fun bonus to me!\n\nOne piece of advice - try on everything - even if the label says it is your size, and it is a brand you are familiar with.  Jeans, especially the designer brands, have many times been altered by the previous owner for waist size or length (and all sales are final).\n\nHappy hunting!!
