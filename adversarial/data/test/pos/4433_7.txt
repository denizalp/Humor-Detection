I visited this place 2 times. The first time was to play laser tag. That was incredibly fun, and the arena was very original. \nThe second time I did the Mini golf. The Egyptian themed mini golf was a good price and a lot of fun. My 2 big complaints is that one or two of the holes had mechanical malfunctions. Other than that it was pretty fun and cool!\n\nHeads up- Mini golf is all black lights. If you wear white, you will glow like a glowworm.
