I moved from Chicago 7 months ago and have endured my share of crappy pizza. Today I received a Rosati's mailer in my mailbox and ran home to show my husband. Pizza that I know, real Chicago pizza! Yes!!!!\n\nSo tonight I called and ordered because they don't have online ordering. My fingers trembled and misdialed twice. Finally they answered and I ordered a large Chicago style deep dish with a Greek salad and a cheese ravioli. An hour is too long to wait. My husband almost tackled the driver at the door and tipped him profusely. \n\nI began tearing packages of salad open while my husband dwaddled and signed his bill on the damn pizza box. Gosh man, can you be any slower? I ripped plates from the cupboard, found a spatula and a fork and knife. This is Chicago style pizza after all.\n\nI finally wrangled the box and opened it, and sniffed. Oh F$&@ yeah! Between the tangy tomato sauce and gorgeous layers of cheese and fennel Italian sausage I tasted home. Ahhhhh...after I exhausted my pizza eating abilities I tried the Greek salad. Plenty of feta and kalamata olives with a lemony dressing. I'm a happy girl.
