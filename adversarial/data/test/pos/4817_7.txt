We four people had a pot of tea, 3 rice bowls, one salad, three small appetizers and two desserts. 26$ per person before tips. \nWe don't like the bubble tea here so we had a pot of green tea with passion fruit. We like the tea but would be happier if they don't charge extra 1$ each time refilling it with water. \nRice bowls we had are minced pork and mushrooms don. Minced pork was very good especially the egg in it. \nSeaweed salad was tasty. The bing bread filled with beef or egg were good. Fried tofu was interesting and new to me. \nThere are many choices of desserts.  You can't go wrong with anything. Some friends of mine even drive all the way to get dessert here.
