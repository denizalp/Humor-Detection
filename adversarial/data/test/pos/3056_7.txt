5 stars because the chef personally came out and greeted us and made sure to explain that the dishes were cooked without any nuts since my husband has a severe nut allergy.\n\nTapas style Mediterranean food with small dishes to share family style. Scallops, grilled octopus, roast lamb, hangar steak all made to perfection. The grilled octopus was definitely my favorite. Lebaneh and cucumber dips were delicious also.\n\nHad a nice selection of wines and beers on tap - service was impeccable. Will absolutely come back!
