Terrible! We had food delivered from this place on friday and it was a disaster. The Thai calamari was greasy and super soggy. The pad thai was completely tasteless - just some noodles with a weird sauce and peanuts. It was supposed to have shrimp and chicken. Found one shrimp and barely any chicken. No thai basil or lemongrass. ugh! and the chef's special Karee was especially bad - four pieces shrimp floating with a bunch of overcooked veggies and a runny liquid. \n\nWorst of all - i found a piece of plastic floating in the curry as well.  I really hoped it would be a great place as its really close to us - but never again.
