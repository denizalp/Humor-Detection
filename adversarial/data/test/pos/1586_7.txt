Amazingly small, CROWDED, and stinky! I swear everyone here is both yelling and stinking. Are they yelling about needing showers? I hope so, but I honestly can't tell. I guess this makes perfect sense though. People come here to drink and party, not shower and relax. Haha.\nThis is such a huge contrast with PDX airport. \nI did totally win 4 bucks from those slot machines, but then I had to spend 3.29 on a f*king bottle of Dasani, so there ya go.\nAlso this plane?? Look how old and raggedy the seats are.. Yikes. But that is Spirit airlines' fault I guess...\nPeace out, Vegas airport.
