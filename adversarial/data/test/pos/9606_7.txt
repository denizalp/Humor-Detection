Absolutely the worst food I have ever experienced in my whole entire life (and I'm not exaggerating)! It all started when I walked in and asked the irrational owner if serves Bhel Puri as I saw it last time on the menu when I went for Masala Chai. He tells me no we took it off as no one orders it; albeit a little weird. Anyways, he suggested something else on the menu which I forgot (doesn't matter as I wouldn't even feed it to my worst enemy). Surprisingly I was still hungry and decided to have a \"main dish\" as I thought it would be a little better. I ordered the Chicken Tikka with Naan and when I ordered I was under the impression that it would take a while as it would be made fresh (this whole \"fresh\" thing it reiterated all over the walls). To my surprise (this place is full of surprises) it came out very fast; unusual for a Chicken Dish. Regardless of how fast it came out, any one who has had Chicken Tikka at a \"Regular Indian Restaurant\" would know that it doesn't come out dressed like a Taco! I even asked the waiter how I'm supposed to eat it; he then proceeded to tell a story about friends and drinks but that story is for another review. The food itself was sooo bad that I had a real issue finishing it (If you're wondering why I didn't complain; complaining at an Indian restaurant almost always doesn't work in your favour as I have experienced this before) the Chicken was chalky and definitely not \"fresh\". \nI'll touch a very little bit on the service:\nAs soon as you enter expect to be bombarded by who I assume to be the owner, he is almost always at the front waiting for any customers to walk in and BOOM! Once you order expect the paper take-out menu, which I thought I could keep to be snatched right from your hands. Truly an odd experience as you can see the owner put it on top of a pile of at least a thousand other paper menus. If the magical and very rare occasion occurs when you can actually KEEP a menu and you even glance at it, expect the owner (once again) to come running up asking if you want to order something more.\n\nI have never experienced such bad food and never have I written such a negative review on Yelp. Do yourself a favour and STAY AWAY from this place!
