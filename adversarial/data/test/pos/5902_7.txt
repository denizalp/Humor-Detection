No where near as good as the one on 40th and Camelback.  And the seating, it is so horrible, for gods sakes, get some more comfortable chairs.  I work my ass off to be in shape, so I don't have enough cushion for those hard chairs.  We had our moms night out there last Saturday and my hubby offered to drive me, so I told him to pick me up after two hours.  He told me I could stay longer,  I told him, no way, my butt couldn't take it any more, I went to the chiropractor on Monday, I still have such a back ache from those horrible, horrible chairs.  Stepping down from the soap box, the pizza piece I tasted from my friend was ok, and my other friend barely ate her muscles.  The Milano Mule was good, but didn't numb my back pain enough.
