Ah.\nThe Hody.\nThe Hody is the kind of place that \"Stefan from SNL\" would make a great skit of. This place has it all. Dad bands wearing witty t-shirts. Moms dressed up in studded jeans from that little boutique store at the mall. Drug addicts fighting over who gets to play pool next.\n\nBut that doesn't necessarily detract from its ...charm? It is a PRIME time people watching spot, and they always have \"the game\" on. The beer is cheap. In the summer time its always cold from the AC. On weekends it can be hard to attract a bartender as this place always seems to be packed by said locals watching the band. So take it for what is worth.
