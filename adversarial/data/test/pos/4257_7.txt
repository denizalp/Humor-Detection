Nice place to get a hair cut on Willy Street.  Stylish without getting obnoxiously hip.  Kelly gives a fantastic shampoo.  \r\n\r\nAlso, they'll get you a cup of coffee.  More places need to do this.  I walk into Home Depot, I want a cup of coffee.  Blockbuster - cup of coffee.  Actually, I just need somebody following me around giving me coffee all the time.  That'd rock.
