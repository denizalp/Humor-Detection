Another typical, overpriced and overrated upscale Scottsdale restaurant. One of their unmemorable soups was extremely salty. I asked the waiter if he's tried it and he said 'No.' I think the chef spilled the salt shaker in the process of concocting a nonedible dish. The waiter just said \"Well, would you like to counter the taste with some sweet dessert?\" Are you f***ing kidding me? Not worth the time or money. Do yourself a favor and eat at Chipotle and Panda Expess for a fusion experience.
