So GOOD.  It's beautiful inside, the service is very nice, and the FOOD is truly wonderful.  I reccomend...everything.\nA word of warning though.  Do NOT mess around when they ask how spicy you would like it.  They are not screwing around.  I'm normally a 8 or 9 kind of guy, but here I won't creep past a 6.\nEver.\nYour mouth will hate you, and your butt won't have anything nice to say to you for days if you go higher than 7.
