On any other day I would have passed on eating here. But it's Christmas and I'm not from AZ so I'm not sure what else would be open as I got further north on the 17. $6.99 was an ok price to put some food in me, but nothing I ate was all that appealing. Usually there's at least one or two items that I'll go back for. Oh well, not every meal can be a winner.
