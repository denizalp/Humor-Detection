My children grew up with indestructible Little Tikes toys back in the 80's. Now that we are grandparents I was regreting the fact that we handed down or sold the Fire Engine, Tractor, Wagon, and swimming pool years ago.\n\nSo I went online and located the Little Tikes website. Wow, they still have many of the same toys but with slight design improvements. So for my grandson's first birthday we ordered the Cozy Coupe with a bonus miniature Hand Hauler Cozy Coupe. The riding vehicle has several nifty features that make it so it will be useful as the child grows and matures. There is a removeable floor board that is used for the younger stage and the functional door has a latch that can be secured. As the child grows the vehicle changes with ease to be foot powered by removing the floor board and the hinged door can function. The roof of the car has a great handle for a parent to use when taking strolls around the neighborhood.\n\nI caught a wonderful sale and the shipping was FREE! So for approximately $50. total Grandma & Grandpa's birthday present was purchased and delivered 1,000 miles away from where we live. While \"Mom\" assembled the riding toy our Little Tike busily played with the miniature Hand Hauler toy. After the quick assembly process the big car was quite the hit.\n\nThanks Little Tikes for making such a durable product.
