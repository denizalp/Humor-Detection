I can't believe it!\n\nhttp:\/\/dormont-brookline.patch.com\/articles\/sugar-cafe-to-close-after-this-weekend#comments_list\n\nI have to wonder if Dor-Stop was just too much competition for them. It is a shame since I did have a pretty nice lunch here a year ago. Kay kept wanting to come by. Sugar Cafe even hosted a Yelp Elite Event once.
