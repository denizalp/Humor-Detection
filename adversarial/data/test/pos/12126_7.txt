We came to Fleming's Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar right before we had to catch our flight out of Las Vegas. We each ordered a glass of wine and a few tapas plates. Prices here are super reasonable for what you get and they even have a small happy hour in the bar. Service was on point and the food was delicious.\n\nThere's a huge parking lot so I'm sure you'll never have issues finding parking if you don't mind a little. The only wish I have is that we had more time to spend here. I've wanted to go to Fleming's for quite a while and I'm looking forward to the next time we'll be back in the area to enjoy it yet again.\n\n2016 Review #56
