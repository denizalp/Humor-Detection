If you like drama with your grocery shopping experience this is the place to be.  About 40% of the time I go grocery shopping there is a customer yelling at a cashier, a customer yelling at a security guard, or a customer yelling at another customer.\n\nIts obvious most of the cashiers don't like their jobs and the stock guys aren't competent enough to answer basic questions about where stuff is in the store.\n\nIf this place wasn't across the street from my house I would never shop here.
