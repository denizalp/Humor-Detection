Looking for a way to avoid the long wait at Barrio Cafe? STOP! This is exactly the kind of toxic thinking that will bring you to try Barrio Urbana, Barrio Cafe's ugly bastard child. \n\nThe enchiladas and quesadillas were oozing with a salty, otherwise tasteless filling of extra creamy cheese. The wait staff was bored and inattentive. Oh and I nearly paid Barrio Cafe prices. I'm embarrassed and confused at why this restaurant shares the Barrio name. I can't say enough good things about the original location, but sadly this experience leaves me feeling that my Barrio loyalty has been taken advantage of.\n\nThat being said the Yard complex has a great atmosphere.
