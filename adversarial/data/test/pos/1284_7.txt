For a DMV this was a super painless experience. I would say my biggest tip is to pre-pay for your registration once you get your renewal in the mail. This expedites the process, because if you don't pre-pay, you have to pay the fee by check or money order. Cash or credit card is not accepted.\n\nThe man at the front who explained this to me was so nice. Usually you expect everyone at the DMV to be grumpy. I will point out I went on a weekday afternoon shortly after lunch, but only waited 10 minutes. I know not everyone has the luxury of doing that. My husband always has to renew his license a couple weeks before me, so he went a couple weeks ago first thing on a Saturday and waited maybe 45 minutes. \n\nThe biggest pain is going to be when PA moves to the real ID in 2019 and EVERYONE in the state has to get a new license. I'm dreading that. Look for that updated review... might not be as many stars!
