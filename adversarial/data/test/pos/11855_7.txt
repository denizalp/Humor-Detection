All things being relative for Shinkansen style sushi this is five stars. They have a wide variety, some inventive appetizers and everything is fresh. Located in the burgeoning \"china town\" of Las Vegas this reasonably priced sushi restaurant is a great place to go to get away from the strip and the high prices found there.  It can get busy at dinner time but after 10:00 pm prices drop to $1.50 a plate! Free Parking too! Highly recommend.
