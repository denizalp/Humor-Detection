If I could summarize the overall experience at this restaurant I would say: Perfection.\n\nIf you are planning a trip to Las Vegas, you must go to this restaurant.\n\nThe Jordan's have in my opinion the prefect restaurant for any occasion.  Everything here is stellar.  Food, presentation, ambiance, service.  If I could give this establishment more than 5 stars I would.\n\nThis past weekend was my second visit to Rosemary's and I was just in shock that any place could maintain such excellence.\n\nFood tried:\n\nComplimentary Dinner rolls- (addictive, freshly baked in house and just plain wrong on so many levels.)\n\nAppetizers-\n\nProsciutto Wrapped Sonoma Goat Cheese Stuffed Figs.  \n(Warm, soft, delicate, complex flavors that linger.  Very Satisfying...but somewhat on the heavier side, although the figs provide a good balance.)\n\nHugo's Texas BBQ Shrimp\n(Unbelievable-  The shrimp, the sauce, the bed of Blue Cheese Slaw.....I am sure Jesus dines on this every night.)\n\nSmoke Duck Breast Salad\n(The most perfectly cooked duck I have ever tried.  The assortment of berries and greens were a perfect match to the duck.)\n\nRoasted Rack of Lamb\n(Served Medium Rare....the most tender delicious meat I have had in a while.  I have ordered this twice and so far, both times it has been one of the most satisfying entrees I have ever had.)\n\nDessert\nApple Tart w\/cinnamon ice cream.  Good, although after such a big meal, next to impossible to truly enjoy since I had stuffed myself.
