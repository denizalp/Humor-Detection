This show was a total waste of time and money. In fact, i tried to get a refund, which I have never done before- no luck! We took 6 family members and paid $150 a seat to see lazy ole' Garth with his baseball cap , cowboy boots, and dirty jeans- take us thru the music of the 60's- none of which were his songs. He'd play 2 lines of a song and then ramble on endlessly about how the 60's influenced him, while never completing a song. It was an unbearably  boring \"performance\". Near the end he asked audience members for requests, which were none of his songs. Again,  he played a line or two, and started talking. It was horrible- save your money and go to a bar if that's what you want to see. He should have had enough respect for his audience to at least dress like a performer,and act like one. He probably sang a total of 4 or 5 whole songs during the set.  Steve Wynn put lazy ole' Garth on easy street, and he just doesn't give a hoot. Sad, but true, go see La Reve instead.
