Not just a rent check:  April & Senada (management office) & maintenance staff (Arturo & plus one) are incredibly professional, sweet & totally take care of me!  \n\nI am enjoying living at this complex managed by April.  It is always kept clean & landscaped. It feels cozy & safe here.  I was really sick for over a week & forgot to pay my rent & couldn't call to tell her until my voice came back. When I did call; April was amazingly genuine in her concern for me (since it was unusual for me not to communicate with them). She said she was about to knock on my door to make sure I was okay. Isn't that just the sweetest?!?!  I am definitely not just a rent check to them. \n\nThey have been very helpful and attentive to my\nneeds.  They always make sure that my requests were completed to meet my standards but also to their standards. For example:  during an inspection; April noticed in my ceiling, where there was a leak, that it wasn't patched cleanly enough & had it redone to higher standards. There are many other instances of her high standards to make sure I feel at home but too many to list.\n\nThey are currently updating, modernizing with many improvements around the property. I am very pleased by April's & Senada's attentiveness and kind demeanor. I would recommend anyone to rent from any property managed under April.
