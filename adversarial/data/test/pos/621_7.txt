used to get a foot massage once a week when i lived in houston, so when we visited las vegas this week, i was looking forward to sharing the experience with my bf. las vegas is flooded with foot massage & reflexology places, so i was unsure which one to trust. thanks to yelpers, i selected pure. what a great choice. we decided to go for the 1 1\/2 hour massage for $54! what a deal. they soaked our feet and then worked on our back and neck, followed by a head massage. we fell asleep during the foot work, and woke up 15 min before the treatment was up. darn! the last 15 min was spent on my back, thighs, and glutes. soooo worth it. we are only going to be in las vegas for three days, but already planning my trip back to pure before we leave! it was my bf's first time getting a foot massage, and he would definitely go again. they even worked out this large knot in his neck, and he said, \"its a million times better!\" what a great endorsement! cons: cash only
