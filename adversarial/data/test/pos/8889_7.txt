I visited Aros with the hubster for its grand opening. After the steep decline of Sport Peppers over the past few years, we were hoping for some rejuvenated ambiance (aka no more sports themed upholstery) and some higher quality vittles (aka wings bigger than my pinky finger, which is pretty tiny). \n\nA spiffy bouncer in a suit greeted us at the door (we're not in Kansas anymore, Toto!) and we made our entree. Oh wait, between the bouncer and the grand entrance the hostess actually huffed in front of us and let the door shut in our faces. And then disappeared.\n\nStanding alone and confused at the front, we had several minutes to soak in some of the new: new and improved bar area, open seating, ambient lighting, lots of flat screens, and... a stage and an area for dancing?\n\nThat's right. A live band was playing and folks were shaking it. The band was really enjoyable and played a bunch of R&B crowd pleasers, and the chance to get down on it is always a welcome one in my book.\n\nWe chose a table near the back and perused the menu: lots of things in \"baskets\", but of course we had to sample the one true barometer of any bar food (\"bar\"-ometer, get it?): wings. Traditional, no-nonsense, hot. \n\nOh, disappointment! The flavor was fine, but the wings were puny and soggy. Like wet nuggets with bones. We tried some tacos, too, but they were just 'meh'. \n\nA note: let your staff sample the menu! One item was described to us as \"I haven't tried those but no one has complained yet.\"\n\nAll of the food was delivered in paper baskets and a roll of paper towels was plunked on the table. Frankly, I was a little taken aback. The quality of food and service seemed entirely at odds with the seemingly upscale strivings of the place.\n\nI am deeply pained to give Aros Grill only a two-star review- I want to love it! I really, really do! But like the name 'Aros' whose meaning I can't figure out, this grill just didn't seem to make a lot of sense.
