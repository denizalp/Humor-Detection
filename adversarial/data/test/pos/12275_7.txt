This is a very cute tucked away cafe in the same plaza as nypd off of Shea and scottsdale. I came here with a couple friends and enjoyed hanging out in their spacious and hipsteresque cafe. I tried a friend's chai, and it was tasty. I had a flat white, which wasn't anything terribly special. Their coffee is roasted in California I think, and it was fine. Not great, not bad, but with the wealth of locally roasted coffee in phoenix, I'm not sure why you would get your beans elsewhere. Anyway, if you're in the area, it's worth a try.
