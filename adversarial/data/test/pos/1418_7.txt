First of all Bachi is promoting a healthy theme but the first person to greet my girlfriend and I (the host) is extremely over weight. \n\nDue to the kitchen being backed up and the host telling us we could not be seated for 15 min, we sat at the bar even though plenty of tables were available. First, we ordered the beignets which were burnt and way too crispy. Second, I ordered the crunch salad and my girlfriend ordered the pocho breakfast. 45 min pass and our food has not arrived nor has anyone come over to update us on what's going on. I ask the bartender where our food is and he goes to check. About five minutes later he comes back with my salad but the order is wrong. I asked for dressing on the side and the Gorgonzola cheese on the side. At this point I did not want my salad to be remade so I decided to share my girlfriends dish. Another 10 min pass and my girlfriends dish comes out; strike one for not bringing it out with mine, strike two for it taking an hour when it's a very simple dish, and strike three for it being mediocre. The eggs were extremely runny, hash browns soft except for the crispy edges, and the chicken apple sausage was passable. We would have liked hash brows that were a step up from IHOP or Denny's. \n\nLastly, the manager is not qualified; she did not know how to handle the situation nor did she present herself as a manger.
