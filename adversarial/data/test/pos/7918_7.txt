I love this park\/trail. It snakes through various areas in summerlin and the trail is always clean and well maintained. They've been doing a lot of construction on the area closest to Apple & Charleston so I haven't been able to use that area as of late, but the other parts of the trail are still easily accessible and worth the trip! You'll run into a lot of dog walkers and joggers, everyone is very friendly and there are benches spaced throughout the area. All in all a wonderful trail\/park.
