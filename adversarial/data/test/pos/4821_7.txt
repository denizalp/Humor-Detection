First, paper plates , second, there are kids prepping food in the back, all that said, don't understand what Tha big whoop is about this place.\nI drove 79 miles from Tucson to Gilbert, and defenatly not worth the drive, the food at best is average, a Tasty Freeze with a little better food.\nI'm sorry, but if your on Yelp giving this place four and five stars, you should not be reviewing food, the food is edible and ok, certainly not worth all this fuss, a waste of a 79 mile drive.  If you like average food, then go ahead and go there, if you have an exceptional palate and know what real quality, well presented and taste, you will be disapointed.\nJB
