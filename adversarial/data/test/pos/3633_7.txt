This is a review for a sex product store. But I intend to be just as thorough as any other review and I'm not going to be particularly shy about it either so please be prepared for complete and total candor :).\n\n\nMy fiance and I came here today because we have a certain type of lubricant that leaves us both feeling sort of sticky afterward so we were looking for something different and maybe just coming to poke around a little (pun intended lol).\n\nWhen we walked in we were immediately greeted, but were given ample time to browse before someone came and asked if we needed assistance. I can't tell you how nice it is for people to have proper timing in their assistance and not feeling as if I'm being assailed.\n\nA girl came up around the 2 minute mark and asked if we were finding everything ok or if we had any questions. I let her know that we didn't at the moment but definitely would soon. \n\nWe browsed some of the lubricants and after we had circled the section twice, another girl came up and asked if we had any questions and by this time, we did.\n\nWe showed her the one we had been using and the general idea of what we were looking for. Not only was she able to tell us why our particular brand felt sticky, she was able to give us several different options, explained why they were awesome objectively and professionally, and was able to suggest products using descriptive language, while still remaining almost completely PG. We're not very shy people, but if we were, we would have been put completely at ease by her laid back approach. Within 5 minutes of speaking to her we had chosen a lubricant and a texturized male \"egg\" sleeve, that I won't describe, but encourage you to ask about, as the idea is not for everyone, but is a brilliant and very interesting product. \n\n\nWith our main purchase goal out of the way, we went to browse some more. I was walking around with the two items we had chosen and a girl came and asked very kindly if we wanted her to hold our items at the register. I said yes thank you, and when I handed them to her she smiled and said, \"Oh these are lovely choices,\" and took them to the register, without a hint of creepiness. Do you know how difficult it is to compliment someone on their choice of lube without sounding creepy? Well this girl pulled it off. It sounded like a genuine compliment, and I took it as one. :)\n\n\nWith our main choices made, and our hands free, we were ready to rock. The store itself has polished concrete floors, and a very modern spacious layout. Think Victoria's Secret, meets Bath & Body Works, meets high end sex toy shop, sort of layout. Starting from the far left of the store going to the far right the products are undergarments (women's and men's underwear, bras, garters, thongs, stockings) sleepwear (silk and lace nightgowns, teddies, silk and lace robes, and sets of all combinations), corsetwear (with a small section that has some beautiful and unique lace lingerie pieces that border on steam punk and neovictorian), some club wear and dresses, couple's intimacy games, kama sutra  books and product line, male masturbators, lubes, blown glass dildos, vibrators, fleshlights, pocket pussies and various other vaginal and anal simulators, beginner to moderate level BDSM equipment (including the 50 shades sets if you're into that), kegel weights, nipple clamps, small porn selection, and all along the back wall, a plethora of shoes to the left, and different types of high end vibbrators and dildos, so like your regular Jack rabbits, then the newer model vibes, and the bigger shower suction pieces. \n\nThey have products for him and her, her and her, him and him, and some just for when you wanna give yourself a little love. It's ok. I'll keep your secret. ;) \n\nOverall it was a great experience and they've certainly made a loyal customer out of me. 5 stars y'all.
