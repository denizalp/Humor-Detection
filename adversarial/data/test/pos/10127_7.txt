I had a really terrible experience here back in March of 2011, and I wanted to give myself sufficient time to cool off before writing about it.  I think 4 months should be enough.\n\nDuring that trip, my friends and I decided to go to XS, a club in the casino.  While waiting in line, some drunken idiot behind me started a fight with me.  After fists (and a headbutt) were thrown, security moved in promptly and hauled us to their offices.  According to the supervisor, after speaking with everyone involved, he'd made a decision permanently to ban both individuals in the fight from the Wynn and Encore.\n\nThis seemed strange, since I'm sure a review of the security tape would corroborate my story that I didn't even speak to the drunk guy before he started behaving like a moron.  Clearly he was just some loser who'd decided he was going to start some sh!t with the nearest person, who happened to be me.  However, I wasn't about to grovel since  there were plenty of casinos in Vegas happy to take my money.\n\nI was escorted out by a few of the security guards who'd helped to clean up the mess, and one of them told me that he'd have done the same thing I did.  He also suggested I should call back and try to explain the situation to a different supervisor to be allowed back in.  While I appreciated the thought, I'd already concluded that since the Wynn had no interest in keeping me as a customer, I had no interest in going back there either.\n\nAnyway, I'm sure this review contains details probably irrelevant for most customers of the Wynn, so I'll stop here.  If you visit, stay out of trouble kids!
