The rooms are fine.  The parking is plentiful and free.  There's a strange wall in front of the elevators, and the more I thought about it, the more I was convinced it was somehow an anti-terrorism measure even though I don't really know how driving an explosives-laden motorcycle into an elevator in an airport hotel and going up to the twelfth floor could do very much damage.  But then again, terrorism isn't always rational, and our obsessive fear of terrorism definitely isn't rational either, so maybe I'll stop writing about it--at least in this review?\n\nI would say three stars all the way around, but the shuttle service is a keeper.  Did we catch the shuttle from the airport?  No.  Did we catch the shuttle to the airport?  No.  We drove to Phoenix, sillies!  So if we drove to Phoenix, why were we using the shuttle service?  Well, we were in town for the Notre Dame-Arizona State football game--don't ask, please--and we needed a quick, cheap way to get to the game.  My mom suggested asking about the shuttle service, and they were more than happy to drop us off right outside Sun Devil Stadium.\n\nAfter the game, we called the hotel, and they were picking up a bunch of Notre Dame fans in the Jack in the Box parking lot on Mill Avenue near University Drive.  The van arrived about four minutes after we did, and although all of us were miserable--don't ask, please--it was nice not to have to wait around for a cab among all these drunk-as-hell kids who are probably pretty regularly drunk-as-hell.\n\nTo summarize:  Decent hotel.  Free shuttle service.  Remember, the Jack in the Box on Mill Avenue near University Drive, although I don't recommend spending too much time in that particular parking lot if you're not waiting for the free shuttle.  You might get something else for free.
