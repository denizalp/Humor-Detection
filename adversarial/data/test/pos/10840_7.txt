I started coming here after I moved here for sinus infections. The office staff are not anything to talk about. They don't know how to talk to people who are ill and carry too much attitude while talking amongst each other. Dr. Carullo was nice and informative on the other hand. I've only met her once because usually when I'm able to get in she's not here. Today I've been waiting an hour to see the doctor so far and I came in for blood work! Blood work. I've been fasting and it was 12:00 before I had blood work done and my appointment was 9:30AM. I asked numerous times to please take my blood so I can eat and take medication but no one listened to me. A nurse came in 3 times asking about my asthma.?? I then asked the staff to fax a referral and records to another doctor before I finally got a response with an attitude. I will not be back to this office because I've had enough. \nI wanted to update my review. I came back because I'm fighting an infection and needed help today. The front desk was very polite to me. I was seen quick today. David is the nurse I really like. He's very attentive, calm and listens to my concerns. He is truly amazing. John, the manager, came in to tell me he had terminated me from the office because of my first review. I explained to John what happened and he was very understanding. He agreed that I shouldn't have waited that long. He said next time to come to him but I think he should have asked me what happened before a \"termination\". He told me to disregard the termination and he would send a nurse in. Thank God it was David. The doctors really are worth seeing and can't always help what the staff or nurses say and do or not do. Dr. Shaw came in with a female nurse to talk to me. Most doctors don't have a nurse sit in so I find that odd. However, he sat down and listened to me. He was patient and talked to me before diagnosing me and finding a treatment. I told him I had a kidney infection and he treated me for one. The girl at check out sent my medication to the wrong pharmacy after I told her twice to send to a different one and even gave her the address.
