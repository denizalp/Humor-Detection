We celebrated my birthday this year at SushiSamba and it was exceptional. The best way to enjoy the menu here is to ask the waiter order the food for you. \n\nIf you give them a set $$ amount that you want to spend they really stay within that figure and help you enjoy a variety of their dishes. More than you probably would if you tried to attempt on your own. \n\nStarting off the meal was a trio of veggie dishes including Green Bean Tempura with Black Truffle Oil. Happiness. We all loved that and ended up dipping everything we could into the Truffle Oil.\n\nFor the main course we had a selection of 5 different meats with a variety of dipping sauces including two types of chimichurri, one red and one green. The red had more of a vinegar flavor to it. Different than traditional but still delicious.\n\nSides included collard greens and peruvian corn. \n\nAs a last course we were given 3 large cut rolls of sushi including the El Topo. A must if you want to experience salmon and crispy onions together. Very different and quite delicious. \n\nObviously we had cocktails as it was my birthday, so my sister and I both ordered the Chu Cumber \"chu-tini\" and it was beyond. Anything with elderflower in it is refreshing and light and makes me want to jump on a plane to the most lazy, tropical destination possible.\n\nThe waiter also threw in a sparkling (literally) Coco Duo dessert for my birthday. \n\nService was great and we were all a very happy group by the time we headed out to see Jabbawokeez!!
