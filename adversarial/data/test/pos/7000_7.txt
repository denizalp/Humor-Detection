It used to be fun coming to the Emerald Isle in spite of the smoky atmosphere because you could play all night and, even if you didn't come out ahead, at least you got to play for a while.  Now, you're lucky is a $20 bill lasts 5 minutes in any of the video slots.  The machines have become so tight even the free food and snacks isn't worth a visit.  You might as well stay home and put your money through a shredder, at least you won't wind up smelling like an ashtray.   Wake up Tim, your greed is killing off you're loyal regulars.
