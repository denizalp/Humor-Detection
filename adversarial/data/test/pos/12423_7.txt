Let's start off by saying this place is HUGE, I love all of the outdoor seating.. I also got a bit turned around and almost ended up crashing a wedding reception. \n\nFavorites included the Radler & Mecktoberfest.\n\nI wish that we had stayed at this brewery a bit longer but on brewery day we have to get our rounds in! Will be returning next time we are in the area.
