I've joined my fair share of gyms. \n\nAs such, I've learned that commercials to the contrary, merely forking over a few bucks a month won't give you the hard body that you crave. \n\nUnfortunately, you actually have to show up, put your little short-shorts on, and work up a sweat. Preferrably, a few times a week. When I decide how a gym should be rated, I think about how likely I am to do just that.  Since I judge things by their results, I turn my mind to 'before' and 'during' (I have yet to reach the elusive 'after'). \n\nI got into the best shape of my life at Mayfair during the summer between first and second year of law school. \n\nAfter packing on the Freshman Fifteen, seemingly by mid-term, I finished that first year miserable and out of shape. While my colleagues were scrambling for biglaw summer jobs, I decided to take the summer to work on myself. \n\nI'm glad I did. I returned to school in the Fall physically and mentally stronger than before. \n\nThe gym itself is large and airy; comfy without being stiflingly warm or freezing cold. \n\nDescending the stairs from the (very clean) change room, you stretch out on the mats provided. Cardio equipment brackets the room. Ellipticals and bikes on one side, treadmills on the other. There's plenty of both, but like most gyms it can be a scrap to see who gets on when, even with a whiteboard list. Bonus for the TVs and in-machine sound systems. Points deducted for the doucher who decides to put the Food Network on while sauntering on the machine beside you. \n\nMayfair provides an impressive array of weight machines, a gravitron (which probably does more to build your pull-up dependant ego than your shoulders and lats) and free weights for everyone. A good workout can be had in an hour, and there's enough stuff to do to ensure that you won't get bored. \n\nA range of classes is offered, including Yoga and Pilates. Classes are geared towards busy parents. Hours are less suitable for the late-to-bed, late-to-rise student population, but the environment was relaxed and welcoming even for newbies. \n\nThe highlight of the gym was the pool. Whether pursuing a cooling post-workout dip or an hour long lap session, it was always sparkling clean and mostly empty except for the occadional Aquafit class. \n\nMayfair is first and foremost a tennis club. I am last and leastmost a tennis player, so I'll just note that the courts seem nicely sprung and well-maintained. A cafe on site caters to healthy and not-so-healthy tastes in equal measure. \n\n\nIf there's a downside to Mayfair it's that this site seems prone to flooding. My review is based on the gym before at least one catastrophic flood, so things may have changed. \n\nTrainers are very well-informed, responsive to your needs and not at all pushy. Some are really cute. They do tend to turn over quickly, so it's probably best to think of sessions as short-term relationships.
