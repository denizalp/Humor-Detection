This Sammy's has an amazing intimate dinner atmosphere! I love the bar design. The food, service, and atmosphere were perfect during my first visit to this restaurant. My server was Julie.\n\nJulie suggested an Italian wine, and I loved it. She suggested an appetizer for us called the Crab & Shrimp Dip, which has artichoke and romano cheese. This comes with tasty grilled flatbread. This was a great suggestion.\n\nFor our entree's we shared the Five Cheese pizza that consisted of smoked gouda, raclette, romano, mozzarella, and gorgonzola and the Greek salad consisting of Romaine, spinach, tomatoes, cucumbers, olives, red onion, and feta cheese. These options were pretty good.\n\nFor dessert we shared the Salted Caramel Pudding. Yummy!
