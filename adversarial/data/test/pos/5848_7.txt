Where else can you go as an adult and throw something at a 6-year old child and not get in trouble for it? The age range in dodgeball really was approximately 6 to 32 years old playing in the same game (don't judge that awesome 32 year old...he threw the ball left handed most of the time). Why don't more places offer dodgeball? The trampoline really doesn't do much for the game itself other than give you something to do while waiting for the balls to be thrown. I tried for a high-bounce ninja throw, but it didn't work out.\n\nWe went on a Monday night and it seems like the perfect time to go. There were probably only 20 jumpers total that night and most were in the dodgeball room leaving free reign over the large trampoline room for wall to wall racing. \n\nThe staff was pretty good. It was nice having a dodgeball ref and the girl in the big room would even call out \"Go\" for the start of our races in between telling us what we were not supposed to be doing (no sitting down).\n\nThe foam pit is fun for one jump or swing, but then you realize how many gross fluids have probably been soaked up by the foam and you quickly want out. \n\nTips: \n1. Do not try bouncing on your knees, it will cause immediate turf-burn like symptoms.\n2. Play dodgeball\n3. You will be tired after 10 minutes of bouncing, so you likely won't need more than 1 hour. \n4. Go on a weekday. At least it worked well for us.  \n5. Don't avoid going because you think you are too old to go jump on trampolines. It is a ridiculously good workout and a lot of fun. \n6. Have ibuprofen for the next day. My abs, back and shoulders were all sore. \n\nThis was the best $10 i have spent in years. Enjoy.
