[LOCATION] - 4\/5\nThis place is located on Warden Ave and Steeles Ave E in the same building as Ajisen Ramen.\rThe main entrance was a bit of a walk from the parking lot. Fortunately, there were lots of empty\rspots in the parking lot.\n\n[SERVICE] - 3\/5\nStaff were efficient and food came quickly. A lot of servers worked on that night, and everything\rwent smoothly during the dinner rush. They did not have much time to check on our table, but I\runderstand they tried their best to tame the crowd.\n\n[DÃ‰COR] - 4\/5\nSmall and seated a lot of customers but was clean. This looked like a more modern\/refined spot\rfor rice noodle rolls in comparison to the old-school\/authentic ones in southern China and Hong\rKong.\n\n[QUALITY] - 4\/5\nRice noodles were high-quality, fresh, and soft! Congee had a good amount of pork and\rpreserved egg! Definitely worth the value.\n\n[ORDER] - 4\/5\n- Shredded Pork & Gold Preserved Egg Congee - $5.00: lots of shredded pork and preserved\regg. Congee tasted quite comforting, and the green onion & cilantro added freshness to the\rhearty bowl of goodness.\n\n- Egg Rice Noodle Roll - $3.75: We ordered this because egg was not a common ingredient in\rrice noodle rolls. The verdict: egg was soft, blended with the noodle roll, and tasted a tad too\rone-dimensional. Definitely was unique, but would not order again.\n\n- Dough Stick Rice Noodle Roll - $4.00: I would prefer if the dough stick was a little crispier.\rNonetheless, I still really liked this rice noodle roll, especially dipped in the peanut & hoisin\rsauce!\n\n- Marinated Chicken Slices with Chives Rice Noodle Roll - $4.50: chicken slices were deliciously\rmoist and steamed to perfection.\n\n[OVERALL] - 4\/5\nI would definitely recommend the rice noodle rolls and congee at Yan Ji Chang Fen because\rthey are affordable, simple, and so comforting!
