Haha. I swear, XS never fails.\nThankfully, I've been networking and made some connections at this club *thank you gawd* and have been able to go late, no entrance, no line...and every time I've been there I've been offered drinks by random tables\/guys =) \n\nGIRLS: Trust me. If you want freee drinks allll night without really trying or asking for it...THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE!!!\nAND the guys aren't ugly either :p\n\nI'm reminded on my birthday when friends and I were dancing (completely sober); and a random guy asked us to \"drink our drinks because we can't drink anymore.\" When we got to the table there was a full bottle of Grey Goose and half bottle of Cristal. Lets just say I'm glad we got home ok because we were pretty smashed after that.
