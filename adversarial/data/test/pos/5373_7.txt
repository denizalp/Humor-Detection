When my husband and I just wanted to discuss a possible new AC\/HEAT unit in about 6 months, Christine in sales at Wolff was so pushy, rude and aggressive.  I have used Wolff on three prior homes we have owned and after dealing with Christine we will not return in any way, shape or form.  She is incredibly rude and does not have the customer's needs at heart.  I was shocked at her unprofessional manner.  We are going somewhere else for service AND purchasing a new AC unit.
