Fab food, great deal, colorful setting. Tachido means that's cool, and it's appropriate monicker. Pink panther on the screen, heyhey.\n\nMontreal restos were burning a hole in my pocket. After several spendy meals, I was ready for a deal, and found one (and one of the best meals of the trip) here. \n\nHomemade torta bread and tortillas, smoky mole, tender pork, soup with bananas floating in it, everything was fresh and fantastic. \n\nGreat drinks, too. Enjoyed a refreshing margarita and luscious strawberry fresca.\n\nThe art selection rotates, but the cabinet of funky toys stays.\n\nI would be a regular here, if only Montreal were my town.\n\nCheers~
