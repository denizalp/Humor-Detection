A bit torn here. I think if I had stayed over a less hectic weekend, I could easily envision another star. Instead, I was here over Carnegie Mellon graduation and they were clearly overwhelmed. First of all, the room was beautiful. Modern and well appointed with a huge shower complete with waterfall rain head and hand held wand. What I wasn't crazy about was the view which, especially when paying well over $350 night surge rate, should have been explained. Our panoramic window revealed a brick wall and a large A\/C duct. Was almost laughable. Okay, I actually did laugh. No big deal. Rest of the hotel was modern, clean, well appointed and visually striking. \n\nWhat was a big deal was that the restaurant, bar and valet staff were over stressed and service floundered. Everything from getting our car from the valet ($25\/night) to getting a drink was tedious and that's putting it kindly. I understand a hotel's practice of jacking rates through the ceiling during the busiest times. This is to be expected. But along with the bump in price, needs to be a bump in service and clearly, last weekend it just wasn't there. Also, worth mentioning, is the crater sized pothole directly in front of the driveway that I needed to navigate my M6 through in order to avoid literally destroying the car's wheels and suspension. I don't know if it's the hotel's road or if it belongs to the city but, for God's sake, fix the damn thing. It's dangerous and an eyesore.\n\nNone of this, however, would prevent me from staying there again as nothing was all that egregious. It was more like inconvenience which, as aforementioned, shouldn't have been a issue considering how much I was paying for the weekend ($627 just for room and parking for 2 nights).  It's certainly a few steps above the local Hampton Inn and the plethora of other chains in the area.
