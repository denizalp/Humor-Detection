*WARNING* DON'T\"T BOTHER TRYING THIS PLACE!!!!  *WARNING*\n\nHow this place has an average 3 star rating is quite beyond me. The no-star option is not available, otherwise they certainly would have earned it.\n\nUnfortunately this review will have nothing to do with the food. On a recent trip home from Vegas we stopped here before the drive out. Ordered our food quickly and went and had a seat. 10 minutes go by and nothing. 15 minutes go by and nothing. 20 minutes go... You get the point. At this time we start seriously considering leaving, but give it another couple minutes. One of the starving travelers gets up and checks the grill. OUR FOOD ISN'T EVEN ON THE GRILL!!!!!! \n\nBy now we are all fed up and we walk out. As we are leaving we can see two of our items just put down on the grill. I felt a little bad doing this, but it had already been 25 minutes, and there was zero communication from the staff. A poor couple (they didn't look financially destitute, just poor in their state of being) who was waiting when we walked in still had not received their entire order.\n\nWe went to the Burger King in the same complex, and guess what? They got my order wrong. Karma?
