I'm not sure if i came here on an off-night. The reviews seem to be very different from what I experienced. Overall ,the owner is a great guy. The place was busy when i went and so business must be good. Which is why my experience really surprised me. \n\n\nI ordered takeout for four. The issue was most of the food was dry and tough, and the quantities were terrible. For example, we opened up one of the chicken rotis and counted two pieces of chicken in the entire roti. The curry goat on rice situation was similar.  Two of the four eating got sick after.\n\n\nI suspect i went at a time when they were probably running out of food, the food might have been sitting out, or they were busier than they expected (I went in at 7.30 pm on Sunday). \n\nMoral of my story - i might give this place a second try, but definitely not from Thursday to Sunday.
