My Turkish husband was told about this place and it's the only place we like to go to get his favourite foods and teas such as sucuk, great selection of cheese, and other imports, spices etc. There are also many packaged foods that can help the cook who is not so familiar to the dishes.\nThe owner is so friendly and helpful. The store is small but well stocked and very clean.\nIf you want authentic ingredients this is the place to shop and you will enjoy the experience.
