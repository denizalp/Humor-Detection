We came here on a Thursday night for dinner around 6pm and it was packed. We had to wait for about 30-45 minutes for a party of 6. Luckily, there are a lot of shops nearby and you can walk around until they text you that your table is ready.\n\nPros: The food is not bad. I got a custom made burger with beef, whole wheat bun, garlic mayo, romaine, red onion, tomato, and jalapenos. The meat was cooked perfectly (we chose \"pink\") and got the chips as the side. \n\nCons: EXPENSIVE. You're gonna be paying about $11-15 for a burger that doesn't even come with fries. The free side is chips, but if you want fries or any other side you have to pay extra. The burgers are also pretty small, especially for the price you're paying. We also got the nachos, and they were not very good. I could've made better nachos myself. \n\nOverall: I don't see what all the hype is about. Burgatory is overpriced and the food is alright, since my burger was good but small and pricey, but the nachos were terrible.
