Top notch. This place doesn't fall into the standard trappings of a strip club. Breakin' it down like a fraction:\n-Bona Fide Hotties (no buttahfaces or methies)\n-Lap dances are worth it\n-Not seedy, you could bring your girl along, she'll have a good time\n\nWhy not 5 stars? Because I wouldn't call most of the girls friendly or fun to talk to. They are mostly 'vets' that mostly just ask for a dance (money) and move on.
