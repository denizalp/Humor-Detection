This has to be my favorite Filipino market in Vegas. When it first opened up, my mom and I probably spent almost an hour just \"oohing\" and \"awwwing\" over all the goods before we eventually bought something and left.\n\nMy mom enjoys coming here to buy Filipino seasonings and snacks, but we both make a big deal over the saba bananas that we use for rolling and frying up some homemade turon. *drooling* Why do we go B-A-N-A-N-A-S? Well, aside from Seafood City, the saba bananas here are cheaper and are of better quality than any other Filipino market we've visited. Also, they're huge! \n\nWhenever I visit this store with my mom, we're always shown that good ol' Filipino hospitality from the people who work here. In addition, the staff is always sweeping the floors and making sure the store is clean and organized. The store is always bright and lit by natural sunlight. Fortunately, this place doesn't reek of fish or any other foul, unidentifiable odors.\n\nLittle Divisoria is the ideal shop to pick up those essential, Filipino food and ingredients.
