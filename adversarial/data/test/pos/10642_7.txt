Night Market is one of the best festivals in Cleveland. I enjoy the Asian Festival in the spring season for the food vendors and performances. The Night Market is the yin to that yang. There is plenty of food along with a beer stand. The first event had new age electronic music with strange figures moving around led by a bizarre woman holding a lantern. I felt like I hit a wormhole back to 2003 in Kent, OH after eating strange fungus because it did not seem real. The attendance keeps growing with each event. I went to a bar called The Alibi Inn adjacent to the festival to skip out on the growing line for beer. The Alibi is a strip joint so buyer beware. I knew about that before entering. Check out the next Night Market on the last Friday of every month during the summer.
