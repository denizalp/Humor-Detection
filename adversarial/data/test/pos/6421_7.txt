I tried to take in our experience through Gordon Ramsay's eyes, ears and taste. Here is what I believe he would say about our experience.\n\nI made reservations for dinner far in advance for 3 of us and we were celebrating a birthday. On the day of the reservation we had 2 more friends surprise us with their presence, so I needed to expand our seating to 5. I walked in earlier in the day, of our reservation, and asked to change seating to 5. The hostess was so pleasant and made sure we could have 5 for dinner-I'm sure my awesome negotiating skills helped ;)\n\nGORDON WOULD SAY \"GOOD JOB\" for the Hostess effort.\n\nOnce we were seated if took a long time for the server, Megan, to get to our table. Overall, Megan was awesome and worked very hard. I know it was a very busy evening and many things were out of her control (as you will see later). Waiting 10-12 minutes or more was just too long as she should have been over to our table to introduce herself within 2-3 minutes. We ordered a bottle of wine to start the evening off. Their wine list has some good choices and the wine connoisseur at our table ordered their Faust Napa Cab. 2014. What was then served to us was Faust Napa Cab. 2015. This is a huge pet peeve of mine and happens often (see many of my reviews). Often the excuse is that it's an \"old wine listing.\" I knew this couldn't be the case here as Hell's Kitchen just opened! The 2015 is a bit cheaper than the 2014 although rated high as well. We, in fact, ordered 2 and enjoyed it. The point is to get the wine list 100% correct or your customers will think you are putting one over on them. They lose a full star on the wine vintage problem.\n\nGORDON WOULD SAY \"YOU DONKEY\" Regarding the vintage.\n\nHere is what we enjoyed and all shared on the dinning side. Wagyu Meatballs (ordinary), lobster risotto (great flavor but served lukewarm), smoked Gouda mac & cheese (awesome), beef wellington (outstanding as promised), short ribs (maybe the best dish), NY strip steak (good) and the brick pressed chicken (too dry). \n\nGORDON WOULD SAY \"PISS OFF\" on the chicken. risotto and the meatballs. But....\n\nGORDON WOULD SAY \"GOOD JOB\" On the beef wellington, mac & cheese, NY strip and short rib.\n\nFor dessert we had the sticky toffee pudding (outstanding) and the pineapple carpaccio (served with dry ice for a wonderful smoke\/fog effect). I ordered black coffee to have with my dessert. The coffee arrived cold! Megan apologized and said they would brew me a new pot. Problem is it took 10 minutes to brew and I had finished my wonderful sticky pudding (I would have loved to have them together). When she finally brought me the fresh brewed coffee it was VERY weak with no flavor  and I couldn't drink it. Megan did take the coffee off the bill, but lack of good coffee can ruin a meal for people like me ;)\n\nGORDON WOULD SAY 'HOW PATHETIC\" Regarding the coffee situation But....\n\nGORDON WOULD SAY \"GOOD JOB\" on the sticky pudding and pineapple carpaccio.\n\nThe atmosphere is fun and energetic and overall I would recommend dinning at Hell's Kitchen. I went in thinking this could be a 5 star for me, but the problems with the long wait, wine vintage, a few of the dishes and the coffee had me take 2 stars off. \n\nNext time I'm in Vegas I may try it again. The negative situations I encountered are so easily corrected. I hope I can come back and give them a full 5 stars. \n\nHEY GORDON \"OVERALL - GOOD JOB!\"
