Conflict Kitchen is definitely one of the most unique restaurants in PGH.  For those unfamiliar with it, the concept is to serve food from countries with which the US is currently in political conflict.  It's run by students from CMU, who are happy to educate customers about the culture in addition to the food.\n\nWhen a friend asked me a few months ago if I'd like to try it out, I jumped at the opportunity to do so, since I'd heard so many interesting things about it.  Never having sampled Iranian cuisine before, I wasn't sure what to expect.  Since I don't eat lamb (it's too close in flavor and texture to beef for me, which I also don't eat), I went with the qorma-e lubia, the one vegetarian option on the menu.  As a non-vegetarian, I'm often inherently skeptical of vegetarian dishes (I'm not a fan of tofu, generally), but it was surprisingly good!  I found it to be well-seasoned and savory, with a nice mixture of textures.  I also ordered the sharbat-e rayhan (lemon rosewater drink with basil seeds), and it was also surprisingly good.  If you like your drinks on the sweeter side, I'd definitely recommend giving it a try!  My friend ordered the kabuli palow (lamb w\/ rice), and told me that she greatly enjoyed it, as well.\n\nSince it was a nice day, we ate at one of the tables right across from the stand, which provided a great view of Cathedral of Learning and students tanning in Schenley Plaza.  I look forward to returning to sample interesting food from other cuisines with which I'm unfamiliar.  4.5 stars.
