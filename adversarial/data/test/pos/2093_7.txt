THE GOOD:\n- Lots of great, tasty pasty choices with the lamb and mint being my favo(u)rite.\n- Large portion sizes.\n- Nice mix of 80s rock, new wave, and punk tunes.\n\nTHE BAD:\n- Everything was a bit over salted.\n- No actual fried chips (french fries).  The baked chips weren't bad for being baked but don't compare to real chips, and detract from the whole idea of a Cornish place.\n- Almost $10 for a pasty seems a bit steep.\n\nTHE UGLY:\n- No malt vinegar, only balsamic. Epic fail!  Brits would be appalled.\n- Out of the first two beers we asked for due to claimed problems with the kegs.  Weak sauce.
