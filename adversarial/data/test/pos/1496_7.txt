Such great variety:  Filipino, Vietnamese, Chinese, Japanese, and even some Mexican.  Produce is great and cheap; bag of lemons for 99 cents, Winter Melon $1.49\/lb, big bag of ginger root $3, etc., etc. Where else can you listen to the best of Micheal Jackson while having your dinner whacked over the head so it doesn't wiggle too much on the way home.\nMost items in the store get an extra 10% off at checkout.\nOh,, and for all you ASU students there's a whole aisle of ramen noodles, many without MSG.
