There's really nothing negative I can think of when it comes to first copy so far...\nbefore actually using the service, I stopped by several times to ask an array of questions, and the staff were always very courteous and professional!\n\nWhat I really appreciate is that I showed up about 40 mins before closing time (around 5pm) on the day I had to print a 3' by 4' poster! I was almost confident I would be rejected since most places ask you to give them overnight, or at least 3-4 hrs. First Copy took care of the situation within 30 mins and all with great attitude! The staff were very engaging and sociable, and I had a good chat with the manager as I waited for my poster!\nWith regards to the services, the final product was much more crisp and clean than I expected for such a quick job and the cost was (slightly) cheaper than a few places I had checked with before.
