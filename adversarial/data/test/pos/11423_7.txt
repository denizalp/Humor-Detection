IF NEGATIVE STARS EXISTED- INFINITY OF THOSE.\n\nI am writing to explain and document our repeated, unethical and entirely disappointing business interactions with Planet Hyundai (7150 W Sahara Ave. Las Vegas, NV 89117) and Centennial Hyundai (6200 Centennial Center Blvd Las Vegas, NV 89149) spanning 2012 to 2013. From date of purchase to months after sale, we have been consistently misinformed, misdirected and lied to at every occasion.\n\nWe purchased a used 2010 Hyundai Elantra. After enduring the lengthy used car sales games, and our sales person \"fighting hard to get us the best deal\", we purchased the vehicle with extended warranties and coverage. From this point the following flagrant offenses occurred.\n\n1) Despite verbal and written statements upon purchase that the small dashboard crack would be replaced asap and at no charge, months of exchanges required us to take time off work for appointments. These appointments sent us scurrying back and forth from the new car lot to used car lots with each representative, if even onsite or available, conveniently not in charge of nor accountable for the problem.  Conveniently our salesman Anthony Bonnet was never available to help with this, nor did he return any phone calls. \n2) After several months without resolution or repair, we asked to speak to the sales and floor managers, who could not be found. With this clearly unsatisfactory response, we were told that we were \"unreasonable\" and \"rude.\" We demanded immediate resolution and rectification. The manager \"just happened to become available\" for this, forced an apology, and gave us $5 in gas (for which we had to remind them twice and wait for both the appropriate card and representative).\n3) At subsequent appointments and maintenance, our Anthony was rarely (if ever) present. Promised car washes or loaner vehicles and requested estimates on hubcaps or rims never materialized. Other staff interactions were incredulous about our long wait times \"you guys are still here?!\" and repeat trips \"back so soon, eh?\".\n4) When selling the vehicle and purchasing a new one (in part due to the constant headache of the Hyundai dealership), we thought we could put it all behind us and move on. Our new car dealership (a complete night and day different experience) purchased our previous loan and advised us to file the paperwork to be paid out the remainder of our extended warranty on the Elantra. I took the paperwork to Planet Hyundai and approached a group of salesmen having lunch outside. After I informed them I was not there to buy a car but could they help me, they pointed to the door without getting up from their very important lunch and said in there. Our documented, confirmed paperwork was \"lost\" and after days of follow up calls and request for updates (which where not returned) we called on November 16, and the receptionist told me I had never filed it. I spoke to manager Jason and he promised as soon as I got the paperwork to Dawn at Centennial they would rush the it and I'd receive my refund in 1-2 weeks. Jason also gave me his cell number \"which he never does in case I had any problems\/questions\" we had to drive to another dealership, Centennial, and file the paperwork yet again. After being promised quick handling and prompt payment, we watched as the manager wrote expressly written follow up and expeditious handling notes which specifically asked Dawn in finance to call me when she processes it, I still had to track her down and was told it would be six weeks. before we would receive payment.  When I called Jason on his cell phone to discuss this matter he did not answer, and over 24 hours later, he has not returned my message. As per standard of this dealership. \n\nThe majority of these issues are beyond recourse and we have come to expect what we have gotten already from Hyundai, absolutely nothing. However, this latest concern of being paid out our rightfully owed balance is egregious and has been delayed due to compounded lie and dealer error. This is unacceptable. We propose the dealership, which has already cost us greatly; front the full balance of our payment to us. We can finally conclude our business, being reimbursed in our entirety, and Hyundai will be made whole if and when they file the appropriate paperwork (which we needed and they failed to handle properly).  \n\nDO NOT GO HERE!!!!
