Eating an utterly buttery Frozen Custard, delighting in an Oreo Blendini, and drinking a Key Lime Misto Shake in a Rita's parking lot with the windows down, a girl under your arm, and Sirius Satellite Radio's Hair Nation on the dial during a warm spring night will take you back to 1986 in the sweetest way imaginable. Do it. You can always come back to 2011 when you're ready. \n\nWhile we enjoyed our desserts, we spotted a little boy across the street running in and out of his house. How lucky that kid is to be so close to a Rita's? He must drive his poor mom insane with pleas for ice cream money.
