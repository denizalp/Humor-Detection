I had the BEST time here!\n\nTo eat I had the sirloin and a baked potato.  I only had room for the steak so I bagged up the potato and all the fixings and gnawed on it the next morning when I woke up hungover.  The potato was the best I've ever had in my life but that may have something to do with the condition I was in because it was cold and from the night before.  The steak.... I was a little disappointed, I want a $40 steak to knock my socks off but it tasted like something I could have made on my grill.\n\nThe service was amazing, really, I walked in with a six pack of Stella and they put them in the fridge for me.
