I'm literally obsessed with acai bowls! If it was okay to eat this everyday I would! \n\nI get acai bowls often and this place is just amazing. The different mixtures they have to create a different taste to the acai is a must try! I come here at least once a week if not twice a week. \n\nMy fave is the PB lover with a scoop of peanut butter on top and coconut shavings. If you love peanut butter like I do this will hit the spot but you really can't go wrong with any of the bowls. I get a regular and it's huge, enough for two people I believe but it's so darn good you will finish it yourself. Also a little tip, get the bowl in an actual bowl. Ask them to place your acai bowl in a poke bowl...way easier to eat. \n\nIf you are new to the acai world then you must try this place.
