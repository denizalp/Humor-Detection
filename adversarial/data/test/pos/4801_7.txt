I rented an apartment here this place was really crappy but affordable I have since bought a house but, I can't go into much detail but it's bad don't recommend living here. I had small service issues they refused to fix, they towed my car while I was at work. On and on. I now own a home and am very happy having not to rent a crappy apartment anymore. The staff was OK sometimes but mostly treated there tenents like crap. Glad to leave forever
