I stored some things here for about a year. The facilities themselves are good, among the better ones in the area. For that reason, I would consider using them. \n\nOne thing I don't like about their rental system is that you have to take what they offer you. e.g., if you want a 5x10 locker, they will only rent you the locker that is next on their list. If for some reason you don't like that locker's location and want another one, you can't have it until someone rents that one first, even if they have several lockers in that size available. \n\nThe on-site manager, Ray, is not very good at customer service. Interactions with him can be unpleasant. After I vacated my locker, the company continued to charge my credit card for storage. I dealt with the regional office and they fixed it. The oversight was because the onsite manager didn't remove me from the system - again, because his poor customer service skills likely reflect his general (in)competence.
