I ordered my Easter ham from Strip District Meats this year, and was quite pleased with it.  I called a week before I wanted to pick it up, and they quoted me a price of $2.59\/lb. for a Daisyfield bone in ham.  Because I was expecting 5 guests (plus myself), I told them to give me a ham that was between 10-12 lbs., and no smaller than 10 lbs.  When I picked it up, the ham ended up being 14.62 lbs., and they asked me if that was okay. I said it was, because I wanted to err on the side of caution, since this was my first time preparing a bone in ham for a group of guests.  The total cost ended up being $37.87.\n\nAfter re-heating the ham (which was fully cooked) in the oven for several hours, glazing it and adorning it with pineapples, cherries, and cloves, I sliced and served it.  The quality was excellent, by far outshining the quality of the garden variety spiral sliced ham I obtained from Giant Eagle last year for Easter.  Of note, it was incredibly moist, and didn't taste salty at all--it was clear this was a high-quality product.  All of my guests were very impressed and pleased with its quality.  Needless to say, it provided leftovers for several more meals for all of us.\n\nOverall, I was very pleased with the quality of the ham that I ordered from Strip District Meats, and would definitely order from here again.  My one criticism is that it would have been nice if the folks fulfilling my order would have called me back and confirmed that I would have been okay with a ham above the size range that I specified--although, to be fair, the guy who waited on me did ask if it was okay.
