Heads up, this spot is popular and always has a wait. I mean always. Like even at 2AM you'll be told something absurd like 45 minutes. Call ahead or go to their website, there's a way to hold your spot in line ahead of time.\n\nBut the reason this spot is always busy is their low prices, huge portions, and good food. It's not high-end dining but they put out good prime rib ($15) and Southern specials like chicken fried steak or chicken ($10?), both of which come with an awesome white gravy. Most meals come with a potato\/rice and soup or salad, and you'll get filled up.\n\nOther menu options include burgers, sandwiches, and daily dinner specials (meatloaf, pot roast, etc). The small special shrimp cocktail ($4) and French Onion Soup ($5) are decent add ons if that somehow isn't enough food for you.\n\nNOTE: You cannot order their chicken and ribs here, you must go to their separate BBQ restaurant space around the corner. Whichever one you go to, make sure you get a root beer!
