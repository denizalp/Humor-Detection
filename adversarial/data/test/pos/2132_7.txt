Craving some tripas I figured I'd try this place out. I have driven by a couple times in the past but it was closed. As I'm walking thru the door my mind is telling me \"Turn around and walk away...no one has even seen you walk in...TURN AROUND AND WALK AWAY!\" \n\nHeart: Give it a try. Whats the worst thing that could happen? \nMind: Look at those flies on the wall, the horrible interior, and filth on the walls, what do you think their kitchen looks like!!? \nHeart: Ah come on...let's give it a try. \nMind: No tripas on the menu you fool. Get out now. \n\nFinally a worker appears and asks to help me. I ordered a gordita with carne asada, asked for a adobada taco but was told they didn't have any. So I ordered a carnita taco and a generic Jose Ole horchata (Mind: BOOOO, Jose Ole sucks...). She rang me up. 8 bucks or so with a tip. I was handed some chips and there was a tiny salsa bar. The chips were stale and the salsa was in very poor form. Huge chunks of onions, no heat, not fresh tasting. I pushed it to the side and sipped on my drink. It's bad when you don't even want free chips and salsa. A few minutes later my food comes out. The carnitas were full of fat and not worth a second bite. The gordita was hot, and had some promise. Then I bit into it and had a rock like pebble that stopped my teeth from closing. Not sure what it was but that ended the meal immediately. I finished my drink. Threw out almost a full plate of disgusting food and made my way out of there much quicker than I made my way in. \n\nMind: You dummie\nHeart: At least we can yelp about it \nMind: No one cares
