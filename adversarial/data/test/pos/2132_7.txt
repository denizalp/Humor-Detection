What a pleasant surprise this Choice Hotels Property is in downtown\/Fremont Street area of Vegas.  It is affordable, chic, has a great location, nice pool area, a block from Fremont Street experience, offers hotel guest discounts in the restaurant and more.  Compared to other hotels in the area this is a gem.
