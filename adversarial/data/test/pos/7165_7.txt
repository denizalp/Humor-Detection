Any place that can get me to enjoy exercising deserves a medal.  I knew my 100th review had to go to something special, so after a mere moment's consideration, I decided it would have to be Cirque Ability.  \n\nI signed up for Beginner's Acrobatics with about 6 weeks left in the session, and from the first class I loved it.  Each class has a maximum of six students per instructor, which is a great ratio.  And for something so specialized and with such small classes, the price is great - only about $15 per class.  The main draw for me though is that it's fun, and it's a great workout that's over before you know it.  The hour goes by so quickly, because you enjoy what you're doing, rather than running on a treadmill watching the minutes tick by.  \n\nIt's also rewarding because you can easily measure the difference between where you were at the beginning and where you are now.  The first time I felt like my cartwheel didn't look like a drunken four year old was an amazing feeling.  As was the first time I managed to balance on just my head and my hands.  \n\nHeather is a great instructor and she really helps by breaking down each move.  Sure, I can't do a handstand yet, but I'm working on building the muscle, balance and confidence to ensure that I'll probably be able to in the winter session.  \n\nAll in all, they're a great workout class that I just love and I can't wait for the winter session to begin!
