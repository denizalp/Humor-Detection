This new bar, opened by the owners of Sweaty Betty's, and memorably described by them as \"more Asian whorehousey\" than their previous establishment, is one of my favorite destinations on Ossington. \n\nI went opening night to check it out, and it was crammed to the point where it took ten minutes to order a drink. Despite the cheap drinks and great look of the place, I was not inclined to return, but ended up there a few nights later and had a great time. The staff is friendly (a consistency with them apparently, Sweaty Betty's also boast of some of the nicest bartenders in the city), the drinks are cheap, there always appear to be fries to share at the bar, the back room is cosy and great for, on successive nights I was there, playing chess or random dancing, and the music is absoloutely wonderful: while YMMV, I have enjoyed awesome 90's hiphop, great jazz, lots of excellent late 90's indie and more, always in an idiosyncratic enough selection that I have never felt like I was listening to a typical mix of any sort. \n\nMy only negative comment would be the constant parade of beautiful people heading outside to smoke makes me wish I never quit...alas.
