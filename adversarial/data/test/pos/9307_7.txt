We have a husky and love exploring new parks around the city. She is two and is a pretty keen runner and wrestler.This is a great little park for a few reasons, it has a smaller dog section so the overprotective parents of mini dogs don't get nervous when they play with the bigger dogs and it is right next to the botanical gardens which means it is smack dab in the middle of pleasant surrounds while your pup plays.\n\nHere is a top line of why this park is enjoyable...\n1 - Big and small statues of dogs to signify the different parks, it's like they are the stoney godlike idols of the playing pup community. Makes me laugh every time I think of it.  \n2 - Has a waterfountain (I've only been here in the winter though so not sure if it works.\n3 - Close to Loblaws for grocery\/walking optimization\n\nSee ya there!
