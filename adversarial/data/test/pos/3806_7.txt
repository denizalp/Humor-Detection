I have been here for lunch and dinner the past month.  Lunch was fine, the food is pretty good and the view is very nice.  However, I live in Fountain Hills, and the views out my windows are superior so I don't have to go there for the views.  It was a freind's birthday and she picked this for lunch, I rarely go to lunch but agreed to make her happy.\n\nDinner...well another story.  They had people seated outside and the wind picked up so they were scrambling to get the people indoors.  They told us there would be a 1\/2 hour wait but seated us faster, after I complained.  Interesting, as there were 3 or 4 empty tables when we walked in.  I think they are under staffed.  The servers are good and try hard but there are not enough of them.  The food is VERY expensive.  The tab was $180 for 2 main courses and one order of calamari.  We had a bottle of $40 wine, but still....not worth it.  We have dined at Eddie V and Capital Grill for that amount, had better food and leftovers.  The portions are not large.\n\nIf you want to go early and dine with the sunset maybe it is worth it, but we are used to driving to Scottsdale for decent food and I guess we'll just keep doing that.
