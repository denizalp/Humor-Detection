This has quickly become one of my favourite brunch spots in Markham. Located in a tiny plaza  on Hwy 7, this place is fairly small inside. There are only seats available so I can imagine it can get packed pretty quickly when they are busy. \n\nMy friend and I came early (around 8:30am) on a weekend and luckily they were not busy. On another occasion I came at around 10am and the line was out the door. Unlike other brunch spots, you place and pay for your order at cash first. Their entire menu is written on their wall by the entrance. The service is great and the staff are super friendly. \n\nI order the eggs benny with smoked salmon which was quite delicious! Not to mention that the the plating is beautifully crafted as well. Though the portions are not huge, it was still a satisfying meal overall! It did not feel heavy unlike other brunch places I have been to before. \n\nHighly recommend if you're looking for a brunch spot up in Markham. I will be back for sure!
