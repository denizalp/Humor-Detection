can it be more difficult to locate? it took me and my wife over 30 mins of walking around the casino to find the restaurant. none of the staff at the venetian knew where it was located and it wasn't even on the casino directory. there were plenty of advertisement posters for the place, but none of them had an address or phone number printed.\n\nthe service was excellent once the waiters were finished battling over who was to serve us. in a restaurant of its caliber, i didn't expect to see such a fussy spectacle over the matter. for the rest of the evening, however, the waiter was exceptional (surprisingly knowledgeable about the food and its preparation).\n\nthe feasting began with complimentary pain d'epi (wheatstalk bread) and butter. it was one of the tastiest breads i've ever had. the crust was thick and crunchy and the inside was soft and chewy--but not to the point where your jaws would be sore from chewing it. we weren't even hungry but we were able to kill the entire loaf (actually, my wife had just one section while i finished the rest).\n\nfor our appetizer, i completely forgot the waiter mentioned that they had salmon tartare as one of the specials of the day and ended up ordering the beignets de brandade de morue. they were disappointing to say the least. greasy and crispy on the outside and mushy on the inside, they tasted like fried taro puffs that can be found at dim sum restaurants for 1\/7th of the price.\n\nfor our first course, we split an order of moules au safron which were served with fries. we had heard really good things about the fries and, for the most part, they lived up to the hype. the fries really were all uniform in length and perfectly seasoned. at first, they appeared to be pretty ordinary but, as we worked on them for the rest of the meal, we realized that each following fry was just as perfect and crispy as the preceding fry. the mussels were much the same. each succulent mussel (there were so many of them we lost count..perhaps 70-80?) was perfectly cooked and delicious. \n\nthe meal could have ended with the mussels, but because i didn't know how big the portions were going to be,  i had also ordered an unnecessary $45 duck entree. the entree included duck breast with crispy skin, collard greens, and fried polenta. this was our least favorite part of the meal. the duck was a little rubbery and not very tasty at all. the collard greens were very very salty and fibrous. the polenta, however, was probably my favorite part of the entire meal. it was so light and crispy but rich in buttery-corn flavor. \n\ni deducted 1.5 stars for the duck entree and cod beignets and another .5 star because the restaurant was difficult to find and because of the initial concerns with the service.
