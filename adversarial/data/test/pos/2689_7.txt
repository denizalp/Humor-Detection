I am a local and decided to get away for the night as I had been wanting to check out the City Center. My visit was on a weekday, used my travel agent discount with Iatan card $99 plus tax. Great deal.\n\nBeautiful resort with with 5 star service.\n\nI forgot to pack shampoo, I called housekeeping and in five minutes they were up to my room with a bag loaded with toiletries to last me 6 months, wow more than accommodating!\n\nGreat restaurants! MMMMM SKYBOX Sport's grill! (See my review)\n\nChecked out Crystal's the art complex with high end stores.\n\nThe little monorail over to Monte Carlo and Bellagio was fun and free for now at least, soon enough I am sure they will be charging for the two minute trip back and forth. \n\nLove the chocolate\/candy store mmm sinful delights! Little chocolate masterpieces too pretty to eat!\n\nIt's dark, romantic, classy, great service with a smile, beautiful room.\n\nI will be back!\n\nThis is a more adult catered property, love that! I don't recall even seeing one child in the entire hotel or casino.\n\nI attached some photo's from my stay :)
