It's an Ok hotel room. Not very clean. I walked to the door to find a dirty wine glass and a safety pin on the floor. God only knows how long it's been since they vacuumed the floor. The view is fantastic and the bed is decent. I checked for bed bugs and did not see any. The bathroom is large with a stand up shower and a soaking tub. The hair dryer is a regular Conair 1875 watts. It is not an ion or ceramic dryer.  There is no fridge unless you tell the front desk you need one for medicinal purposes and they won't charge you. Otherwise there is a daily charge. There is also a daily charge for wifi $13.99 but if you go to the Starbucks it's free. \n\nThe hotel location is perfect and in the middle of everything. The gentleman at hotel registration was very nice and accommodating. He gave us a complimentary upgrade with a view of the strip but it was located right next to the elevators. Room 3517 was very conveniently located and noisy if you have partyers on your floor or if you are opposed to hearing soaring winds from the elevator banks. If you are interested in getting some bottles of liquor there is a convenient ABC store located in the mall. Do not go to Walgreens, it is such a ripoff. The rooms definitely need some updating.  At night the pleasure pit turns lively with a bunch of girls gyrating to the clubby like music.  On weeknights, there are several prostitutes hanging around the elevator banks looking for some action.  \n\nThe mall is the best part of the hotel.  It is very nice and very convenient if you only need to grab a quick bite.  The best is Earl of Sandwich, this is a definite \"Must visit\" and so is Gordon Ramsey's BURGR joint in the casino.  Now that I've tasted the hell's kitchen burger, I will probably hate all others.  Reviews for those eateries on my profile as well. \n\nWe can't really complain that much since we only paid $90 a day through Priceline for this conveniently located hotel.
