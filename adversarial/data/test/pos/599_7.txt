Went to this place for lunch today and I am glad I did! This place is really a secret because it took me about 5-10 minutes of driving around the parking lot to find the place. The restaurant name is small so it is easy to miss, but place is located on the corner of the plaza with the dry cleaners. \n\nUpon walking in, I was impressed with the decor and atmosphere. This place has a more upscale feel to it compared to other Thai restaurants. Kind of reminds me of a winery (and they do have quite the selection of white and red wine!). \n\nI ended up ordering the massaman curry with chicken (I don't think you get to change the meat, but I didn't mind) which came with a small salad and one vegetable potsticker. The salad was really good because of the light dressing and the ingredients were a nice change from just the standard iceberg lettuce with carrots (they actually had cucumbers and some other veggies). The potsticker was really fresh and I really liked how the outer shell was crispy which gave a nice contrast to the contents. My curry was really good as well. The potatoes were fresh and had a strong flavor which I haven't really experienced in other restaurants. The chicken was nice and moist (not chewy like some other places) and the serving was pretty good considering the quality as well. I also ordered a glass of thai tea which was pretty good, but not the best that I've had.\n\nOverall I would definitely recommend checking this place out. It has a nice, intimate atmosphere and the staff are really nice and attentive. Their water is also fancy! Today the water was infused with strawberry and some other fruit which I thought was pretty neat. I will be back to try some of the other dishes! \n\nFYI, the lunch specials are around $11 which is a couple of bucks more than other places, but it is worth it! Do it and treat yourself.
