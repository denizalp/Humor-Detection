Williams Sonoma is generally pretty overpriced, I still shop there though because the customer service is second to none. I am willing to pay 10% above Amazon or another retailer for the piece of mind knowing that if something goes wrong I can return it to a store 2 miles from my house and have my concerns dealt with reasonably. I have shopped at WS for about 10 years. \n\nThis particular store has been a disappointment though. I will only go over the two most egregious incidents. \n\n1. About 3 years ago I wanted to purchase a polyscience immersion circulator- a not cheap piece of equipment for sous-vide cooking(it was roughly 900$). I called the store to confirm they had it, and then drove there. Upon arrival the same person who 15 minutes prior had told me it was available told me she didn't know what I was talking about- she did not know what the product was or remember speaking to me on the phone. There was none on display but I got another employee to look in the back and sure enough they had about 20 of them. It had been advertised online as coming with two bonus products (a 20l stock pot and a plastic tub that people often use for sous-vide). I was then told these did not come with the instore purchase (something I had asked the main office about) and that they were not in stock. Long story short 30 minutes and a few phone calls later and I got them. After about 3 weeks of use it became apparent that the device was not calibrated correctly- it was about 5 degrees C off. This is actually a pretty big deal so I brought it back and the people in store were like no go on the replacement or return. No reason given. I asked to see a manager and they said there wasn't one there. I left my information and was never contacted back. I called 2-3 times , never a manager available, never heard back from them. I ended up contact polyscience and they were horrified and immediately shipped me a new one before even asking for the other one back. \n\n2. I purchased a Le Creuset enameled cast iron pan that I had ordered to the store. After getting a confirmation email that it had been delivered I went to the store and they said they didn't have it. They couldn't \"find\" it till two days later. I opened it up in the store and it had a fair amount of cosmetic damage to the outside. They tried to convince me that it wasn't noticeable\/important and hassled me about wanting to send it back. \n\nI still shop there because it is close, but any customer service related issues I take things back to another store or call them directly. I have had less trouble returning something I bought at this store in another state without a receipt than I had returning something to them. (the item in question the employee immediately recognized as a WS exclusive and swapped it for me no questions asked).\n\nOne other random note- as another review mentioned this is much smaller than your average WS store.
