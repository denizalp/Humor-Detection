I previously had purchased BOB before and the experience was great. So this time we purchased it again from Paris Le Village buffet and it was $74.99 per person due to holiday weekend (July 4th) which I think was reasonable. Upon purchasing it, I checked with the staff about the additional fee I needed to pay if I chose to go to Bacchanal buffet at Caesars Palace. The cashier lady at Paris buffet told us that it was $20. We found the price to be reasonable so we purchased three passes and decided to go to Bacchanal Buffet during these 24 hours. \nAfter many many experience with Vegas and misinformation from hotel staff, I went ahead to check with other hotel staff at concierge and its Caesars website about the additional fee to Bacchanal buffet. Some told us $20 additional fee, website said $30, so we prepared ourselves to be charged about $20-$35. \nIt was a very hot sunny day at 104F outside, we walked from Planet Hollywood to Caesars with my mom, my hubby and my two years old baby. Since my mom was platinum member, we went to the fast VIP lane and ready to pay and stuff ourselves with food. We showed the cashier lady that we had BOB and we understand that there's extra fee. But we never expected the amount the lady said. It was $44.99 extra!!! Are you kidding me??? Even your website said $30 and there's no mention anywhere in your website that said there's going to be even higher price during holiday! (Which we have already paid $74.99 holiday price per BOB pass!)\nWe argued with the lady that everyone from total rewards told us it's either $20, $35, and website said $30. She called the manager on duty to come over and he told us that it's $44.99 and its either you pay or go elsewhere. He told us we can go to other buffet within the BOB. I was really pissed off as I even showed him the website from Caesars and he still didn't want to honor the price! Such a bad management and so many misinformation around. They should train their staff to provide correct information to customer because basically, they were lying to us when we first purchased the BOB from Paris, the $20 additional fee was one of the factors why we would buy the pass!! If they told us it was $44.99 per head, we probably wouldn't buy it.\nAnyway, since there's no point standing in line occupying the line, so we stepped aside. I immediately called the customer service line that was provided by Caesars palace website especially indicating to call when we have any question about the holiday price. I told the CS that it was July 4th weekend and I have paid $74.99 for the pass, how much would I need to pay extra if I want to go to the Bacchanal buffet. The CS said it was $35 extra fee!! So I went back to talk to the lady cashier and I put the phone on speaker. I asked the CS the same question, she said $35! And the lady cashier immediately grabbed the phone and told the CS that it was $44.99. Haha\nSo after we put down the phone, the lady cashier immediately informed the manager and at the end, they honored the price of $35.\nThe point is not about the money. The point is about providing the correct information to the customer and train your staff!! And if the website didn't even say abt $44.99, why are you charging people extra! It's like they could just name their own price, whatever they want, which is wrong! \nBacchanal buffet is not worth going anymore. They charge ridiculous amount during holiday to rip people off. The oysters had sands in it and customer service was just fine. They didn't even refill us our drinks the entire stay. The prime rib was just so so. I think the best in the buck buffet is planet Hollywood.\nSo the moral of the story- do not trust any of the staff said. Stand to your ground when things happen. Justice will serve!
