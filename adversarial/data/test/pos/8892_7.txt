I love the food and love the great prices. I love samwhiches as well as the cheese curds they have there that is made locally. What i don't love is the customer service at the Sprouts kitchen, they are always angry, seems like they hate their job and freak out if their are more than 3 orders to make, (imagine if they worked at subway), I go in there multiple times a week only to arrive feeling guilty to put in an order. After waiting a good 10min - 15min i was told they were backed up, which was fine, but the snarky \"have you even filled anything out or what\" is what definitely turned me off. Its not the sandwich's fault for the service nor is there any other sprouts around, so i suppose I will still have to anger those lovable and courteous ladies in the Kitchen:)
