Bite was amazing as always. When I found out they were selling tickets I bought mine and my friends. $15 presale and $25 at the door. PRESALE BABY! We ended up coming around 1pm and just started walking around and eyeing the park and everything that was around. We started out by the Race Now tables and worked our way around. After our first go around our other friends showed up and we started to get into the food. \n\nFood \nPineapple park- My first stop on the bite road. I wanted the dole whip and I got it! I order the pineapple upside down cake and it was amazing, it reminded me of a shot i order when I first turned 21, not sure why I haven't ordered it since. \n\nTexas Twister- First drink stop, We though lemonade and you can refill, why not? And we were a little disappointed. It didn't taste sweet. It was more of a bland lemonade. Only plus was the fruit in the cup, my friends ate it all. \n\nPapa Johns- One of the last stops of the night. When you only have $3 left and you need something hot and homey, when papa was the way to go and it was close. Haha, super glad they handed out the garlic sauce. \n\nCulinary dropout- Not my first experience with Culinary drop out. They had the sames cheese and bread at the B&W party and it was still as delicious as ever. \n\nPanda Express and friends- When over because I saw sushi and was interested. My friends told me it was a bad idea but they were wrong. Probably my favorite meal of the day. They had spam musubi and some cream cheese wontons. They said for a dollar more I could get two egg rolls, so I told them to throw it in the bag. My friends of course stole some but that's why I got them. \n\nRainforest Cafe- Our favorite place to sit and eat. We happen to grab a small table after grabbing some food we needed to st down to eat. They kept the tables clean and they were fill. \n\nClaim Jumper- Two of my friends went here and order some sliders and chips, as well as a salad. I of course ate all their chips and a lot of the salad. It was a Cesar salad and it was pretty good. We dipped the chips in the cheese fondue form culinary and it was bomb.com. They also had a guy yelling about double chocolate cookie that were as big as his head.. Very tempting sir. \n\n\nVendors\nAfter stuffing ourselves with food we started walking the tents of free things and sign ups. The first stop was State Farm, who I already have insurance for but sign up to win a $250 ft card, I was down. Also they gave out shades, awesome. Next was Toyota. They had iPad to sign  up for stuff and they you spun a wheel for prizes. They had black shades, awesome. Also they had chap stick and hats. Next was KB homes. We literally just went there to get the free cotton candy. It almost blew away when the wind started but i saved it with my mouth. We walked our way the the Metro PCS booth and threw a phone in water to get more shade, purple, awesome. Then checked out the idea image booth. Orange shades, awesome. Then went over the the hospital booth, the had heart clip magnets, sunscreen, stress ball brains, and many different colored shade including pink, awesome. I got a lot of shades now, just saying. \n\nMusic\nMy real reason for going, because lets be honest a $15 is a steal. The line up included Daughtry, Colbie Caillat, O.A.R., American Authors, Lindsey Stirling and The Script. We really were just listening to the first couple bands and didn't actually sit and watch til Colbie. She was wearing shade which I though was funny but I love her song Try. During her set is when I had to get up and try and find a sweater. Her crew had shirt and some long sleeves but no hoodies or anything so we went on a mission to find something to warm me up. We failed. The military hoodies sold out and the race shop said they would get more in a hour. We ended up telling security we were grabbing a jacket and sat in the car til The Script came on. I thought they were so high energy and fun. At one point the lead singer asked for someone to call and ex boyfriend and he took the phone and sang and talked and kept calling back when he hung up. He also wanted to make a moment and ask for everyone to put down the camera and just turn on lighters or lights. I really liked that. He also came into the crowd which was really cool. \n\nRandom\nThe Vegas area was really nice and chill we ended up there multiple times to sit and relax. The best part was right before The Scrip came on they were giving away Tshirts, hats, cards, and dice for your car. The lady was really cool and was trying to make it fun by throwing it over her shoulder. The red couches were comfy and right my grass so you could take your shoes off. Other random was the bathrooms, i mean porta potty. When i went in the early day i grab some TP assume they would run out. I came back later and the potties still seem pretty clean and stock. Also love that they have the sinks to wash hands.
