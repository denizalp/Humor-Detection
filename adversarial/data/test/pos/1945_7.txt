Wine, beer, indoor and outdoor seating, and a little shop!\n\nThis was my second time at Duck & Decanter, this place is great if you want to pick up a delicious bowl of soup & sandwich.  Duck and Decanter has more of a market feel vibe with a lunch board where they serve up some unique sandwiches you won't find at a normal deli or sandwich shop.  \n\nYou order at the counter, wait for your name to be called, take a seat, and enjoy your meal. Today, we decided to dine outdoors. The outdoor dining area was perfect. Just the right combination of shade and sun, it was ideal. I can't think of a better way to spend  a lunch hour - eating, talking, relaxing.\n\nMy lunch companions had the beef brisket chili & 1\/2 Ruben sandwich. Both said the Ruben was the best they ever had. I had the Smokey with ham. One of the best sandwiches I have ever had! The cheese was perfectly melted and seemed to cover ever piece of the ham.\n\nAfter, you dine take a look around the store.  The market area has a good mix of items from all over the globe and the bar area has a good selection of beer and wine. \n\nIf you ever find yourself in the area or your  just looking for good soup and sandwiches stop by you won't be disappointed.
