Ugh Ocean's.\n\nWhy do the other shoppers have to be so frustrating?!\nI just want to buy my groceries and leave.. ya DIG?!\n\nMy family goes fairly often and sometimes I tag along. My dad and I went yesterday and it was just most difficult and annoying. We were walking in circles and the staff aren't as helpful\n\nLet's start with how the planogram makes no sense at all. Crazy asians.\nThen, the fish cove is disgusting. I gagged the whole time and wanted to puke at the fishies :(:(:(:(  My dad was pretty grossed out with me HAHA oops!\nSorry but I didn't grow up in dirty Chinatown and I live in the suburbs with a weak stomach.\n\nMy ranking for asian supermarkets in Mississauga central area:\n1) T&T (you gotta love their hours, I can only go at night or shoot myself during the day)\n2) still T&T (LOVE the replacement of the shelving!)\n3) Btrust (gotta love the expansion)\n4) Yuan Ming (I may go like once a blue moon)\n5) Oceans (I rather pay more than to deal with this crap, but i'll give a point for a better parking lot)\n\nI like going to supermarkets where I can use my creditcard and get points. Who carries cash nowadays =S\n\nHope this helps!\n-jT
