Tiny tacos. Delicious, delicious tiny tacos. That's all you need to know! \n\nWe were starved for food, and Mexican sounded amazing. A quick Yearch (Yelp search, eh? Eh?) brought this place up...right down the street! Sold!\n\nOur server was super friendly and knowledgable about the menu, if not a *little* absent. It's a good thing we weren't in a rush. We passed the time by watching the Denver Tebows implode so all was well. \n\nI opted for the 2 taco meal, where you chose from a list of about 15 types of street tacos and rice and beans. I love that you get the option of corn or flour tortillas and black or refried beans. I got a mixed veggie taco and a Pappas con Queso taco. Both were delicious and the black beans were super tasty as well. The regular salsa was pretty standard (but good) and the tomatilla salsa was smoky perfection. (Chips and salsa don't come automatically--but are free if you ask!)\n\nAll in all, I'm SO glad I know about Cien Agaves! It wil become a staple!
