I'm pretty easy to please. This was a short run from where I was staying, and when you're the designated beverage dude, you can appreciate having a Fry's nearby. I'm about efficiency on the beverage run, and they've got that whole refrigerated aisle with cold bevvies.\n\nNow, I'm not a machine and I'm not impervious to the sweet whispers of ice cream. So, with a cart full of beverages I went down the freezer aisle and what do you know, there was a small pint of ice cream in my cart. Convenience, you know. Resistance is futile.\n\nChocolate milk, you know. It's also powerful. So the fridge section was handy there in dairy-land, and the chocolate milk came home with me as well. \n\nSo basically, like any good grocery store, you come for one thing, and you leave with lots of others. Must be a good sign?
