Unbelievable. I pulled up to this Jack in the Box at 12:12am to get some food for my husband who was just getting off work. I was the third car in line. At 12:32 (20 minutes later) they took my order. I pulled up and 'Rain' said, \"Sorry, we were having technical difficulty\" and, \"the other person that works here was in the bathroom, so I had to do everything myself.\" Then he asked me to back up and pull back up to the window so it would reset the timer. I finally got the food at 12:38. I will say that at least the order was correct and the food was hot and delicious. That was riDICulous!
