After working a nine-hour shift, rushing through a quick shower, and driving for five hours to get to Vegas to meet up with my girlfriends, we stumbled into Cafe Bellagio haggard and famished.\n\nService here is awful.  Maybe it was the way we were dressed [it was 12am and we were all in a different array of pajamas], maybe it was because we all had our travel faces on, or maybe it was because they lacked decent customer service but waiting around for 30 minutes in a near-empty empty restaurant on a weekday for a glass of orange juice and a sandwich with fries is ridiculous!  At least give us some water if you can't pour me a glass of oj!  I get that the servers deals with the drunks and asshats that venture into their beloved city but we were nothing but polite.  My friends and I all work in different fields of customer service and the lack of manners and a smile is just rude.\n\nSo how was the food?  Mediocre at best.  I daresay that even Denny's or Village Inn can slap together a better sandwich and deep-fry some frozen fries.  Oh well.  We ate, we paid, and we left.  Never again, Cafe Bellagio.\n________________________________________\n\nSide-note:  I received a nice message from Mark H., the customer representative, offering me to give them a second-try.  I'm flattered for such a gracious offer and I admire they're business integrity on trying to bring the best service possible.  It shows great work ethics and I respect that 100% but I must decline.  Definitely noted though and very cool of them to try and kiss and make up.
