I've been here several times. The service has always been attentive, accommodating and friendly. \nThe menu meets most dietary needs. I usually get the veggie omelette with egg whites. They offer gluten free toast which makes my day! \nThe food has always been very good and tasty. The iced tea is good as well as the coffee. They have milk, non fat milk, and soy milk on tap as well as sodas and lemonade. \nThe atmosphere is clean and bright. It's light and cheery inside. They offer a patio for outside dining and I think it may be pet friendly.  (I saw a dog out there) \nI would recommend this place if you're in the area and looking for a good for breakfast.
