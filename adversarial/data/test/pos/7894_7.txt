Horrible company!!  Had them come out in July of 2010.  When the 2 creepy guys got here, they were talking way too fast in a thick accent and basically told me that the $75 Coupon I had was void because our carpet was too dirty and must be \"deep Cleaned\".  The coupon was only for a general carpet cleaning.  They made me sign something in the middle of all  this fast-talking madness.  That meant I was on the line for over $300!!!\nAfter they cleaned the carpets, they poured the dirty water onto our front lawn!  Which of course killed our grass.\n  I tried to pay with a check in the end, but they said they do not accept checks!  What kind of company does not accept checks?  Especially one that does work inside of a home??  They made me pay with a credit card that I had just paid off, I did not want to use it at all.  While they were finishing, I called the company to find out if they in-fact do accept checks, and they said yes!  I just wanted them out of my house so I just let them be with the credit card.\n  I can't believe they called about a week ago to ask if I wanted to have my carpets cleaned again!\n  What morons!  Will never recommend them to anyone!
