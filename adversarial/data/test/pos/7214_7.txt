Little known fact.  Umai is an ancient Japanese term for \"a flock of headless chickens running around.\"  We waited over an hour for 3 appetizers, that came out 15 minutes apart, with the third coming after we threw in the towel.  The staff was nice, but there are absolutely no processes in place to make this successful.   After we asked for our check, we were told their computers were overworked, so we can just leave.  Thanks for the free drinks and food, and I hope your restaurant flourishes after Gordon Ramsey showcases it on \"Kitchen Nightmares.\"
