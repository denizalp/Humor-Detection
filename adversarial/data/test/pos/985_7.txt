Huh.\n\nThat is my impression of Merc Bar.\n\nHuh.\n\nThank god I had Stevey to lead me to this bar-I really would have NEVER found it on my own. Seriously. From the whole parking garage thing to the walking around like an outdoor mall plaza...wtf. This is surely a different world than where I come from...yes it is.\n\nWe entered in and I was seriously like, ok, I have seen dark bars before...but this is stupid dark. Like they actually DID run out of light bulbs dark. The bar is small and diagonal, and we got a G&T...or a gimlet, something like that. I was gifted a drink, but it was so weak with tons of ice that I didnt really wanna go crazy drinking another one. The bar had ladies that were over 35, with LONG hair, ready to party or get laid. But in a classsy way, I suppose. I wandered over to the loungey side (left of the bar) and saw there were RESERVED signs on two of them. ARE YOU KIDDING? At the Merc Bar in an outdoor mall plaza? That is just TOO much. Uh-uh. There is no VIP at the Merc Bar, baby. Maybe that is the too cool for thou vibe others picked up on, I just found it hilarious and not intimidating at all. Whizzev.\n\nStevey got us a table for 5 over the dining room area lit with candles only. This is def. a late 20s and up crowd, which I can see being fairly relaxing for people tired of dealing with college age people all the time in Tempe. I wouldn't call it a slice of Scottsdale at all, though. These people were trying HARD. JT style hats, suits, diverse crowd, breasts out, breasts lifted so high it hurts, heels, lots of head turning to scope out the so-fist-icated scene.\n\nAlthough they were playing PEACHES, which surprised me and kinda made the bar for me, esp. with the people watching here. I found the servers and staff incredibly nice and professional, our waitress even offered outside on her smoke break to take our group photo-how sweet is that? And you do get validated parking with a lil stamper at the door.\n\nMaybe if I can score a VIP couch and get some stronger drinks, I will be willing to come back.
