My family stopped here for a quick lunch on our way through Vegas. So glad we did. These are some of the BEST sandwiches I have ever had. The Reuben was easily one of the top 5 sandwiches of my life. This place is a little off the beaten path in the seedy part of Vegas, but well worth the trip. Will is the man, and takes obvious pride in preparing and serving up this amazing food.
