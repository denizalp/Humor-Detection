WILL NEVER BUY FROM THEM AGAIN!!\n\nAfter buying a brand new $300 satchel not more than 4 months ago the color started to EXTREMELY FADE!!! After talking with the main company and the store manager I decided to bring it in for them to fix it. Or even exchange it. To my surprise I was not only told that there's nothing that they can do about the fading but they only offered me $80 store credit for another purchase. REMEMBER I PAID $300 FOR THIS BAG ONLY 4 MONTHS AGO!!!!  So much for COACH backing up there unconditional guarantee on there product. \n\nFOR ANYONE GOING TO BUY FROM THIS OUTLET...... DON'T!!!!!!  I will never buy from an outlet again. I never had any of these problems at a retail store. \n\nIt's really sad cause all I ever buy is Coach products from Luggage to socks. And they lost a 10+ years and thousands ($$$$$$) of dollars customer over this...  Guess I am going to start buying from another brand. Sad really!!!
