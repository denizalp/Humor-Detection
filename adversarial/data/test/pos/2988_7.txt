What a great office! \n\nI threw my back out last week working in the yard, I know not as exciting as a car accident or street brawl. I waited a week hoping that it would get better but each day the same thing would happen, wake up and it felt fine then after standing for a few minutes the stiffness and soreness would come creeping back. So enough was enough. \n\nSo I decided to search Yelp for a good chiro and stumbled upon Dr. Reiss and Southern Nevada Chiropractic. I was immediately greeted by Ashley (office manager) who was super friendly and outgoing. From there she had me fill out a few forms and within a few minutes was being examined by Dr. Reiss. He has some very cool technology that he uses to diagnose my problem. In no time he got my back straightened out and then armed me with a daily routine of stretches and exercises to help prevent this from happening again. \n\nIf you ever mess your back up and you need a pro who knows what he's doing, give Southern Nevada Chiropractic a call. They take most major insurance but if you don't have insurance their pricing is reasonable. Stay healthy!
