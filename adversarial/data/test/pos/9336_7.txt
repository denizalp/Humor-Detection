I wonder why this place has 3 filtered reviews?  I guess I am not the only customer who has had issues with the crappy quality of the furniture I purchased and atrocious customer service I received.  The only redeeming quality to this establishment is their management.  They are top notch but the amount of phone calls you need to put in to get one is crazy and pretty much the only time you are guaranteed to talk to one is if you go in person, which I had done.  \n\nGreat managers aside, this place has some of the worst furniture I had ever purchased, one of my sofa's got a water stain on it and they sent in a repair tech to assess.  SERIOUSLY- water stained this thing! I was told by the repair guy that they have had several issues some of the Bricks furniture and it was determined that they would replace it.  The movers even complained that so much crap is returned from the Brick that it keeps them employed!\n\nMy sons bedroom suite armoire had to be replaced 3 times and all three times the door was broken.  The repair guy they sent basically glued it together and said he fixed it.  24hrs later, it was splitting again and when I called customer service they told me that it was repaired.  I fought back and told them I will send pictures if they needed proof.  I take it they wanted to get rid of me and told me if they gave it to me at 50% off would I leave them alone (ps. it is now at the point that this armoire is discontinued!) I took the 50% discount and got a wood guy to fix it for the value of the discount, but at least it works now, no thanks to the Brick.\n\nI also ordered a set of leather couches.  I was told that they were not in stock and should be in no later than 4-6 weeks.  I am a patient person but after 6 MONTHS had passed and no couches, I told them to take all their crap furniture and shove it because by contract, I was informed that it would be less than 6 weeks-not 6 months, heck I would have no problem if it was even 3 months!  \n\nA manager stepped in and basically agreed to a refund after I had to rip them a new one, getting the refund however, took long and they had to split it up over a couple of days since the invoices were separated (something they did).  It took some time but in the end I was happy to have my money back and to get out of dealing with the Brick.  \n\nThe only reason they got two stars was because the manager happened to be a really understanding and great guy to deal with.  I would have given them 1 star because of their obvious furniture issues, lying about dates and if you have ever called their customer service for an update, you will quickly learn that every agent you talk to will tell you something different and they talk to you like you called them at their home and went out of your way to annoy them.  I guess dropping over $15,000.00 on some furniture really warrants being treated like garbage, meh.\n\nThe Brick does have some great prices on several items like mattresses, appliances and electronics, and I say hey, if you get a great price why not, however, when it comes to their furnishings, they are often cheaply made and can be found on-line for way cheaper if you get the name of the manufacturer.  \n\nP.S. I ended up getting most of my new furnishings from Costco which I LOVE for about the same price without dealing with sales people and the quality was phenomenal!
