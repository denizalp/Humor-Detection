AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!!\nI went here on a Friday night and what I saw could only be expected to be seen in a movie.  First of all, the waiter did not say a word to us for over 10 minutes.  We he came, I was set to order drinks, sushi, AND dinner (it was late -- we were hungry!).  He wouldn't accept dinner orders yet... Well, okay...\n\nWhen the sushi arrived, I requested soy sauce.  He rolled his eyes before bringing it to me.  Halfway through the sushi, he took the soy sauce away!!! What?!  Guess I was done with that... The sushi itself was not good -- it tasted like grocery store quality that had been sitting for a week.\n\nWhen the Japanese chef came out, I thought the experience would change.  He started dropping the \"N\" word to the other African Americans at our table.  This made us feel VERY uncomfortable.  As he cooked, he was rapping the entire time with our table.  We live in the Warehouse District.  We know what Cleveland has to offer.  We love it for its diversity.  But to experience this at a \"nice\" dinner was -- straight out of a movie.  My girlfriend actually asked me \"where are the cameras\" as if we were on Boiling Point or Candid Camera.  The food was okay.  Not the best hibachi I have had, but not the worst.  The steak was really really tough and overcooked - no where close to medium.  The veggies were decent and the scallops were good.\n\nWhen the check FINALLY came, 20 minutes after we requested it, we noted the server put 25% gratuity on our bill.  Now, I am generally a very good tipper having worked in the industry.  But this experience was terrible -- I certainly did not want to tip 25%.  I tried to talk to the manager about my experience.  I explained that the N*gga this and N*gga that made me feel uncomfortable, as did the 15 minutes of rapping and hooting and hollering and screaming at the table.  There is a line between entertainment and making fools of yourself at a nice dinner.  The owner ACTUALLY called me racist and told me I had no business living in Cleveland if I didn't like this kind of restaurant.  Are you kidding me?!  Avoid this place.  It'll be the best advice anyone ever gave you....
