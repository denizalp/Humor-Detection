Hellllloooooo, Whole Paycheck!\n\nI braved the crowds - I survived the parking lot (in and out) and the newest Whole Foods is open in my hood.\n\nSure - the store is comparable to every other WF I've been in. The bar is NOT. \nHelllloooooo, 20 Highland Tavern! 36 beers on tap - 26 of them local. And tables and TVs and foods and happy hour!  Yup - I'll end up here far more than my budget wants me to.\n\nI regret not going for the WAY discounted and amazing looking salmon and ahi. I cheer myself for jumping in on the $9.99\/lb choice NY strip steaks - cut to order. They are beautiful!\n\nWelcome to the hood, Whole Foods. We're destined to spend a whole lot of time together, and I really hope I get that raise at work. SOON.
