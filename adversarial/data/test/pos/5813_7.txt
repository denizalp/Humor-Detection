This review is for the Massage envy located at arbros drive in charlotte-28262.\n\nThis Massage envy location is one of the worst. They use some terrible chemicals in their product. I did their facial service for 3 months and had developed acnes because of their pathetic products. post acne, i have acne scars now that dont go away with any sort of treatments. Unfriendly astheticians, pathetic service. they just mint money by selling their products. worst worst nightmare i had 5 months back. when i tried to cancel my membership, i was told its a clause that the membership is mandatory for one year. beware of that clause if you are going to sign the membership. i am paying $80 per month now till october this year  t for not availing any service. such low standards of service and customer interaction. one of the worst place on earth. I am not sure if this particular ME location is bad or the whole franchuse is like that. when someone goes for facial, they trust the aestheticians since face is the most importnant feature. and see what treatment they give to the customers. i am apalled by their service and unprofessional behavior. this place should be banned and closed for using weird stuff in their products.
