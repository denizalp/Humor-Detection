Dined here for the first time on 5-26 with my wife & daughter. My mother-in-law said we should try it and we are glad we did. I ordered a Bean Tostada and a Ground Beef Taco. The taco first. It was Crispy, Crunchy and lots of flavor, loaded up right. Only negative was it fell apart as soon as you took your first bite. No worries though, nothing a fork couldn't handle.. Now on to the Bean Tostada. One of the best I have had in years. It was a thinish shell, yet supportive enough for the all the goodies on top. The beans are way flavorful as well. We also ordered a Fry Bread sans the Honey.. WHOA Nelly. NOT your ordinary Fry bread. Most fry bread is a greasy lump. However here that is not the case. Light, Fluffy and just the right amount of Powered Sugar on top. \n\nI will be back as well. A hidden gem, without signage (which is 100% ok with me), so the \"hipsters, wannabees, and doofus'\" stay away and don't ruin this place, like they do with most places in Gilbert\/Chandler.
