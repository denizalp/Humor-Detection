These guys were great.  Not sure how anybody could rate them with a 1 star, though I understand the frustration of a business closing early.  I took our 6 year old Dyson upright in after it started making a nasty grinding sound which didn't go away when the belt was cleaned, which is what I'd done prior.  They quickly diagnosed it as a clutch and gave me a quote and a day it would be available.  At the time, I also asked about a broken part that we hadn't been able to repair which was used for wrapping the cord up.  They said I'd be better off to order it directly from Dyson since it would be cheaper.  Later, the repair shop called (this store sent it to another location for the actual repairs) and they mentioned that hair had gummed up the bearings on the brush and it also needed to be replaced.  I approved.  A few days later, I got a call the vacuum had been repaired and that I could pick it up.  I'm not kidding when I say the thing looked brand new.  They even went so far as to clean the bottom plate which had some sort of black crusty grime built up on it over the years of use.  Most importantly, the part they told me to get directly from Dyson, was also replaced, and I wasn't charged for it.  These guys ROCK! Take your stuff to them if you need it fixed. I essentially got a new vacuum for just over $130 in repairs, parts and labor included.  A great value in my mind.
