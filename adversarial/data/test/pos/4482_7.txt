Believe, that this sucks.  Believe this is a waste of $.  Believe that you will fall asleep and be bored.  So maybe it was the heavy meal, or the fact that we went to the 10pm show but this was pathetic.  I thought maybe this was going to be awesome, Criss Angel and Cirque de Soliel together.  What great things could they come up with?  NONE.  Like someone else mentioned this show is about dancing and a rabbit and a dream.  I wondered if I was watching Alice in Wonderland or the Wizard of Oz. a way, way off broadway version at that.  Please save your money and go to any of the other Cirque shows in Vegas, they are all awesome but this is so boring that I Believe you will fall asleep no matter what time you attend.  UGH!
