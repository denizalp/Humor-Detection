I've used various PC Financial services (debit card, credit card, TFSA, RRSP) for about 10 years, and I'm very satisfied. The PC points aren't as generous as they used to be, but I still appreciate the free groceries that I earn with them as well as the no-fee banking. My debit card was compromised at a 3rd party ATM a couple of years ago, and PC Financial detected and dealt with the problem very quickly.  If you're a fan of Loblaws products (which I am) then PC Financial is a no-brainer because of the built-in ATMs at every Loblaws, and the points you earn by shopping there towards more groceries.
