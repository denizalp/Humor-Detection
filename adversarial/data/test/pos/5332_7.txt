Where to start.....lol  Sat at the bar with the gf during football game and was generally ignored by the bartender.  Although she had no problem taking care of what could only be considered regulars since she knew their names.  Ordered several appetizers, which weren't bad, but not outstanding in any way.  Far from being the \"Best Wings in Westlake\" as advertised. The best part of the evening was listening to a middle aged drunk woman screaming \"Bring it all day...Bring it all day\" every time the football team she was cheering for scored. (They lost by the way and she was very unhappy) :(  Not the worst I've been in but won't be going back.
