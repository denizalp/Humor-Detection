I've only ever had the house special banh mi here.  It is very good.  My friends tell me not to get anything else here and that this is the best banh mi in town.  \n\nAt some point I plan on doing a taste test with Pho Thanh Huong and Hue Thai, but for now I've only had banh mi here and they have been good every time.  Good bread, good pressed meat, fresh veg.
