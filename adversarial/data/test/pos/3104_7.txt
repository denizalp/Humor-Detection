I AM BEYOND IMPRESSED.\n\nAs a major foodie coming from Southern California for Spring break, I have ate my hearts out around Orange County but this place. This place is something special. \n\nThe service was amazing! My glass of water was never empty for more than 1 minute. The server was very informative and helpful. He really knew his cows. \n\nFinally decided on Filet mignon, medium rare. BEST. I Have EVER had. Morton Steakhouse has nothing on this mother Spaceship of a Steakhouse... \n\nI always thought people sounded so stupid when they said meat melted like butter in my mouth until this filet mignon melted in my mouth, LITERALLY like butter. Okay. You get my point. \n\nWHAT THE BUCK ARE YOU WAITING FOR! GOGOO!!! Good luck foodies :) muah xo \n\nPS THE MASH POTATOES ......... #idiedofhappiness
