I unfortunately have to go to the ER at least once a month due to severe migraines. The doctors and physicians assistants are quick as possible and get me the right medicines. I've rarely spent more than 2 hours here, and only had a handful of bad incidences (involving nurses who don't listen to me: \"if you give me that medicine without an antinausea, I will vomit\"). I like the quick rooms (for non trauma) which are quieter and have adjustable lighting that helps during my migraine treatment  much better than the rooms with the uncomfortable gurneys. They have these rolling recliners, it feels less hospitaly, which is probably why its less stressful. \n\nThey also limit to one visitor per bedside (which is mostly adhered to), so no running around kids and screaming babies. \n\nThe only reasons it doesn't get five stars are the times when I've had rude nurses who act like they're doing some kind of charity when they're doing their job, and the ones who decide they know my body better than I do (four years of daily migraines, but hey, if they want to wear vomit, its their choice). I also had to visit family in the regular part of the hospital once (I've never been admitted to any part other than ER), and the waiting room was packed. Children everywhere, people sitting on floors, it was awful. There was that gross smell from just too many people in one tiny waiting room because of visiting hours being so restricted. Actually, that part reminded me of a bus station. \n\nIf The Walking Dead is on while you're there (TV's in the quick rooms), people seem to be in a better mood when they come in to help you or who ever your roommate is on the other side of the curtain. \n\nPS: My partner of 6 yrs takes me there every time. Everyone is nice, helpful, and she has never been banned from my bedside or treated rudely because of our sexual orientation.
