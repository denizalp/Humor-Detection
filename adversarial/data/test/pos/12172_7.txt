Best little hole-in-the-wall sandwich shop. Mom and Pop owned and operated. I never in a million years would have found this place if it hadn't been for Yelp. The reviews were spot on...excellent handmade\/homemade sandwiches with very generous portions. \n\nOnly negative could be they have a tuna sandwich and veggie sandwich as the only offerings for vegetarians, (had one with me that day. Mostly delicious burgers, chicken and pork sandwiches.\n\nGo to this place and you will not be disappointed.
