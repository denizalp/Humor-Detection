Exige Medi Spa, is one of the best here in Calgary. The atmosphere at Exige is very warm and relaxing. I've had a few massages at Exige and each massage has left me feeling revitalized. \n\nI always get their Thai Massage and with all the stretching and acupressure from this massage, it sure has helped me with the knots that I normally get from working in an office. I always feel refreshed and full of energy after my massage. \n\nGo and try Exige.It's definitely worth going to.
