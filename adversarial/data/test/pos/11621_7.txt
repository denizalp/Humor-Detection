Food and overall experience deserves 5 stars! This was suggested by our driver after telling him how hungry we were after the helicopter ride tour to Grand Canyon. Lots of locals likes this steakhouse apparently and I can see why. It's a block away from Fremont street experience so it's convenient to get to also. It was a beautiful night so we opted to sit in the front patio. Gorgeous and you can subtly hear the music from the Fremont Street shenanigans. \n\nWe ordered the ribeye with mashed potatoes and the pot roast. It was phenomenal. The steak was tender and cooked to medium rare perfection. Flavorful and amazing with the potatoes. We found the mashed a tad bit on the salty side but it wasn't a deal breaker. But the pot roast oooooh! You won't be disappointed. Generous portion and it was very tender but not overcooked. It wasn't soggy and didn't look like carnitas on your plate. Definitely a must have and if I could, wish to be having some right now. \n\nCocktails were good. Beware of ordering the old fashioned... We found there was nothing \"old fashioned\" about it. Aside from that, we will return next time we are in Vegas. It's a nice switch from other steakhouses and it was priced between 24-35 per dish. Not bad.
