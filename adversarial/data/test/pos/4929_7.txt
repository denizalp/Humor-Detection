Newsflash: This is a real review for this place!  Hopefully soon they will filter all of the bogus reviews for this place. \n\nTo my knowledge, this is one of the only places in Vegas that you can get Korean Chicken wings. so fake hype or not, this place was on our radar however, we tempered our expectations. \n\nWe ordered 1 8pc spicy and 1 8pc traditional BBQ. The clerk said that they are made to order and would take about 10 minutes; so plan accordingly... \n\nWe balked at the prices for 8 wings however it was quickly put to rest with the sheer size of the wings. Reference the soda can in my picture for proof. Size matters! I hate when you order wings and end up with micro sized wings.\n\nThe traditional BBQ sauce is very similar to garlic chicken glaze that us 808 people love (think sugois and fat boyz) just not as garlicy.. \n\nThe spicy BBQ sauce was they typical kochujang\/garlic spice that we all come to expect when eating Korean food. Very close to Banchan but not quite..... \n\nBoth versions of were delicious and were free from frying defects that previous reviewers reported. My only gripe is that they were not saucy enough. No need to give us ranch to dip our wings in; save money and add more sauce to the wings! Other than that I think that our tempered expectations were met. \n\n\nOne final note: they offer a free soda with FB or 4-sq check in.
