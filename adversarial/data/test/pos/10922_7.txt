Please lord take me now! I had decided to try sushi ko because I walk past it everyday. Worst mistake I could have made. I ordered the shrimp tempura roll and have spent most of the rest of my work day in and out of the bathroom. Talking to my coworkers about my horrible experience they shared with me that they have a client who knows the owner and the client won't even eat there. Wish I had known before I ate my tempura shits roll.
