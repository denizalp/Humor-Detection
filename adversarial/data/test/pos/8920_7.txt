My experience here was great. After eating lunch next door, my friends and I stopped by to grab some frozen yogurt for dessert earlier today. There were so many flavors - cinnamon bun, pumpkin, watermelon, oreos, peanut butter, salted caramel popcorn, cake batter, vanilla, chocolate, etc. There were also so many toppings to choose from - the most I've ever seen at any frozen yogurt joint - so I was impressed.\n\nThere were so many of those popping bubbles; I've only tasted strawberry and mango really, so I was having a great time.\n\nThere are three tvs, board games, a lake in the back of the shop. No wi-fi. Seating is pretty decent.
