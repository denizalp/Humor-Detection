We had a great meal here while in town for my future sister-in-law's college graduation.    This is one of her favorite restaurants in town, so the whole family (party of 10) came here to grab dinner.  I was super impressed!  The bread basket that started the meal was delicious, and served with their homemade olive oil.  The menu was extensive and had an interesting mix of Turkish, Greek, and Italian entrees.   For my entree, I had the \"tavuk omer pasa\" (chicken with mushrooms in cream sauce), which was fantastic.   My fiance had the chicken kebab, which was great as well.  The chicken in both dishes was very flavorful and juicy, and the portions were good-sized.   Entrees also included soup or salad & rice.    Prices were very reasonable considering the quantity and quality of food (many entrees in the $10-$13 range).  They did an excellent job accommodating our party of 10.  I would love to come back here if I were in Madison again and I definitely recommend this place to others.\n\n(Best ___: Best Mediterranean)
