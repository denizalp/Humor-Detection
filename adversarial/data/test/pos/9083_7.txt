Chalkers is a really nice pool hall\/restaurant. The place itself is clean and spacious and to play pool it's pretty cheap. The patio is really nice in the summer. The food is mediocre and could be cheaper. The have alligator as an appetizer but I haven't tried it yet. I heard it's ok and tastes like chicken lol \n\nI really like the jazz nights they have on Wednesdays!! Great for a date.
