I'm writing this review after I just got home from this wonderful office! I have heard about some really BAD filler Drs here in Vegas. So I waited till I found them and I'm glad, I could not be happier with my Botox and Filler! The Dr. Knows his shit! He's an injecting king! Trish the Cosmetic coordinator is very kind and helpful! I could not have asked for a better experience for my first time getting these services. The pain was very minimal , swelling isn't that bad either and I do NOT have DUCK lips! I highly recommend this office! Four women I know have gone there and I finally tried them. I was nervous as this is my first time having filler in my face. I model part time and was very scared my face would completely be changed. It's not. I look like I'm 28 and I'm 38! There will be some swelling for a few weeks. Not notable though. Already is going down. If you are thinking about it. Try a consultation and see how you feel. They're very warm and comforting. I will be a regular. Thank you Dr.Aspacio & Trish!\n\n*** I would like to note..  Since someone wrote that these reviews are scripted??? Mine is not! I truly believe like in any business you can not please everyone as some simply can not be pleased no matter what the situation. To make a blanket statement that she made is BS! I know 4 women who love Dr Aspacio and his team! They know 4 women and so do they. I'm sure you see where I'm going with this. For every 1 unhappy customer there are dozens that ARE happy! \n\nAs you all read before, I am very pleased and I highly recommend this establishment and I was not asked to write this review. After spending a couple hours there with them I think I can make an assessment and write a review based on my experience. If you read my other reviews you will see I'm very picky! Check em out and you will see that I'm not bias at all!
