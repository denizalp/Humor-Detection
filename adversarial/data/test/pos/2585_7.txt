Food was ok. \n\nWalked 3\/4 of a mile while on hold, only to get disconnected. Called back multiple times but calls were ignored. Continued calling as I arrived at the location. Watched as the barkeep took 5 orders in front of me, then turned to the other customers and mocked the person on the phone (me). \n\nDon't advertise that your establishment serves take-out if you won't pick up the phone.
