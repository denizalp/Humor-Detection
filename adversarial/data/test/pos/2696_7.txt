Absolutely loved this little spot. I was looking for somewhere to take my dog with me for breakfast because he needed to go to the vets afterwords. Crepe Expectations popped up on my yelp and I decided to check it out. Our waiter, who's name we didn't get, was absolutely incredible. He checked on us, my dog, and brought my dog water and treats! My dog had a great time sniffing everything and hanging out and the crepes were delicious. I will definitely be back with my other dog :-)
