FAQ\n\nQ: OMGz!!!1! DID U SEE THAT ULTIMATE FIGHTER GUY? WAS PARIS OR BRIT-BRIT THERE? LOL\nA: Wow. Are you a 14-year-old girl? Anyway, there were some celebs there. Some UFC guy. Mandy Moore maybe? Who knows. It was a while ago. I don't keep track of those things. What I *did* keep track of was the $40.00 (for guys) to get in the club. And the expensive drinks.\n\nQ: yo. did u holla at some hot bitchez?? fo realz.\nA: There are some attractive women there. Here's a tip for the girls, if you didn't spend hundreds upon hundreds for a table, check out the girls bathroom. There's a weird counter you can sit on.\n\nQ: So you had a pretty good time?\nA: Pre-drink (heavily), get in line super early, if you're a guy, go with a bunch of girls. Work your way up front. Pay the cover (don't think, just pay) and buy a few drinks (don't think, just pay) and dance. Aside from the price it's a pretty good time.\n\n\nFYI ... There's no place to sit. Deal with it. You didn't come to Vegas to sit. Also, the roof-top area is pretty awesome. Great view from there. Enjoy.
