Decided to stop by to have two of my watch batteries replaced. Read the great reviews. Arrived at 9:50 AM to find the shop opens at 10 AM. I waited. Another car came at 10 and the driver went to the door. Still locked. I waiting ten more minutes and decided to leave. Only can decide the shop is great but it failed to open on time. Chose to go to another shop.
