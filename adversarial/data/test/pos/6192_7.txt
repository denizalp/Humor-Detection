One of my favorite lunch destinations and so this review is based on my lunch experience alone. This location is convenient to the many errand spots and stops one must accomplish during the day so I usually feel somewhat rewarded when Bonefish Grill ends up being the last stop over my lunch break.\n\nMy first impression while entering through their revolving door was that this place feels smooth and looks inviting.\n\nWe were promptly greeted by the hostess and then were led through the warmly lit dining room to the most comfortable, cushiony booth ever!\n\nThe dining room was fairly busy with an active lunch crowd yet I quickly noticed how pleasantly peaceful the sound level was even with all the conversations around me going in full tilt.  How relaxing and refreshing not to have to shout to your dining partner.\n\nWe were warmly greeted by our server who was wearing a very nicely pressed professional looking waiters jacket as did the other servers and bar staff. Nice touch.\n\nWhile glancing through the menu I immediately realized that an overabundance of delightful choices lie ahead of me!  Not your same old same old lunch options at all. \n\nGreat appetizer listings include things like the Bang Bang Shrimp, PEI mussels, lamb lollipop chops, fresh oysters and much more. There are soups like lobster bisque, or corn chowder and lump crab. The menu also features wedge salads, cobb salads, cilantro lime shrimp salad, Fresh fish of the day, Sandwiches such as BFG fish, Kobe beef burger, Bang Bang Shrimp tacos.  Too much to list but if choosing is hard to do then there is always the lunch combo.\n\nThe lunch combos allow you to go with a soup and salad, or the soup or salad and wrap, or soup or salad and soft tacos and are all under $10.00.\n\nAll in all lunch at the Bonefish Grill is a first class experience at an affordable price.
