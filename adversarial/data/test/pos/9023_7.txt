WHAT TO TRY?!\n\nThe squash poutine, the tempura chicken with deviled egg, the torched mackerel and if you have a bigger appetite, the sizzling plates are good to share with 2-3 ppl!\n\nI particularly liked the squash poutine because of the intricacies and layers of flavors to this dish. Not like the typical poutine, this dish has mayo, kimchi, pickled radish, black sesame seeds, and green onions. Very different approach to using fried squash rather than potato or yam fries!\n\nThe tempura chicken with deviled egg was also good. It's a bigger dish and has enough chicken to share with two ppl. Dip in the mayo and add on some seaweed! Yum. \n\nThe torched mackerel is a rather plainer dish where it doesn't have much seasoning to the dish. It's nice to have a dish that doesn't have a lot of flavors going on when all the other dishes are very sauce heavy. The mackerel is torched at tableside and it's great to dip in the soy sauce. \n\nI didn't order the sizzling plates but looking at other tables, the sizzling plate is towering with food so it's good to order to share. It comes with white rice too. \n\nLAST TIP?!\n\nThis is a hole in the wall where you might miss it if you're not looking carefully. The name of the restaurant is rather in a discrete location and on top of a mailbox actually! Be prepared to wait in line though because they don't take reservations as the restaurant is rather small and there's usually a lot of people. Especially with prices that are reasonable for the dishes, of course this place is going to attract people to come visit and come back!
