Well, I didn't get knifed on the walk there at least, that's worth at least half a star no?  The area around this store is a little Stabby Mc. Stabberson....not so ideal and the \"pole barn\" look of the exterior should have been a warning.\n\nAs Elaine K. said, this looks like a place where her mom might shop, well, actually maybe I'm younger, this looks more like my grandparents' generation.  I would characterize the selection as old, formal, and sort of junky.  I found almost the same model of couch I ended up purchasing from Leon's here, but it was $300 more expensive.  Additionally, the cushions felt like they were stuffed with batting...it's like they went with a less expensive assembly option.   Very disappointing.  \n\nThe worst though was this creepy salesperson who followed us around the entire store at a distance of 12 feet.  It was like he thought we were going to steal a large sectional and rush out the door.  He would occasionally dart into speaking range and blurt out \"that comes in other colors\" in some rather unintelligible foreign accent.  Very passive-aggressive and he must have had Asperger's as he didn't take the rather forward request that \"We'd just like to look around on our own for now.\"\n\nIn any case, I can't really recommend this business for your furniture shopping. Go to Leon's at the Roundhouse and ask for Ellen (see my other review).  She took great care of me there.
