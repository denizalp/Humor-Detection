Can you hear this? Yes, it's an angel playing a harp because you're in heaven, AKA French Corner Bakery.\n\nTheir croissants are to die for. Best ever. Ever, ever. Crispy and flakey on the outside, soft and chewy inside. I'm serious here. If you buy their croissants and you don't like them (because you're obviously crazy), please send me a message. I'll give you my address and take them off your hands. I'll eat them all, no problem. Kidding! (maybe)\n\nTheir baguettes are ah-mazing (both white and whole wheat). Their pastries look so pretty that you almost don't want to eat them. I tried tiramisu, opera cake and divine (raspberry mousse). I didn't really like the opera cake but who cares, it's all about the bread and croissants anyway!\n\nNext time I'm there (probably later this week), I'll get some macaroons. They have many flavours to choose from and even though I'm not normally a fan of macaroons, I'm almost positive that I will like them. They just look, oh, so tempting.\n\nFrench Corner Bakery also offers light lunch - soups, salads and sandwiches. We had sandwiches with salad and they were pretty tasty. \n\nAs a side note, please keep in mind that this place is a bit hard to find, as it's located at a small plaza that doesn't really stand out when you drive by. I must have passed by this place so many times and I've never noticed it until someone pointed it out to me. However, even if you don't live in the neighbourhood, you should try to go there some time (or tomorrow). It'll be totally worth it!
