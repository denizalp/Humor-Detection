They have taken care of our dogs for over 7 years. I have had the wellness plan the entire time. It makes me more responsible because they call to schedule the appts. Otherwise I would prob never go, unless it were an emergency. \n\nThe staff, while ever changing, are usually really nice. Speed is not a specialty but I can understand why. It is not like the dog, cats, and rats can tell you whats wrong. \n\nThe Drs are cool. I usually see Dr Jucan. She is nice. I still feel like they are raping my bank account every time by asking to perform things that are not 100% needed. Like \"expressing\" my 75lb labs anal glands. Granted I have no idea what that really does but I know the dog can shit just fine. \n\nI usually deny all charges and pick the ones i feel are needed. Like heart worm pills etc.
