I've tried to get an ipad for a while and could not decide which one to get.  I went to couple apple stores and checked online and still could not make my decision.  I walked into Chandler Apple store and Donnie helped me picked a perfect ipad. He listened to my concern and talk me thru the decision process.  Ask for Donnie if you are as confused and indecisive as I am!
