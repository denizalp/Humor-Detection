Will never go back! Spent a weekend in Vegas with my husband for our anniversary and went here for dinner. I decided to splurge and get the wagyu beef filet and it was horrible! The meat was extremely fatty, not flavorful and definitely not worth the money. To top it off I told our waitress and she brought the manager over. I then told the manager and she said she was so sorry and did absolutely nothing when our bill came. ( Even recommended getting the beignets dessert to us and never even thought to comp it!) I understand its a business and you need to make money but if you want people to come back or not spread negative about your business you need to at least act like you care about the customer. Not to mention this is Vegas, I would expect to get what I pay for!! Let's just say my night was ruined after eating here. I thought an anniversary dinner here would be special and it was so not. We spent way too much money and I didn't even enjoy my meal. \n\n\nI will definitely go to another steakhouse when I go back to Vegas!!
