Very good experience.  As a potential first time customer I called and spoke with Anthony Strope in service.  He was very professional and helpful and although I had intended to call around and get quotes, after just a few minutes on the phone with him, I felt this was the right place to service my Honda.\n\nTurned out to be a good choice.  He did everything he said he would do and more.  Anthony was thorough, knowledgeable, friendly and very professional.  So much so that I'm bringing my car in next week for more work I've been neglecting to do.  Fair pricing and good customer service were delivered to me on my first visit.  I hope they can maintain this standard for future visits.\n\nMy only complaint would be the free car wash was a so\/so job.  But hey what do you want for free?
