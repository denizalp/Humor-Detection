The South Point Hotel, Casino & Spa (?)seems to be a nicer casino than most in its price point. It seems cleaner and the restaurant more friendly and better food too. It has a good feeling. Can't put my finger on why. I do need to investigate this spa though. I haven't tried it!\n\nWe stay up the road at an RV park so South Point is close and we like it better than others nearby-and it's not as crazy as casinos on the main part of the LV Strip. \n\nThe hotel rooms were nice. We stayed once.  The price is not bad and had a coffee maker! It's amazing how providing coffee adds a star. I hope they still do even though soulless casinos do not anymore. LOL! No, I'm serious. Haha. \n\nThe bed was decent with a choice of different pillows so hubs gets the firm and I get the softer one. Plus enough to sit up to read or watch tv. \n\nThe buffet is our fav for the area. They give you wine or a whole bottle with a coupon (we got one from the RV park and when we checked in the hotel). The food is better and more interesting. There are numerous restaurants that are decent besides the buffet. The Cafe has surprisingly good Chinese and comfort food. The Oyster Bar is ok but the gumbo isn't as good as other places so get something else. There is a better than average store with wine and snacks as well as souvenir goodies.\n\nIf you are needing a hotel in Las Vegas, I do recommend the South Point. It's a friendly and nicer casino.
