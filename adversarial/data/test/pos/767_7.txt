Le Red Tiger is a bit off the high street but that just makes it even cooler, doesn't it? It looks quite hip from the outside. Go inside and you'll become a hipster too. Fortunately it doesn't stop there. The service and and the food are just as nice as the restaurant's interior design. I'm not giving it 5 stars mainly because the choice of vegetarian dishes is very limited. We got the Pate de Riz et Taro aux Oeufs and the Tofu on Tomato Sauce, both $8, accompanied by a bowl of white rice for $3. As a starter we shared the Rouleaux de Printemps which we thought would be deep fried spring rolls but they were actually what I know as summer rolls that are wrapped in rice paper. I'm embarrassed =( I thought I knew my rolls. Anyhow - everything was delicious! The ingredients were crispy fresh and the flavors were perfectly put together. I'd come again =)
