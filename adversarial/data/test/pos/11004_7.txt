THE.BEST.TIME.EVER.\n\nUpsides: \n- Huge drinks\n- Huge pools\n- Fun people\n- Water slide!!\n- Hot bartenders\/waitresses\n- Pumpin music\n- \n- GREAT TIME\n\nDownsides: \n- Tight security who are generally just pissed off (can you blame them? They deal with drunk people all day) and we still got stuff stolen.\n- Drinks are EXPENSIVE!\n- Pool gets kinda gross. I even got an ear infection from the water slide)\n\nTips:\n- Drink in your room if you can at least some of the time!\n- Bring NOTHING valuable with you!\n- Don't even bring your phone.. one wrong move and WHOOPS!\n- If you do happen to drown your phone, Mr. Lucky's has rice! Skip Pink Taco. They dont... weirddddd!\n\nHonestly, this was an experience that when I die, I will likely flash back to. It was THAT MUCH FUN! So, just do it!
