My husband and I ordered from mobilewaiters.com last night and were very pleased. Mobile Waiters is a food delivery service where you can order from many different restaurants on line and have it delivered within and hour or less. We ordered Thai food from a local restaurant through Mobile Waiters came within 45 minutes and it was hot and yummy when we ate it. What a great idea and a good selection of different cuisines to  choose from. It is easy to order right on line. Making Friday nights easier after a long week at work.
