I got hosed down with spray tan by BodiBronze the week of my wedding.  I did it as close as possible to the wedding before I had to leave town--about 4 1\/2 days prior.  I told the lady I was doing it for my out of town wedding on that Saturday.  She gently chastised me, saying, \"We really recommend you do it 2 days or less before the wedding.\"  I told her that I wouldn't sue them if my tan faded in the 4 1\/2 days before the wedding, so I sure wasn't going to drive 8 hours to get a spray tan.  Then I said, \"Now, hose me down, woman!\"  Not really.\n\nBodiBronze is a nice place...very professional and spa-like.  They're also very expensive, which is to be expected for airbrush tanning.  I believe a full body \"light\" tan cost me $60 with a tip and a bottle of some sort of moisturizing cleanser that's supposed to help keep your tan's tone even.  Since spray tans only last a week or two, it could definitely bore a hole in your wallet.\n\nAs for the experience?  You get as naked as you want to get.  This is with the understanding, of course, that if you wear a bra or undies, you get a tan line of wherever those undergarments fall.  Since my dress was strapless, I bared the boobies to some poor lady at BodiBronze.  I'm not particularly concerned with nudity, but BOY....there is something about standing there with your arms and legs outstretched (like you're about to do jumping jacks) with a perfect stranger kneeling down and making sure every square inch of bare skin is covered with tanner.  Awwwwk-waaaard.\n\nThe tan was beautiful.  It was even, not bizarrely dark or orange, and lasted about a week.  Word of advice?  If you wake up the week of your wedding to two bats flying around your room and need to get a round of rabies shots and the nurse puts a bandaid on your arm after you get the shot?  Take off the bandaid.  Otherwise, you will be like me and wake up the morning of your wedding, still wearing a bandaid and remember that, oh shit!, you probably have a bandaid-sized pale mark on your arm.  'Cause that will happen.
