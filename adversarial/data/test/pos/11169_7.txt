Drais is by far the best place for afterhours in Vegas.  The ghetto ass shady afterhours we have available to us in San Francisco really makes me appreciate the luxurious afterhours party that Drais provides.  \n\nIt can be kind of tough to get in, and guys will have to pay cover unless they have hookups.  I am grateful of the fact that I know a few of the employees here so I usually never have a problem, but if you're rolling up anywhere between 3am-5am, be prepared for a short wait.\n\nThe best thing about Drais by far is how they have a hip hop room as well as a house room.  This is GENIUS!  One of the things I dislike about afterhours is the house music I am usually forced to endure- and it's not like there are many options when it comes to afterhours.  At Drais I can party to the music I like!  I like to roam around the club to make fun of the house music people dancing when I get bored as well, so that provides for some additional entertainment.  \n\nMuch better than Empire Ballroom- Drais has class and luxury...something that most afterhours spots do not provide.  It makes me feel slightly better about partying until 8am when I know I shouldn't be....hey, at least we're not in some warehouse being served low grade alcohol in plastic cups!  Yes, that is what we're dealing with in SF, people.
