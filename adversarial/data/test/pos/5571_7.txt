I was craving a sandwich but at 10pm most places are closed. They don't have any Embers out in Southern California where we are from, plus they have great reviews, and they are open late, so we decided to order take out from them.\n\nI couldn't honestly say I enjoyed my meal here. It was beyond overpriced by any normal standards for what we got. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem spending extra cash if it means I'm getting quality and flavor, that's not the case here.\n\n$15 for a grilled chicken breast sandwich which advertised mozzarella cheese and pesto aioli on a roasted garlic focaccia bread, spinach, and roasted red peppers. There was a paper thin piece of melted mozzarella - seriously, there wasn't any. Pesto aioli? More like a dot of pesto oil! The sandwich and chicken was extremely dry and flavorless. Only when I actually had a bite of roasted bell pepper, was it an average sandwich. I felt really let down and robbed. \n\n$11 for a mushroom and spinach flatbread. I felt that they really skimped on the toppings since most of my bites were just dry bread pieces. I barely got any bites with truffle oil and once I did get a mushroom and spinach bite in, it was only ok... It wasn't amazing. There wasn't any body or layer of flavor, just salt. \n\n$30 for a meal that I could of gotten at a typical chain like Cheesecake Factory and had a better flavorful experience. \n\nI don't know who decided to slack that day, but it caused a first time customer reconsider ever coming back again.
