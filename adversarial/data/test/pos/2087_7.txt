For a really long time, I didn't know this was a restaurant. I thought it was just an orange ball for fun. When I finally realized it was a orange juice place, I never thought I would go because I hate orange juice. But I just had to try it at least once. It's famous here in Montreal. \n\nI got the poutine and the hot dogs. It's good comfort food. It's very enjoyable to eat here, you can just eat and people watch.\n\nI think it would be more fun to go here if I had a car and my driver's license though. Otherwise, I have to take public transportation and that's definitely not as fun.
