I'm officially giving up on \"Farmer's Markets\" in Las Vegas.\n\nThis was my second attempt of Farmer's Markets last weekend. After experiencing the huge FAIL that was the Summerlin Farmer's Market I thought I would try this one because it was a whole lot closer to my home.\n\nBad, bad, bad, all bad.\n\nStep your game up Las Vegas, like seriously. The Farmer's Markets here are not even close to being up to par.\n\nI said this in my other review as well, stick to Whole Foods\/Trader Joes.
