Came for wed wings night @ $0.25 \/ wing.\nFIFTY wopping flavours to choose from... They are so kind to categorize them under 1) BBQ 2) Hot & 3) worldly hahaha.\n\nWe tried 8 flavors.\nThe dry ones seemed to have powder (maybe along the lines of kernel's popcorn powder) flavor sprinkled on them.  I liked dill pickle the best of the 8 I tried. \n\nThe place itself is slimey... hahah... makes you feel kinda dirty.\nThe waitresses are dressed in their skimpy outfits (yes I know it's a lounge\/bar). \nThere seemed to be a lot of single guys just sitting around staring and ooogling eyeballs all around... slimey...bleck...eyeballing ... bleck.... The guy at the next table was practically h*mping the waittress and flirting with her for a whole hour, and then lo and behold his girlfriend arrives and switches modes and is having a dinner with her holding her hand....  Slime ball.
