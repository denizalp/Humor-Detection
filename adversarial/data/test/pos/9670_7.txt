Me and my boyfriend were bored on a Wednesday afternoon, so we decided to come here since we had been to other Deja Vu clubs before and were always pleased. First, for the afternoon, the cover was 30 dollars apiece. Normally girls, weekdays, or afternoons are cheaper, but not here. Once we got inside the place was empty. Empty. We saw 2 girls dancing on a pole in the corner and went and sat by it but were rudely informed by one of them that that \"pole was closed\" because they were practicing. So we moved to the main stage. Out of the 45 minutes we were there only 2 girls danced on the main stage and no one approached us for a lap dance. Then, what little enjoyment we were getting was disrupted as a whole construction crew started constructing new booths right by us. Now since we weren't in the mood to stare at an empty stage to the sound of nail guns, we left and will not go back.
