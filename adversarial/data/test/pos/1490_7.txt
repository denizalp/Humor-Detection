I would give this place a big fat ZERO for taste and customer service. \n\nI ordered a $350 baby shower cake here for my shower. I emailed them and arranged a meeting with the owner, a woman named Genevieve I believe. Instead, one of her bakers met with me and instead of talking to me about design and cake flavors, she basically did nothing while my best friend and I tried to explain what I wanted. We were both heavily pregnant at the time, my bestie with twins, and we had been told we've be able to try samples, etc., and none of this happened. The baker was not helpful in the design.\n\nWe bought a few cupcakes to munch on (actually we bought one of almost every flavor) and at first bite, we were making YUCK faces. They were dry and the icing was horrendous. It tasted like someone had smeared butter into a huge blob. It needed more taste, more sugar. The flavors had real potential but the cupcakes should have been an indication of what my cake would end up being.\n\nThis place was so disappointing. Even now, a year later, my stomach twists up in distaste thinking of my terrible experience with this place. Since I'd received no help from her associate's in the design, I emailed Genevieve frequently trying to work it out. In every single email, she was rude and curt, acting as if I was a pain the a**. It was my first baby, my first shower, my first big custom cake and I wanted it to be special. If I was a pain in the ass then that's what happens when you're 7 months pregnant and feeling like a gross whale!\n\nMoving on... the week of my shower, having heard NOTHING from them, I called and inquired about pick up or delivery. I was informed I'd be charged $50 on a $350 order to deliver from... get this... Liberty Village to the Old Mil. $50 for what, 10 minutes? I thought that was appalling. We picked it up instead. \n\nThe cake looked great. Everyone oo'ed and ahh'ed. Until they bit into it and faces of women at my shower did the whole \"fake yummy\" thing. It was gross. It was dry. It was bland... and worst of all, my two tiered cake had TWO WRONG FLAVORS!! Worst of all, one of the flavors was banana cake with vanilla buttercream icing and it was VILE. My cake didn't get eaten more than a few bites of each plate. \n\nAnd to make matters WORSE, when I emailed Genevieve about her massive mistake, she literally said \"glad you're guests liked it\". Um... my guests did NOT like it, I was very upset since it was a big deal to me, and I paid $350 for this piece of shiz! The decent thing to do, Genevieve, would be to offer at least a partial refund. What did Genevieve do? She offered me a coupon for six MINI cupcakes. Worth $20.\n\nNot only will I never EVER go back to this crappy business, I have been telling everyone about my experience and making sure no friend of mine ever makes the same mistake. This woman basically ripped me off for $350 for a cake for 25 people and it didn't even taste good. NEVER GO HERE. Certainly don't let her do your custom cake. Yes, I'm still upset over it all.
