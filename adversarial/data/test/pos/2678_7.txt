Soma-ch goodness to say about this place, and I'm not even a chocolate fiend. You know those girls who make orgasm sounds when they bite into candy bars, and ooh and aah when someone brings brownies to a pot luck? Yeah, those weirdos. I'm not one of them. \n\nI came to Soma to put together a last minute goody basket for an office full of swell, furry people. The staff were fast, efficient and did it with me on the spot. I clearly had very little chocolate knowledge or preferences, so they put together a sampling of diverse treats for my pals with very little guidance. I gave them a dollar amount and they went to town. It ended up being one of the best gift baskets I've ever given. Kudos. \n\nWhile I waited I had one of their mochas. It was a sublime warm beverage experience, so much so that it made me one of those chocolate-cooing freaks. I will certainly be back. \n\nPEPPER POINTS for all the things they do with chocolate. Blue cheese? Pop rocks? Who knew!
