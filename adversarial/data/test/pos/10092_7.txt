It's very bright inside. Really hurts my eyes. It's fairly new, but it looks like an old-school drug store complete with \"crappy toy aisle\" that my daughter MUST see. They're not really doing much to spiff things up for the new millennium that happened all of 12 years ago.\n\nAnyway, this location has a drive-through which is super-convenient. The pharmacy employees here are usually nice. I've had two run-ins with some not-so-friendlys. The pharmacy manager is great. He listened to my concerns and vowed to speak with his staff--time will tell.\n\nAlso, Walgreens now has a points program similar to CVS so my reasons for going to CVS keep diminishing. I still think CVS employees are a little nicer and more helpful on average.
