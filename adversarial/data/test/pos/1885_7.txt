This place is a train wreck in a refrigerator. Its very cold (which is to be expected) but also extremely dilapidated. The ceiling is falling in, its old and worn, and worst of all, there is NO ONE to control the children.  The children (which are more like teenagers) are running a muck, creating cracks in the ice and throwing it at other people. \n\nI don't like the ice throwing, and I don't like cold ceilings falling in. When asked if you should go to Arcadia say, \"No!\"
