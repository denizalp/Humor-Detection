No thanks...they are toooooo pricey for me...Charging two months at a time and I can never get ahead.Several times was cut off..My last month they told me to pay $425-which I did in two payments last month.Two weeks later I get another bill for $317?????EXcuse me...More than $200 each month for phone,cable(basic)and internet is stupid..
