Chalk this up to an experience more than anything.  From being lead to our table through a room so pitch black that I couldn't see a hand in front of my face to figuring out what we were eating was undeniably fun.  No phones, no nothing.  A group at another table likened it to being in the SHU (Orange Is the New Black, anyone?).  But the idea was to heighten one's other senses while sitting through the 6 course plant based meal.  If you're complaining about no meat on the menu, try dealing with a bunch of people holding sharp steak knives in darkness.\n\nAll the servers wore night vision goggles (does anyone else automatically think of Silence of the Lambs too?), which helped tremendously when trying to find a utensil or wine glass.  I admittedly gave up during some courses and went hand to mouth just because it was easier.  Not like any of the patrons could see me eat so rudely :P   \n\nI won't get into the food, since revealing that would ruin a lot, but I was surprised how far off I was in guessing what was eaten.  It wasn't until the end that we were shown the full menu, which did garner some laughs.  All of the items were generally decent.    \n\nThe only real downer was the price tag, which was around $80 per person without drinks.  I mean...these people are making a killing!  They save money on electricity, didn't need an interior designer, could probably get away with mismatched silverware and don't use any fancy ingredients.  \n\nI was lucky enough to get a BOGO, but despite the fun, would rather wear a blindfold (or just take my glasses off?) to an Indian restaurant.  Even with all that, I still look at the evening fondly.  So if you're looking for a unique date night (literally, blind date) or a funny group outing or just want to spoil that special vegetarian in your life, this is still worth considering.
