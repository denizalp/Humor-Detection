Looking for a super cute dessert place to hang out with a group of friends? This is your spot. There is something for everyone here. Desserts like honey toast, crepe cakes, cakes, coffees, lattes, teas, and milk teas. We rolled in 6 people deep and found some good seating in the corner by the brick wall. Furniture is cute and eclectic.\n\nWe ordered 6 different desserts: \n- matcha green tea crepe cake with green tea ice cream. \n- red velvet crepe cake \n- chocolate cake\n- honey toast (2) with various toppings\n- green tea waffle\n\nGet your cameras ready folks, you'll be fighting over the best aerial shot. Picture taking takes like 5+ minutes getting the best angle. Can we eat already? \"I need for my instagram...facebook...snapchat...\" Myself and another elite, \"I need it for Yelp!\"\n\nGoodness gracious, the hype is real. The matcha green tea crepe cake is pretty darn good. I really like the red velvet crepe cake as well. The chocolate cake was very rich and decadent, but a bit much. The waffle was just okay. I prefer Serenade's honey toast. \n\nAfter all that sugar, what better to wash it all down with another sugary drink? Not. My mistake was getting the iced caramel macchiato. I would have much rather been content with the complimentary self serve water. A common complaint at my table was why no mason jars? Our drinks didn't have the cool factor. \n\nWell, I think the duo running the show were just slammed. They are super sweet and friendly!
