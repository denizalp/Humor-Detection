Look at it this way. Less than half the cost of a table at some shitty Britney-Paris-Lindsay-esque club and way better eatin.\n\nI liked the heavily Burgundy-centric wine list and the down-to-earth, enthusiastic sommelier. That's one of the few unexpected highlights of Vegas for me: Service that is geared towards people indulging beyond their usual means (often unwisely), and thus, less uptight, less pretentious, less old money. Some might say too young, too informal, too plebeian, but I dug it.\n\nThe crowd: Evenly split between a wedding party -- an actual post Vegas wedding dinner with bride in gown and all -- and a swinger party, judging from the number of stone cold f-me staredowns we got from the other tables. What is it about this place? Perhaps the erotic signal of 3,000 fresh cut pink roses arranged on the wall in the shape of a giant vagina?\n\nTip: If you ask nicely (i.e. tip) your waiter may pluck you a rose... or two.
