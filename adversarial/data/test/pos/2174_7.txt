Yes, I am a fan of the Monte Carlo.  We stay at the hotel on 12\/10 - 12\/13 and the customer service was outstanding.  The pool outside is excellent and you can order drinks and bring them outside...great palm trees.  \n\nThe Hotel has great location...the heart of everything, across the street is Hard Rock Cafe and great taxi service outside.  Very low price to stay here.\n\nThe rooms were okay nothing special and the spa was odd because if you want to use the gym...you must enter through the spa.  I posted reviews of the spa already.\n\nYour choices to go eat...The Brand (Steak joint), Buffet which was great price for $35 to eat all day wearing a bracelet, Diablo which is a lounge and bar, Sports Bar, Starbucks, Noodle Dragon that cooks dim sum and lots of fast food places like McDonalds, Subway, Panda Express, and a Mexican joint if you want to save money.\n\nThe mall is crappy called Streets of Dreams...go to Caesars Palace Forum Shops or Aria if you want to shop...and the gambling section is small but friendly tables & dealers.  \n\nThe shows was excellent...I had the hookup so we went to watch Music which features the JABBAWOCKEEZ!!!!  We had front row seats and took pics with them which I posted in my pic profile here.\n\nOverall, I enjoy my stay and I hardly stay in my hotel only to take a shower which was excellent because the showerhead pressure was like a massage.
