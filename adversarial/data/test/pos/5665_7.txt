It makes no sense to me that the majority of my foodie friends have not tried 28GO. \n\nMy favorite item is the 28go rice. Perfect combination of rice, sesame oil, aioli, sesame seeds seaweed mix, and green onions.\n\nService is top notch. Servers and staff are so attentive regardless of how busy or slow the restaurant might be. I find that I get the worst serve at most restaurants when it is slow. They are always more than happy to cater to any alterations you may wish on any of the dishes. If you're vegan you can also ask the chef to make you something off the menu. \n\nTheir happy hour is 9-11AM Monday-Thursday; 20% off your entire check!  Prices are low which is great since they cater to students, being located right next to UNLV.\n\nI believe the menu has been changed since the last time I've checked them out. They've added more tapas and ramen options!!
