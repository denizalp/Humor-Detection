My wife took the vacuum to another dealer in Scottsdale and they kept it for the day and told her that nothing was wrong with it and no charge. The loud noise is gone. To think Mulqueen's wanted to charge us $165.00 for NOTHING and they guy was rude to my wife and said he was the only dealer in town that could fix our vacuum. Stay away from this business!
