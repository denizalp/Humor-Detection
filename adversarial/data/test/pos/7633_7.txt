There is no other place on earth like the Las Vegas airport.  Everyone arriving is happy and trying to take everything in like it's their first day out in the real world.  How full of hope they are.  Landing in the Las Vegas airport gives a sense of expansiveness even though the place is dangerously full of people.  Leaving the Las Vegas airport is another story.  People tend to stare at their shoes in shame from whatever event is never to spoken again.  Or people are way too happy because they won fifteen bucks on video slots and scored a free drink.  Winner and loser alike are crammed into winding line where TSA are more handsy than homecoming dates.\n\nWhile waiting at the gate there are more slot and video poker machines incase you have any spare cash you'd love to piss away.  To be honest if it came down to putting money in an airport slot machine or getting an airport quesadilla, the slot machine wins every time.  At lease the slot machine won't give me diarrhea.  \n\nI'm always glad to go to Vegas to meet up with old friends and I'm always happy to leave the neon nightmare.
