This is a lunch review, so please know that I wasn't drinking wine at the time. My review may have come out differently if wine was on board. :) \n\nI thought the place was nice enough. but for some reason I was expecting nicer. The decor was just ...meh..for me. \n\nThe prices seemed unbalanced. We got the 3 cheese plate as an appetizer and it was good, but again I was expecting a little more for $16.00. I ordered the lunch combo; half sandwich and soup for $10.00. The chicken and prosciutto sandwich was a bit dry and sort of lifeless. But the tomato basil soup with goat cheese chunks stirred throughout was amazing. I would go back and just have that soup. \n\nAll in all a nice lunch, but I'm not in a huge rush to go back. Maybe for drinks and an appetizer before dinner (someplace else)? Also., we felt it was a bit odd that everytime our female server (she never divulged her name) came to our table she addressed us as \"Lady and Gentleman.\" At least tell me your name before you call me that for an hour! ;)
