Came here looking for a Odyessy.  Showroom isn't that big.  Service here is meh, not bad but not the best.  When we asked to get a vehicle to test drive, the lady only bought 8.17 liters of gas and wondered why the fuel gauge didn't seem to go up from empty...now I'm no smarty pants but I'm guessing that 8 liters is nothing when your tank is empty, that's why the fuel gauge didn't move much.  But hey, who am I to say?
