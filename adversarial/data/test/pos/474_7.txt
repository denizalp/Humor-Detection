i have been living in the charlotte area for right around two years now and had yet to find someone who would color my hair the way i wanted and would not cut my hair that i want to grow out. \n\nlet me clarify that the color i wanted: little mermaid red-orange. \n\nso one day i find out about this salon and call up kerri and she says she'll do it and you know what? she did. it was simple as that. she just did it, because i asked for it. and she did it quickly and did it again today when my roots were growing out and i trusted her enough to trim the ends and she did just that, trimmed the ends. not cut off like 4 inches, just a half inch. and she didnt try to give me some weirdo hipster haircut either because i didnt ask her to do that so she didnt. do you see where im going here?\n\nask kerri, and you shall receive.
