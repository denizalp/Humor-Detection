I was amazed by the poor customer service that I encountered when I attempted to arrange an appointment for a wedding cake tasting.  I contacted Dessert Trends in August 2011, but was told that I would have to wait until mid-October to have the tasting because they were \"too busy\" to meet with me during wedding season.  So I set up a tentative date in October and we agreed to confirm the appointment a week before-hand.  A week prior to the appointment I had not received the confirmation email.  So I waited for a few more days and contacted them to confirm the date and time.  \n\nThe day before the appointment I was told that everything was arranged for the cake tasting and that I should call Chef Don the following morning.  I was given Chef Don's cell number which I promptly called in the morning.  The phone was off and I left one or two messages, however no one called me back and no one followed up via email to explain what happened.  \n\nNeedless to say, if Chef Don and his staff cannot even keep a simple appointment for a cake testing (and do not return phone calls), I certainly would not trust them with being able to handle baking and delivering my wedding.  It was definitely a very disappointing experience because they had been highly recommended to us.
