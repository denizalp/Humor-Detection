The food was amazing and the presentation was extraordinary. This is what we ordered:\n\nRavioli di ricotta con caciotta Toscana - As the previous reviews have said, it is THE BEST item on the menu\n\nLasagnette con rag√π di crostacei - Delicious! \n\nOrata (Gilthead sea bream) with Palermitana (green olives, pomini tomatoes, capers, white wine) - This fish was $120 which proportionately served 2 people. It was a mildly flavored fish and the texture was coarse-grained. The capers in the \"Salse e condimenti\" complemented the fish perfectly.\n\nBranzino (Sea bass) with Cruda (tomatoes, arugula, garlic, red onion, olive oil, red wine vinegar) - Compared to the Orata, this fish was my favorite! The taste was more subtle and delicate. Not as \"fishy\" as the other fish. The texture was flaky yet very soft and as I like to call it \"melt in your mouth\" good! I highly recommend this fish! The side sauce also enhanced the flavors of the fish without overpowering it.\n\nFor dessert we had the Torta Caprese, Semifreddo di Vaniglia Tahitiana, Baba au rhum. I recommend the first two desserts, the latter...not so much. I literally had a cough attack because of the alcohol in the dessert. I felt like I was taking a shot of alcohol. \n\nWe ordered more appetizers but honestly they were not that special to even mention. Overall the food was amazing.
