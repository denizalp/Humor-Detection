I have membership to LA Boxing where I can attend any LA Boxing I want to.  My membership was grandfathered in when LA Boxing was changed to UFC Gym.  The gym that I usually go to is  the UFC Gym in Anthem because it is closer to home.  However, I recently discovered that Blue Diamond is much closer to my work!\n\nI like Blue Diamond because it is very spacious.  There is a boxing ring, a full octagon, so many heavy bags to choose from.  The weight area is spacious as well.  I can do weights without having to worry that I am in someone's space.\n\nNow onto my favorite trainer...well, I haven't taken other trainers' classes, but head trainer Solomon is so awesome that I didn't want to risk going to another.  I did stay later after one of the 5:15-6:15pm class to observe Olu Sola's class and it looks interesting...one of these days I will take.  But anyways, back to Solomon's classes.  I have taken the MMA plus TRX (MATRX) class and I loved it.  I did knees and elbows combination that I have not yet done before.  The TRX is an amazing apparatus to incorporate in the workout.  I took Trigger Point Boxing class today and we used the grid foam roller.  It intensified the workout and really made members work every single muscle.  Solomon is very knowledgeable and the various full body workout is nonstop, which is awesome because we are losing body fat, more so than other exercise.   During and at the end of class, I was just sweating out toxins.  \n\nI really wish I can make it to the gym for lunch and dinner every day.  Yes, that's how much I enjoy it.  I highly recommend everyone to try out this gym, and if possible, take Solomon's class.\n\nManagement are great as well.  Taylor and Chase are very accommodating and super helpful.
