Whoa! This is a strange place... The drinks flow fast and free here, plus they have $1 Nathan's dogs! Also try the deep-fried Oreos and Twinkies if you dare. The waitresses are very friendly and eager to get you hammered. BTW I will never listen to The Monkey's again after their themed slot machine wiped me out of $40 while incessantly playing their songs.
