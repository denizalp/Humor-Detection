My visit to Little Nicky's Coffee was the result of one of those random unplanned walks I took while I wander aimlessly around downtown core walking to my yoga class. \n\nI know it sounded strange.. I need my espresso beverage fix before my class... I did not know Little Nicky's is located on the side street.. all I saw the banner saying Coffee Shop while walking along Queen Street, and that was my calling! \n\nLove the Retro Vibe of this place.. really laid back compare to other Indie coffee shops I been to..and you kind of have to chill and take it easy... \n\nWhile waiting for my cappuccino to be ready.. I could not take my eyes off those little mini donuts being made!! They kind of like Tiny Tims but they look a lot more delicious!! But you have to order at least half dozen.. and no way I can eat that have a cappuccino and do a headstand in a heated room within 30 minute. It took me all my will power to say \"that's all\" when the barista asked me if I want to have something else with my coffee... \n\nMy willpower is weak.. really weak... I am now have my mind set to come back again to have those mini donuts SOON!! And of course, their cappuccino was awesome too! Lovely Latte Art!
