I am really baffled by all the hate for Carnevino in the reviews. I first came here about 5 years ago when I cam to vacation in Las Vegas and have been back probably 10-15 times since I moved to Las Vegas. I always go when people are in from out of town and want a good steak place so I have been with about 20-30 different people. Never have any of us gotten a bad item, had bad service, or not loved it. I am a unapologetic fine dining snob and until Gordon Ramsay Steak opened this was my favorite steak restaurant in Vegas- and for the steak itself it is probably slightly better than GRK (GRK has better non steak dishes and desserts). I can't wait for someone else to visit so I can try the new beef tasting menu. \n\nThe restaurant comes from Mario Batali (orange crocs) and Joe Bastianich (the mean judge on amster chef). If you have been to any of their other restaurants Carnevino is similar in many regards- formal fine dining atmosphere, similar slowly paced service, the waitstaff likes to talk etc. This isn't for everyone- some people just want to order their food and have it delivered in less than 10 minutes without a lecture on Italian after dinner drinks (Grappa by the way is an acquired taste- I almost gagged the first time I had it but now I love it). If you do go to Carnevino give yourself at least two hours and have a backup liver waiting for transplant. \n\nThe Steaks\nUsually I would start with appetizers but let's be honest- you are here for a giant slab of meat. \n\n Here are the steaks I have had ranked in order\n\n1. Bone in ribeye for two. This is carved tableside. If you like Ruths Chris serve your steak at 1500 degrees sizzling deal you might not like this as it is served more room temperature- and if it is warm at all the heat quickly goes away from the thinly sliced meat. It is very tasty though- the seasoning is very light so its all beef taste.\n2. NY Strip- not usually one of my favorite cuts but I have gotten it a few times for variety and it is better here than elsewhere I have had it.\n3. Bone in Filet- superior to the boneless IMO- has the very soft texture and less beefy taste you expect from a filet. \n\nNow, not always, but most of the time, they have a special steak that is aged longer- if this is available for the love of all that is holy get it. Pay whatever they ask- 100$ a pound, 200$ a pound, your first born- whatever it takes. These steaks taste like nothing you have ever had or likely will have again in the future. They have an almost blue cheese like flavor that is incredible. I have had plenty of expensive food that I would say was not worth it- this is not one of those. \n\nNon steak Items- I have ordered a few of these - pork chop, Osso Buco, and they are great- if you are a local and can come here frequently I highly encourage you to try them. If you are in from out of town though, you probably just want to get a steak or you will return him and find yourself lying awake in bed, filled with regrets.\n\nAppetizers- there are quite a few beef appetizers. You can go two ways with this- some people will find beef on beef on beef to be too much- we call them French. So if you are worried about your blood test results get something else, if you love America here are some suggested Apps (not all of these are beef but are meat)\n\n\n1. Carne Cruda- raw beef good. \n\n2.Prosciutto di Parma and Affettati Misti- picking between these two is slightly harder than Sophie's Choice\n\n3. Beef Cappallacci -this has some really strong goat cheese which is amazing but may knock your socks off. \n\n4. Anolini- lobster pasta- whats not to love
