The Walker Breakfast Ranger sandwich is as much of an abomination as the now defunct television program its name satirizes. A mouthful of processed mush ordered via an anti-social touchscreen, the puck of banality was about as flavorless as Chuck Norris' acting. \n\nOoooh! I have a Chuck Norris joke. \n\nWanna beat Chuck Norris in the octagon?\n\nTrick him into eating a breakfast sandwich at Sheetz beforehand. He'll get so nauseous, he'll forfeit!
