I thought I had figured out how to have a good meal at La Brioche: take out.  I very much enjoy the organic burger and some of the omelets, and, with take out, I had been able to avoid the horrible service.\n\nAlas, no more.  \n\nI called in an order for my usual burger with avocado and swiss, stating I would be right over.  I arrived, paid for it, and waited.  And waited.  I checked, only to find that the person who took my call had indicated that I would pick it up one hour later than I had said.  No apology from the staff involved, barely an apology from another staff member, and certainly no gesture like, \"Please, have a pastry on us.\"\n\nI am done with True Foods.  Madison has a number of other restaurants with better food and much, much better service.\n\nIncidentally, while waiting for my missing order, I discovered how to get good service at True Food: have a relationship with a staff member.  A young women who was apparently attached in some fashion (girlfriend?) to a staff member received lavish attention from that person and other staff.\n\nSo, unless you are related to someone who works at True Food, look elsewhere.
