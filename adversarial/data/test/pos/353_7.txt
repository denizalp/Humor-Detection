Great pre-opening lunch!  The Chef's Special Dry Chili Chicken is spicy.  Not the kind of spicy where you can only eat a bite or two, but the kind of spicy that your nose runs and you want to stop eating but can't!  And, whatever you do, do not sleep on the crispy shrimp with lemon sauce.  F'ing spectacular!!!  There are still a few kinks they're working on, but this place is legit.
