Atmosphere: somewhere between rundown night club and abandoned storefront. Multiple holes in the wall with exposed drywall. There is no air conditioning. No star.\n\nCleanliness: the smell of a rat nest emanates from behind the counter. Every chair is sticky. No star.\n\nFood: ordered a calzone and some wings. The dough was pretty good. Small calzone has half of a medium pizza in size. One star.\n\nService: the cashier\/server\/whatever seemed to hate his job. I wouldn't blame him since the manager\/cook\/whatever was rudely critiquing him while I was ordering. The server was surprised we ate in for lunch; probably because we were the only people there. No star.\n\nPrice: $10 for a salad. $5 for a slice of pizza. Calzone was $7. It's really not priced well for the value. No star.\n\nOverall: do not recommend. This may be the last review I ever write, because I might die from this food.
