I've heard a lot about this restaurant since they have 50 years old history. The place was very decent when I first stepped in. I felt something not right when I sat down. A mid forty Chinese man with poor English was serving  us while a young Chinese lady was serving another table. I'm wondering is that a Chinese restaurant or a western steak house ?! The waitresses didn't have unified uniform. I expected the services and the atmosphere should be similar or better than The Keg, Buca, cafe Boulud, Joso, and etc. since they have 4 and half stars in Yelp. I kept persuading myself that the food must be good even they didn't have professional services. The price is not cheap when I went throw the menu. The tiger shrimp cocktail was $38?!!! My friend and I ordered the scallop, shrimp cocktail and foie gras. And lobster & rib eye for our main dishes. The scallop and foie gras were fine, very normal compared with other restaurants where I went to. I was shock when I tasted the shrimp cocktail. I don't understand why they charged so high for four shrimp and tasted worse than the one I bought from Costco ( maybe I expect too high for this restaurant). Forget about the appetizer. The funny thing was they served my friend black cod instead of lobster. Yea, the \"waiter\" placed the wrong order. My rid eye was tasteless!!!! I didn't expect they could made my steak like Cafe Boulud or Jacob, but please, at least better than the keg !!!! I  was so disappointed!!!!!! Oh and the wine was awful too. The restaurant is not very big. Only two table Canadian, and the rest (5-6) were all Chinese ( Asian ). It's not about the discrimination. It was something not right. I asked the \"waiter\" is the restaurant Chinese own ?? He didn't answer my question but he said oh, we have Chinese chef, and Canadian chef. One last thing was, we asked the bill, the \"waiter\" brought out the machine without cleaning up our table!!!! My half of the steak still on the table !!!!!!!! I really don't wanna waste my room to finish that. At the end I find out, they used to have very good food since they reopened last year winter and owned by a Chinese people. If the quality of the food (everything) is good. I don't care where they from. I don't think they deserve 4.5 star! It just misleading ppl going there !!!!!tt
