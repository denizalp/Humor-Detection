This is a high end boutique that also caters to a celebrity clientele. If you want a rescue dog, go to the shelter. \nWe got both our puppies from Gloria, the owner of Prince & Princess. We found P&P after looking at other places and finally coming to a clean place here we were very happy. Gloria answered a lot of our questions and pointed us in the right direction with advising us to get doggy insurance which has saved us when our oldest ingested pesticide, she also helped us get in touch with Dr. Hines who is the best vet in Vegas. She was available when I had numerous inquiries and always took the time to speak with me. Yes prices are boutique prices but we got a level of care and service for many years after getting our pups that is priceless.\nWe are very happy with our puppies and we love Prince & Princess.
