The food is pretty good but give me a f**king break. Unless at least 3 people are going to share a plate, you should feel guilty for eating here. Guilty for commiting the sin of gluttony, guilty for punishing your body, guilty for the toilets you will destroy later.  There is no reason a single human being should be consuming one portion of any dish here. \n\nIf when you sit around the house, you actually sit around the house, then eat here.\n\nIf you sweat gravy, then eat here.\n\nIf you're so large you have your own area code, then eat here.  \n\nIf you order pigs in a blanket and the waitress bring over a snuggie and wraps you up in it, then eat here. \n\nPerfect for fat asses and people who desire to develop or augment health problems. Eat away fatty!!
