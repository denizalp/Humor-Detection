When we walked in, I thought I was in heaven.  The place is not only dog-friendly, but they have beautiful, fun dog shaped decor.\n\nI ordered the basic burger with no onion, tomatoes or mustard, only lettuce and ketchup.  I also ordered onion rings in place of fries.  My burger came with onions, tomatoes and mustard - no lettuce or ketchup - with fries on the side.  I told the waiter and he apologized and promised to fix the error.  My second burger came with nothing but the patty and mustard - no lettuce or ketchup.  By this time, they had brought my onion rings so I could eat something during the burger catastrophe.  The third burger attempt produced just a patty - no lettuce or ketchup.  I asked the waiter to get those items for me and he brought those on the side.  He apologized and murmured something about the new burger process, blah, blah, blah.\n\nMy husband ordered the mac and cheese with shrimp which he enjoyed.\n\nI figured the restaurant would comp our drinks or my burger, but nada.\n\nI was extremely disappointed.
