First off I would like to say that I have absolutely no experience in Bulgarian cuisine. However, everything I tasted here was good so five stars haha.\nA Bulgarian friend of mine actually took us here for dinner. It was crowded and seemed like a regulars type of place. The waitress was very nice and took the time to explain the menu to us. My friend actually ended up ordering for us so I just went with it.\n\nHere's a list of what we got:\n\n-Fried cheese: Okay so you're probably thinking 'what the heck? fried cheese?!' yes fried cheese. Not sure what type of cheese they used but it was very light and not overly ooey gooey like a mozzarella stick. This dish grew on me.\n\n- Lamb soup & cucumber soup: If you're going to opt for a soup, I would go with the cucumber soup. It's a cold soup so it was very light and refreshing. Had bits of cucumber, yogurt?, and some herbs. No clue what herbs but it tasted good. \n\n- Bulgarian sausage: Excellent also. No idea what spices were in the sausage but it was very savory and paired well with the potato wedges.\n\nVery vague review but all I can say is that this place serves up great food, good service, all at a great price.
