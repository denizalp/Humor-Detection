What does it take for me to get off my \"stuck on 600\" silliness? How about a good old fashioned FTR. OK so it's Fresh & Easy, but whatever.\n\nI dropped by thanks to a $5 coupon they sent me for their grand opening. The store is clean, like you would expect for a new location. It kind of smelled like brand new furniture when I walked in. Also, I appreciate the two hybrid car parking spots right next to the new mom spots right out front. How bougie (I blame Regina P and Earl C for compelling me to use that term in a review).\n\nOther than that, it looks almost exactly like any other Fresh & Easy I've ever been to. It's really not all that convenient from my house, so I won't be frequenting. If you live in Southern Highlands, however, consider yourself lucky to have a shiny new store in your hood.
