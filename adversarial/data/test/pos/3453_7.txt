Thank you lord for answering our prayers. Finally, good Indian food, That too 5 min from my work...\n\nHumor aside, this is the best South Indian food I have had outside my own home cooked food. This, coming from a picky South Indian. I tried the buffet twice in a week, the was nothing in the selection that was sub par. I loved every vegetarian dish. My wife mentioned that the chicken was good too. \n\nThe place serves all the authentic South Indian flavors that I grew up with, which is my staple. The menu boasts a big selection of South Indian, Tandoori, Indo-Chinese. The ambiance was great and they have spent a lot on the decor. Price is a bit on the high side which is the norm in Phoenix for Indian food. \n\nI would strongly recommend this place to anyone.\n\nYelp states they are closed during the day... Not true they are open for lunch and dinner.
