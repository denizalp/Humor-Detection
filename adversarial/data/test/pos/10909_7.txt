After seeing a long line for Distillery (on a Tuesday), we decided to check out Edgars. It was a very busy little bar on Mont Royal with great music and $3 mixed drinks!  The bar has something for everyone with lots of great quiet small tables near the front window and a lot of booths\/bar stools by the dance floor. Great atmosphere with a fairly young professional-type crowd. \n\nPS What do I remember most about this bar?  SO MUCH PLAID. I never figured out why, but if you have a plaid shirt (or hoodie) and like to party in the Plateau, this bar is for you.
