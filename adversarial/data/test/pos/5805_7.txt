sub sandwich joint in a great location.  very limited seating, maybe about 7 in total.  try to look past the msn-messenger-username-esque name, because the food here is really damn good.  the chef is from philly, so i would like to think that he knows his sandwiches.  also they call their sandwiches \"jawns\", and it doesn't get more philly than that.  very extensive and impressive menu, which i had an extremely difficult time choosing from.  yes, that is a good thing.  prices are close to $10.\n\ni got the south philly sandwich, which had a LOT going on.  cheese and steak, as per the classic sandwich recipe, but with kale, hot peppers, garlic aioli, and hot sauce.  probably not the most authentic cheesesteak, but i don't care because it was delicious.  the meat had little to no seasoning, which some people may not like, but i can definitely appreciate that since it lets all the other flavours shine.  the garlic aioli might have been the x-factor in this sandwich - it really elevated it to some sort of next level.  the kale added good texture and, most importantly, vitamins.  hey look mom, i'm eating healthy now!
