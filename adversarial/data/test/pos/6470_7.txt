I've been coming here for quite some time, I'm Japanese and knew from the beginning that this fish wasn't the best quality  but love supporting small businesses. Was a regular. But the chef CHOI (the Korean), was an absolute *excuse my language* prick. He refused to let me order certain food, told my friend he could have whatever he wants but I couldn't. He was terrible and I'd be embarrassed to have him in my business. He yells at the waitresses and embarrasses them too. He ruined my experience 100%. Mind you, I've been going here for quite some time!! \nHe's terrible. He skims your fish he will always do more rice than fish for all you can eat, to save more money in his pockets. You'll get full on rice before you eat any different varieties of sushi. \nThis whole place is ran by unprofessional people. The owner (a Chinese man) with the sharpest tongue. Talks badly about the customers, but is a great chef so there is that. \nThis place is a joke. If you order anything, get to go! \nDo not dine in. This place is rude, they'll try to scam any way they can. They are money hungry and do not care about service. Take your hard earned money else where  you deserve  to. \n\n**UPDATE**  (yesterday when we went,  we did not tip. It was only myself and one other person, turns out this place not only Shit talks you, but steals your money!!! They added a $20 tip to our already $50 tab. \nThis place is BULLSHIT. SUSHI WOW IS AWFUL.)
