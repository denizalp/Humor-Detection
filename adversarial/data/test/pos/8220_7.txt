I have purchased a part online and picked it up and that was an OK experience.  But this \"FREE PARTS\"  Saturdays is a TOTAL SCAM.  Not only do you have to pay $50 to enter the yard..AN ENTRANCE FEE.. I use the term yard mighty loosely... really a disaster zone...and see if they even have the vehicle you are looking for plus then you need to remove the part yourself... providing you can even get to the part if the car is 7 feet in the air.  So what happens if you don't find your vehicle or part... THEY KEEP  YOUR $50 and give you a store credit...  They do not inventory their vehicles... how hard can this be really?? !!  I am not even sure that you can use this store credit to come back another Saturday to troll around again.  \nIf you want to waste a perfectly nice Saturday morning trolling around a crap hole and cough up $50 for it then this is the place for you.   What some people do is come on the Friday.... pay NOTHING to get in...  Remove the part they need and then hide it somewhere... easy enough... then come back on Saturday and pick it up..   IF and ONLY IF you are savvy is the  'FREE PARTS\"  day a bargain... It is completely buyer beware for these scams.   I would guestimate that at  least 200 people cough up their $50 to buy a part ... so they are clearing 10 grand in ENTRANCE FEES... \nBUYER BEWARE IS ALL I CAN SUGGEST...
