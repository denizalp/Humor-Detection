Decent place to watch football games.  They have plenty of big screens and even arm chairs and a seating area to feel like you are at a friends house. I did not understand why they were blasting music during playoff football but maybe I walked in during halftime and they quickly shut off the music when I asked.  The bar has plenty of gaming machines but what I liked is they had a part of the bar with no gaming.  I hate when a place kicks you off a seat at the bar because you are not playing and want to save it for that ONE LOSER that thinks he is gonna hit it big.  \n\nDuring football games they have some food specials that are not on the menu.  Price points and servings vary depending on how many people you have in your group but they start at $8 and up.  I went for the Beef Sliders and Tater Tot Nachos.  The sliders were filling and a decent snacking size.  The bun was fresh and of good quality.  I thought the Tater Tot dish was an amazing idea and it was surprisingly good in my opinion.  Great little bar food dish.  \n\nDraft beer choices were not great and seemed to be favored towards the Anheuser Busch family of beers. I had a Sierra Nevada and to be honest it did not taste that great, maybe they needed a line flush or its not a beer served often.  \n\nService was OK and no real issues.  Friendliness and a willingness to be outgoing can go a long way on a bartenders pocket book.  I did not see either of these attributes being displayed during my visit.  However I can be an Asshole at times.
