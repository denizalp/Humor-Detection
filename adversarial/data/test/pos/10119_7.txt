This was the best meal I have EVER had.\n\nBF & I had dinner here to celebrate our 4 year anniversary. We were seated at a huge booth, very comfortable, very beautiful atmosphere.\n\nAs soon as we were seated, we were greeted by our amazing waitress, who wished us a happy anniversary. She went over the menu in detail with us, and pointed out things she recommended.\n\nI started with a Peach Passion Martini (and followed it with two more!) which was recommended by the waitress. Absolutely delicious.\n\nFor dinner we ordered the Lobster Bisque, Grilled Kobe Skirt Steak, OrganicSalmon, and Broccolini.\n\nWhile we waited for the food we enjoyed the scrumptious little fresh baked dinner rolls. We were constantly being checked on to make sure we had enough drinks and that everything was going well. It was nice relaxing in the comfy booth with my man, listening to the Blues music they were playing and taking in the awesome decor.\n\nMy Lobster Bisque was out first. It was a generous portion of creamy, lobstery, tarragony soup with lots of massive chunks of lobster meat. We shared the soup, but didn't finish it because we wanted to make sure we had room for dinner. This bowl of bisque was large enough to fill one person up.\n\nAfter the soup, our entrees arrived. My Grilled Kobe Skirt Steak was out of this world. I have honestly never had something this good before. The meat was so tender it literally melted in my mouth. It was cooked in butter and it was just... succulent. I mean really, there are no words to properly describe this steak. The portion was huge too, we took half of it to go.\n\nBF's salmon. Okay, I don't like salmon, I think it's too fishy. But, they cooked his salmon to medium and I love salmon now! Who knew? We also took half of that home.\n\nThe broccolini was sauteed with garlic and red pepper and it was the perfect side to compliment both of our meals.\n\nThe reason why I didn't overdo it and eat all of my food, was I wanted to try the Cinnamon Monkey Bread. I had read about it on Yelp, and I just had to save room for it. The waitress came over and gave us the dessert menu, and she mentioned that we should try the Monkey Bread. We informed her that we already knew wanted that, so she went and placed the order.\n\nWhile waiting for the Monkey Bread, an employee came over with our to-go bag and apologized profusely, stating that while transferring BF's salmon to the box, it fell on the floor. We said it was fine, we didn't need it. The man told us they were cooking a whole new piece of salmon for us. Again, we told him it was fine, but he insisted, and we got a whole new piece of fish. Nice!\n\nThe Cinnamon Monkey Bread arrived. It was served with banana toffee ice cream, and they had written \"Happy Anniversary\" on our plate in chocolate. Very nice.\n\nThe Monkey Bread was better that I could have even imagined it would be. It was soft, warm, sugary, cinnamony, with lots of chewy caramelized pecans on top. It was dessert perfection. There was not one crumb of that left on the plate when we were done with it. \n\nThis was the absolute perfect meal, not one flaw, not one negative. This was the best meal my boyfriend and I have ever had. It was the perfect place to celebrate our anniversary, and I look forward to dining here again someday.
