After hearing great things about Butcher and the Rye, my friend made a reservation for us a few Friday nights ago.  We had reservations for 5 PM on a Friday night when there was a baseball game.  So while parking was a problem, we got a day of reservation with no issues.  \n\nAs I had sat through meetings at many coffee shops that day, I just couldn't order a drink.  This was a total bummer, but there are plenty of alcoholic options if you are interested in a drink.\n\nTo begin we started with the crispy Pig Wing ($9) and Sunday Gravy ($10).  I loved both appetizers.  The pig wing was surrounded with thai chili sauce, pickled mango salad, peanuts, and cilantro.  The Sunday Gravy was heated tomatoes, lamb neck, olive oil, and ricotta served with grilled bread.  The Sunday Gravy was a significantly larger portion, but I couldn't pick a favorite appetizer if I had to!\n\nFor an entree, I ordered the Dirty Pasta ($16), and my friend ordered the Shepherd's pie ($20).  The Dirty Pasta was SPECTACULAR, and it is strozzapretti tossed in ground duck, sage, brandy, and pecorino Romano.  I would 100% recommend this dish.  It is absolute perfection and beyond words.  The Shepherd's Pie was a bit strange.  The braised beef was wonderful, but it was mostly vegetables and there was no crust.  It wasn't bad, just not what we expected.\n\nI loved the atmosphere of the restaurant as well.  The main level is a bit farm-y, and the second level is very wildlife oriented.  I really liked the atmosphere of the second level, and it would be great for a more intimate evening.  Unfortunately, as others have pointed out, the bathrooms are awkward.  Just awkward.\n\nIt is a rarity that I go anywhere without checking out Yelp before I go so I didn't realize this was the sister restaurant of Meat and Potatoes.  This makes total sense.\n\nI will absoltely come back to Butcher and the Rye.
