This is my very first experience with a rehab facility and I'm glad it was because this place is more like a hospital and it eased me into the harsh reality of what these establishments are typically like. \n \nVery good quality of care received here.  Excellent rehab.  Also, it smells clean when you walk in. The lobby is very nice and has a pretty cool doll house on display. There is a gift shop in the lobby which is ridiculously overpriced.   As you continue down the corridor you pass the vending machines (very important to know where these are located) before coming to the rooms. The nurses and staff were friendly and attentive and it was very clean.
