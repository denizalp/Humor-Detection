I stayed here once many, many years ago when I was younger. Back then, pops was more about getting a cheap rate on the strip than decent accomodations and amenities when bringing the family to  Vegas.\n\nI understand this place is of historical significance to the history of Las Vegas. However, progress is still progress and Tropicana still embodies most of the tacky and gaudy flavor and stylings of mid-century Vegas that most people come to find more horrifying than cutesy.\n\nI'm trying to recall specifics of the room and the resort (I'd say it's been a good decade since) but my inability to remember much at all can possibly be explained by just how unremarkable this place is. I recall staying in one of the Garden rooms, which sits on the ground level with old school sliding glass doors onto outdoor patios that are accessible by ANYBODY.  Talk about a potential safety hazard and a complete lack of privacy.\n\nWell, I'm quite certain that no major renovations have been done since my one and only stay.\n\nTime to go the way of Old Yeller, Troppy.
