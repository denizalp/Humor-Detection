I am not  a huge buffet eater, but I came here due to my babe's dieing desire for a buffet......\n\nWe arrived about 5 and waited 30 minutes to get a table.  The decor is very trendy and cool.\n\nI was very surprised to see the quality and the variety of the entree selections.\n\nEach entree tasted fresh and  the food presentations were wonderful......very \"gourmet\"  for a buffet.\n\nI cannot believe I am saying this but I was very impressed.  The best buffet on the strip......for the $$$$.  I will be back....
