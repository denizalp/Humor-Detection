WORST company ever! Placed my first, oh and definitely LAST order with them. Ordered a week ago. Get an email today, oh, sorry we are out of stock - we'll refund you in a few more business days (so like next week). REALLY? How about you learn the first rule of business - don't sell what you don't have in stock! Chatted and called - basically got the run around. Ugh, so frustrated! Good riddance!
