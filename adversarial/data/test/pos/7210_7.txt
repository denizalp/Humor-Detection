I'm not sure if the hype has died down or I was just lucky, but I didn't experience the long waits that a lot of people reviewed about.  I've been here 2 other times in the past and admit, the place is always busy, but I have never waited more than 10 minutes.  Maybe it's all about timing or maybe I'm just one lucky dude.  Anyways, what's not to love about the Coffee Cup? \n\n5 Stars for Service\n5 Stars for their Chicken Fried Steak\n5 Stars for Portion Size\n5 Stars for Price\n\nTo me, a place like The Coffee Cup is what I prefer for breakfast. I love these small, family owned breakfast restaurants.  Service has always been top notch, but it's all about the food, right?  I've only been here a total of 3 times and in all 3 times, I've only tried their Chicken Fried Steak.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it. That's my motto and when it comes to breakfast, this motto is applied. No sense telling you how good their Chicken Fried Steak is.  If that's all I get, then it must be good.  \n\nThe Coffee Cup the perfect stop for breakfast, if you're in the area, or heading to and from the Hoover Dam.  I recommend, but you been warned...their Chicken Fried Steak is addicting. \n\nPS:  Some of the best extra-crispy hash browns too.
