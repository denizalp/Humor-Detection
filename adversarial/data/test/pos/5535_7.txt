I got lucky and was able to grab myself a sundae before the line hit this afternoon. A few months back, I was super excited to see that Uncle Testu opened a matcha cafe, but was subsequently disappointed with their products. I was hoping that Tsujiri wouldn't disappoint and well, there's potential.\n\nNot a surprise but there is usually a line. The line was massive when I dropped by on Sunday so I just moved on and went somewhere else. I'm not docking any points for having to wait in line though - it really doesn't make any sense to. No one forced you to stand in line, and you yourself chose to wait 1.5 hours for matcha ice cream - what could you possibly be expecting? You're not going to have some intense orgasmic experience from even the best matcha in the world. Let's be real here, you're only standing in line so that you can be one of the first to tell your friends about how Tsujiri is not worth the wait. It's actually kind of funny to read these reviewers complaining about the line when they themselves are contributing to the ridiculous line, you're part of the very problem you're complaining about.\n\nAnyway, now that my rant is over I'll detail what my issues were. I ordered the Shiratama sundae but the cashier punched in the Tsujiri sundae - no big deal, I didn't really care either way. The cashier could have been a little apologetic about messing up my order, but I suppose there is the possibility that I might've said the wrong thing? Meh, not a big issue.\n\nThe green tea soft serve is 10x better here than from the Uncle Testu Matcha Cafe. I was pretty happy with the ice cream, until I got to the bottom. There is too much genmai (brown rice) at the bottom which just overpowers the rest of the flavours. It's also a bit too crunchy for my liking. The red bean was also too sweet that my throat felt a little sore. I would advise against their sundae and just opt for just their soft serve. I can't comment on their drinks, shaved ice, or their pastries because I didn't order them but they looked good so I'll have to try them next time and perhaps update my review.\n\nThe service is also somewhat slow. Even though there were only a few people waiting for their orders, it took them about 10 minutes to make my sundae. It's just a sundae, nothing needs to be cooked, I'm not sure why they need so much time to make it. I suppose you could make the argument that the slow service contributes to the ridiculous congestion, and so the crazy line is partly their fault (but mostly just because of the hype).\n\nI liked the clean design of the cafe but was not a fan of the inefficient use of space. I don't think the counters by the front and the side should be used as displays, they should be used as standing tables to increase the amount of space for people to eat indoors. There are only 3 tables and a tatami room which would fit about 8 people, but if they just converted the display tables to actual standing tables you really could double the capacity. The tatami room is a nice touch, but I would've preferred to change that to regular tables to increase the number of seats. Maybe the shop didn't expect to get this many customers. It's also odd that they didn't have garbage cans... I had to give my garbage to the workers who were preparing the desserts. That part seemed particularly odd to me because they seem like a place that really values cleanliness (the workers who prepare the food even wear clear masks) yet they touch other people's garbage while preparing the food? Odd.\n\nThe place is cash only for now (I'm sure it won't be in a few weeks) so make sure you have cash on you. It says so right at the door and even the workers make announcements from time to time yet people still attempt to use their card to pay when they get to the register! I don't even feel bad for you by that point.\n\nOverall, there is potential with this place and perhaps their sundae was just not to my liking. I love matcha so I'm not going to give up just yet, stay tuned for an update in the future when I happen to pass by here when it's relatively empty.
