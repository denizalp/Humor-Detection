I really like the food and the service and the prices are fair.  My only complaint would be that the owner sits idly on his ass chatting with his friends at the front of the dining room and loudly belittles the waitresses (who by the way are busting their butts and doing a fine job) right out in the open in the dining room.  His behavior is very off-putting. What a do-nothing jerk! I'm torn on stars to give so let me just say I'd like to give the place a 4 and the owner a big old ugly zero like him.
