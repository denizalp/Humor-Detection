I've been to many Gabby's in my lifetime. I've also been to this location before. Generally it is what you might expect for a chain pub: average. Not bad average; it's generally good but they serve hamburgers and nachos so what are you really expecting?\n\nWell a group of us was there recently for weekend brunch and it was absolutely horrid. Every single dish was cold. Every single dish got sent back. This is bacon and eggs we're talking about here, this isn't gastronomy at its finest. The whole ordeal took forever and we all agreed we will not be returning.\n\nDundas in the Junction continues to grow and Gabby's is not the only or best option. If you're going to be an average chain restaurant, I think your quality margins are much thinner than the competition. Gabby's just can't afford to be bad because there are so many better options available.\n\nIf you're looking for pub-type food, support our local community and take your business to Axis. They have better food and better service.
