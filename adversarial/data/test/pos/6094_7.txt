Edison's has stools.\nMy dog likes to sit on stools.\nMy dog likes to sit on stools at Edison's.\n\nThis is going to be a dog-centric review.  There are plenty of good things to say about Edison's but I'm sure they've been hit on already.  Anyway...Edison's is like Vegas for dogs.  Not only are they welcome, but there's an awesome patio, friendly petting people, and so many little pieces of popcorn on the floor to eat!  How much fun is that?!  \n\nThere aren't a ton of dog-friendly pubs, where I can bring my pub-friendly dog, but Edison's is my favorite.  They discourage pets on busy weekend nights for their own safety, but generally you'll find a Chihuahua, a bulldog, a Boston, or maybe even my dog there.  \n\n5 stars for letting Zukey eat as much popcorn as he possibly can.  Plus, there are enough dog people there that he usually ends up with a \"cookie\" from someone too.
