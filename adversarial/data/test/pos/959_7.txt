Superb! \nAnd a shocker to some degree. (more on that in a bit)\n\nCan't argue with the reviews already given.\nI don't know what region the food is of origin, but Spicy is it's foundation.\nAnd it's tasty!!\n\nA Saturday lunch.\n3 tables active. Two other couples, and one big family. I was not the only tourist looking patron. But I was outnumbered. And thats GOOD!\nMaybe 15 total tables in the place available. Nice size in my opinion.\nGood clean room too.\nYes, new owners. \"wun yeer now thank yoo\" (no offense intended)\n\nSpicy & Sour Noodle Soup, $5.95 (like spaghetti w\/ chili broth, and herbs)\nWontons tossed in chili sauce, $5.95 (YUM, nice garlic hints)\nSliced Chicken w\/ Szechwan Sauce, $8.95 (YUM YUM, spicy smoke flavor  trails off w\/ a sweetness, YUM)\nYes the rice is done w\/ perfection as a goal. Details, all in the details.\n\nThe \"shocker\"........\nThis menu is as authentic as I've ever seen. \nReminds me of times in San Francisco's Chinatown when I might have ordered off a menu to be refused by the wait staff  \"No no no no, shaking their head\". You see, I'm a big tall Gringo looking dude......they were just protecting me is my guess. Saving my fragile \"naive\" palate.\n\nYun Nan Garden offers what I think you can't get many places in SF anymore. At least spelled out on the menu, here they are.\nChongqing Spicy Frog.\nBlackened Pepper w\/ Eel.\nThree Flavors (Squid, Fish, Black Sea Cucumber)\nChickens Intestine w\/ pepper sauce.\nAnd the afore mentioned Pigs Ear.\n\nDon't be afraid though. You will just be missing out on some tasty meals.\n\nI like the location, easy in, and easy out. Great parking!!\nJust below Spring Mountain, 3rd driveway on the right off Valley View.\nYun Nan will be on your right, far corner of the first building. (mid lot)\n\n7 days a week, 11am - 10pm.\n\nAnd they have 2 additional locations:\nMonterey Park, CA. 301 N. Garfield Ave.\nHacienda Heights, CA. 1229 S. Hacienda Blvd.\n\nEnjoy!!
