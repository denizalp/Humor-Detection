NOT WORTH IT!!  STAY AWAY!!!\n\nI am a BIG fan of Mexican food.  El Segundo Sol is as generic as you are going to get when it comes to Mexican food.  Beyond watered down.  Most generic Mexican restaurants still get it right with somewhat decent food.  But almost everything was lousy...I will start with the food..\n\nIn what seems like an effort to be authentic of gimmicky, they bring out this bottle of water that caps off.  It looks like something they might pour your water with in a restaurant in Mexico maybe?  So it gets poured into these tiny little glasses.  The water is warm and is clearly tap water.  I'm perfectly fine with tap water at restaurants. Next time, just fill a glass up with ice and turn on the sink.  At least it will be cold, which usually helps to mask the tap flavor.  Get rid of this lame gimmick.\n\nWe got the bottomless chips and salsa.  Chips were kind of oily and super thick.  The salsas were just OK.  It all just tasted old.  \n\nThe three of us each ordered an entree.  The chicken enchiladas were dry and kind of flavorless.  They come with a side of rice and beans.  The rice tasted like the instant kind.  The fish tacos were terrible.  It all comes separate and you make your own.  The red, creamy sauce was pretty good.  But the mahi mahi was grilled so strangely in this big lump that didn't pull apart well.  It just had the flavor of burnt as well.  It's sad when I had to douse it with Tapatio to make it edible.  My girlfriend got the chicken quesadila, which actually was not bad.  But you deserve negative points if you can't make a quesadilla.  \n\nThe service was strange.  First, we had this unfriendly girl who was with us up until she took our order.  Then this creepy guy became our server, even though we kind of just thought he was a busboy until we realized the girl wasn't coming back.  He was attentive, but wayyyyy overboard.  It was like, what does he want now..\n\nOverall, this place sucks and I will never go back.  Maybe if the prices were half of what they were (well no, not then either).  But 17.99 for those nasty fish tacos and 15 for the enchiladas was ridiculous..  \n\nIf you want good Mexican food at the Fashion Show Mall, visit TacoMaker in the food court.  Their Daily Special is $5.99 and it is delicious.  Enchilada style burrito, small portion of nachos, and a crunchy taco.  Mmmmm.  I wish we had gone there instead.. :(
