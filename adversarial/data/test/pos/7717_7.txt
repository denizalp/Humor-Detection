Before you come here you the first thing you need to know is that their hours are 12 pm to 8 pm Monday through Saturday. Closed Sundays. On the business listing it says they open at 11 am. Well imagine my dismay when I showed up at 11 only to say a couple of curse words and leave hungry to look for another place to hit up for lunch. Sucks when you have your mind made up for a cheese steak. Fyi I ended up going to Full House Barbeque (A Filipino restaurant) just down the street.\n\nSo this next time I show up exactly at 12 to check this bookmark off.\n\nI get the foot long Cheese Steak ($8.99) with the Cheese Whiz\/Provolone mix along with grilled onions standard. You can add Bell Peppers ($1.25), Mushrooms ($1.00), Pepperoni ($1.00), Extra Meat ($3.50),and Hot Cherry Peppers (50 cents).\n\nThe sandwich was ok but if you wanted to add everything that I mentioned, you would be looking at a sandwich that is over 16 dollars! Even if you didn't get the extra meat you're still looking at about 14 bucks. SAY WHAAAAAAAAAAT!?!?!?!\n\nService was great. The overall ambience of the place was just ok with several tables and chairs. There are Philly paraphernalia on the walls.\n\nOverall, I thought it was just an ok experience. Nothing really impressed me but at the same time nothing really disappointed either.\n\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #144 \"What's the dilly with the 16 dollar Philly?\"
