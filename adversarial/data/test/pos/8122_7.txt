As stupid as this may sound, I went back to this place the following day for breakfast after a mediocre dinner.  \n\nI have to say that this location will not substitute anything.  They do not want to be bothered with any variations in their menu. \n\nI ordered the egg white scramble with crispy fries.  Unfortunately, the fries were not crispy.  The bacon was very average and did not taste like the applewood smoked bacon they claimed it was.  \n\nI ordered a banana but French toast. It was actually a slice of banana nut bread topped with some fruit and whipped cream (about $15).  I tried a few bites and pushed it aside. On a good note, they do serve Peet's Coffee and it was delicious. \n\nThis place could be so much better, but they really don't care, IMHO.  I wanted to try it for myself and now I have. Too many other places to spend your dollars without all the heartache and grief.
