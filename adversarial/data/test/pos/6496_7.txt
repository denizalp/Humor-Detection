I'm torn between the quality product and the poor service and WiFi.  \n\nThe coffee is exceptional but the entry fee (getting past the flaming hoops of attitude) to get your coffee is a little high.  Now I guess I'm one of the cool kids at times (working for the man - Buring Man), but unless that comes up in conversation, most often I'm not dressed the part in my business casual and just another target for the staff.\n\nBeyond the slow service and attitude, the WiFi is crap.  They are riding a signal from a neighbor companies (Wet Paint) router.  I wish they'd get their own router and Cox connection!  Hell I'd even set it up for them, and when I suggested putting a WiFi tip jar the customers at the bar were all for it!\n\nI like the location and the product but not the service and WiFi - both things that can be fixed.
