I actually found this guy on Yelp.  I purchased some sandals last fall on sale, and unfortunately, I needed some extra holes punched in to them because they were hurting my feet.  I had tried to exchange them at the store, but because it had been so long, I was unable to do so.  I was encouraged by the store to find a local shoe store to just get holes punched into the straps to accomidate my situatation.\n\nSo, I find this guy on Yelp.  I called in advance to see if he would be able to help me.  He said he could, and that he was open until 3.  So, I race over there, and he punched the holes in my sandals while I waited!  wooohoo! I was so grateful!\n\nHe charged me 50 cents a whole, times 4 holes for a whole $2!  This is great! \n\nThe store itself is small, but organized and rather clean.  They sell all kinds of shoe stuff, and do all kinds of repairs not only just to shoes, but luggage, zippers, etc.  He says he's been in business for 16 years now, and to keep coming back.  Good experience for something so simple and mondane.
