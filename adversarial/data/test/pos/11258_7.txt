Eclectic mix of Greek, Italian, and American specialties. The spot of a joyous evening celebrating the hub's grandparent's 60th anniversary. 60 is a real accomplishment and can you believe they still act like newlyweds? ;-D\n\nCost to worth it ratio: 3.5 (many main items under $10 and portions are generous)\n\nHighlights:\n- Variety: something for everyone from Greek classics like lamb and soulvalki to Italian pasta and pizza items, to steak, seafood, and sandwiches.\n- Portions: many items could make it through 2 whole meals. \n- Moussaka: like a Greek shepherds pie with ground meat on the bottom and mashed potatoes up top. Meat was seasoned nicely with the traditional savory yet added cinnamon spice but the silky potatoes mixed with bechamel sauce were divine. Eggplant slices were embedded as a layer and marinara sauce circled the plate.\n- Eggplant dip: I'm not even trying to spell the name of it, but think it starts with an m. Large boat dish filled with processed eggplant slightly chilled and mixed with dill. Very refreshing and on top of warm pita triangles, a perfect start to a meal. Only suggestion here is that they bring the out with more pita pieces, as the default amount only could assist you in consuming a fourth of the dip even if you were a liberal topper.  \n- Good for groups: they have several rooms to accommodate large groups and were very helpful and friendly with our boisterous crowd of 50.\n- Dessert carousel: fun to gawk over the various items and plan for later. Continuing on the Italian Greek theme, tiramisu is in that mix and they also have a tray if baklava to the side if it.\n- Wine: house options aren't bad and you can get them by the glass or carafe. \n\nLowlights (my flip side to highlights):\n- Prime rib: just ok--a bit dry.\n- Side room size: a nice spot, but a bit cramped for 50 if you want to mingle.\n\nThe family will probably be back for a dinner or another group celebration.
