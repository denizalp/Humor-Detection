I threw my ice cream in the trash. That's how much I disliked it. It just wasn't worth the calories I would ingest trying to finish it. The compost cookie was interesting, with all its various ingredients, but part of the texture was off and somewhat off-putting. Lastly, the crack pie was extremely sweet and seemed predominately butter and sugar. I liked this best, but I also felt like I was slowly killing myself with each bite. Tip: share it with someone else.
