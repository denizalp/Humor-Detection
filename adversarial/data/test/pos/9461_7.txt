I visited Culinary Dropout for the first time last night for their soft-opening. They are definitely moving forward in the right direction for creating an entirely different concept in a restaurant. \n\nAtmosphere:\n\nWhile it still has the memory of Pink Taco lingering in the rafters, the atmosphere is a great mix of trendy sophisticated meets rocker. With the family style table set-ups, it's great for a group dinner, but if you're going there on a date and want some privacy, you may want to ask for a private table before you arrive. They had a great live band playing some classic hits, but it almost felt like you were at a concert instead of a restaurant, making it pretty hard to keep a conversation going without asking \"WHAT!!?\" every 5 seconds. But, if they turn the music down just a notch, it'd be perfect. If they transform the restaurant into a music venue later in the night, it'll be a great Old Town bar spot in addition to a tasty restaurant! \n\nFood \n\nExcellent. It's home-cookin' at its finest. The smoked salmon appetizer left you wanting more. The ribs won the popularity contest by a long shot, but surprisingly, the turkey pastrami sandwich was tasty as well! Don't let the dull name fool you. With it's pretzel bun and homemade coleslaw, it did a great job of disguising itself from its deli sandwich brothers. To top off the night, check out their apple dessert. The name has left me, but there are only three desserts, so you won't miss it. \n\nLooking for some cocktails? Mojito all the way. Or the punch. In all honesty, every one of their cocktails looked good and I heard they are each a specialty drink. \n\nIn summary, I think Fox has a great start to a new \"concept\" and I'm excited to see where it goes from here!
