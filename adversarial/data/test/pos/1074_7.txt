Would give this place a 3 star but gotta raise up the rating for the man who was holding the fort up during the busy night my friends and I came in.\n\nThere was one employee working with about 10+ people waiting for their order. But I gotta give him props because not only did he take every single one of our orders, he finished making all our orders before we even expected him to!\n\nTheir snow flavors were noooooot bad. Personally, I prefer the texture from Kuma more but the texture at Snowflake is okay. They have a decent amount of choices for toppings and they give you the first sauce free! The portions are HUGE so one small can definitely serve two people. \n\nI ordered the cookie butter snow with mochi and strawberries. The flavor of the cookie butter is quite strong so FYI. The strawberries were fresh and the mochi was a delight!\n\nOverall, not bad!
