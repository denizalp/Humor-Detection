WAY BETTER THAN CITY OF LAS VEGAS DETENTION CENTER. My boyfriend was safe in CCDC and he could always contact me. Once he got transferred to The City of Las Vegas Detention Center; FUCK that. They didn't let him keep any of the stuff I gave him in CCDC INCLUDING my phone number. I spent three days frantic because I couldn't talk to him and know if he was okay. Fuck NLV. They neglect and abuse inmates there. It's been five days, and still no contact with him even though he has money on his account. Fuck them.
