The reason why i'm giving this a 3 stars is because the ramen here is amazing. \nHowever, it gave me and all my friends diarrhea. Yucky, i know. \nWe ate this in the morning before heading back from Vegas to Irvine. However, our stomachs were hurting so much during the trip back. And 3 of us had to go to the restroom pretty frequently throughout the way back. \n\nEven though the ramen was really good, i would not pay the price of diarrhea for it again. I rather eat Subway .
