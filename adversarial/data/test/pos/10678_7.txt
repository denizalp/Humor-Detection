My friend and I were super excited to come and visit this museum on our recent Vegas trip. After touring this museum, I can say it was A-OK. There were some really cool things, and there were some things I didn't care for. It was alright, glad I visited, but I wouldn't visit again.\n\nThe good:\n\nI LOVED the building that the museum is housed in. It was built in 1933 and it was originally a post office and courthouse. The original details are all still there and it is just a gorgeous building, from the old PO Boxes when you enter, to the marble floors, to the old doors and original elevators. Super cool building. \n\nI enjoyed learning about the Kefauver Hearings as I had never heard of them before. The video we watched was very interesting and I thought it was great that the hearing was actually held in the room you sit in to watch the video. I like that the old courtroom still looks the way it did back then.\n\nYou can take pictures of everything! I thought that was awesome as so many museums don't allow you to take pictures of anything. That was a definite plus.\n\nEvery person that worked there was happy and very friendly and helpful. You can tell they were all excited to be at work!\n\nThe not as good:\n\nMaybe my expectations were too high, but I expected there to be more STUFF to look at. This place is at least 75% pictures on the wall. No real artifacts. And the stuff they did have? Much of it was not labeled, so I didn't know what the hell I was looking at. For example, towards the end of the tour, there is a glass case with pajamas, a belt with money in it, and other items. I don't have a clue who that stuff belonged to. \n\nModern day mob? After we left my boyfriend was asking if the mob is still around? They don't discuss that at all. Of course they aren't going to tell us what the FBI is currently working on, but there could have been some mention of present day. Instead they leave you with pop culture mob - outfits Tony Soprano wore, the Casino script - cool, but not real mob stuff. \n\nLike I said, it was A-OK. I say it is worth checking out if you have the time - we were there about two hours. Admission is $18 and I think parking was $5. Definitely cheaper than what you would spend in a casino in two hours!
