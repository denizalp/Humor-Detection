Modern rustic feel, cafeteria style, 3 godlike dishes are how I would describe Lasa in short bursts. Filipino food used to be new to me in the past when it was super unknown to me and now it seems to be all the rage these days in foodie scenes (new Filipino restos popping up and all) I really do believe there is a lot to discover with this type of cuisine and I highly recommend Lasa as a starting point.\n\nLasa is casual but the food really shines. They divide the food in separate categories: fried\/vegetables\/main etc. We ordered the kare kare with oxtail stew, fresh lumpia, and fried chicken. The kare kare was a first for me, but I've heard many things about it and to me it was  so tasty. It's definitely not for the faint-hearted. It's got this very bold and pungent taste (it has peanut butter in it...I know!), but personally I loved it. The oxtail was super tender, probably braised\/cooked for long hours, and everything about it was just powerful. I think it definitely could be one of those you either hate it or love it dishes. \n\nNext! Fresh lumpia, almost like a Filipino version of a spring roll minus the protein. The outside was made of ube crepe, which I didn't think would work, but it did! It was sweet but filled with fresh vegetables that somehow had a nice crunch and fantastic flavor to it. Fried chicken was also a winner for me. I have no idea what they flavored the batter with, but this is not like any other fried chicken you will taste. It had its own unique seasoning to it.\n\nHonestly, there were so many other dishes I really wanted to try, so I will have to come back! Definitely recommend anybody wanting to try Filipino food to check this place out. Also very affordable!
