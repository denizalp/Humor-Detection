Well. Since we never actually got table service I won't be able to provide much of a real review of Fanucce's. I was also considering checking off \"No\" under the tips section when they asked if there was table service. That's pretty bad. The place was packed. If they would have known that 3 Yelpers would give them a bad review, I'm sure they would have chosen a different table to completely ignore. \n\nThere was a guy who was manning the pizza oven, or pretending to, that almost didn't even let us sit at the only empty table in the joint because he \"had a reservation coming in.\" I feel bad for the people that actually reserved a table there. I think there was only one waitress for the whole place. She didn't even look at us. I'm sure that other customers were much more satisfied than we were... but they weren't being ignored.\n\nI agree with fellow Yelper's M. and M. on all counts. I want to believe that this place could actually be good. This is why it gets 2 stars. I have hope. \n\nThe place kinda reminds me of Lady and the Tramp. I could picture Lady and Tramp sitting there sharing meatballs and spaghetts and being all cute and stuff. So what the hell, Fanucce's? Get your act together!
