Easily one of my favorite ethnic supermarket in Las Vegas. This market specialized in a large range of Korean products and it is the main anchor store for Korea Town. Plus, they carry various Asian products from other countries. One of the main feature is the Hot and Ready made Korean dishes including various Banchan(side dishes) in the back prepared onsite for those looking to stock up or craving for Korean food on the go. The Produce and Seafood section is fresh and the quality is good. Another section is dedicated to ramen in various flavors and spice levels with a wide selection of brands. \n\nWe rarely get any issues with customer service but when they get busy the lines can be long but they move in a timely manner. The aisles in the store are reasonably larger than other Asian markets and the store is clean and organized.\n\n2017 Yelp Review #82
