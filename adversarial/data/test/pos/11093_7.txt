What we call $4 tacos at 74th street Baptist church, we call a sinny-sin-sin... \n\n$3 is the most I would ever pay for a taco.... so how did I end up paying $4 each for 3 here? Oh, the toppings are extra. Yep, extra on top of an already overpriced 'co. Lord knows how they figure out what's what. $.15 here, $.35 there, $.07 around the corner, $.27 for a bag... \n\nThis whole experience was a mess. I tried to get all three tacos without sour cream and 2\/3 ended up with it, my veggie taco ended up being carnitas (and $4), it took 12 min at the window to get my food, the wrong salsa was in the bag, oh, and the tacos were $4 each. Three tacos shouldn't cost more than 2 burritos. \n\nThe three stars is bc naturally they were delicious. -2 for the price and wack job service (even for a drive through). Next time, I'm headed to Tacos El Gordo.
