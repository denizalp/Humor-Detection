Wriiten last week:\nFresh and hot, and the people are REALLY nice!  I'm eating spicy chicken and vegetables. Only problem is, why is it sweet?  I asked for it spicy and she brought me some chili paste and chili oil.  Then, as a joke, brought me a beautiful little habanero pepper!\n\nThese people are great and I'm coming back to try more stuff!!\n\nUPDATE:\nWent back for dinner on Sunday the 3rd of July with a companion.  We ordered the Sizzling rice soup, Mushu (mooshoo?? Mooshu? whatever) shrimp, and a spicy tofu, pork, and mushroom dish.\nYUM!\n\nBut this time, I'm going to give a REAL review.  Here goes.\n\nFrom outside, this place looks like a craphole.  Inside, it hasn't been remodeled since roughly 1974 or so.  I think this turns a lot of people off.  I know that it scared me at first when I went for lunch, and if the staff weren't so nice and the food so fresh that first time, I would never have gone back.  What is it about a yucky interior that makes us think the food is no good?  I'll have to investigate that psychological phenomenon another day...\n\nOkay so we've established that this is not the place to take a first date or anyone that you are trying to impress.\n\nSo, on to the staff.  NICE! FRIENDLY!  I don't need anything else.  They get my complete vote.\n\nShall we now talk seriously about the food?  Here we go.\n\nThe first time I came here, I ordered chicken and vegetables and it was sweetish to the taste.  Now, I'm not a fan of sweet things,  but it was so freshly cooked, I was pleased anyway.\n\nThe second visit was with a gentleman friend that was leery about the ambience, but willing to give it a shot.\nWe ordered the sizzling rice soup as an appetizer to share.  They brought out  our big bowl and served us each an individual bowl instead of letting us serve ourselves.\n\nMy gentleman friend ordered  the mushu (whatever) shrimp.  It  came out steaming on a platter, then the man who had cooked it actually filled, rolled, and served the pancakes tableside. By this time, I was feeling pretty  pampered and was practically purring.\n\nThen the tofu dish came out.  I truly loved it.  Again, there was a sweet note to it, but it was spicy and the tofu was silky, and it was just DELICIOUS.  If I had to criticize, I would like to see that dish made without pork.  \n\nThere are a couple of things that most people don't focus on that I would like to address.  These are little items that, for me, can make or break a restaurant experience.\n\n1. The iced tea was delicious. The lady that served me told me it was a jasmine black tea bought especially for their iced tea.\n\n2. The water was filtered and actually drinkable.\n\n3. The hot tea was delicious and not anemic like at some chinese places that are trying to save a buck.\n\n4. I didn't swell up like a balloon as I have so very many times after eating chinese food.  Obviously, they have a lighter touch with the salt--which is GREAT!\n\nI haven't been here enough times to say that I'm in love, but I might have a little crush on this place!!\nSo, how do we rate this place?  I'm going to have to try to be scientific, because emotionally, I think it might be 4 and a half stars.\n\nAmbience: 1 star\nStaff: 5 stars\nFood: 3 stars\nMiscellaneous: 3.5 stars\nTotal:  3.12 stars.
