NOT RECOMMENDED\n\nOh.....how the mighty have fallen.\n\nOn 10\/7\/17, I awake at 4:00 a.m., head to and through the typical security BS at JFK and take a 5.5 hour Jet Blue flight to Vegas. I love Jet Blue. The flight arrives on time, my luggage is there when I get to the carousel and the jetty to the McCarran Rental Site is waiting for me. There....the fun begins.\n\nI shriek and mutter F-bombs as I observe a line in excess of eighty people(look at my photo) and observe three rental agents sitting at their respective stations. The \"supervisor\/manager\" is nowhere to be seen and no one takes any extra measures to service the massive crowd.Certainly, that person could have sat at one of the two vacant work stations and actually worked.\n\nBottom line.....ONE AND A HALF HOURS TO GET MY CAR!!!! I  shoot down I-15 and arrive at Green Valley Resort tired and pissed.\n\nNEVER AGAIN AVIS!!!!!!!!
