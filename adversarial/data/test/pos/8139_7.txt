Disclaimer: this review is from the perspective of a parent of a youth amateur hockey player.\n\nThe RMU Island Sports Center is the premier ice hockey facility in the area.  It is simply fantastic.  Lets start with the ice.  There are two indoor rinks, a covered outdoor rink, and a covered outdoor deck hockey rink.  Of the two indoor rinks, the 84 Lumber Arena s NHL-sized and has fantastic spectator seating.   The other rink is an Olympic-sized rink and is aptly named Olympic.  The spectator seating is less, but still ample for youth hockey games.  There is also great standing area behind the net, both inside the rink and outside the rink in the corridor because of the large windows.  Both rinks are very well lit, good ice surface, and nicely maintained.  The two outdoor rinks are covered in a large barn-like structure with thick plastic curtains to keep the wind out.  One has ice in the winter and the other is for deck hockey\/roller hockey year round.  They have what looks like a large changing area for mites (very young kids) who always need their parents assistance when changing.)  This is nice since most rinks have the kids change anywhere where there's room.  (Mites play six teams at a time on a sheet of ice.)\n\nThere is a pro shop on site, which is always important to have at a hockey rink.\n\nTheir snack bar is very nice.  They serve Starbucks coffee, and they even have a pizza oven!  This is a great rink for hockey tournaments, especially for the parents.  You will have plenty to do and a very pleasant environment to do it in.
