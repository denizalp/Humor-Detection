You walk in as a normal human being, you walk out still mostly normal but with such deep scents of smokeyness in your skin you'll probably never get it out.  \n\nPortugalia is a rotisserie chicken sit down restaurant you don't really get in USA#1, with full service and menu and the food being cooked and the aromas flying about the restaurant.  Go there, order some chicken, eat some of their fantastic bread, and have a beer or two. You deserve it.
