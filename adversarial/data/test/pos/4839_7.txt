The closer I got to Le's, the more and more Roland's voice sounded like Colonel Kurtz from \"Apocalypse Now.\"  Time slowed down a bit, and my senses heightened.  I found myself deeply inhaling through my nostrils for the smell of napalm.  \n\nWe arrived sans metal detector and traversed through the parking lot minefield unscathed nonetheless.  Instead of eyeballing for the entrance to the barracks, my eyes scanned for enemy combatants until my compatriot lauded the \"all clear.\"\n\nNo guards, no signs...this must be the place.  We knew the praise for Le's must be the real deal Holyfield.\n\nThis is one of those locations that you had no issue traipsing around and adventuring to before marriage and kids.  Now you're appraising the vehicle you're driving and wondering if your life insurance is up to date.  Just kidding...or am I?
