Worst place ever.  Got stuck in a room and said someone will be with you in 10 minutes.  Almost an hour later I go and ask what's taking so long.  Smart ass Dr think he's witty says you can go to another facility and wait 4 hours.  Mother f*cker is lucky I didn't knock his ass our.  Did I mention they came in to make sure I had insurance though.
