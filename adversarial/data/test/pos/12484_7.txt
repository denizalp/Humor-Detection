Newmarket's very own gem, right on main street!!! I love main st newmarket.. how come I feel like they have better food than any other main st?? Made in mexico is huge, with a patio in the front and a large dining AND bar area. Make sure you make reservations on the weekend because it does get busy.\n\nThe owner Caesar is absolutely the nicest person ever! He obviously hires staff that are on the same level of niceness as he is, because they were all super lovely to talk to. I brought my friend here to #OrderTheYelp, and he downloaded the app just for it! (yay for me!) With the yelp deal, it was AMAZING - under $8 for a HUGE burrito boyz sized burrito + two sides (rice, beans, salad) My friend and I were seriously going to burst and I didn't even have the filling-ness of the meat and cheese in my meal!! Also ordered a small watermelon margarita, it was a little too much ice, which the bartender apologized for, but IT WAS STILL GREAT! I thought they messed up and gave me a large by accident because the small was so. big. WTF? If I had a large, I would've popped. My friend had the mango mexican bulldog and this is one of the first places I've been where they have different flavours of their margaritas and mexican bulldogs! Soooo deliciously icy and good. Their sangria is also very fresh, as I saw them chopping new fruit for it every few minutes. \n\nThey also gave us some churros at the end, and my friend devoured them even though he was past his 'too full, gonna die' point.\n\nI'm definitely coming back. DEFINITELY. Now I need to find a baeritto to buy me burritos.... haha.. ha.. ok, I'll escort myself out now.
