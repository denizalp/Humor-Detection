I'm a fan of Fabulous Freddy's, but think this one is just okay. Compared to the one I frequent, this one isn't as busy at all. My usual Fabulous Freddy's takes a little longer for a car clean and wash, but at least the job is perfecto.  \n\nSome Pros:\n-Close to one of my gyms.  I can get me car washed or detailed while I shed some pounds. \n-Close to Rachel's Kitchen.  I can get my eat on while they clean my car\n-Quick:  One of the quicker car washes I've been to. The Freddy's I usually go to takes a long time for your car to get cleaned.  I've even waited as much as 45 minutes for a regular detail.  Here you get your car back with the quickness. \n\nSome Cons:\n-The detail wasn't as good as the other Fabulous Freddy's.  Outside was fine, inside needed a little work.  I was in a rush on my most recent visit so I finished what they didn't when I got home.  \n-No real lobby.  There's outside seating to wait for your ride and a makeshift lobby between the coolers and chips.  Not much comfort inside in my opinion. \n\nI'm not saying I won't come back. I still think the job they do here is okay. But if I had a choice, I will continue to go to the Freddy's I usually hit right off Craig Rd.
