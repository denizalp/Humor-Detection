The hotel is actually pretty good. It's away from the main Vegas strips, but very close to the monorail convention center station so it's pretty convenient, and much quieter. Its own parking garage is located just next to the building so it's easy to access.\n\nI got upgraded to a room with front window view, and the view is impressive. Wynn is right there outside the window cross the golf club. The night view of the strip is simply beautiful from my window. \n\nThe monorail passes by my room every 10 mins, of course, but it's not too bad. At night I hardly notice the noise. The room itself is pretty nice too, clean and well decorated. I like that they have both tub and shower in the bathroom. Only complain? No internet inside the room.\n\nComparing with hotels on the strip, one convenience is the short checkin line. Our checkin only took 5 mins including the waiting line. The line in front of hotel Starbucks, however, is much longer. Lots of people simply goto Starbuck to grab something for breakfast, including people from nearby convention center.\n\nThe atmosphere of the hotel is more business oriented instead of entertainment oriented. It's next door to the convention center, got business center and UPS store by the lobby, and have a side door to the convention center. A big plus for us is that there is no casino inside hotel, so we can totally avoid the unpleasant smells of cigarettes and slot machine noise.\n\nIn general, a very nice, clean hotel off the strip but very conveniently located. I wouldn't mind live there again next time visiting Vegas.
