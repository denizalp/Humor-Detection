A sweet little self-sustained palace of fun off the strip, I maybe don't hate that we're having a meeting here next year.  The design of the place is gorgeous and very fun, and it's just not quite so VEGAS-y as the rest of the strip.  I understand that this is more of a \"locals\" casino.  But with a spa, a movie theatre, a bowling alley, and plenty of dining, drinking and dancing options (even a wee tiny bit of overpriced shopping), I don't know what else you could want.  I mean if you had to be stranded in a hotel for a week, I'd recommend Red Rock where you most likely wouldn't have time to get bored.  \n** update **\nThe rooms are fab and those suites?!  Crazy.  From \"ooh nice\" to \"WOW, really?\" to \"OMFG, you have got to be kidding me\" - both in price and design (someone please bring me to stay a week in the two bedroom ones that have their own little patio deck with hot tub, mini cabana, bar, etc. - I promise to love you forever; oh and since we're here anyway spending crazy amounts of money - maybe we can rent out one of the private bowling alleys, kthx.).  The pool area was great too, and everything is laid out so well so it's aesthetically pleasing from just about every angle (see the rooms that look down onto the pool as an example, or the view of Red Rock at sunset in the reflection of the glass in the meeting space).  If I could afford it, I would definitely stay here.
