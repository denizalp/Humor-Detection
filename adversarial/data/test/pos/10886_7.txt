I am a Fashionista!\n\nSeriously, I like boutiques and finding really cute unusual pieces of clothing,  but lets be real,  there aren't many boutiques around theses days. Plan deaux; TJ Maxx!\n\nThis TJ is located next to many other shopping options, seems a little touristy, but this could be the reason why this store always has good finds and never disappoints.  I find the cutest outfits and \nshoes and even stuff for our house.\nI also love the packaged flavored coffees. I bought a delicious Madagascar Vanilla coffee for under 6.00 a bag.\n\nThe childrens clothing has cute outfits in designer labels but price pointed at Target prices. \n\nI love this TJ.
