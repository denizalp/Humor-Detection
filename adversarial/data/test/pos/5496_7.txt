This was our first visit to Shiki Menya and we were quite excited from all the raving reviews people gave the restaurant.\n\nWe(my brother, hubby, and myself)arrived around 11am and did not get seated until 1:10pm. Around 12:45 I asked my hubby to check the list and he found out that our name was crossed off, but we weren't called at all(and we knew when names were called as we were seated by the restaurant door). There were also 2 other groups that had their names crossed off without being called. We spoke with the staff that was keeping track of the line\/list and he denied that he didn't call us, but multiple people confirmed that we didn't hear our names. He wasn't apologetic at all and made this annoyed face every time he came back out to call customers in.\n\nI would really give the restaurant 5 stars as the food and service in the restaurant was superb. But the first staff we met really put us in a bad mood. We were prepared for a long wait as we read the reviews, but we would have waited without being seated at all if it was up to that staff member.\n\nAnyway, we ordered 2 tonkotsu classics, and the spicy miso(totally forgot the name). Both broths were flavorful, but not oily. The noodles were perfectly chewy and tasted really fresh. The egg, meat, and veggie toppings were the icing on the cake. Everything came together to make the perfect ramen bowl. \n\nWe will definitely come back again, but will be there around 10:30am and will keep a close watch on the list. Definitely recommending Shiki Menya to friends and family. And will be bringing a bigger group next time as well.
