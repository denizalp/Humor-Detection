I hate this place!! I went in because I seen a giant sign that said 20 dollar pedi and 20 for a gel manicure. However when I finished some dumb girl asked this old lady with short black hair how much to charge me. Hello isn't the price just forty????  She said what did you do? The dumb girl said a gel manicure and a pedicure ( no gel on the toes ) and the old lady says oh a manicure that's going to be fifty! Really you guys have a big Ass sign on your building and you are trying to raise the price on the spot? Dame that's scandalous !!!!!!! Beware a rip off !!!! They suck balls!!!!!!!
