First of, let me clarify... this is an one incident bad enough to warrant its own 1-star (if I can give zero, I would) review.\n\nAfter the Yelpy Award night, a few of us decided to get a bite and a drink to keep the party going.  It was about 10pm when we arrived, not late by any means for a bar.  We ordered food and drinks.  We were aware that our waitress is new (3 day old).  The service was a little slow, but what the heck, we're having a good time talking.  Then it dawned on us that it's REALLY REALLY SLOW.  As in 45, 50 minutes later we still haven't had food, and the waitress had barely came by. \n\nThe place was virtually empty.  It doesn't take almost an hour to fix a few sandwich wraps and fries.  Plus people don't order food at 10pm unless they are just-got-out-of-prison hungry!  We started to voice out loud our frustration, I mean, last I checked I'm in the US and I have the freedom of speech to say whatever the heck I want as long as I don't scream \"Fire!\" in a crowded theater (I know I learned something in school...).  There was another waitress out on the patio doing clean up work.  And before we knew it, she HUFFED and PUFFED right by us and said LOUD ENOUGH for us to hear \"F$#K, YALL ARE KILLING ME\"\n\nI am not sure which school of waitressing this chick came from, but I'm damn sure that's unacceptable at anywhere.  And boy she picked the wrong table to F with... a table full of Yelpers?!  We eat for a living and we sure as heck have an opinion and the whole darn world is going to hear about it. Man, I was pissed... this chick done got my neck-twisting, finger-snapping side out of me.\n\nA NOTE TO MANAGEMENT (if you are reading): 1. Please tell your waitresses to NEVER be so rude to your customers. NEVER, no exception, even if the customer was rude (which we weren't).  I waited tables, so I had rude customers, go b!tch in the kitchen.  2. Keep your tables informed if there's some unusual wait time.  How the heck would we know you had a big take-out order if you don't tell us?  Let us decide if we want to wait (thus forfeit our right to complain) or not wait.  3. The F word is to be never used at any table for any reason whatsoever by your staff!    \n\nThis is one of my fav spots in town, and it was such a disappointment to have to encounter this myself (on an empty Wednesday night to say the least).  I have sticked my neck out plenty of times for this place, and now I can't even use my usual line \"I never had bad service here, ever\" anymore
