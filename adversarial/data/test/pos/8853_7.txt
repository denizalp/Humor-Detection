I feel the need to start off this review by saying that I am *not* one to post negative reviews for mediocre experiences, but my experience today with Pizza Rustica was so completely infuriating, I have to.  If this post is understandably too long to read, the short version of the story is that half of our order was not delivered and the restaurant (and specifically, head chef) handled the situation with complete disregard for customer service and an abhorrent attitude.\n\nI placed an order through UberEats at 8:00 pm on Saturday, April 9th for a pizza and a panini. When the order arrived, the driver said that a woman at the restaurant told her that they no longer made the panini so they did not include it in the order.  I found this to be strange because I was not contacted by the restaurant to see if we wanted to swap the panini for something else.  I thanked and tipped the driver and called Pizza Rustica to find out whether they would be sending something in substitution or if they would offer us a refund.\n\nWhen I called, I spoke with a young woman who seemed to be incredibly friendly and helpful and went to ask the kitchen why the panini wasn't sent out. When she came back on the phone, she said that they make the panini and would never have told the Uber driver that they didn't so it must have been ordered from the other Pizza Rustica restaurant on the same street. I asked her if she had the telephone number for the restaurant. She said that she didn't, but that I could probably find it online. She told me to call back if I didn't figure out the problem. I thanked her and hung up the phone.\n\nI couldn't find another Pizza Rustica on the same street online, so I called Pizza Rustica back to double-check that they didn't have the telephone number. I was speaking with another woman who said that the first lady gave her the low-down on my order issue. She said that she could give me the number, but they probably wouldn't be open because it was a catering service. (?) So I said \"so, the order came through your restaurant? Do you have a record of it?\"  She put me on hold and went to talk to the kitchen about the order.\n\nFive minutes later, she puts me on the phone with the head chef. He told me that they definitely gave the panini to the driver, and that the problem was with UberEats and not them. He gave me the telephone number for JustEats customer service (*not the same delivery service*).  Before I planned on getting off the phone, I asked him if he was 100% certain that this was the case because I didn't want to contact UberEats not having my facts straight. He said he was going to triple-check with the kitchen.\n\nWhen he came back, he said that he now thinks the order wasn't punched in. He put me on hold for 5-10 minutes while he looked through his computer to confirm this. He concluded that could be the problem, but he wasn't certain. He told me about an UberEats order from the day before where they messed up. I said \"I just want to see how this situation can be rectified, will you be sending the order or can you offer me a refund?\"  He said that he can't send a delivery driver and he can't offer a refund because the payment does not go through him (totally understandable). He then said that he is super busy with the Jays home opener (which was the day before). I said I don't really care about the Jays home opener, I just want this problem to be fixed (through refund by UberEats or resending the correct order). He said \"oh you don't care about the Jays home opener? Listen lady, I don't need your tone and don't have to put up with this\" and hung up the phone.\n\nI was given the complete runaround from Pizza Rustica with three different stories as to why the food wasn't delivered. I still don't know why for sure, but my assumption is that it was because the chef and employees of Pizza Rustica are completely unaccountable, lazy, unprofessional and can't handle a two-item delivery order.  Who would also rather tell a bunch of half-assed lies than admit that the mistake was a fault of their own.
