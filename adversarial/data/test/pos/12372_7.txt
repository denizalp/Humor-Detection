I place an order on Bath & Body Works website 2-3 times a year because it's easier than going into a store since I always know what I want, to re-up my hand soap stock and get more wallflower refills. I also order when they offer free shipping making it that much more convenient to order online than drive to a store. When you want to pick out a scent for someone like I recently did, it's obviously better to go to a store so you can try on and smell, smell, smell all the varieties of scents they have. \n\nWalking in I was greeted right away and the girl was nice, but I told her I wanted to look around on my own and would ask her if I needed help and she still tried asking me questions and showing me stuff. Ugh. Inside was very clean and organized. They have a sink where you can wash your hands to try the different hand soaps however once you have washed with one it's hard to distinguish the different scents from each other. The person I was buying a gift for was specific about the scent of fragrance mist aka body splash she likes, so I made sure to find that right away and noticed the advertised deal of buy 2 get 1 free posted. Since I was able to mix and match the different scents of body care in the deal, I got a fragrance mist and body lotion for the gift and the freebie was a shower gel for me! The girl who rang me up was friendly like the girl who originally helped me, but tried getting me to add on other stuff and it just felt uncomfortable. \n\nI didn't end up impressed with the shower gel because it didn't leave any type of lasting scent. I'm sure they'd prefer me layer with mist and lotion, but I'm not interested since I already have brands of that I like and use. The shower gel and lotion were both priced at $12.50 and the fragrance mist priced at $14. The best time of the year to buy this type of stuff is when they promote the buy 3 get 3 deal and often times have coupons for a certain percentage off your total purchase.
