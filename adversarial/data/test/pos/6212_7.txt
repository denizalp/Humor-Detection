Murphy's Law Irish Pub is an ideal spot for date rapists to bring women.\n\nBeen to Murphy's a couple dozen times, didn't particularly like it apart from two things: great rooftop patio, and it's close to my place (and the beach.) The food is a little overpriced across the board- it's fairly typical pub quality with above average prices. Due to location, it's often a busy place and service can be slow at times. Taking into consideration their rooftop patio, I might have given it three stars, but I had an absurd experience here the other night that stripped me of any respect I had for this business.\n\nI went with some friends for food after a festival at Woodbine Park (where a friend of mine admittedly got a little drunk.) When we arrived we asked if there was room on the second floor (first floor was packed,) were told yes, and made our way up. As we were sitting down, our waitress noticed my friend was drunk, (I'm guessing) by the way she was walking and talking. (Not tripping, being beligerent or anything like that, just noticeably tipsy.) We sat down, decided what we wanted to eat, and eventually our waitress busily passed our table, and in passing told me she wouldn't serve my friend. Somewhat surprised, I said that was okay (assuming she meant drinks, which we didn't want anyways.) Our waitress didn't come back to take a food order for some time, so- bored as I was- I thought I'd feign to make 100% sure my friend would be able to order food at some point (I was more just reminding the waitress our table still hadn't ordered.) I got her attention, asked, and was wide-eyed when she told me it would be against company policy to serve my friend any food.\n\nMy friend was terribly embarassed, but all of us have worked at various bars and restaurants (about a dozen between us,) and never even heard of a policy refusing food to intoxicated people (infact, bars are legally required to provide some sort of food option so people too intoxicated have a way to sober up.) At next opportunity I asked our waitress the logic behind this company policy, and, as she explained it the belief was- and I feel ridiculous just typing this but- *if we serve her food, and something happens to her, like she trips down the stairs on her way out, there will no longer be proof we didn't serve her drinks.* I inquired how serving her food would have any impact on proving whether or not she had been served drinks, and the answers were unclear, if not obviously feeble-minded. I scoffed at the absurdity, and we were on our way out to somewhere else for food when I figured I'd get the waitress' name and talk with a manager the next day. To my luck, while I was waiting for another free moment with our waitress, a manager passed by. \nI explained to him what had happened, and although his tone was much more agreeable, he simply reiterated what our waitress had said. I pointed out the policy's flaws in logic, and how an intoxicated person would be more likely to trip downstairs without eating. He said, 'well, ideally she should've been told we wouldn't serve her food before she came upstairs.' I asked him, 'But now that we are up here, and serving her food obviously has no impact on proving whether or not you served her additional drinks- can she order her food when we order ours? [In retrospect I should've just ordered two entrees myself and given one to her. Also, so the reader understands- she was not approaching messy 'blackout' drunk- we went up and down the stairs, and went about the rest of our night, without the slightest concern for incident. Neither was she loud, juvenile, nor on verge of throwing up. Additionally, this place bills itself as an 'Irish Pub.']' He apologized, but insisted on the powerlessness of all who dwell within those hollowed walls to that ancient and mysterious policy. We left, discussing the unreasonable policy and our bafflement for hours to come. Date rapists rejoice: policy at Murphy's Law denies intoxicated women any sobering food or non-alcoholic beverages.\n\nThis is one fake a$$ Irish Pub you don't want to have more than an (overpriced) pint or two in. There are people in management positions who clearly don't have the brain power to belong there, and on principle I'm avoiding future patronage.
