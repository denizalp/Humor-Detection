Love their food and was a regular but I had to stop eating there because the food is soooooooo oily. I asked them several time to cook my food with the least amount of oil but that didn't work! If you don't mind the oil dripping from your food, then this is a great place, nice relaxed atmosphere, owner operated and very nice. They also deliver with min order of 10 or 20 depending on location.
