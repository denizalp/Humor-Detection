I visited C2 Tactical for about 30 seconds this evening. I noticed their sign in the window but entered anyway just to clarify. I went directly to the counter and spoke with one of the guys. I was stunned to learn that a Tactical firearms store wouldn't support licensed\/concealed carry. Unfortunately, my son and I had to leave immediately since I had my pistol on my side (concealed). \nC2 was a very nice looking store and appeared to have a wide variety of gear. I sincerely hope that they take that sign down asap. It's ridiculous to train people and sell firearms and gear for protection, then turn around and tell us that \"we don't trust you to carry here\".
