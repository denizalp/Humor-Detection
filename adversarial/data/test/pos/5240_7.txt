This place offers dreams and rainbows in a self-serve cup. Each flavor so enticing, so glorious, that it's difficult to choose. My suggestion is to try the coconut. Its flavor transcends space and time. Anyone who didn't love this place, wasn't loved or hugged as a child and I can only pray for your soul.
