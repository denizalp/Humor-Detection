Terrble. I havent been to a beauty supply store this insulting in my life. The little store clerk followed me around..asked me to model my hair in a hand held mirror instead of the full size and stood over me the entire time I tried the different hair styles. I was highly offended and uncomfortable. How do you expect people to purchase your overpriced products when you dont give them the freedom to shop? I have been to several other beauty supply stores without this issue there is no excuse for stalking customers. Also, I left the store...didnt buy anything because I was so annoyed and went to EZ Beauty on Tyvola who had the exact same thing for $40 cheaper! My advice for Tisun...come to 2014 and invest in a security camera like every other store on earth!
