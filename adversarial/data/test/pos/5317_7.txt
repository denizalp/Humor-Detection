One of my car took a dump, and I had to change out a fuel pump on one of the worse placed fuel pump in the automotive industry.     At first, I was begging it was only a fuel filter issue, but since there was no humming coming from my gas tank.  I knew it had to be changed.  \n\nI was pretty pissed off with Ford, because they claim it was just past the warranty period, and would repair it for 650.00.     I laughed and left the dealership, and was determine to find someone to install this horrible pump.   Then one of the employees told me about KB, and what they do, how they charge, and most importantly... their an insured business.  \n\nI called them on a Saturday, and their Secretary nicely took my information on my car, and what needed to be done.    I had a call back within two hours on the total cost of labor and parts.   What stunned me was the quote....$265.00 for labor, pump and filter!      I jumped on that quote, and made an appointment on Tuesday (my day off)\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Kenny and another Mechanic came to my house, and went to work on my car.    What blew me away was when Kenny told me this repair should be done within an hour and change.     Ford Country told me this was going to be  three to four hour job, but Kenny told me \"we don't fool around, and will get this job done right\"\nSo I went back into my house, and let them do there thing.      I checked them out about every 15 to 20 minutes and on the four time outside...they were done with this job!\n\nI was stunned, and my car is running like a champ.    One more thing, KB doesn't charge extra for coming to your house!     Thinking about this now, I should have scheduled on Monday because it only took 70 minutes to do.     I finally found my mechanic in Las Vegas when I don't want to be greased up.
