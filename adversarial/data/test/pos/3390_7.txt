I've frequented Rito's since the late 80's, way before it was cool to drive down through the Garfield neighborhood. One of the only positive things about working in the financial services industry is that no one seems to care if you take a 2 hour lunch in order to make your way in to \"the hood\" for some really good food.\n\nLunch crowds are a mix of locals and lawyers, lined up shoulder to shoulder in a line that usually makes it way out the door. Take a dose of patience and a big appetite (oh and cash.... no plastic here).\n\nMy favorite: the red mix burro enchilada style.... just typing that phrase makes my jaw shudder hannibal lecter style.
