I ran into Target today to get a few things and $400.00 dollars later I was heading out happy.  Even though I wasn't expecting to purchase everything I came out with, I was happy with the whole sales experience.  The sales associates on the floor were very helpful and friendly and the cashier was equally nice.  \n\nThe store was very clean and well lit.  Everything I was looking for was available and so was the other $350.00 dollars' worth of stuff I purchased :) Target has really stepped up their game over the years and it's noticeable.  If you haven't shopped there in a while, I recommend you give it a try.  Good prices, friendly staff, good selection, and a clean store, what's not to like.
