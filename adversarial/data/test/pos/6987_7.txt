GMonkey love me some AYCE SUSHI to get several cooked items. \n\nStep 1:  Order everything with red heart. You're only allowed one order per person. \nStep 2:  Finish what you order or be charged extra for waste. \n\nGMonkey do:\n\nHAMACHI KAMA-broiled perfectly, best part of fish\nSALMON KAMA- ditto\nUNI- creamy in your mouth\nSWEET SHRIMP- sweet raw, fried head\nGIANT CLAM- little giants\nSOFT SHELL CRAB- battered & fried\nSABA SHIOYAKI- grilled just right\nSALMON NIGIRI- old reliable\nPALM JOB Handroll- spicy SSC, scallop wrapped in soy paper, crunch\n\nSeated quickly, service was superb. Never passed my table without being checked on. Though I intended on sushi, everything was cooked perfectly. Sketchy dark parking lot with beggars wandering all night between parked cars. Be aware. GMonkey shall return. In daylight.
