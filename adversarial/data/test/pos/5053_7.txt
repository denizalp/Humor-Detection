After a hideous taxicab ride with a driver who was convinced we wanted to go to the airport, we arrived at the ferry departure point and took the first ferry away from the mainland to escape the frustration of our day.\n\nOur initial destination was Ward's Island, since it had rave reviews and seemed peaceful with less little kids running around.  But getting on a ferry - stat - took precedence.\n\nThe ferry ride was relaxing, and we had great views of the skyline.  Even though it was raining lightly, the ride was pleasant.  Our ferry to the island was less than half full - only six or seven people on the boat.  Two guys on the boat asked if we were headed to the \"concert,\" and by their age and outfits, I was amazed to learn that there was an EDM concert on Centre Island that night.  I would have bought tickets if I knew this was happening!\n\nWhen arriving at Centre Island, we were given instructions on where to board when we wanted to come back.  Ferries run every 30 minutes or so.\n\nMost people seem to rag on the families and kids that come here.  There's a small amusement park area with paddle boats, a rollercoaster, and a farm\/zoo (not quite a petting zoo), and despite how many people were on the island that day, it didn't feel super crowded.  Even though there are a lot of children, there is so much open space here that I didn't really notice.\n\nThe ferries back to the mainland are packed like sardines.  That line was VERY long.  The return ferry was packed as if we were European immigrants headed to Ellis Island.\n\nFor two adults, there wasn't that much to do here, but it was a relaxing escape from the city to just walk around and snap pictures of that fabulous skyline.  And the baby goats at the zoo?  OHMYADORABLE.  Okay, the loud bleeting DID get a bit aggravating, but that's when you just walk away.  And it's hilarious to see and hear kids bleet back at the goats.\n\nThe EDM concert was blocked from view to us commoners, but I contemplated hopping the fence, or just buying tickets, but I wasn't dressed to dance in the mud all night long.  Walking along the paths, hearing thump-thump-thudding EDM, while looking across the water at the skyline gave me a thrilling feeling.  I jumped into the air a few times to try to see over the fence and failed #whitegirlscantjump.  I wanted to dance by myself on the outside of the fence, but the area is full of security guards, and I didn't want to be hauled away on a stretcher under the assumption that I was pumped up on Molly or having a psychotic break...so I just kept walking.\n\nEven though we didn't DO much at Centre Island, I'll never forget our visit there.  Truly memorable!
