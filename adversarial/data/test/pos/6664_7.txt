I only go to this store when I'm in the area, and if I've already been to Target. \nI always find it very clean. The store is large and spacious, so it's pretty easy to shop.\nPretty good selection of kitchen ware. I've gotten good deals on a few things. \nNice selection of inexpensive frames.  Baby section is kind of small, but I think that is typical. \nClothes: Steer clear. I'm not sure why the people that make clothes for the poorer people insist on making them so ugly. Ugh. The Kmart clothing section is filed with obnoxious patterns, loud colors and terrible fabric. Avoid! \n\nMy favorite thing about kmart, is that they will email your receipt. Genius!
