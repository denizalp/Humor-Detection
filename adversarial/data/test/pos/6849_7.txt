I love me some after hours music!  I've gone to Drai's before its renovation and the interior still looked the same - just cleaner.  The club is located at the back corner of the Cromwell, apart from the Drai's Nightclub and Beachclub.\n\nThey open at 1AM and close around 10AM (sometimes even later).  It starts to get packed around 5-6AM since the nightclubs end around 4AM.  There's a house room and a hiphop room on the side.  The crowd is diverse, the music is bumping, and if you prefer bottle service - there's plenty of tables to choose from throughout the club.\n\nThere is usually always cover for both males and females.  We bribed the bouncer to line cut and the ladies were able to walk in for free while the guys paid the cover charge.  We didn't have any issue with dress code -- everybody was dressed differently, from dressy to trendy to casual.  If you still want to continue to get your party on after the nightclubs close, Drai's is the spot to go to.
