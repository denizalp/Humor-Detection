I really like RnR. Actually, love it. I wish it was easier to get a seat on Sunday funday but the secret is out and therefore this place is packed. I got these amazing little tiny ahi tacos, they were so fresh, so awesome. I wish I would have taken a pic as the menu description is super descriptive, but not what you imagine you are getting....they are better!  These are literally one to two bites max but soooo worth it! I seriously could eat like twelve. The chicken lollipops in honey jalapeno sauce are amazing. They are soooo good! My boyfriend gets those everytime. He introduced me this fine, fun establishment it has yet to be a let down. \n\nService staff, well some of the staff can be null\/non existent or brain dead so just a heads up, don't go here on a time crunch or a short fuse. The food, atmosphere and drinks are great though. Just be aware that occaisonally there is a farmer's market located in the parking lot, therefore, there is no parking that is convienent on those particular Sundays....cheers :)
