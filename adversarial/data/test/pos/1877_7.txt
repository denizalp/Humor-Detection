Unlike many of the reviews for Triple B garage door and gates this is from a customer with a real experience to share!\n \nI don't usually write long reviews:\n \nReaders Digest Version of this review: Watch out, do not use, less than honest, horrible workmanship, defective parts!\n \nAfter a few reports of garage doors not working at some of our east valley properties we decided to hire a local expert to make the necessary repairs.  Based upon Yelp reviews we selected Triple B Garage Doors and Gates.  Here's a tip: checkout a business's website.  If it's cheesy, lacks a business location and is half done STAY AWAY!\n \nIt took three calls before someone named Roderick called us back.  We arranged for Triple B Garage Doors and Gates to provide an assessment of 12 properties in the east valley.  No one showed on the scheduled inspection date.  We did receive a call the next day advising they had a scheduling conflict and would be out the next week.\n \nRoderick and a character named Kevin did show up (an hour late) for the scheduled appointment.  We provided access keys to all the properties and they promised to give full evaluations and estimate for necessary services.\n \nLess than 30 minutes after leaving our office we got a call from Roderick that the first garage door they inspected was \"stuck\" and needed immediate repairs.  The cost was $476 dollars.  I gave the ok but had a bad feeling about these guys.\n\nSure enough about an hour later another call came in that they were at the second property with another \"stuck\" door.  The price for repairs was quoted at $610 dollars.  Something did not seem right.\n \nWhen one of our representatives arrived on site to investigate she was confronted by the character named Kevin.  He was angry and wanted to know why she did not trust him and would not authorize the repairs.  He pointed out that she was wearing a cross and that he did not like Christians.  Not sure why wearing a cross given by her late Grandmother made her an evil Christian??\n \nGiven our uncertainty and the argumentative nature of Kevin we decided to pay for the first repair and move on with someone else. \n \nWe called A-1 Garage Doors the next day.  Amazing difference.  Someone actually answered our initial call and dispatched a service technician that day.  I met the technician at the second property that Triple B Doors had alleged we needed $610 in repairs.  My suspicions were confirmed when the technician advised that the only service needed was lubrication.  Jack the service technician pointed out that the system was less than two years old and more than likely under warranty.\n \nI discovered at the first property that $476 in repairs were most likely not needed and that based upon what was done we were severely overcharged.  Wanting to get a refund I called this business and no one would return my calls so I went to the business location which turned out to be One of the owners home in a residential area . That was a waste of time as all I got was a sob story. They did however offer me a cash payment if I promised to leave a good yelp review GO FIGURE!\n \nTo be truthful I was stunned how could a business with such good reviews on Yelp be so bad? \n \nThis is where the story gets interesting.  This business did not get a license until May 12, 2013, yet there are reviews proclaiming wonderful service prior to this date (look at first review left).  There is even a 5 star review from a Yelper that wrote they had not had service but decided to give out a great review.  Experienced Yelpers know this scenario.\n \nEven more interesting is when I went to Roderick (one of the owners) personal Yelp page where he rips his competitors, including A-1 Doors that did a great job for me.  Not cool and I believe a violation of Yelp TOA's. The facts are the facts and Yelpers can only be fooled for so long.
