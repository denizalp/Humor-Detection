Was not really feeling the white cream sauce on the rice bowl and the bulgogi Philly cheesesteak. Felt very fattening and made me feel sick. Wish they had told us what kind of sauce it was when they were giving us the option. I felt very rushed to make a decision on our order. When asked to substitute the meats they could not do it. I don't see the big deal. Was too pricey for the quality of food we got.
