my first review..  i read them alll the time on here, and after following some reviews and decided to eat here.\n\nthe service was amazing, the food was even better.. some of the freshest chinese i have had in AZ.. the variety you can order from is extensive to any tastes you or your family might have.. the atmosphere is versatile as well, good for a quick bite or a nice date.\n\ni felt like i needed to write one in regards to the \"Andrew C.\" person.. this guy must have never had chinese food to believe this is akin to pei wei .. or even less asian than it.  he probably ordered the most american dish he saw. he must be a sweet n sour lover (not that there is anything wrong withthat)
