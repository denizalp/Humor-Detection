Is it clean? Yes. \nComfortable? Not bad. \n\nBut ...\nThis is my second time here. I've had all of these problems last June '13 and now. \n\nWIFI isn't even usable. \nAlways a problem checking in. \nKey to my room never works. \nTV in room is 20 years old.\nThe girl I had in my room was younger than the TV.
