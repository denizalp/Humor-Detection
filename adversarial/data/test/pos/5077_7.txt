Think Qdoba with pita bread and more options. The portions are large, cheap, and consistently good. There's Pita Pit franchises all around the country, but as far as I know, this is the first one in Wisconsin. I tried a breakfast pita recently, and I'm a huge fan already. The chicken, eggs, cheese and vegetables were all cooked to a perfect consistently, and there was a ridiculous amount of extra toppings and sauces to choose from for no extra charge.\n\nThis food is in no way, shape, or form authentic Middle Eastern food. In fact, the pita bread just tastes like flattened white bread. But that doesn't seem to be what Pita Pit is going for. The food is thoroughly Americanized, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. I don't go to my local Chinese restaurant for authentic Chinese food, and I don't eat Chipotle because it reminds me of Mexico. Yeah, you can get a falafel pita here, but you can also get pita versions of classics like Philly Cheesesteak, Caesar Salad, tuna, or eggs and ham.\n\nThis place isn't nearly as nutritious as it claims, especially considering the amount of food they're giving you. But hey, this is America. If I want a mildly ethnic version of the oversized portions of comfort food I know and love, it's my god-given right to have it.
