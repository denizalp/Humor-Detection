I love to walk into a local business and see an owner whose passion for what they do shines so brightly. That's how I feel about Sean. \n\nI don't buy a ton of seafood to cook for myself. Sometimes I find fresh fish counters intimidating. Not here. I can walk in completely clueless, and leave happy. Everyone here is nice and helpful. I feel like Sean knows fish like I know Friends sitcom trivia. (Aka that means he's a certified expert)\n\nAlong with fresh offerings of their own, Catch On also supports local businesses and carries products from others. I think one of the coolest things they do here is Taco Tuesday. The kits make 6 tacos. They come with tortillas hand made locally at La Lupita, house made fresh salsa from Three Amigos Mexican Restaurant, taco seasoning from The Savory Spice Shop, mahi mahi, slaw, an avocado, and a lime. Kit is just $16. Steal. You could probably have dinner ready in 10 minutes. \n\nYes, this is going to be a little more pricier than your Harris Teeter. But, it's better quality and still comparable and even better priced than a lot of the other seafood places around town. Keep up the good work Sean and crew. Love having you guys just five minutes down the road from my house.
