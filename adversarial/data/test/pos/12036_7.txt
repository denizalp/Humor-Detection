Even though Jaburritos is almost identical to Soho Sushiburrito on Sahara Ave, Soho triumphs Jaburrito when it's all said and done.\n\nWe came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. I always order the Rosarito (aka Firecracker at the Sahara location). But here, the burrito is very bland. And they STILL don't have the Diablo Habanero hot sauce. My spicy tuna wasn't even spicy!!!! What a disappointment!! Their taro chips here were stale. Nacho cheese for the dipping sauce was watery. I wouldn't be surprise if they diluted the cheese with water....just to be cheap and save some bucks. Service was slow. The Sahara location runs like a well-oiled machine. Thought I'd give this location a second chance, but no....I'll be at the Sahara location from now on.
