ABC Stores is where I get my revolving supplies of Milk Chocolate Covered Macadamia Nuts from Hawaii with Las Vegas Strip packaging, and our annual Las Vegas wall calendars.  Diane and I are no fools, and have learned through the years by experience to ALWAYS keep TWO of these nut packages on hand: one for display on the living room coffee table and the enjoyment of guests, and the other tucked away in our kitchen pantry for our mouths only.  The addictive power of these chocolates is well known!\n\nSo, a finished box of the tasty treats was just replaced a few days ago, and a 2013 Vegas calendar duly purchased.  The store was busy as usual, but all was in good order, and sale associates were friendly and efficient.  I will most definitely be back!
