John was fantastic and knew exactly what to do with my hair and eyebrows. He was very detailed in shaping my brows and cutting my hair. I'm the type of person that tells the stylist to do what looks best and going to an Asian salon, it's obvious that they know what they're doing! $24 for a haircut and eyebrow wax? Can't beat that. Definitely will be returning.\n\nThey have a bit of Asian mom personality where they tell you what will look best in you and some people may be turned off by that, but I appreciate it and find humor in it.
