---This is for all Subway locations.---    You bastards!!!  \n\nWhy must you make it so difficult to make a simple, crappy sandwich?   \n\nThis is how it goes, \"I'd like a turkey on wheat.\" then they put on gloves and ask \"that was a what again?\"    Do they only hire \"short bus\" people? \n\n Ingredients, yup they regularly screw that up too. Either a huge handful of onions, or peppers, enough to make you gag, or they may give you only a single piece of onion\/peppers. As if to say \"I don't like my job, so now I'm going to ruin your sandwich so you can have a bad day too.\"    \n\nWhy Subway why must you hassle me every time I get a sandwich?
