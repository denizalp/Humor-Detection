We came here for a graduation celebration party. I've eaten here several times whenever my touristy friends are in town. As you see, I'm a Las Vegas local and usually going to the Vegas strip isn't my favorite thing to do because it's always busy, loud and so touristy. The people that work on the las vegas strip are always obnoxious and rude because they think everyone are tourists. Why come eat on the strip and pay high prices for mediocre food when I can go some place local where it's cheaper and we will be treated better. But like I said we come here only on special occasions and for out of towner friends. \n\nAnyway, we ordered a New York steak thinking that \"how could you go wrong with steak?\" The steak came out rubbery, over bloody and not cooked long enough, but the sauce was not bad. \n\nBesides that... Not only the food was bad, (our other friend had to return her salad because it was so plain) the service was bad, our drinks never refilled and the waitress was non existent. \n\nI don't recommend coming here. Food is over priced, rude to their customers and basically sugar factory is just a gimmick. If you're not a Kim Kardashian or nicki minaj don't expect good service here.
