Besides the fancy iPad looking thing this place gives you upon arrival (substitute for actually filling out paperwork - warning: might be hard for older patients) which I thought was pretty cool, this is pretty much your standard urgent care. Wait around for 45 minutes, see the doctor for 3 minutes, get a script for your pills, and you are on your way. No real bedside manners (sometimes that's nice when you're sick and miss your mom) but overall - decent place. Having to go to places like this just makes me want to find a primary doc ASAP.
