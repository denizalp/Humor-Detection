What is not to really like about this place?\nNothing that I can see.\nIt is a great place to come to ,if you live in the Valley, or anywhere else in the world.\n It is as great as any casino resort in Vegas.\n I think we are lucky to have it here close by.\nThe rooms are nice, there is covered parking. Great pools, nice grounds.\n The Buffett is one of the nicest around.\nNice place for out of town visitors to stay as well.\nA t in my book.
