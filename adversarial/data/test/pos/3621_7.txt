I love me my veal.\n\nI love this place.  I have been a few times, and each experience has been enjoyable.  I am so full that I could be rolled out....but damn....it is worth it.\n\nThe women who work here look miserable.  They can fry up a mean piece of meat, but they are like robots...friendly robots.\n\nThe fried veal is amazing.  Like butter, not greasy, just perfect.  I can't recommend it enough.  In fact, I am getting hungry just thinking and writing this!\n\nMy favourite sights at California Sandwiches - seeing a side of beef being delivered through the side door, watching the women stir the huge pot of sauce with a boat sized paddle, the array of customers (construction, suits, mom and kids) and seeing the people who order the double meat sandwiches (which I am sure would inflict major meat sweats).
