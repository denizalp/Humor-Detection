Wifey & I went to Lindo one night for a light & late dinner.  Not a bad choice!\n\nUpon seating we were served a big bowl of house made tortilla chips with the Lindo house salsa and bean dip.  Hey, great beginnings!  Chips were still warm, I don't normally like smooth salsa (I like em' chunky LOL) but the flavor was good in Lindo's.  But that bean dip though!  Very tasty!  We were happy to eat all of this up!  No appetizer needed!\n\nActually, we weren't hungry enough to order entrees for each of us - so we did end up ordering appetizers to share!\n\n**Nachos Monarca's - Corn tortilla chips with beans, melted cheese, jalapenos, and carne asada, topped with guacamole & sour cream\n\n**Elotes - Mexican street corn grilled with mayo, cotija cheese, and lime chile powder\n\nBoth great choices overall!  The nachos were covered in tender carne asada, and thankfully it's real shredded cheese over EVERY chip!  Not into that cheese whiz stuff on nachos.  The platter was big too!  More than enough for 2 to share.  The elote was good too but was a little light on the lime chile powder.  Gimme sour!  Gimme spicy!  Gimme gimme gimme!  Luckily the extra limes on the side provided an extra kick.  Next time I'm gonna tell them heavy on the chile powder!\n\nI probably ate more carbs than I should have that night - wonder if I was able to stay on KETO?  Service was speedy & friendly - the place was packed on a Friday night.  We'll visit Lindo again, maybe next time for their famous Fajita platters!
