On my way walking back from a eatery just down the way, I stumbled upon Jewelry & Minerals of Las Vegas enormous display of geodes outside the store and immediately wanted to go inside but they were closed for the evening.  Vowing to return the next day I got up early and took the bus down the strip and then walked the few blocks to the store.\n\nWOW WOW WOW is all I can say.  You walk in are overwhelmed in the first room, then you realize this place has 6 or 7 more rooms of minerals, rocks, formations, carvings - it was mind numbing!  I'm not a rock \/ mineral person but I sure can appreciate the size of this collection!  And then he took a few of us outside to show up this largest crystal sphere in the world along with many other large items which are also for sale but just too big to really fit into the store.  If my son had been with me, I'm not sure I'd ever gotten him out of this place w\/o dropping some serious cash! \n\nOn display and in the back room, they had some of the largest and most beautiful geodes I've every seen - this is museum quality stuff the likes of which I've never seen! \n\nI also have a friend back home, that if she ever got into this store, she may never exit as she's really into crystals!  \n\nI think I wondered around the store for 2 hours, taking photos, sending them back home to see if they were interested in me picking up something.   I'm still considering one of the larger geodes but I have to ensure I have just the right place to put it and with me remodeling the room, I'll have to wait until we are done before deciding. \n\nI highly recommend stopping in if you are in Vegas. Get off your butt and get down the strip for heaven's sake and oh by the way, there are two wonderful Thai eateries in the 900 block, just down the way you should also try.   \n\nNow, if you are really into crystals, then I'm sure you can feel this store.... even before you land!
