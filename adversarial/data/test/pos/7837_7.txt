Amazing place. Was greeted by a friendly maitre d upon entering and showed to my seat. The atmosphere was amazing and was pleasantly surprised to see that the angelic harp music I was hearing was actually a live person and not just a recording. The mix-ologist at the bar was very personable and quite knowledgeable about the selection of spirits on-hand and crafted me a beverage fit for the gods. Will visit again.
