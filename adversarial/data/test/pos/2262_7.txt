[First time Out-of-Towner for Spring Training]\n\nWe at the hotel, motel, Hooolidaaaay Innnnnn...\n\nOur temporary home away from home for five days and four nights. From the moment Megan picked us up at the airport to our drop off by Donte (?) our entire stay had been fantastic.\n\nThe free food and booze notwithstanding, the staff is amazing. Genuine, sweet, and beyond helpful. Seriously, management over here is doing a great job. Although they were as busy as can be, none of the employees acted rude or unprofessional. They all were welcoming every time you walked past the front desk or into the lobby. These guys exceeded every minimal expectation I was having for a Holiday Inn. Shout outs to Megan and Amie, the sweetest gals there - they even left me a personalized birthday (candy & booze) gift in my room. I can't say enough about the staff & the facility...we are already think of booking for Spring Training 2013!!\n\nTheir facility, as we were told, was recently remodeled with in the last year or so. The \"suite\" gives you an extra room with a TV, couch, and a desk, in addition to the room with two queen beds. This was plenty of room for us 3 girls. By no means was it fancy, but it was good enough. We had no complaints about the room and we appreciated the mini fridge and microwave to hold our leftovers and booze for the trip.\n\nFREE! FREE! FREE! Free breakfast every morning, weekends are a little later hours so you can get extra beauty sleep. Self serving coffee bar, an automatic pancake maker (they were gross), biscuits, gravy, eggs (or omelets) sausage or bacon, plethora of carbs, fruit, yogurt, and cereal. Plenty of options to keep you satisfied before you get your day started. Not once did we go out for breakfast...this little set-up was legit. As the day wears on and it hits 5PM, everyone rendezvous for another round of FREE stuff - HAPPY HOUR! Sutter Home stays in business from them, they pour full cups of this stuff - Chardonnay, White Zinfandel, or Cabernet. They have beer options and soda, both of which I never partook in. For snacks they have the Chex Party Mix BOLD flavor & a mini nacho bar - cheese, chips, jalapenos, and chili. As this weren't enough, in the evening they put out fresh baked cookies with a carafe of milk...all free for the taking! These items are not over the top, but they are free and filling, so this in itself is worth staying here!\n\nMy only complaint is their gym. For the remodel, they sure forgot about that lonely little room with two ancient treadmills, an elliptical, one jack-of-all-weight-lifting machines, and two medicine balls. NO free weights...even two would have been nice. The line the entire wall with a mirror, so everywhere you go, which his not far, you can check your technique. This was our only gripe and we didn't mind it that much, but it could have been better!\n\nThey really made our stay enjoyable and were really helpful to AZ  newbie's! Not only that, but they shuttled our butts all over town, in a 3 mile radius of course. Annnd, they picked our butts back up when we needed it before 10PM. Seriously, it was all the small things they did that makes them such a great place to stay!\n\nNot all Holiday Inn's should be judged equally...fact!!
