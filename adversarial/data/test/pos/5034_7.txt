Everybody knows the middle child syndrome.  Not the first born with all the privileges, and not the baby of the house that gets all the attention.  Sherway is that.  The middle child screaming for attention.  They are undergoing heavy reno's and adding premier stores.  No matter how much pomp, pageantry and fanfare, it's still like putting lipstick on a pig.\n\nYorkdale is one of the sibling with all the super boutiques and Square One is the other.  Which is older or younger is up to you.\n\nSherway is fine if you happen to need something and if you are nearby.  Don't get me wrong, the place is nice...it was nicer years ago when it was a shiny boutique place and now it's just another wannabe.\n\nIt has all the \"me too\" stores but does have a good selection of restaurants - no...not the food court area - outside and attached to the mall.\n\nAll in all, the constant construction and parking annoyances makes it tough to love but at least it's not as crazy busy as the siblings.\n\nCheers.
