My first trip to NYC was magical. It was foodie heaven. One of my most favorite meals was at Shake Shack in Madison Square Park. Now it's here in Vegas and off the strip! How awesome is that?!\n\nMushroom lovers, the shack stack is a must try! It is a breaded portobello mushroom with warm melted cheese in a cheeseburger. Warning: it's a lot of cheese, but in a good way of you really like cheese. Negatives: the priciest of all the burgers. Some people can't justify paying that much, but for me it was well worth it to relive that original Shake Shack experience. Plus it saves me a plane ticket. \n\nVegetarians, the 'shroom burger is a great choice also. Basically, the same as mentioned above minus the beef patty. Love this option on my non-meat days. \n\nDo you like a little heat and a little sweet? Bacon? I think I have your attention now. I highly recommend the the SmokeShack, which has chopped cherry peppers and applewood smoked bacon. It's so tasty! Definitely, a man's burger. My husband gets this every time! Also, available as a double (patty). \n\nTruthfully, you might be disappointed with the ShackBurger. It was not bad at all, just not memorable. I would rather spend a little more for the ShackStack or the SmokeShack. \n\nThe crinkle cut fries here are okay, but I recommend the cheese fries over plain fries. The cheese adds some extra oomph in the flavor department. \n\nWhat I love about Shake Shack is the quality ingredients. Although, burgers are on the small side it doesn't bother me. I'm full after one burger and sharing fries.  Pricy overall, but it's a nice splurge. Honestly, Shake Shack is not really comparable to other burger joints out there. \n\nWith desserts and cold treats nearby, I usually skip the shakes and concretes. I've sampled some before and they were delicious and extremely smooth. Look out for limited edition flavors that rotate weekly \/ seasonal!\n\n\n*****Yelp 2016 100 review challenge*****\n7\/100
