I've been here several times to pray with the monks, even though its in a language I don't understand. They will provide you a book that gives English translation. My most recent trip was with my Thai friend, celebrating a special Buddha day. An hour of chanting prayer, 20 minutes of silent meditation, another 30 minutes of chanting prayer, and then holding flowers and candles we chanted another 15 minutes before going outside and circling the buildings 3 times. I have no idea what we did, but it was pretty cool. \n\nThis Monastery is very well kept, clean, and has a nice outside area for meditation as well. At the end of every month they also hold the now famous Food Festival, where the proceeds go to the Monastery for their expenses. \n\nI'm not Buddhist, but I enjoy learning about other religions and their customs. For the most part they all teach a basic lesson, to love, and to respect. Sometimes makes me wonder why our world has gotten away from these simple values. They will welcome you here, and help guide you.\n\nOpen to the public for prayers\/meditation from 9-10am, 2-3pm, and 5-6pm. Located off S. Rainbow past Warm Springs, turn right after O'Reilly's Auto parts store.
