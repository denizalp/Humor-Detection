I have nothing against a good dive. In fact, a good dive on its own may get an extra star just because it's not a fast casual restaurant. Place it next to a topless joint and that alone may be enough to put it in the running for five stars.\n\nIn this case, however, maybe not so much.\n\nFirst, finding your way into Hinson's isn't easy. It's not difficult, but it's not as simple as it could be. Then, as with the infamous Asian Corner Mall, you may need to check your alignment afterwards.\n\nSecond, the hours are not exactly regular, and the signage doesn't help. Typically you see a building with lit neon and you think \"open\". Not always the case here. They are supposedly open at 11am most days (they are not open Monday). At least one day, however, we came by and they weren't open when they \"should have been\". No explanation - just no one there. It wasn't even the typical July 4 week that some small companies take off. Just nobody around.\n\nIf you do happen to get by when they are there, the inside isn't much to look at (there is an inside, in comparison to say Brooks). Staff is friendly, if not overly welcoming. Food is decent, but not exceptional.\n\nNow what makes them a \"drive in\"? Nothing, really. Apparently they used to be a drive-in (think South 21 on Independence near Uptown), but since Independence\/Highway 74 grew, they don't do that these days. Frankly, this cinder block building doesn't look much like it could have ever supported a drive-in. But that's neither here nor there, just a tidbit of information I found interesting.
