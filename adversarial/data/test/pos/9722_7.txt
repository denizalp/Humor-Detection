Decided to take a road trip from south Scottsdale and have dinner downtown.  Within walking distance of our next stop, District fit the bill.  I was really impressed with the design of the restaurant.  Great windows, lots of trees, inside and out, nice patio complete with a hungry kitty I spotted.  I was surprised by the lack of customers on Saturday night, but it was Halloween.\n\nI decided to try something new and not have a meal before the meal, so we skipped appetizers.  They do serve bread before the meal, but it's just a standard dinner roll that really should be served warm, but isn't.  \n\nFor my entree, I had the cedar roasted salmon with risotto.  The salmon was served on the plank with crispy shallots.  The preparation was simple, no special sauce or anything, but the fish was cooked perfectly.  The risotto was filled with shrimp, asparagus, and parmesan cheese.  Although maybe just a little on the salty side, it was delicious.  My husband had the lobster pot pie.  When it's presented, you will think it's ginormous, but it's really just the puffed pastry.  Once you pop it, it's a manageable portion.\n\nWe opted to share a dessert and went with pecan pie spring rolls.  These, too, were served on a plank with a caramel dipping sauce and bourbon chantilly.  Quite good, although I thought the plank made it awkward to share this dessert.  And speaking of sharing, you may want to ask about portion size before opting to share.  Our dessert was three small rolls that was perfect to share if you just want a little something sweet.  But if you expect to completely indulge, might want to order your own.  Unless, you're going to stick with the complimentary cotton candy at the end of the meal.  If they had a carousel out front, you could save a lot and skip the fair!\n\nAs far as service, it is a little slow.  But it's slow as in \"relax and enjoy your evening\" slow, not \"where the hell is my stinkin' food\" slow.  And the server did ask if we had a theater performance to catch, so it appears they make the effort to ensure you're out on time.\n\nDefinitely worth coming to again sometime!
