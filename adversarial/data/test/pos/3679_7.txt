*This review is for a mani\/pedi walk-in May 10*\n\nI find this place is a hit and miss. I went for a mani last week and it was great. One nail was splitting a bit (I work at Starbucks which is so harsh on the hands) and she took care of it really well. \n\nThis time, however, I got virtually no hand or foot massage, more like a 5-sec rub for each. Foot file also wasn't used. I removed my own calluses at home with my own file but the whole point was to pay someone else to do that!! Also, if you're a walk-in, they don't tell you the approximate wait time. They'll keep you waiting while you are soaking and manis are not done at the same time as pedis.\n\nSoooo... back to Cozy Nails I go.
