Anyone who has seen the painting I created at The Wine Palette knows that I am not terribly artistic.  But the place is cool - most especially because you can bring your own bottle of (whatever your drink of choice), and that makes the painting process that much better.\n\nThe lead painter is not Bob Ross - but give him a few years and he could sport an afro that looks something like him.  Your group chooses a picture, and you are gently lead through recreating that picture one color group at a time.\n\nIf you have chosen the boat on the water, you first paint the water, then the sky and finally the boat.  Easy, right?  Wait until you check out mine.  The process is generally relaxing - at least as you mix the colors to create the water.  When you add in the details is when it gets a little more hair- (and glass-) raising, but that is when the fun really begins.\n\nDefinitely much more fun for the group than alone, unless you want to keep your artistic ability to yourself.
