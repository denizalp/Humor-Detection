This place is relatively close to where I work so I might stop by here occasionally when I feel like a doughnut\/muffin\/danish or something sweet to drink like a frozen lemonade, fruit smoothie, or an ice cappuccino. I'm not a big coffee drinker so will rarely have a coffee here. On top of that, there is free coffee where I work which is another reason why I rarely purchase coffee on a work day.\n\nThis Tim Hortons is close to McGill University so there will be a lot of university students ordering and hanging around.\n\nThere is free WiFi. The line-ups can be long so if you must leave in under 15 minutes, this might not be the place for you but then if you really want something at Tim Hortons, there are at least two other Tim Hortons with generally shorter lines (one inside Promenades Cathedrale and another Tim Hortons at the McGill metro near Pizza Soleil and a tailor or dry cleaning shop) within a 7 minute walk from this place.\n\nAs a few other reviewers mentioned, people have gotten their items stolen while eating\/ordering at this Tim Hortons so you should be very careful and even though seats\/tables might be or get scarce or your bag may be heavy, don't \"reserve\" your table\/seat by putting your bag or items unattended while you order. Also, when you are enjoying your food\/drink at the table\/booth, keep your eyes on your personal belongings.\n\nI've ordered things here to go and I've also ordered things here and eaten inside. Other than the long wait to order and to get my order, I've never had any real issues.
