This place is DELICIOUS!\n\nI had their Whole Hog Skillet with extra ham, and their Wild Berry Cakes.\nIncredible.  So good.  \n\nService is great ... the patio is great ... it's all great.\n\nThe only thing in my opinion that keeps it from being 5 stars is that you can't do a \"call-ahead\" or make reservations.  Lines can get very very long, which can be annoying.\n\nAll in all though, it's worth the wait.  ENJOY!
