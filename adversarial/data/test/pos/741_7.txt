Executive elite status makes renting a car here as easy as can be.  Walk up, pick a car, drive to the kiosk and leave.  Service here is always friendly and this week with the temps above 110 they were handing out cold bottles of water.\n\nDuring peak times like spring training they can run out of cars, so hope you like that minivan.  Otherwise, the only issue is the speed walkers trying to beat you to that Suv you just spotted.  Hurry!
