Wow! I went here in a party of 8 and was seated at a window side table with a gorgeous view of the remarkable Bellagio fountains! The view was amazing, the restaurant's decor was extremely elegant with a modern touch and the ambiance was superb. My dining experience here was amazing and let me tell you why... \n\n1.) Appetizers set the bar super high for the coming meal\nFor those who love raw stuff-\n*We started with two large Seafood Platters. Served in an elegant setting that had the oysters, lobster, crab, prawns, mussel and clams over ice. Underneath the setting was another bowl that was conveniently placed (yet still hidden) for the shells. Everything in the seafood platter was extremely fresh and of great quality. I'm usually not a fan of oysters but these oysters were to die for. Alongside the sauces which include: cocktail, horseradish, and vinegar, *dont forget to ask your waiter for melted butter and Tabasco* best and most fresh seafood platter I have ever indulged in!\n*The Steak Tartare and Carpaccio was another great choice that we started our meal. Served with Tarragon Aioli and Grilled Crostini, I highly recommend this especially if you are drinking wine.\n\n2.) I think the Steaks are made in heaven\n*The filet Mignon, medium rare, melts in your mouth. The steak cut so easily and was tenderly moist. It was perfectly seasoned and charred on the outside but exactly medium rare on the inside just how I like and wanted. It was served with a zesty roasted green chili, perfect to change up your palate.\n*The bone in rib eye steak was just as tasty! Seasoned more than the filet Mignon and a little more \"fatty\" I would recommend this for those who like their steaks more flavorful. This too melted in my mouth!\n\n3.) The sides are small and properly portioned \n*The glazed market mushrooms and truffle mashed potatoes were my favorite but I also was able to taste the creamed spinach and steamed asparagus. The mushrooms and mashed potatoes are a must order! I'm just glad they we're small portions or else I would've eaten all the sides and wouldn't have room for the main course! \n\n4.) The service was amazing!\n*i wish I remembered our waiters name but he was awesome, I wish I could give him credit. After a couple of martinis, I forgot to ask. He was attentive, personable and funny. The dining experience definitely would not be the same without him and the incredible staff.
