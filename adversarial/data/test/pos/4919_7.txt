Tiny tiny little Starbucks with a ton of customers this Saturday morning. The line moved fairly quick though and service was good. I think my drink order was the longest string of words I've said so far at a Starbucks: grande iced peppermint white chocolate mocha with coconut milk no whip. Try saying that 5 times fast!
