Not a bad spot to check out at all. Great place to drop by and grab a quick lunch if you are in the area. \n\nThe location has plenty of parking and serves thier buffet from 11-4:30 for lunch, which is great if you are running late for lunch during the week.  They offer many of the familar basics and the food is brought out pretty consistently.  The flavors are good, not great and not very spicy. Most items are mild, which is probably done so that it can suit more people.  I am used to most being at least medium.  The location has comfortable seating and lots of it. They are attentive and it is very clean. They have both meat and vegetarian options as well and they are served on separate parts of the buffet.  \n\nCheck them out if you are nearby and if you have never tried indian food because you are worried it's too spicy, this may be a good place to give it a try.
