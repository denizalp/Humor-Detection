You like Chips and Salsa? You like a family restaurant? You like a clean bar scene? Well this is the Mexican restaurant to try. Opened forever they have drawn families and foodies for years. They have an authentic menu with a variety of options for all Mexican food lovers to try. My favorite is there Fajitas or the Carna Asada. This is a kids friendly restaurant.
