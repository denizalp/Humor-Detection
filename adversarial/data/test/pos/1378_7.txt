On a whim I ended up here on a Saturday night. The lady and I were enjoying the zombie walk when we all of a sudden decided to top off the already romantic evening with a date at Bianco's. Believe it or not, we waited less than an hour for a table. That being said, I wasn't wasted when I finally got to my pizza and I wasn't a pissed off\/hungry food nazi waiting to hate every bite. I was completely neutral going in.\n\nWe ordered some bread and olives to start, and they were both tasty! I would have preferred some kalamatas but the olives we received were good enough. The bread was great, and with a little bit of olive oil and salt, it was even better. As for pizzas, we ordered a Sonny Boy and a half Wiseguy, half Rosa. The Rosa was good. The rosemary and pistachios really went well with each other. The Wiseguy (the pizza that I thought would be my favorite) was just okay. The sausage had fennel in each chew, and the onions were a nice touch, but there wasn't that pop of flavor like I got from each bite of the Rosa. It's important for fancy pizza in my opinion. And, last but not least, there was the Sonny Boy. This pizza was definitely my favorite of the three. The salami, the cheeses and the olives went perfectly with one another! Those first few chews were the highlight of my visit to the pizzeria. I would order that pizza again in a heartbeat.\n\nMy bottom line...? It's good. Period. I'm not sure that I'd want to wait for 3+ hours to eat there (that's silly considering all the other great pizza places not too far from there), but if the same kind of situation that I had my first visit came about, I could see myself returning to Pizzeria Bianco.
