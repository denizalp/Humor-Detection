Second part for Shirley B birthday party week. I got excited again too be trying out someplace new one that rave all about the Faming Fajitas. Need say more its all in the name of the restaurant. I never ordered the Flaming Fajitas. I felt like constant bonfires going off every five mins looking around the restaurant. So really hard not too order the star or show stopper but thankfully bunch of us so got too watch the show up close. I heard about looked and smelled great everyone said that it was really good. \n\nWhat I did order was the Carne Asada Burrito. I loved it! The portion size is huge. I know its mexican restaurant so that really should not come as shocker. I felt like you got nice portion of rice and beans. Not only the size but everything on the plate had great flavors and really really good. The Carne Asada meat by itself was fabulous! The thing was the burrito was packed with meat more meat and went with the red not green chili.  The meat was nice, moist, well seasoned, and use base carne asada any style taco, burrito, or whatever be in Carne Asada heaven. The rice and refried beans had nice flavor. Sometimes go mexican restaurant taste very bland or feel like out of can. I felt like both sides freshly made each day. The guacamole was nice. \n\nThe chips and salsa start up with highly ADDICTING. The chips were nice, Hot, fresh and crispy. The salsa too the warm bean dip. Be warned might want too take it easy on the chips before your meal. No room for entree.\n\nThe service was awesome. We brought in two different desserts from outside businesses. They still more then happy too keep them refrigerated in the back until we finish with dinner. Missing candles they found two candles for us. The whole they never raised stink eye about us bringing outside stuff. The staff guess birthday they sing happy birthday and the birthday person gets too wear sambrero. We slowly but in time we all showed. I felt like they never rushed us too turn over our big table. Never empty glass of beverage or chips on our table the whole night. They more then happy too split our checks. Talk about reasonable family friendly prices. It been while since went too mexican restaurant but here at Juan Flaming Fajitas one that see coming back many more times.!!!!!!
