Came here today where there were only 5 tables only. 2 tables eating.\n\n As i sat down and ordered laksa and spicy fermented tofu we were both eager to just eat! As we waited the place filled up very fast! We noticed that other people that came before us were getting appetizers and some even their meal! Im like this is weird since we ordered at least 10 mins before them. My laksa camr but the fermented soup hasnt... And we waited and waited... And as the table beside us got their whole meal before us being apps and both entree it just got seriously ridiculous!  I asked the server how long for the other soup, and she said 5more mins since we are busy.... In my head we ordered and got here first before most of the tables! The last dish came, we both really were just frustrated and just wanted to get this meal over with.... Both dish were good in flavor but theres no customer service and theres no management in this restaurant.\n\nWe also noticed that other tables at least 4 were having the same problem 1 entree for a couple ..\n\nMake a reservation, biggest tip it gets full fast. Tables are seated really closed to each other too. \nThe smell is awful if your not a fan of stinky tofu. \nTo the management, you guys should have a system here, seems like the staff is running with no heads. And dropping food to wrong tables. \n\nOh btw they gave me two bills, when i asked for my bill, 2 servers two different bill.
