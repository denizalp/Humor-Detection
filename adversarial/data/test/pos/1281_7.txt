This REI is a nice store in a nice location. REI caters to the majority of outdoors activities. I come here a lot to browse the climbing gear. Climbing wise the selection is small but that being said there are some quality products. There is also a good variety of outdoor clothing. Price wise REI is expensive compared to other places, many which are online, but in case of emergency and you can't wait for shipping REI does the job. \n\nMy biggest and main issue with this location is the staff. I am a frequent customer here and the staff have all seen me numerous times. But for some reason every staff member asks me if I am an REI member. As soon as I walk in instead of a \"hello sir how are you doing today\" I get asked \"Are you an REI member?\" or do you know about our membership program? When I am looking at gear the staff come by and ask if I am a member instead of asking me if I need any help or have any questions. When I try on climbing shoes I only get asked if I am a member. I don't mind being asked once or twice if I am a member but if that's the only form of customer service I get then that is unacceptable. Every single employee asks me the same question every single time I enter the store. \n\nBesides the pushy sales people REI is great for your outdoor needs and it is always fun to stop in and browse. If you are not a member though odds are you will either be brainwashed into paying $20 for the memebership, it is a one time fee though and will pay off if you shop there more than once or twice but if not don't waste $20 no matter how pushy they are.
