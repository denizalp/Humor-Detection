Came here to get robbed and watch Tiesto's dj set. Loooooved his set. But I am not impressed at how crowded it gets, how little you can see and how expensive it is...\n\n$11 for a small 330ml water.\n$25 for a single vodka and mixer. That's a single measure... \n\nDress code is different per event, however, pay close attention to it. You will be turned away if you do not comply.\n\nVery strict on ID for entry. \n\nGlad we went, but will never go again!
