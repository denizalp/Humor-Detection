if only I could give zero star or negative 2 star. the worst consumer service ever!!! the taxi took us through the longer route. when I tried to call another taxi to return back to my hotel, the coustomer service representative was impatient, and literally hung up on me. Try to avoid this taxi company all time! such a ripped off with shitty attitude and sucky coustomer service. with such an amount of money I paid I could get way better treatment with other companies.
