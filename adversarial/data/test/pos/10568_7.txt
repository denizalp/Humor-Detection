Brand new BBQ spot in my hood. Wanted to really like them as all employees were nice. However they have some big kinks they need to work out. \nPros: the beans are legit, the two sauces are quite bomb as well. I would go back and buy the sauce if they sold it. \nCons: I ordered a two meat platter. The chicken and brisket. Both were cold not luke warm, cold. The brisket was smaller chunks of brisket that he cut down to order. Problem is it was way overcooked. And the fat was white from the temp being so off. With BBQ fat is flavor but I couldn't eat cold white fat. The flavor was decent and has potential if they can get their temps right. The chicken was dry. Like got left out for a couple hours dry. I had to pour two containers of sauce on it to make it doable. No seasoning of any kind didn't get smoke or anything just dry bland chicken. The cornbread was dry as well. And it wasn't warmed up it was just pulled out of a Tupperware container and handed to me. So dry and cold bread had my coughing and sucking back iced tea. I would maybe give them another shot in a couple months for the beans and brisket but those were only two that I'd touch again. One of the people with me did say the cole slaw was creamy and good. After having Lil Miss BBQ and some other local spots this just doesn't come close, at all.
