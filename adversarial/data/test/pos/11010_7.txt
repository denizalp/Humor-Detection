Time for an update: I've concluded that Lon's is one of my top restaurants in the valley!! I absolutely love the ambiance, the service, the food, everything except the price. Haha but definitely worth it!! \n\nI had to bring my hubby here because he's never been even though I've dined here twice. We decided to make reservations for date night around 5:30p. It was the perfect weather at the perfect restaurant. We had to wait a few minutes to be seated because we were early so we sat at the patio and I ordered a painkiller while hubby ordered a beer. The painkiller was refreshing and we were finally seated outdoors. Live music started playing and it was so romantic, I felt like I was in a movie.\n\nWe ordered the calamari, the pork special (split), and the truffle Mac and cheese. Oh my - everything was decadent! The calamari had the perfect seasoning, the pork special had so much flavor and ingredients that went well together, and the Mac and cheese was cooked perfectly (not too hard and not too soft). We were so full that we skipped dessert.\n\nCheck came to $87 - if you split a plate, they will charge you $5. Service was great and it was a great date night!!
