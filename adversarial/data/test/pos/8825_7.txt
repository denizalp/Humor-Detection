Is there an age limit for those who shop at Urban? I hope not because it's too much fun to browse the store and I don't want another birthday to keep me from visiting. \n\nI have been a consistent shopper of Urban since my college days at U of A. At first, it was because the U of A campus only had limited stores for me to shop within walking distance of my dorm. Then they became the store with a strong variety of dresses and perfect gag gifts and off the beaten path knick knacks. When I finished college and moved to Phoenix, I would do the occasional visit if I was on Mille. But then when they opened up a store at the Waterfront, I was sold and came to the conclusion that I could still enter without feeling too old. \n\nMoving on the Urban, it's part of the Anthropologie chain so if you like the look of Anthro but can't quick make it to their prices, you can visit Urban where the clothing is similar but a bit trendier and cheaper. They have the best gag gifts out there including inappropriate ones sitting right next to the game you haven't played since you were eight. And since some of the shoppers are eight, then this is their haven. The clothes are funky and fun. You can go the traditional route or you can get as trendy as you want in just one visit. They have adorable shoes and accessories and I love the housing decorations they sell. \n\nUrban is a great store to visit when looking to make a whimsical purchase, find a deal on some clothes (they have awesome sales), purchase a trendy outfit or simply browse and waste some time when it's too hot to stand outside.
