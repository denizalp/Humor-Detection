Staying in a local hotel, I found that there was an IKEA down the street which means, they have the food court! Its an exact mirror image of any other IKEA i've been to in the US. Pasta\/sauce\/5 meatballs and a bread bun for 10.30, can't beat that price. The food area was very clean and I always saw workers bring back the food tray carriers and empty them in back. Still reminds me of being back in Europe.
