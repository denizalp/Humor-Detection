Good but not great would be the way to sum up my experiences at Great Dane's.\n\nYes, they serve Chicago style, genuine Vienna Beef hotdogs, but despite what anyone claims, these are not rare and can be found almost everywhere. Plus, despite the fact that they may be \"Chicago\" style, they are kind of wimpy little dogs.\n\nUnlike others, I've never had an issue with the service here, so they get credit for that.\n\nBut mostly, it's just the dated atmosphere that drives me batty. The building itself is built in that faux-Danish style that was popular in the 60's and 70's and this place feels like it hasn't been updated since. From the wood benches to the lousy AM radio station playing in the background, it feels like you've entered a time warp. In fact, if you wanted to turn this into a bar, it could be the Regal Beagle from Three's Company. \n\nWhat I'd love to see would be the owners either embracing the retro theme and including it in the menu, decorations, or overall atmosphere or just partnering up with local schools and becoming the hangout for junior high and high school kids in the area, like one of those classic malt shops or diners you see in TV shows.\n\nFor now though it's a decent place to get a hot dog, but nothing all that great.
