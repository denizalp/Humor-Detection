This is a really cute business.  It's basically a baby Whole Foods or Earth Fare - everything available is somewhere high up on the \"crunchy\" spectrum.  Lots of nursing supplies and peripherals - pumps, wraps, pillows, creams - but organic formulas too.  For older kids, Earth's Best food, non pvc\/bpa feeding supplies. Some toys, lots of lotions and ointments and cleaning products.  The star attraction in my opinion is the massive cloth diaper selection.  I have not been able to find such a variety of CDs in any brick-and-mortar store in Charlotte.  They had a half off sale on Kissas products when I came by so I finally bought some fitteds - I'm more of a pocket girl. They have disposables as well, 7th Generation and Naty.  \nThere are a few needs they don't fill - safety products for one, and they have only a few toys. It's very much a \"grocery\" oriented store.\nThe price point is higher. There's no escaping that in a store of this kind.  But they do seem to have some good sales and they have a reward program - spend so much, get a bit in never-expiring \"babybucks\" for a future purchase.  It's not terribly far from BBB and BRU, so if your green needs aren't satisfied there, check this place out.
