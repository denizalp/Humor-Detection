I'm not Vietnamese. Hell, I'm not even Asian. I dated a couple Asian girls once. Had to break up with Suki when I bought the Porsche because she got tired of sitting on Kimmy's lap. It was a two-seater.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that I know what good Vietnamese food tastes like and they serve it here. \n\n20% off appetizers before 7 pm makes it feel like you're stealing from these folks but they are cool with it.
