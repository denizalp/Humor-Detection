I can't believe I haven't reviewed B&W! Wow. Well here comes a 5 star review:\n~Fud\/Drink~\nThe food here is honestly OK. It admittedly is overpriced and I rarely eat here because its just not worth the $ amount unless you are about to keel over from lack of food. Otherwise, eat elsewhere. If you must eat here, the best bang for your buck is to split with your date (if on one) the Ramen Burger everyone raves about. I have had it, it's pretty good...not great...good! Aside from that the drinks set this place apart.\n\nHonestly, just go up to the bar each time you want a drink. If you are on a date, get a seat at the bar. If you can't, wait for a spot to open up. I will tell you all right now, the bartenders here can mix anything up together, just go directly to them and don't order from the waitress ever. For example: I was on a date with the most gorgeous girl on this planet, and I asked her what she'd like in a drink: something fizzy, sweet, and with pineapple. Boom, relayed this to the bartender and in about 8 minutes he concocted this amazing and tasty drink (I tried a quick sip). She was happy. I was happy she was happy. And of course, I was happiest because I had an amazing Old Fashioned to kick back with. Once again folks, the barkeeps here will make your night, no matter your drink of choice...I guarantee it. This is my #1 go-to spot for a hand craft drink in town, hands down. BTW: If you go anywhere else in metro Phoenix for an Old Fashioned, you are just being silly.\n\n~Service\/Atmosphere~ \nThe bartenders are great, personable, fast, and extremely knowledgeable on what they are doing. I do not like the waitresses taking my order, its just not the way I do my drinks in general. They do a great job getting your order in, no doubt...but the quality of my drink was lacking the one time I came here and ordered with the waitress. The atmosphere is outstanding as well, quaint and trendy with an old school feel to it. The old school style inside of an old office building is a perfect setting for a good old fashioned mixology bar. It is anything but your typical dive or drunk's bar... it is classy, as are their drinks and service.\n\n~The Downlow\/Extras~\nNot much more to point out...Check out their list of options before ordering, because you might want to pick and choose which base liquors you try that night. There are so many varieties it allows for you to play around and see what you may or may not enjoy. Overall 5 stars goes out for the consistency, great location in downtown phoenix, amazing bartenders, abundant options of liquor, and classy atmosphere. This is my top spot to enjoy a drink with your special someone...You shouldn't take every girl here gents, only the good one's ;-) ENJOY!
