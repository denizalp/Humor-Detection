I waited for this restaurant to open so decided to try it for a TO GO lunch.  I do not eat sushi so ordered the Chicken Teriyaki.  It was terrible.  Their version of teriyaki is not good.  The chicken was so dry and it was not teriyaki.  I took a menu but threw it in the trash.  It was a waste of $10.  Need I say, I will never return.
