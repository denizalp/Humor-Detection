Chin's is probably one of the funniest China joints around. \n\nThe couple who own it are really awesome and will even fight in front of customers (but only if you're a regular, I think). This only adds to the charm of Chin's. \n\nThe decor is straight ridiculous. Deep red patterned wallpaper and wood paneling. The booths and chairs are all a nice matching red leather as well. Fish tank complete with algae caking the sides. There is also a \"Lounge\" attached with some seriously cool black and white patterned wallpaper. It's almost goth and I kinda want it for my own home. Sadly, it sold out in 1970something. \n\nThe food here is pretty good. It's better than most other Chinese restaurants in the area that I've tried so far. I really love their soup and they make the craziest chicken wings that are battered and fried and go straight to your ass, I'm sure. Heavenly though, really. And the hot oil they give you? HOTTT. \n\nThe service is great, maybe a bit slow for some, but I never mind that. I hate to feel rushed in a restaurant. Everything they serve is fresh... so you'll have that.
