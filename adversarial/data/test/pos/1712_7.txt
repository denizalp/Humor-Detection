3.5* rounded up, because the staff here is always super nice to us, often when long lines full of the Tuk's most impatient people are having complete meltdowns. The lines can get long, particularly later in the evening, but we never cease to be amazed at the full on fits adults will pitch over waiting in line. \n\nAnyway, their prices can be high, and they don't carry Boar's Head cold cuts - important for Scott because they offer low and no sodium options, and for me because I'm picky AF - but I do like their produce and it is close. They do have good sales and reward programs can save you $$ on gas. \n\nI've seen some people bemoaning the lack of self check out option here: Scott uses them often, but they never work for me. Ever. I'm just a girl standing in front of the self check outs elsewhere begging them to work and trying not to weep ;) \n\nScott was deeply entrenched in their Monopoly game for a while, and the workers were nice about subbbing out items they never seemed to have. Also, other customers have approached him and offered their game pieces as he zips around on his scooter shopping. So sweet! \n\nFinally, their flowers are very nice. No, really! Scott buys bouquets for me frequently, and they last a long time. The roses come with a five day guarantee and have lasted almost two weeks at times. When my Mom comes, we buy dozens of flowers, and she can never believe they are \"supermarket flowers!\" The ladies who work in floral make custom arrangements, and there are usually some attractive grab-and-go options in the cooler if DIY isn't your jam. \n\nIn all, it is a close by, has a Starbucks, is a well stocked store with kind employees: we won't let grown ups throwing hissy fits over a line deter us!\n\n* they sell lottery tickets @ Customer Service Desk, and have a machine * \n\n** Redbox inside ** \n\n*** deli & meat\/seafood counters close early *** \n\n**** floral makes custom orders and has grab and go in fridge at various price points ****
