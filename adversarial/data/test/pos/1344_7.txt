Deagan's served sour milk to our one and two year-old children.\n\nOur waitress apologized and explained that the milk had an expiration date of July 4th...we were there on July 10!!  Not much consolation two the two young customers who were extremely unhappy about their drinks. \n\nNeedless to say the entire experience left a sour taste in our mouths.\n\nDeagan's WAS one of our go-to family friendly restaurants.  Obviously, the lack of food quality has taken them off the list.
