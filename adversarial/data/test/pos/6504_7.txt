We had just visited The National Atomic Testing Museum only to realize this place is just across the street. Even though the lunch buffet was only open for another 45 minutes we couldn't resist!\n\nI tried just about every hot dish that was out and I have to say that most were too spicy. But I did find a few that weren't and they were absolutely delicious! The Paneer Tikka Masala was probably my favorite, but the Vegetable Korma and Chicken Tandoori were great as well! \n\nThey also offer a little salad bar and some desserts. The naan is brought to the table fresh - you even have a choice between plain or garlic!\n\nI will definitely return soon!
