Waiter: So what would you like? \nMe: I want a happy ending with harry potter. \nWaiter: (Straight face) Would you also like a man whore with that? \n\nAt any other place, I would probably get some weird look or a slap in the face; however, at Yama Sushi, I just get a big smile. So one of my friends recommended this AYCE sushi place to me in Vegas. At first I was extremely skeptical, considering the closest ocean to Vegas is about 6 or 7 hours away. However, when I came in and saw the huge menu, I was completely caught off guard at the quality and the selection. Addtionally, I love the back side to the menu where they have Yama's rolls which all have the most interesting names.\n\nNormal sushi: \nTuna\/ yellowtail\/ albacore sashimi- awesome\nOctopus\/ squid sashimi- Not so much, too chewy for my taste \nSea urchin- Tastes very fishy, not my taste, but some of our group loved it. \n\nYama's specialty rolls:  \nHarry potter- It's like a garlic tempura roll- pretty awesome \nHappy ending- It's a tuna roll with lemon- Really tangy \nMan whore- It's like a Philly cheese roll- No one should ever mix cream cheese with sushi. \nHot night- Very spicy- But pretty good as well\nWho's your daddy- It's okay. \n\nDessert: \nGreen tea ice cream- awesome \nMango mochi- awesome \nRed bean ice cream- tastes like candy \n\nAll of this only cost me $27 with tip. FREAKING AMAZING, TALK ABOUT HAVING A HAPPY ENDING. Even though we had to wait for an hour it was worth it! My only gripe is the sushi isn't the most fresh and most of the rolls are hit or miss, but the selection makes up for it. Best AYCE sushi in Vegas hands down. \n\nUnfortunately, since it's an AYCE I can't ask for a happy ending to go ;D.
