There are things I love about Butcher...but that upstairs bartender is truly an ass.  I've dealt with him on 3 separate occasions where he was just blatantly rude to a degree I have never experienced in the service industry.  Openly mocking me and treating me so terribly that my date told him flat out he's being a dick.  He was nice to my date for the rest of the evening but not me.  We were going to stay for the rest of the night b\/c we love the cocktails there but he absolutely ruined our moods so we left and went elsewhere.  I ended up paying for the meal so his being nice to my date was fruitless for him because, for the first time in my life, I gave well below my standard 30% tip.  \n\nI normally would not have gone on this rant publicly and figured that, perhaps, he just remembered me those three times and I 'rubbed him the wrong way', but just yesterday my friend told me about a nearly identical experience she had with him.  I spoke to another friend of mine and the, \"oh, the asshole Asian guy?!\" response says this is just his method of operation.  He deters us from wanting to return.  If he hates serving people drinks so much he should seek employment in another field.
