4 stars for their Chicken Pakora Appetizer.\n\nEverything else was a bit too salty and greasy. Love the concept of Hakka Indian Food. It's a cozy joint. Nothing fancy here. Chili sauces are on each table. Menu items are reasonably priced. If you enjoy spicy food, you will appreciate the dishes here. If they could just tone down the amount of oil when cooking and salt, it would be a solid 4 stars for me. \n\nEmployees are friendly and quick. I appreciate that my Aunt brought us here.
