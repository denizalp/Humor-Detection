We have been coming to Luna for over 20 years. We even had them catered our wedding 20 years ago. I always referred to Luna as 'my happy place'. We were there around 6pm Thursday (5\/18). Salsa was different... not in a good way. Watery. Our server spent much of our visit talking to the table next to us... even our girl that fills chips and salsa spent 10 minutes chatting with same table. We ordered quesadilla and mini taco basket, 1\/2 chicken and 1\/2 beef. When the server brought our tacos and I asked about the quesadilla, he said 'oops'... It came out 5 minutes later, burnt on the edges and only 1\/2 on the tray. When I started eating my last chicken taco, I noticed the meat was a huge chunk instead of shredded. When I picked it out of the taco, it broke apart and revealed the meat was grey. I would normally chalk one bad visit up to a bad night, but several of my friends commented that their recent experiences have been horrible as well. I'm so sad... my favorite go-to has declined enough that we won't be back. I will miss their Pollo Fundido.. always was my favorite. I hope management realizes your loyal customers have noticed that downward trend.
