I have only been to Georges Brasserie for happy hour so I can't comment on their full menu or service but as far as happy hour goes, It's always a happy hour indeed. \n\nWe have tried the mussels with chorizo, the steak with pommes frites, their oysters and the crispy Brussels leaves with a fantastic balsamic drizzle. Everything has tasted so great each time we order it and for the fact that each dish is either $1, $5, or $7, it is a lot of food. The mussels are some of my favorite, it is a huge bowl of mussels with a great broth, tons of chorizo, and their bread is fantastic. The steak is enough for two to share, cooked well and with delicious pommes frites. \n\nIf you only get one thing off my list, the crispy brussels leaves is where it is at. They are cooked perfectly and the balsamic drizzle is 'lick the plate' delicious. We actually got a second order because we each wanted our own, that's how good they were. \n\nThe oyster deal is pretty great too considering their usual cost and they also have a few drink specials, though we usually just get wine. All in all, I really like GB for Happy Hour and have actually wanted to come for a full dinner (review to follow).  The service is always great near the bar, the food comes out quickly, and we leave happy. If you're looking for a good happy hour, add GB to your list!
