Ginormous CVS\n\nStopped by each morning of my business trip, to stock up on water & they had absolutely everything\n\nAll the snacks you could think of; breakfast items like cereals; drinks of all sorts from milk to sodas\n\nChips galore, chocolate & any other drugstore item you could possibly think of\n\nHuge fan!
