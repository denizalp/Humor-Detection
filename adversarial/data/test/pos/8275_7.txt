Let me start by saying that it's only one person I'm disgusted in Audio Express on Sunset.  I came in right after they opened at 0900 and Zack approached me asking if I had any questions on any of their products (started off right). I said, actually I'm looking to see how much would it be to install and purchase the backup sensors? He came back at six hundred dollars flat. So, I got the breakdown of the installation and the name of the sensor.  I asked him if that was their final price or if they had a special going and rudely he responded NO (with an attitude). \nI went outside the business looked up the other Audio Express on Sahara & Maryland Parkway and asked for the installation of the same package. He came back with installation and all I was looking at 260 plus tax. \nWHAT?\nWhat a rip off he was. Even after I had it done I told the Manager what had happened and how much I was being quoted and his response was he wasn't surprised. He continued saying that's why his store is number one in installations and sales.
