First time ordering food from this place and I was in AWWW. I called in to place my order at around 7:45pm and the girl who took my order was very friendly. \n\nI ordered one side of white rice, one chicken pad thai,(medium spice) and one chicken with rice noodles soup. (medium spice) My total was about $22. I was told to arrive in 15 mins to pick it all up. \n\nI walked in and they weren't busy. The cashier quickly greeted me and she knew I was there to pick up. She rang us up quickly and we were out the door. \n\nThe food was great!! Our soup was piping hot and it was delicious. The chicken pad thai was also very good and it had a ton of pieces of chicken. \n\nI will definitely order for pick up again and I will definitely have to try out their lunch specials! They also have thai tea which I'm excited to try out!
