The tacos were a big disappointment All tortilla and no filling. No sauce and no extras on there. Better off with the burrito. I like the cameron. Crispy fried shrimp with beans and rice \n\nI got here at 550 one night because they open at 6.  NEVER doing that again. They didn't show until 620 then they waiting too long to get orders and started setting tables up instead. They let some regular get his burrito before me.  I don't get mine until 650.  One hour for a burrito or not worth it.  I'll probably never go back after that experience
