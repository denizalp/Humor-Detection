Reserved a 3 day standard size rental via AAA and Thrifty rates were always a tad cheaper than the Enterprise\/Alamo chain, even the Dollar\/Hertz family that Thrifty is part of!\n\nAs a Blue Chip member, the experience was a disappointment as there was no one behind the Blue Chip counter and there was no option to walk directly to the car with a stall #. \n\nAfter being in a queue with a non-existent agent, fellow renters allowed me to speak with the next agent that was leisurely at best double and triple checking items, upselling insurance, gas etc. *Hello, it's all in my Blue Chip preferences!\n\nThe highlight was that I was upgraded to a Full Size, Toyota Camry when I booked for the Standard size Altima\/Jetta (not sure how those are Standard sizes...)
