Went to sign up with my Domestic Partner.  We are not considered a \"enough\" of a family to be given the rate they give the \"nice people\" who are married.  Their reasoning was (even though we share a Mortgage, Health Insurance, Utilities and a Time Share\").... \"what if you break up? who'll be responsible for paying us?\"\n\nIn the State of Ohio, an official Partnership Agreement is valid in most every place but Lifestyles.  \"Family\" to them is a nice married couple, ours was not nice enough to be respected and placed together on one account.
