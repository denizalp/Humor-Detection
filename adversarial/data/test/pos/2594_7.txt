Restaurant week provided the perfect excuse to cross this place off my list. Although we enjoyed it, I think it lacks the \"wow\" factor. If you're jonesing for his famous lobster pot pie (which is fabulous, btw) I actually recommend Nob Hill instead. The atmosphere there is better, and I think the offerings there are more interesting. We found the atmosphere at MM to be very blah. Not cozy blah, or sleek blah, just BLAH. \n\nFirst things first: The Bellagio cocktail is awesome and I'm happy about that $14 we spent on it. The $20 wine pairing with the restaurant week menu was just ok. I definitely wouldn't spend $10 a glass on either of the 2 wines I was served if I had the decision to do over again .\n\nCourse 1: Tuna tartare. This was a typical MM presentation (similar to how he does his kobe tartare). Egg on top, lots of cool seasonings and things on the plate and then mixed in front of you. This didn't disappoint! Tuna was fresh and the pine nuts and mint and whatnot melded perfectly .\n\nCourse 2: I had the Miso Cod, my fiance had the \"3 little birds\". The miso cod was extremely bland and flavorless. The miso flavor was way too delicate for me. The table next to me actually complained about the same thing.. maybe it was an off night? This dish was a huge disappointment given it's one of his \"signature\" offerings. Allegedly it used to be sea bass (rather than cod) and it tasted better back in the day.. who knows. The operative word with 3 little birds is LITTLE. There was maybe 5 oz of meat on the plate. 5 oz is a lot of foie gras.. or kobe.. but not freaking chicken\/duck\/quail for $39. It was however, beautiful and very tasty. No major complaints.. definitely a recommended dish if you like birds and you aren't a big eater. \n\nDessert: This took 35 minutes to arrive.. yes, we sat for 35 minutes between main course and dessert. Damn annoying if you ask me. The dessert, however, was excellent! We had the rootbeer float with homemade rootbeer sorbet (rootbeer sorbet covered in rootbeer..kinda stupid but awesome at the same time) and then these awesome warm cookies were on the side. Loved it. \n\nOverall a good dining experience, but with so many great experiences to be had in this city I don't think we'll return anytime soon.
