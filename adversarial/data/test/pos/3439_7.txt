I've lived in many luxury apartments in the valley and this one is way over priced for the neighborhood. The management did just change and it keeps getting worse. They will keep telling wrong information due to lack of knowledge or their systems were under maintenance etc.. They are very snooty and they dress kind of ghetto. Grace the manager will straight out lie to your face and very unprofessional. I've never in my life would recommend anyone to live here, unless you want to get shot.
