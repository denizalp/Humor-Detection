Do yourself a favor: comparison shop. The Tuftex carpet we loved here is $16.22\/sq ft installed. At the other carpet store we went to, it was only $10\/sq ft installed. In our theatre room of only 430 sq, this equated to be a $2,700 difference of price. Can you imagine if we were doing the whole house in this carpet?! Do your homework, compare prices elsewhere, and you'll see what I'm saying is true and save yourself thousands.\n\nTo their reply: I don't know about you, but pricing is a big factor when we're talking of thousands of dollars more, and I'm sure many people would agree. To each their own. Comparison shopping has always been a win for me though.
