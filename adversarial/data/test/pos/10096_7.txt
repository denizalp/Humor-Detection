I don't usually shop at Dillard's but decided to give it a go. I usually shop at Nordstroms which I love. Anyways I bought a pair of pants that cost $128.00; they were just sitting in my closet not being worn with tags still on them so I decided to return them but Dillards has a 30 day only return ploicy for money back. I could have returned them for credit but that turned me off. Back to Nordstroms the take returns with no time frame. Off to Nordstroms I gooooooo.
