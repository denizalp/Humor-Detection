Cutesy, cartoony macaroons.....how the heck can your resist!  Here I was just finishing my lunch nearby and opened up my Yelp app and saw a bunch of posts of DaanGo Cake Lab having their grand opening just around the corner.\n\nOpened by a former contestant on Masterchef Canada, DaanGo Cake Lab produces a variety of really cool designed cakes and desserts including these insanely cute macaroons of various characters such as Mickey and Minnie, Hello Kitty, Baymax and my favourite, Totoro!  \n\nBy the time I got there most of the cakes were gone but I really came for those macaroons!  The flavours were really nice and delicate.   The only bad thing was how fast you can finish them;).  \n\nCost wise the macaroons were $3.50 each or $30 for 9 so bit of a splurge but considering most good macaroon places are around that price point its pretty fair especially since they look so cool!\n\nFor the grand opening there is a 10% discount and they even give you a card for a future purchase of 10%.\n\nReally look forward to try their other creations and wish them the best of luck for future sucess!  \n\n4\/5.
