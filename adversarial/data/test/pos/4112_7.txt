I think this was one of the most affordable lunch cafes inside WYNN\/ENCORE.\nAbout $15 a plate for the cheaper dishes.\nMe and my fam bam was desperately looking for some food...which was all my fault for not planning...and stopped here since there was no wait...\n\nMe and sis had a burger each and our mom had the waffle with strawberries.\nEverything was okay...I remember being super hungry so the burger went down and I don't even remember how it tasted.\n\nI see how everyone is liking the Vegetarian Chicken and waffles...\nIf I ever go again...I might try this.\nLobster Benedict...I believe was $$$$. I love Egg Benedict but I'm not much of a lobster person. So spending $$$$ wouldn't make much sense to me.\n\nMy mom did love her coffee...I believe they give you a whole jug of it...\nAnd ofcourse my mom finished it. lol\n\nSpending $50 + tax and tip  for 3 is decent.\nI would much rather go to Bouchon (A bridge over to Venezia) and spend a little more and get awesome food.\nBut then again...I would have to wait an hour.\n\n1 star for immediate seating and edible food.\n1 star for having something my mom can eat.
