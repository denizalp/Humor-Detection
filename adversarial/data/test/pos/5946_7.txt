Hungry Howie's is by no means artisanal pizza, but it's a good Pizza Hut\/Dominos alternative. Their flavored crusts are unique for franchised pizza. This location has been open only a short time and it's a nice option to have in the neighborhood.\n\nI've had Hungry Howie's pizza in the past and was never that impressed. This carry out order included a thin garlic and herb crust pizza. Stumbled upon something I really liked. I'll admit to being shocked how much I enjoyed it. The original round asiago crust was fine as well, but more at the level I expected.\n\nMuch of Howie's business is delivery, but if you do decide to carry out, be forewarned this location is hidden back in the corner of the strip center (SE corner of the intersection, next to Safeway). No space to dine in.\n\nHungry Howie's is very promotional. Grand opening coupons. Online deals. You should never have to pay full price. This day we received a free large pizza as part of their grand opening. We'll definitely consider Howie's again if we have a large group and need some decent cheap pizza.
