On days like today when I'm not in Las Vegas...\nnot by the pool at Tao Beach...\nnot enjoying the views...\nnot drinking a mojito....\nnot smoking a CAO honey flavored cigar...\nnot listening to the dj spinning the top 40...\n\n I think about when i was and smile to my self....\n my heart gets all warm and then ....\n\nI start trying to figure out when is a good time to go back. \n\nI did however drop a star for the one time I went and the staff was acting like jerks just because some celebrity was throwing their birthday party there, but hey who offers consistently good service in Las Vegas?
