Hodge's is one of my favorites in Cleveland. Conveniently located in Downtown on Euclid. It's a small space, but they have a dope bar area which all of the restaurant surrounds. And I really love the space above the kitchen.\n\nIt's the little details like how the wait staff wears red chucks or getting your bill in an envelope that says \"damage\". Every time I been to Hodge's, the service has been exceptional, whether I'm sitting at the bar watching the game or trying to grab a seat on a busy night. It's always a personable experience.\n\nThere isn't a lot on the menu I haven't tried. The entr√©es alone, you can't really go wrong with any of the dinner items. I personally like the pork, short ribs, and walleye. Every meal comes with complementary corn bread on the house. CORN BREAD !! And a side of sweet potato tots. Who does that ?!
