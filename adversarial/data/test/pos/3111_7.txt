Perhaps I was wrong to give Romeo's such a bad review, because even though I left my leftover pizza in the work refrigerator too long and had to throw it away, when I went to toss it I had discovered that some sneaky food-stealing co-worker ate about 2\/3rds of it already.  To risk: 1) eating pizza that could have been weeks old 2) eating pizza that could have had gross I-dont-wash-my-hands-after-I-go-to-the-bathroom germs on it (for all they knew) and 3) the possible embarrassment if I had caught them... suggests that this pizza must actually be damn good.
