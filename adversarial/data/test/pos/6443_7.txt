Apparently when you have a 2 bedrooom you can only use one shower at a time. Forget about doing laundry and jumping in the shower waiting for your outfit to get clean or forget about getting ready with your husband at the same time. My daughter is in town visiting and we're both trying to get ready to go to brunch and I get stuck with a cold shower. This should't be a problem considering the amount we pay here. Ridiculous.\n\nThe issues at this place have been crazy. More on that later.
