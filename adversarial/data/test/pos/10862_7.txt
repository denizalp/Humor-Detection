November Challenge - 21\/30\n\nOn a quest to find poutine for a friend (being vegan, I have never consumed poutine that I haven't made myself), we found ourselves inside The Unicorn Pub. A band was there doing soundcheck with Green Day covers. Ah, homesick nostalgia. 510, what!\n\nService was decent; I really appreciated that the waitress made it possible to enjoy my go-to drink while still observing the highball special of the afternoon. Food was okay as well, not extraordinary, but not half bad. Remarks about the poutine was that the cheese wasn't properly incorporated, so you got three giant blobs - one that had to be sliced apart with a knife! - and that was it. \n\nThere were apologies made for the loud soundcheck, but honestly? That's why I wanted to sit downstairs :). Definitely would come back for a show or more happy hour highballs.
