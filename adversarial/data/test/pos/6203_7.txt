I'm a fan of Rubio's and stopped by this location for dinner one evening.  I ordered my traditional item.....Steak Burrito.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/j0h8OH6ktQsnTmIaJsN5Hw?select=Zx--exGz8noCK_pSNsQuOA\n\nOf course, I stopped by the Salsa bar to get a few cups of their Spicy Salsa.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/j0h8OH6ktQsnTmIaJsN5Hw?select=FpVfp0gkLcDXCZBTWSLyGg\n\nThe Burrito was very tasty as usual.  So far, all of the Rubio's I've been to have been consistent with good quality food and service.  This one is no different.  I'll be back again!\n\nReturn Factor - 100%
