11 people in line for the teller and only 1 teller window open. Pretty terrible wait time is guaranteed if you opt to come here for anything other than an ATM transaction.\n\nI am just glad this is not the main branch I go to regularly, but happened to be on the way to my next errand.\n\nStay away from here if you have a choice.\n\nBy the way, the line was 13 people deep at one point, before another employee decided to open a second teller window.\n\nYou have been warned.
