I've come here for so many different issues in the past 5 years. Bladder infections, weekly therapy, psychiatrist, ER and some more.\n\nI had some issues 5 years ago, only because the nurses and doctors definitely never for sensitivity training about trans people. That was not a fun experience at all. \n\nMore recently though, I went to the ER twice for mental health issues and they were super respectful and took care of me. In the morning some psychiatrist residents came to talk to me and even asked what pronouns I use since they saw that I have therapy at MUSIC (McGill University Sexual Identity Centre). \n\nI've had weekly therapy through MUSIC for 2 years now and its really great (as well as group therapy). \n\nThe place is usually very clean. The one thing I cant stand is how COMPLICATED it is to get from one building to another. You have to get off on a specific floor and walk and take 3 different elevators, its insane, WHO designed this!!
