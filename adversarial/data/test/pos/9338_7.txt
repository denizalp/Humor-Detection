I've shopped at Discount Tire since 2003 AD and have always had a positive experience. They have a decent selection of tires that can match almost any budget. They are hardworking & courteous. They've been cool enough to plug tires I didn't buy at Discount Tire for free - this is when I became a loyal customer and always shop this brand.\n\nThis location was friendly, efficient and extremely convenient. I would recommend this shop to my family and friends!
