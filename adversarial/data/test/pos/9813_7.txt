Horrible experience!\n\nWe had a kitchen remodel in Aug of 2015 with all the appliances purchased through Spencers.  Sales rep was helpful but could not give us actual prices for each piece, only a total, as they were selling us a package.\n\nInstall happened and after of 4 hours of the installer complaining that they were have issues with the dishwasher because of our cabinets not being installed correctly they got it installed, but installed a damaged floor model, not the new model we had ordered.  So they had to come again.  Fridge door dinged during delivery, fixed later by the manufacture.  Then the range hood was way too large for our space, even after offering the dimensions to the sales rep.  So we had to buy a new one else where.\n\nNow a year later we get a call from Spencer's finance team that they did an audit and found that our rebate of $900 was credited to our Spencer's card twice.  Being in the middle of a remodel and paying everything off, we did not notice the error on Spencer's part.  So now a year later we have to come up with $900 to pay them back.  After airing my concerns about all of their errors, they refunded $50... $50.  Really bad experience, hopefully its done with now.
