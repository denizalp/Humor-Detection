I knew if I prayed to the Pizza Gods long enough, they would answer my prayers for an authentic NY pizza\/Italian restaurant in Charlotte! AAHHH the power of prayer. :)\n\nWe popped in on a Sunday evening and to my surprise we had a 15 minute wait. What? Really? Did I hear you correctly Miss Hostess? As I peered around the corner I saw every table and every booth filled to capacity. This was a very good sign and I think I actually giggled out loud. My husband quickly reminded me that IHOP is always packed too and he knows how little I like that place but I digress!\n\nOnce seated, I actually got to see how small the new restaurant was. It was almost a little too small but as long as the food was good, I really didn't care. \n\nWe ordered a large Cheese, well done on the bottom (because that's how I roll) their Lobster Ravioli (one of 3 specials) and the Mozzarella Sticks. \n\nThe sticks were fine. Kind of generic but the Marinara Sauce they served with it was divine! Miss Waitress may I have just a bowl of the sauce and a large spoon? OK so I didn't actually say that to the waitress BUT I thought it.\n\nThe Lobster Ravioli came out and it was a beautiful plate of food. It really should have been sold as a Seafood Ravioli because the ravioli was stuffed with crab meat and topped with Shrimp. The ravioli itself was heavy, tasty but heavy. I like my ravioli pasta thin and these were not. I didn't see or taste much lobster. but the tomato cream sauce was very unique and the shrimp and crab were very good.\n\nThe Pizza arrived and it was like an event, carried in by a very tall Waiter with our Waitress on his heels with our plates. There was all kinds of commotion at our table with the waiter trying to fit the pie on our table and the waitress trying to bus the table, rearrange things and add new clean plates. It was all a blur really. He placed the pie on the table and my children's eyes got as round as silver dollars! The smell was amazing, the color was amazing and the bottom was cooked to PERFECTION!!!!! But how did it taste? Maybe I won't tell you. Maybe I should keep it a secret for fear that you will all go and now my wait will be double or triple the time...OK fine, this is a review after all. It tasted like heaven!!!!! It tasted like a true NY pizza with a little less grease (thank God) AND for a brief moment I was transported back to my beloved Manhattan
