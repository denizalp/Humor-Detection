I love the M Resort.  It is honestly my favorite casino and resort in Vegas period.  Never mind that it's not on the strip and that there isn't some random theme to differentiate it from all the other resorts, this is just a really nice establishment.  It's immaculately clean, never reeks of smoke, and doesn't feel as cavernous as some of the larger casinos in Vegas.  It's honestly as intimate as a casino can feel.  \n\nThe bars and restaurants inside of this casino are equally impressive.  (See my review of the Studio B Buffet: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/studio-b-buffet-henderson#hrid:58geBOMZm3c1XduHUS2drA).  Having driven in late Friday night, my friends and I wanted to just have a mellow night and grab a few drinks.  So we opted to come here, initially thinking we'd go to the beer bar, we ended up in the center bar which is a lot more trendy and nice.  This was a great bar.  With cushy couches to lounge on and really retro music going on with music videos to boot, we spent hours here drinking our dirty vodka martini's and getting way more drunk than we had initially thought we would (sorry for the drunken IM's & text messages!  I really need to leave my phone at home sometimes).  \n\nOh, and one last thing that is awesome about this casino and resort.  FREE SODA FOUNTAINS.  Yes, you heard right.  Found throughout the casino floor are soda fountains where you can just help yourself to a drink.  Pretty freakin' awesome if you ask me.
