I'm not hipster enough for this place. But, that's okay - the owner doesn't judge, is super sweet, and makes a great latte. \n\nWe came on a Saturday around 12:30 PM.  First, this place can be hard to miss. We were craving something hot to drink and must have walked past this place twice before realizing this was the spot. Don't look for a sign signalling the shop's name - instead, look for the bright red 96 (for 96 Spadina), and you've found it. Interesting, rustic, yet classy interior, and a really chill ambiance. It's a great spot to sit, people-watch, and relax for a bit before heading out for the rest of your day.\n\nWe ordered the Turkish Latte and a tea. They have a selection of looseleaf teas available for your choosing, and a decent list of lattes and drinks on the menu. The Turkish Latte was on point - it's comforting, with nice hints of spices and some cinnamon. I would have liked it to have been warmer in temperature, but overall, the flavour was definitely there.\n\nWhile the shop interior itself doesn't have much seating, there are tables and chairs located just up the stairs connecting to the shop, if you want a quiet spot to do some work. For two people, we paid around $7.00 for our two drinks.
