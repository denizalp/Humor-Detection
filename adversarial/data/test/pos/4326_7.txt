I and my wife were on a car hunt during end of January 2015 and start of February 2015. We had nothing specific in mind and we were just looking for a nice car which we both can drive and a good deal. We roamed around to many car agencies, selling used and new cars. While crossing Bell Honda, I told my wife let's just check this place too. We went in and were greeted on the door by Camille Volcy. He was very polite, soft spoken and the respect reciprocated both ways. He showed us some cars and we test drove Civic Coupe. It was indeed a very good driving experience. It was smooth; my wife liked the space in the car (usually the problem with coupes). Still, I was not sure of purchasing the car then and there. I made it very clear to Camille. \n\nLater we sat down on Camille's desk, he was not trying to push the deal down our throats, he was polite and logical. He asked me to check online for the prices and tell me your price. He was not behaving like other desperate sales persons but he was moreover like a counselor\/consultant. At the end of the whole conversation, he gave us a very good deal which we could not refuse. So, from the mindset not buying a car today to I bought the car. The transition was because of only one reason Camille.\n\nOverall, we had an awesome experience, even after purchase of the car. Whenever we needed some information or help, Camille was there promptly. He is an awesome sales person and gem of a person. We really liked his behavior. I would give 10 out of 10 for him. I would recommend anybody looking to buy car from Bell Honda, go for Camille.
