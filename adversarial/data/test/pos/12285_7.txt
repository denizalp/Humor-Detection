By far the best meal we had during our stay in Vegas :) We were meeting another couple for dinner and while all 4 of us had really different palates, we all left really happy. This place is a fusion of Asian, Italian, American & seafood, so everyone should be able to find something they like. \n\nTo avoid an embarrassing grabby \"fight for the check\" scene, I asked the hostess to make sure that the check came to either myself or my bf. She took down our names and outfits and promised us the check would be delivered to us. \n\nOur waiter Flavio took great care of us. I think he has actual magical powers. He never hovered over our table, but he always seemed to appear within seconds when we even thought about wanting something. \n\nThe food was equally impressive. I would definitely recommend the tandoori chicken dish. The presentation was great... I wish I took a picture, but it was too delicious to pause for something trivial like that :P \n\nFlavio found out that it was my bf's birthday weekend, and he brought out ice cream encased in some ice sculpture bubble. We spent a good 5 minutes ooohh-ing and ahhh-ing. \n\nWhen it came time to cash out, and our friends try to slyly hand Flavio their credit card at the waiter's station, he very discreetly said that the check was already taken care of. \n\nWe'll definitely be coming back here on our next trip :)
