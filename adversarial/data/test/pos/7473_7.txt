NO TAKE OUT PIZZA AFTER 7:45pm????  YOU GOT TO BE JOKING RIGHT???\n\nYou ever have one of those days that you think can't get any worse???   Yep I had that one Tuesday.  So I am with my son in toe and wife after some very bad stuff went down money wise I decided to stop at Lou's since we were in the area.  Maybe Lou's will help us get over losing $750.  My son was tired and not up to eating in the restaurant...  So I said hey lets get it to go.  Well the lady at the door greeting people, looked like a manager told me rudely no more to go pizzas are made at 8PM, even though it was 745.  I was dumbfounded.   I honestly didn't know what to say..  745 and I can't get a TO GO pie????  She said NOPE...  I could have stayed and asked why or argued, but my son was complaining that he was hungry so we just left.\n\nYou know after the Viral Del Taco video came out a few weeks back, all we hear about is how poor customer service is in the United States...  Well Lou's proved it.
