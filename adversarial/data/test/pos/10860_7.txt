I stopped by here after work to pick up a couple of things and oh my goodness!!! There was an item I needed and there was an employee in the aisle who was stocking (I won't say in what section as I don't want to embarrass him) who had such bad body odor!!!  I tried holding my breath as I looked for what I needed but the odor was too much. I honestly thought I would puke. I said to my boyfriend who was at the other end of the aisle and told him I can't get what I need cause that dude smells too bad and my boyfriend said \"yeah, I know. I can smell him from here\".\n\nWe went to another part of the store to get the other things I on my list but before we went to pay, I decided to look down the aisle to see if the guy was gone and he was. I started walking down the aisle and I could still smell him!!!  His odor lingered in the air! Disgusting!!!\n\nI don't think I'll go back to this store. I'm surprised his manager or coworkers didn't say anything to him about his body odor.\n\nTake a shower, dude! Use deodorant!
