Being Korean, and reading about the Kogi Truck on Serious Eats a couple of years ago, I was pretty excited to hear that Vegas had their own place that served Korean fusion tacos. But my excitement quickly turned into disappointment.\n\nTacos: They're $3.00 each, but are $5.00 for two (including tax), so we bought a beef taco and a pork taco just to sample. Both tacos came in a small flour tortilla, dressed with kimchi (which resembled sauerkraut ,and was pretty bland), lettuce and cilantro. It was difficult to differentiate the two meats; they tasted pretty much the same, and were overly sweet with a hint of spiciness, but really lacked any depth of flavor. I also felt that there was too much of the kimchi\/lettuce and not enough meat.\n\nOverall, the owner was friendly, and the food was fresh and cooked up quickly, so that's where the 2 stars are coming from. But unfortunately, I was not impressed with the tacos, as I felt there was nothing remotely \"Korean\" about them.
