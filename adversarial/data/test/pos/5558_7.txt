This Sunday was only a 20 minute wait. As we sat down, one of the staff asked if we wanted coffee...YEAH! It was in the high forties this morning and glad that we didn't have to wait to ask for coffee. \nThe server was pleasant and asks the right questions. Especially when I asked about the Corn Beef Hash. This time instead of the skillet, I got it on a plate with hash browns, which look like scallop potatoes but was thin and crispy around the edges. My wife enjoys their Swedish Pancakes and my daughter had the Country Benedict. Unfortunately, the egg was over cooked.\nOther than that, we had a great breakfast and will definitely be back.
