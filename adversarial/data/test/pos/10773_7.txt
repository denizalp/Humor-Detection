I straight up hate this place. Is that enough of a review? No? Okay well let me tell you why I hate this hotel.\n\nArriving at the hotel your hit in the face with the most awful scent ever. My boyfriend described it as \"urinal cakes\". Yummy.\n\nCheck in went fine, and we headed up to our room. Well we walk in and the room is boiling hot. Turn on the lights and it looked like someone attacked the shower area. The only covering that makes the shower private was sprayed out across the floor. Looked like an angry bear mauled it.\n\nWe called down and they sent someone up about 20 mins later. Mind you it's past midnight at this point, we're hungry and tried. As we waited we noticed the tv wasnt working. Well maintenance fixed that, but said the shower cover curtain thing will be held off till morning. They never came to fix it. \n\nSo good thing I was rooming with the boyfriend otherwise it would have been rather uncomfortable showering with the world to see.\n\nOur mini fridge and bar food area was half stocked. That's cool..okay thanks? No hangers, except two that said to enjoy their bathrobes. Those didn't exist!\n\nBefore heading to bed we ripped the place apart searching for the 'do not disturb' sign. Well it didn't exist. So we called down and said \"hey please don't send room cleaning over-we don't want it\". \n\nNext morning as I'm snoozing away. Some dude parades in and walks all the way to the bed before realizing I'm there. He left right away, but whoa come on!  (Happened three mornings in a row after calling them and saying not to send anyone up).\n\nWhen we did ask for the room cleaning they never restocked our toilet paper (there was also none when we arrived)...thanks! Also we were charged $76 for the room cleaning. That's never happened to us in vegas before.\n\nWe called down again to have the mini fridge cleared out (not that there was much anyway). Well the lady came she grabbed everything then stocked our stuff carefully above the sensors. LOL! \n\nDuring check out low and behold we were charged for everything the woman took out of the bar. They took it off but what a hassle that was. \n\nBtw the restaurants suck here. We tried three and they all sucked. \n\nGuys and gals.. Don't stay here. Go to the encore.
