I'm not Buddhist, but I enjoy going to the temple. Here, I feel comfort and I feel safe.\n\nI've only been to other temples in the States, so I can't compare it to any other temples here.\n\nCham Shan Temple is nice and big. It gets very crowded here during Chinese New Year.\n\nEntering and exiting can get quite hectic, as the parking area is very small. They have underground parking as well, so don't worry if you can't find parking upstairs!\n\nTo be honest, I don't know the names of all the Buddhas in the temple but every time I come, I make sure to light a few incense sticks and start from the outside and go inside.\n\nThey have donation boxes in front of each Buddha as well as inside the temple.\n\nThe best & my favourite part of going to the Temple was going upstairs to the other building to \"kau cim\" \/ 求籤 aka beg a stick aka fortune telling!\n\nYou pick up a cup with sticks in it and you kneel and shake the cup until 1 stick falls out.\n\nOn the stick there's a number and you look for the \"cim\" according to that number.\n\nIt's in Chinese BUT if you can't read Chinese ..well there's a book on the side by the doors with English explanations.\n\n9\/10 times my \"cim\" is usually very very accurate and yes, I'm one of those superstitious people that believes in these things. But hey, how can I not when it's SO ACCURATE?!
