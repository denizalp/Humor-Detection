The secret is that it's really just OK pizza. Typical greasy under-the-heat-lamp pizza that tastes delicious if you're drunk but just all-right if you're sober. The flavors are as-is for the most part but you can accessorize for a price. The best part about coming here is that it is a secret - no signs or special doors, just a hallway. You feel special just to find it, along with the other, yeap I'm gonna say it, hipsters. IPA and PBR are flowing as well as wine and soda. Pinball machines are in check.
