Beautiful brewery that just opened up in Cuyahoga Falls (more so near Silver Lake\/ Stow). I've been here a few times. Once on opening night and a few nights after that. \n\nThe decor is rustic and charming. The patio is to die for (looks like they're going to be adding perhaps some sort of fountain and a walk way by the water maybe?). Patio is also dog friendly as long as they're on a leash, and there's plenty of shade for the pale vampire girls like myself. \n\nThey have their in house brews as well as wine, and locally featured beers (HiHo, MadCap, etc.)\n\nThe food is banging (try the guac with house made chips). \n\nIt's truly a reasonably priced Brewery, with a great story, and a phenomenal view. Check it out!
