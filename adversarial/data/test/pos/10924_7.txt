I need this place to never change. It's friendly and funny and full of perfect fried things. You can still get a cheap breakfast here that's hugely filling with bottomless coffee and fresh fruit. You can get a great steamie, a massive poutine for like $5, a pizza, a pepperoni sub, basically everything good. \n\nI love the owner and staff, they wave when I walk by, they crack jokes as they cook and chat with regulars, and crank out hot, fresh food. I love the vinyl booths, the big menu and the much bigger heart. Support your local casse cro√ªte people, these are the bits of history that keep neighbourhoods alive!!
