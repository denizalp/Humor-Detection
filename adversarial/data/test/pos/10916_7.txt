Thanks Yelp for helping me find weird stuff! LOL . So if you like weird art, you should stop here in the Art District right off E. Charleston BLvd. It's on Coolidge and S. First Street. It's around the Smith Center and the North Premium outlet shopping plaza. If you brave enough to walk around there is graffiti art sprayed on some of the buildings. This is the art district after all! LOL  \n\nCool to read history of the kitty and the creator. So many photos of Snowball already posted, so I will just add to the collection. Great to do selfies with the kitty. This is not the best part of town, so go during daylight and watch out for homeless people around. Cornish Pastry is also nearby if you want to try a one pound signature pasties. :-)
