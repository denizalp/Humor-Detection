What can I say ~ I Love Ruth's Chris!\n\nFrom the moment I walked in I was waited on with the utmost attention.\n\nI made a reservation for some friends and I.\nI arrived early so I sat at the bar and ordered some calamari(see pics)\n\nPJ the bartender took very good care of me, he was funny without being obnoxious, we watched jeopardy together and he knew all the answers, he even gave me a wine tasting tour of the most expensive wines they have! I found a new favorite.(Whitehall Lane Cabernet)\nHe was great company while I waited for my guests to arrive. \nThanks PJ~\n\nDinner was Delicious as usual, although I did notice they increased their prices a bit.\n\nI ordered Shrimp Cocktail, Ruth's Chop salad, Seared Scallops and the broccoli augratin. (see pics) I really don't care for red meat anymore but their Rib-eye is Delicious if your a steak eater.\n\nMy guests ordered the filet and crab legs, tomato salad, house salad and a rib-eye and they loved every bite as well.\n\nAfter dinner we relaxed for a bit on their patio complete with fireplace and the most comfy patio chairs I've ever sat in (see pics)\n\nI spent nearly a $100 on my dinner alone but it was worth every delectable bite~
