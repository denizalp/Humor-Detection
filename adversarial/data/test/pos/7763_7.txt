I stayed here Friday...we had been traveling for hours and chose to stay here to rest for the night. After we checked in and got settled...we called down and requested a late check out and were granted a 1pm checkout time. Nice staff at the front desk during check in and night shift. \n\nSo, the next day around 11:30am the housekeeper Knocks on the door....We let her know that we got a late checkout of 1pm and she leaves. Moments later, I get a phone call from a tremendously unprofessional and rude (supposed) front desk member telling me that \"her staff wouldn't give a late checkout on a Saturday\" and that I was lying. Wow! It was astounding at how rude she was... I was in shock!!  She continued with \"I can call the employee from last night to verify that they didn't give you a late check out\". Yep, this actually happened to me!! Shocking!! I told her to please call the guy!! Just to verify that he DID give me a late checkout!! \n\nNext, I told her she was being terribly rude and I wanted to talk to the manager. She was hesitant and threatened to charge me for an extra night!! When I mentioned that I was a Marriott member she told me that she was \"looking at my profile\". I was astonished at what was happening. It was insane. I demanded that the manager on duty call me back and got off of the phone. \n\nNext, a different woman called, claiming to be the manager on duty and offering me an even later check out of 2pm because they made a mistake. She said there was a notation in the computer that indicated that the guy on night shift had granted the late check out to us. Wow! At this point, I asked what her name and title was to be sure I had some proof of this call. She told me that she was the \"housekeeping supervisor\".  Okay, but I requested the hotel manager on duty call me back. I wasn't sure what was happening so I questioned her further. I asked who was in charge of the hotel? Then there was a pause and I heard whispering ... She replied \"I'm in charge\". Okay so now I'm suspicious. I asked a few more questions and she confessed that \"Karen\" was the hotel manager on duty! I told her to have Karen call me and gave her my cell phone number. Of course we packed up in a hurry to get out of that room by the 1pm time, promised to us the night before ...I certainly didn't trust that seemingly bogus 2pm offer from the supposed housekeeping supervisor.  \n\nLong story short:\nNeedless to say the hotel manager on duty never called my cell. We hurried out, un-showered , un-ironed, in a flurry of confusion because I had wasted so much time befuddled on the phone. By 1pm, I went to the front desk after packing the car. \n\nI asked the three standing at the desk,which one had called my room. They answered that none of them had called. But, the manager Karen was standing there (one of the three) and said that she was \"aware of the situation\". Yet, she didn't bother calling me or contacting me in any way to rectify the situation. She made excuses and blamed somebody named, Brittany. \n\nThen she turned the computer monitor around and showed me a notation on the screen which indicated that I WAS granted a 1pm check out. She also told me that \"they never look at that box\" and shrugged with a giggle. She gave a half hearted apology but mostly made more excuses as I'm standing there in astonishment over being rousted out of my room like a criminal!! Okay, but here is the kicker... After I left, Karen calls me to tell me that \"it wasn't actually Brittany\".... No, it was a \"housekeeper calling me from another suite\"!! \n\nI asked Karen if it was within the housekeepers scope to threaten to charge me an additional night, look into my profile, call my room and call me a liar etc. Karen said \"No, it is not in her scope\".  Basically, I got a half hearted apology and a bunch of excuses attached to some unprofessional giggling by the manager on duty of this hotel. Oh and she \"had a talk with the housekeeper\".  Me being astonished and amazed is an understatement. \n\nI asked Karen to have the General Manager call me because I wanted to inform him\/her about this incident. I have also notified corporate with a formal complaint because I have not heard from the General Manager as of Tuesday late afternoon. \n\nI do not suggest staying here. A hotel where unauthorized staff run amok, threatening guests with extra charges and calling them liars while rousting them out of their rooms early.... Too many other options in town that know how to treat guests. :-\/
