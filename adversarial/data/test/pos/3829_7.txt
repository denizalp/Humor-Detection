I scream, you scream, we all scream, for ice cream.\n\nSweet Republic offers a large variety of ice cream flavors and  sorbet. The flavors are unique and appealing. On this visit I tried the Campfire S'mores ice cream and it was really good.  However, I'm not sure it was good enough to justify the price per moderately-sized scoop ($3\/scoop or $4.50 for two scoops).\n\nThis ice cream shop also carries 'vintage' candies. They also have 'homemade' sweets, such as marshmallows and brittle.
