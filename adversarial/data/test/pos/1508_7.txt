Their treadmills and classes keep my pants buttoning, so I figured it was time for a review. LA Fitness is exactly A-OK. For the price of the membership, I feel that I get exactly what I pay for: a solid, in and out, calorie burning experience with maybe a class or two thrown in here and there. \n\nI've been going to LA Fitness for about four years now. I only ever visit this one. I had a brief stint with the one on McDowell, but this Wildcat felt more at ease away from the ASU gym hangout. Like I mentioned, the membership is decently priced, even with a budget. The equipment is A-OK. It's not top of the line, but it's rarely broken. I will run on the treadmill for 20 more minutes if they ever get ones with TVs built in! \n\nI really only go to LA Fitness for cardio, but the free weights overtake much of the gym and they have a large selection of bikes, treadmills and ellipticals. Even during the busy time aka gymaholic's happy hour, I always seem to find a treadmill relatively quickly. \n\nThe classes at LA Fitness deserves another star to the review. They have spot on classes! I rotate between spinning, kick boxing, pilates and most recently Zumba. I love them all! The teachers are energetic and kick my butt, the music is fast paced and motivating, and the class agenda stays current. \n\nThe bathroom and locker room is very nice with enough space for a small army of weight-loss hungry gym goers. I pass by the sauna and the pool and while I've never tried either, they look appealing. I always tell myself I should swim more, but haven't made it to this pool yet. The last two highlights for this gym would be the day care classes they offer and the brand new juice bar. I have no idea if the day care is yay or nay, but it was worth mentioning. And be warned, bottles of H20 are a whopping $2,00. Yikes! \n\nSo I suggest LA Fitness if you're like me and use the gym to focus on working out and look for a workout of getting in, getting your sweat on and getting out in a reasonable amount of time.
