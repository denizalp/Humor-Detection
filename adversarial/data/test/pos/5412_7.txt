I just returned home from the First 'Asian Night Market' that features cultural cuisine, crafts and unique teas. The Asian Night Market runs from 5 to 9 p.m today ( October 19th ) to showcase local Pacific and Asian Islander restaurants and businesses.\n\nIt is held outside and behind the lot at Dignity Health - St. Rose Dominican, San Martin Campus in the Southwest Valley right off of 215 and Buffalo.\n\nThe parking and the event is free to the public. I found parking at the front of the building. The place was too small and packed with people. I don't know where the lines for the food truck started or ended. Some of the vendors include-\n808 Sushi, Aware Coffee & Tea Lounge, Brew Tea Bar, District One Kitchen & Bar, Duo Duo Arts & Crafts, Fat Choy. \n\nEvery where they were lines and I saw there was no lines at Lee's Sandwiches and I got wings which was tasty. Most of the dishes at the food trucks were $7 or less. I noticed there was a stage for entertainment and music, but nothing was happening when I was there. This event is hosted by the Asian Community Development council.\n\nThe venue is too small and way too crowded for me.
