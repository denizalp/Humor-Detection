Not bad at all. When it comes to ratings I think a lot of factors come in: the food, interior, service and also the company you are in. If you are not fond of the people around you then the food will taste bitter and the beer will feel flat. I haven't had any of that. The beer was fine, the food was decent and everyone had fun. Our waitress seemed a bit cold at first, but that's just her personality. She was great at doing her job and we appreciated that. It helps when you say \"thank you\" to someone who cleans up your dirty dishes. We had a company lunch today and we loved it. I will visit again with my friends soon.
