It's the nicest, tiniest Second Cup in all the land! Okay, their coffee isn't the greatest. Neither are the pastries. But it's a savior when I get to school at 8am, walking all bleary-like into the Rotman building, moaning \"coffeeeeeee\" like zombies moan \"braaaaaaiiiiins.\" The two people that usually work there are the sweetest, and always remember how I take my wussy-pants latte. The biggest shame is that they're not open on weekends, when my fellow Rotman-ites and I are there, burning the candle at both ends.
