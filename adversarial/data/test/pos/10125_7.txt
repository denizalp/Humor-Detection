I was here for a reunion and since most of the festivities were to be at SLS, our group was encouraged to stay here. I had stayed at the Sahara before which used to stand in the same spot. Thinking it was a new hotel, and having been to the SLS in Beverly Hills, I had somewhat of an expectation when I arrived here.\n\nThe lobby was unimpressive, sharing space with the Monkey Bar and Perq, a grab-n-go operation serving sandwiches, coffee etc. Everything feels super chaotic when you take into consideration people waiting in line to check-in, and those lingering at the bar, plus those walking to and from the room to the casino.\n\nThe guy who checked me in was courteous and accommodated my request for a room closer to the elevator. I requested a non-smoking room, but when I got to the room, it smelled of cigarettes. I didn't have time to go back downstairs to contest this so just left it. The most surprising factor is the teenie tiny room I got in the World Tower. Our beds were full sized, not queen. The room had mirrors all over to create the feeling of spaciousness but it was super small. My friend who was sharing the room joked that it was designed by Ikea. Everything felt cheap -- not what I expected from the SLS brand.\n\nFor the online price we paid ($89 before tax and resort fees), I would say was a decent price. If I had paid more, I would have been really pissed off. There are other hotels on the strip which offer better rooms at similar prices and are located in prime real estate on the strip. SLS is on the very end of the strip so really, it shouldn't really be as expensive as other hotels. The casino is also tiny. \n\nWe got VIP entry into Foxtail, the nightclub, but even with free drink coupons, we didn't stay because it wasn't really enticing enough. All the tables were reserved for bottle service like all nightclubs are in Vegas and standing around while we drank is not appealing to me. The free drinks are super watered down so we ended up buying our own drinks anyway.\n\nWould I stay here again? Only if I absolutely have to and the prices were reasonable enough to make me want to. Otherwise, it really isn't worth it. It isn't a nice hotel, nor is it in a location where it is easily accessible even with the monorail -- which you now have to pay for.
