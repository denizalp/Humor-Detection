Rudddeeee!\n\nI went here with my Dad couple months back. We were trying to find a good place to eat before I headed back to Los Angeles. My Dad said it was pretty good so we went in.\n\nThe waitress came over and asked what we would like to drink, my Dad asked for some jasmine tea if they had any, and the waitress turned her nose in the air and said \"we are a KOREAN restaurant not CHINESE!\" Ok lady, and I'm Japanese but what difference does it make? If I was a Chinese then I would have been no doubt offended by her tone of disgust. She sashayed away leaving me with my mouth open in disbelief. \n\nThe food itself is unique that you have to self serve from a buffet instead of ordering from the waitress. When we started cooking the vent was broken or not turned on which left us in a cloud of smoke. The waitress ignored our repeated attempt to get her attention and finally she said \"it doesn't work at this table.\" Then why did you seat us here???\n\nThe food was mediocre at best for pricing  and the service just made it outright terrible. Hate to leave negative reviews for small businesses but customer service is everything and I definitely did not get that here.
