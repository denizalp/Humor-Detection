Seller Networks,\nThe moment you post a vehicle online, be it a car or a motorcycle, on Craigslist or some other online method to sell something. These folks will contact you. They offer you an opportunity to use their service and guarantee that they will sell your item by advertising it on several different websites for $300. You do all of the work. You take pictures, develop a video, and give a brief description of what it is you're trying to sell. And, true to their word they post the item on several websites for you. I have had my motorcycle posted for nearly three months now. Steadily lowering the price of it to try and get at least an offer. I have heard nothing. I never hear anything from Seller Networks unless I contact them. THIS IS A TOTAL RIPOFF!!! I threw my hard earned $300 away. Beware, as soon as these people contact you turn them down and tell them to never contact you again. They are very pushy in their tactics to get you to pay for the service. Just hang up the phone and block the number. They will call again and again. That is how they got me. I finally just gave in because I thought I didn't have anything to lose and they would get the bike sold. It's a lie. The bike is still sitting in my garage and I'm out of my money. You're better off just advertising in your local newspaper.
