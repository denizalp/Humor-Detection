Gourmet Malaysia was recommended by a friend who longed to eat at this restaurant before they left Toronto for a year. \n\nEntering the restaurant rather later in the evening, there were tons of seats (weekday night). I feel like the restaurant has way more seats, than it does have for parking seats - limited. It oddly gave us a feeling of those Chinese restaurants in Europe or in a heavily Western populated location where large group tours attend to dine. \n\nWe ordered the Hainese Chicken on Rice for ($9.99), the special gourmet Malaysia platter ($23.99) and their Laksa bowl. All of these dishes were quite large, though I had expected the Malaysia platter to have more appetizer pieces in it. \n\nThe Hainese Chicken had a larger than normal piece of chicken for you to eat, with a fairly large scoop of rice as well. I really enjoyed it - the meat for the chicken although tasted slightly more rough than the regular smooth pieces of chicken, I felt like ACTUALLY was a piece of chicken cause of the amount of meat in it.\n\nThe Laksa bowl was another huge dish consisting of noodles and fish ball related items. It was spicy, but it was pretty delicious. I eventually used the soup based - which had some viscosity to it, and mixed it with the rice and it tasted great.\n\nThe Malaysia platter's items were slightly smaller than expected. The kabobs on their own were quite expensive, so we decided just to get this all in one. In this platter consisted of chicken and beef kabobs (6 pieces), though it was rather small in size compared to the kabobs at other places. I'd go for this option too if you were looking for appetizers to eat. The spring rolls were much smaller than I had hope for it to be and they tasted like something you could purchase frozen. I really enjoyed the salad - a mix of mango, cucumber and peppers. They also had fried shrimp balls and the fish ball related texture foods that were spicy. \n\nI think their price and the proportion of food was fair - would come back to visit!
