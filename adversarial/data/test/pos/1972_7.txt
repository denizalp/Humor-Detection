I've been wanting to visit ChopShop since I saw a long line at the Scottsdale location. I am never patient to wait in line so I didn't go so here was my chance on a Friday around 4pm to go to the Tempe location. There was probably no wait this time and I was right. We took advantage of happy hour sangrias for $5. It was good, but the portion was a little light. \n\nI ordered the shrimp protein bowl with forbidden rice and fianc√© ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl with forbidden rice. Both were good, healthy, and filling. I also ordered the almond butter brownies. That was a total \"fail\". I can make better paleo brownies...\n\nThe bill = 2 sangrias, 2 protein bowls, 1 brownie = $36.21 + $2 parking fee.\n\nOverall, I think ChopShop is a tad bit overpriced and a little overrated.....and I'm a little over it.
