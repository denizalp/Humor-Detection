I popped in here last year for the Friday the 13th tattoo deal and found Marcel my new tattoo artist! His work is amazing and he makes you feel comfortable and is a cool person to chat with.\nI loved my tattoos so much last time left with 3 and today another 2 and might even pop back in before the day is over!\nAll the tattoo artists here are very nice and very talented. \nI'm looking forward to finishing up my half sleeve with Marcel! If your looking for a good tattoo artist I definitely recommend checking him out! \nAlso I would like to add this place has 15 different sheets of tattoos to choose from! I've never seen so many options for a Friday the 13th special! \nSome where drawn out by one of the artist there herself and they're awesome! And your not restricted to just the arms or one size during this special but there is a small charge of 10$ to place on a more difficult body part and 10$ to add color. They also have bigger tattoos that range from 20$ to 80$ which is still a amazing deal!\nAnd I had no wait on both of my visits here, Marcel had me in and out of here with in the hour. \nI'm one satisfied costumer and will be back!
