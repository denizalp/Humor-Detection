I write this review for the people who are in my position, and if you dont understand why SOME people are made to go here for petty offenses dont read this and judge because you dont understand what bullshit it is. The people who work here are cool and respectful and I understand its their \"job\" to run this place, but in reality its just another stunt by the government to rob people of their money and time. Most everyone assigned to this program cant even afford it which puts them in a even worse situation. The goverment pulls this crap cuz they know they can and piss people off more which in turn makes most situations worse. For the people who can relate for getting in \"trouble\" for the smallest thing and have to at least pay $1,500 to get something small off your record is complete shit.
