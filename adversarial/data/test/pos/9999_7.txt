Ah Costco. This is what I love about America, where access to awesome food samples are a basic right!\n\nAs of this writing this Costco is barely 2 weeks old. No crowds yet, but like every Costco, it's clean, very bright, wide aisles, and with employees that love their job and it shows. Kudos to companies that treat their employees well!\n\nAnd of course, the Costco hotdogs and the pizza are my guilty pleasures. The secret is out. Guilty as charged!
