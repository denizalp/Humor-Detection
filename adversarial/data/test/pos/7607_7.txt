I take full blame for not asking the price of the brunch buffet before sitting down to eat. So sue me: I was tired and hungry. I just wanted to eat.\n\nI guess I should've known it'd cost an arm and a leg when my plate was Versace. Seriously?\n\nNo offense intended, but our waitress seemed to speak very little English. I think she felt as awkward about this as we did, as she rarely stopped by our table to check on us.\n\nThe food was delicious and very filling. It trends toward the pretentious side, however, with their tables covered with caviar, fois gras, lobster and other such nose-in-the-air types of foods. I stuck to old standbys like prime rib, crab cakes, bacon and the like. I was full after 2 plates. \n\nThe dessert bar is the highlight here: cookies, pastries, chocolates and a dip-it-yourself chocolate fondue station. Heaven.\n\nI was zapped back into reality when the bill came: 3 buffets, 2 mimosas and 1 coffee: $235. SERIOUSLY??\n\nAnd the mimosas weren't even bottomless!
