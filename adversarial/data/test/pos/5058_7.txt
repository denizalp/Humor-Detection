I don't normally 5 star a spot when I haven't had the food, but Lure's patio is awesome enough of a draw that I think it alone is a draw. Lure knows what it is doing when it comes to outdoor dining. It's massive patio houses a huge bar under a pavilion. Plus, the patio is one of the most appealing I have seen in all of the Cleve; using overhead strands of lights to set the mood. The staff is extremely friendly, loving the fact my friend, searching for the term Buttery Nipple to describe his desired shot, blurted out \"buttery crotch\" by mistake. I don't even know if buttery nipple is the correct term because I am against any non straight-up liquor shots (like tequila. vodka. whiskey). The beer selection is decent, serving Lake Erie Monster and Magic Hat #9.  It also has long island iced teas and margaritas on tap. Yeah, I didn't know that could be done either, but I liked it.
