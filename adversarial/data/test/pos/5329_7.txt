A disclaimer... I'm not a fan of Cosmo.  Too young.  Too much of a hipster\/spring break crowd.  HOWEVER... the hottest girls in town seem to congregate here.   \"Ok, Mr. Man, if you don't like this place, why visit and waste time reviewing it?\"  First... I sense some animosity.  Relax.  I come in peace.  Second... did you not read the part about all of the hotties?  There are two draws for me here... Scarpetta and said hotties.  Now... I kind of think the upper decks of the Chandelier thing are more interesting, but the Vesper Bar is probably the best place I can think of (in any hotel) to people watch (and by \"people watch\", I mean stare at beautiful women in tight little dresses).  The drinks were so so. The bar itself is pretty small.  That, and... the chairs are a bit uncomfortable.  Blah blah. Who cares.  If I want a great bar, I'll go to Mandarin Bar at MO.  Hit Vesper for booty.
