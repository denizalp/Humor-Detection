This studio needs to update their website information, either that or upgrade their staff. The website clearly states that there is 6 spots available for parking on the premises after 5:30pm on weekdays:\n\n(Pulled from website)\n\"Monday to Friday (5:30pm onwards): All six spots in front of the studio are available. Please park 2 deep \nSaturday & Sunday (all day): All six spots in front of the studio are available.\"\n\nNow I'm not a novice to the consequences of driving downtown, expensive parking or none in sight. So of course, when I looked up the website it was a very pleasant surprise. Of course, when I went in the eccentric lady manning the front was surprised that I took up their offer, and informed me that the tenants in the building may, at any time, 'disallow the use of the spot'.... \n\nOkay? So am I going to be towed?! \n'No, they will just pull you out of class and ask you to move the car'\n'Okay...'\n'Well actually, it's not okay because you'd be disturbing the class.'\n'...'\n\nThis is in the middle of winter, and yogis generally wear very little during a hot yoga class. As I took my bags and was about to head to the change rooms, my favourite person once again called me back and asked me to decipher on my form,\n\n'this strange symbol with a line through the 0, in your email address, I've never seen it before'\n'Um. That's a zero. It's so you don't think it's an 'o'.'\n'Well, I must be old school because you could have written a 'o' but made it bigger'\nMe thinking, how on earth do I explain, or just get the hell away from her.\n'Right, so I'm going to change now' (backing away slowly)\n\nThe shower is a communal one with no divider. The other girl sharing the shower with me was a peeping Jane... \n\nThe class was pretty good, not memorable, but a strong Moksha flow class. Soon enough, a girl was pulled from the class to move her car. I would much rather they not have any parking advertised than parking with large loopholes.
