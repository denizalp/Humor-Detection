All the meat, soup, and noodle dishes I had were pretty good. Definitely not the best I have had (considering I have been to Korean about 20 times), but by far the best in Arizona hands down (I have been to Cho Dang, Takamatsu, Hodori, Gogi, and Korean BBQ). This place just opened up a little over a week ago, so I am writing this review based on my three experiences there. The staff is friendly, the service is good, and the decor is... Well, let's just say that the food definitely makes up for the decor; keep in mind that it is a restaurant, not an art gallery.
