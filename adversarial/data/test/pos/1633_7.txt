In and Out kills this place, you gotta be kidding. Ok. Check this... 3 guys order normal hamburger meals.... 34 goddamn dollars. This place is expensive enough to be fine dining. It also takes forever to get your food. You wake up the next day feeling awful, not for all that whaskey you drank, but for the burger that waged a tiny war in your large intestine all night. Skip it.\n\nwait. bonus star for the sweet jukebox. getting to put on some ol' willie and merle - pancho and lefty, at 4am in a public venue is almost more than a drunk man can take.
