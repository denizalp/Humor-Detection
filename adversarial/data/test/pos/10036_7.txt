I love food. I love going out to eat after drinking myself stupid. I like laughing at the drunk girl who has half a ruben sandwich stuck to her cheek. \n\nI however do not like getting food poisoning. I get it every single time I eat here. I sit on the toilet cursing the bacon cheeseburger that my Grey Goose said would be a fantastic idea at 3 A.M. Then I become violently ill and curse some more. \n\nI actually give drunken protests when friends suggest this place after the bar. Only if they are really friends though. Otherwise I let them learn the hard way. \n\nMy friends and I actually prefer to go to My Friends instead. It's right up the street, a hell of a lot cleaner, and the food is way better. \n\nHowever if your idea of a kick ass hangover includes food poisoning, please, have a bacon cheeseburger.
