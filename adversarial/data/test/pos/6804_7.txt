Well where do I begin....well let me start with the entrance into this establishment. When you walk in you will immediately notice your walking into luxury....where hostess' are waiting to check your reservation and send you to movie heaven. Now if you not in the gold class seating where the chair recline...no worries...the other seats are just as comfortable. I went tonight because by becoming a new member back in December I got a free ticket that I couldn't use until now....due to the fact that I have been busy....not because the ticket said so.....didn't want you to be confused there. \n\nIf your hungry or thirsty they bring food made to order to you and drinks to...that you can enjoy while you are watching your movie. The have an outstanding restaurant there called Tanzy and for those of you who want a cocktail or just a simple beer they have a bar called Salt. The atmosphere and ambience is just fabulous....they even have a wine dispenser that let's you press a price on a touch screen and it dispenses the amount of wine your paying for right into your glass.\n\nNow here is my favorite part....and no offense to parents out there with children.....but if you go after 7:00 pm to any of the IPIC Theatre's NO KIDS ARE ALLOWED....you have to be over 21 to get in. Now at my age now that makes for good business because I would like to enjoy my movie in peace. So if your in the mood for good food....good drinks....a great atmosphere....and a great show....come to IPIC in The new Scottsdale Quarter....and you won't be disappointed. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!
