It's a small place, and we were a big group of ladies out for our once a month Ladies' Night Out.  We kinda took over the place and were a little loud, but that's because we were having such a good time and stuffing our faces on what turned out to be great food.  Since we all ordered what we wanted but ended up sharing, there was a big assortment of items to try.  \n\nThree friend and I shared a white pizza, which was scrumptious, and a large salad that, thankfully, was romaine and not iceberg, which had a very good ranch dressing that we had on the side.  There were other dressings to choose from.\n\nWe also got to sample the garlic knots, veggie pizza, and the calzone.  Everything was terrific, but the calzone was extra wonderful!  \n\nWhat I love most about Bambino's pizza is that the crust is not overly salty; so many other pizza joints drown their crusts in salt.  This one was perfect, and crispy, just the way I love it.  The white pizza had just the right amount of chopped garlic, creamy ricotta, and extra seasonings that bumped it up several notches in flavor.\n\nGreat service, too, from a family-owned establishment that I hope will be around for a long time.
