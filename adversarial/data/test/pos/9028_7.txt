Normally, I probably would've gone to tea station or some other place for tea\/boba, but Don and I made an agreement that we weren't going to go to any of our usual eating\/drinking spots together for the next three months. Because of that, we ended up here. We were both pretty skeptical about going inside because we couldn't help but be a little disturbed by the side by side signs: Good Feet Foot Massage - GF Coffee. Don't you just automatically assume that means Good Feet Coffee? We sure did.\n\nOnce you enter, to the left is a curtain that connects GF Coffee with the foot spa. A large group of men actually entered through the curtain while we were ordering. The place isn't decorated very well, but I think most people just go in and out anyway. We ended up ordering tapioca tea and a coconut slush w\/ boba. When we were waiting for the drinks, we overheard the group of guys talking about the stamp cards. They didn't even offer us any stamp cards when we ordered, so we had to go up to the girl to ask her about it, THEN she gave it to us, ugh. I probably would've given this place 3 stars because of the service, but both of our drinks were ammazing, especially the coconut drink and I don't usually like coconut. They were just so flavorful and pretty addicting. I definitely prefer the drinks here over Volcano Tea and Tea Station.
