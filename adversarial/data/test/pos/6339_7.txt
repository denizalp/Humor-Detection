Let me preface the review by declaring my love for the Fleury West neighborhood in Ahuntsic.\n\nThe streets are peaceful,  lots of trees and beautiful homes. Pretty close to central streets too.\n\nThere is a Parc nearby to enjoy a latte or just to take in area.\n\nThe prices are pretty reasonable but I have to try some of their other offerings.\n\nMost surprised to find the apple muffin was still good 3 days later after I forgot it in the car.
