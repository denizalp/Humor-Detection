What can I say about Segal's Market?  Once upon a time when I was a poor and starving student living in Montreal I shopped at Segal's every week.  Yes, it's grungy in there, and smells weird, and is full of salty people, but I was able to get bags of groceries that fed me for an entire week for about $10.  Admittedly that was a while ago, and I was a vegetarian back then, and I weighed less than 100 lbs, but hey I lived to tell this story.\n\nI was back at Segal's this past week, for a stroll down memory lane, and with the exception of some new security cameras and TV screens, it's exactly how I remembered it.  It's still poorly lit.  The refrigerated sections still have those yellowing plastic curtains.  The floors are still dirty and it still smelled weird.  Prices are a bit higher, but I would say keeping with inflation.  They stock a few more organic items now.\n\nThe bulk items used to just be in open tubs (like at Bulk Barn, minus the coverings), but are now in plastic garbage\/recycling bins, with lids, lol.  The \"scoops\" are plastic water jugs that are tied to the bins.  Most are cracked or broken.  I found this amusing.  \n\nThis place has apparently been around since 1927.  Maybe it's just nostalgia speaking, but I have a soft spot in my heart for its \"this is who I am, warts and all, take it or leave it\" attitude.
