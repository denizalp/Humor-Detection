Complete coincidence that it's four years later nearly to the day that we're back to Harry's for a late lunch. My lovely wife was in a mood for a cheeseburger and I remembered the great burger that I'd had here. \n\nThis time, I went with the club sandwich. Not the usual four cornered stack, instead served on a short sub roll but still with the usual cheese and ham and turkey plus lettuce and tomato and mayo. Quite good and improved with the sweet potato fries.\n\nService was excellent and the food was very good. It's still a challenge to find but they're in Ayrsley just past the YMCA. Street and parking deck available.
