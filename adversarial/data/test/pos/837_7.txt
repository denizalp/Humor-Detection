Heard about this place on tv, food network channel to be exact. I'm a huge FNC person so I had to try it. \n\nLets just begin with... \n\nTHE SERVICE HERE IS AWEFUL! \nI've come here 2 times & every time I have the service is horrid. You would think the young and pretty girls would have a bubbly outgoing personality. I mean, you are selling cupcakes for gods sake. How hard is that?! \n\nThe first time coming here the women (brown hair, maybe early twenties) was rude. She acted as if we were bothering her. She wasnt even polite. I was looking for a place to buy cupcakes for my baby shower. After seeing there prices and bad service I quickly ordered some (to try before ordering for my shower) and left. In the end they weren't worth the price in my opinion and i got cupcakes from somewhere else.\n\nIm the type of person to give second chances..\n\nSo i came back a 2nd time with my best friend, shes a total cupcake fanatic and wanted to try them. We bought a box of 12 which came to 48ish dollars. They were hit and miss. The champagne frosted one was disgusting! The lemon one was amazing! The chocolate one was alright, nothing special. Carrot cake is my favorite and their carrot cake cupcake was extremely dry. What a disappointment. Strawberry shortcake was nasty but the strawberry lemonade was simply delicious. Like I said before, hit and miss.\n\nThe second time the blonde girl was helping us but had no personality.. can we say walking zombie?
