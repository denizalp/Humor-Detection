Why's it called secret pizza? The place with no name.\n\nWhere you ask? Down the shady hall on the 3rd floor. That's all I've got.\n\nThis was such an amazing find. I would even consider going there NOT drunk. For all 10 minutes of that whilst in Vegas. It's just a hole in the wall with a few places to sit\/stand.\n\nGo.
