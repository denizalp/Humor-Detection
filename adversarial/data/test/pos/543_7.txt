Really good pizza!  Why do I like their pizza?\n\n1.  Thin crust\n2.  Great price on the Strip... all of their speciality pizzas are priced at $12.\n3.  Perfect size for two people at 11\"\n4.  I came here both times and ALL of the service staff were uber friendly and served me with Aloha!\n5.  Pizza took less than 10 minutes to arrive.\n6.  Plentiful toppings and flavor was excelllent.\n\nMy gripes?\n1.  No alcohol.  Not a big deal as there is a Fat Tuesday in the adjacent shop.\n2.  They close too early for me!  I wished they stayed open until 4am or so....\n\nI am starting to like MGM Grand and will probably stay there if not at the Cosmo, and if i do, i expect multiple visits to this pizzeria!
