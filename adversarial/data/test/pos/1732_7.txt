A good sized pool lounge, yes it's a lounge with a small pool in the middle, a few cabana areas around, there are some tiny plunge pools in cabana areas as well, they looked more like tanks to me actually. \n\nWe skipped the long line a little past noon on a Saturday cause we had friends throwing a small event there. The bag check was very strict, much more strict than regular pools at Aria. Absolutely NO any type of medications, not even the over the counter ones like tums, band aids, eye drops, Advil or even hand sanitizers! Of course no outside water, beverage, food or alcohol allowed, so put everything away before going in, or they will just take everything and throw them away! \n\nWe ordered bottle of Grey Goose, the pineapple mixer was exceptionally good! I drank so much of it with goose vodka! Also had some appetizers later on, the lobster tacos and shrimp cocktail were so fresh and delicious. Our servers were very attentive and friendly, took really good care of us the entire afternoon. Funny thing was the bartender at the bar asked for my ID when I tried to order a drink and charge to my room, but the other waitress didn't ask for hubby's ID when he ordered bottle of Grey Goose? What's up with that? They needed ID for a 30 bucks Mai Tai, but not a bottle of 500 bucks Goose vodka? It didn't make sense! \n\nI am not really into pool parties, I don't do well in heat, it wasn't even that hot that day, but I still got really dehydrated afterwards. It was fun time, good music, good crowd, all the single guys left me and my gf alone once I told them my husband was just over there. But no dancing on the tables or having my gf dancing on me, NOT allowed at all, thought this was sin city! Whatever!
