When the line at L'Avenue was too long to contemplate waiting in on a freezing rainy morning, we walked around Mont Royal until we found a place with no line and a table open under the window. My partner's Benedict was awesome, but my build-your-own potato\/brie\/mushroom crepe was less than stellar-- the potatoes were in huge chunks rather than slices and appeared to have been boiled rather than pan-cooked, and there wasn't nearly enough brie to balance out the dryness of the potatoes. However, the service was great, and I was too hungry to be too picky. And the coffee was great.
