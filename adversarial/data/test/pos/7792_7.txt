I heard through the grapevine the show was changed; however, It's still a sensual show that might offend someone who is conservative and private.  \n\nI am a flaming Christian who isn't afraid of her sensual side or flaming homosexual innuendoes.  \n\nI thought the show was fantastic filled with arousing art and human body muscular discipline.  \n\nMany people have many different personalities; therefore, if you are somewhat sensitive to see the Freudian sensual side of a Cirque Du Sole show... Than this won't be the show for you. \n\nEveryone in the middle or on the other side of the spectrum; you're gonna love this show and you, and your spouse, will enjoy the \"after party.\"
