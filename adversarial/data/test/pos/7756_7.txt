For an establishment that named themself \"Oolong\" I am bewildered as to why they have none of the utensils for sale or for use in store that the Chinese and Taiwanese traditionally brew Oolong tea in, namely the Yixing teapot. It makes me wonder what other corners are cut.\n\nOn their website they have Pu-Erh listed as an Oolong tea. Pu-Erh has never been classified as an Oolong tea in the history of Yunnan province, the point of origin. It is a post-fermented tea and is the only true black Chinese tea that they carry.\n\nI use Long Jing tea (Dragonwell) as my yardstick for boutique tea houses. Very few teas reveal as quickly as a Long Jing whether it has been stored properly and the quality of the leaf picked. Here I found slightly fermented LJ, an absolute no no because it ceases to be green tea once it ferments. My hunch is it was due to storage. Properly packed LJ comes with anti oxidant packs and my gut feeling is that their supplier by passed this. The taste was chlorophylly and bitter. I brew exclusively Gongfu in Yixing pots which assassinates an inferior tea. On the good side, they are not pretentiously selling this for $150 plus per pound unlike some other boutiques. They sell for $54 per pound.\n\nTheir DongDing Oolong was passable, but grown at too low an elevation to exite me. They claim 1000 to 2000 feet. The best teas are grown above 3600 feet. No indication as to spring or winter flush is given. My guess in winter because it lacks the finesse of spring flush. At about $75 per pound it is a tad overpriced. One can do better at Ten Rens, but not much better. This is good everyday table tea but not exciting.\n\nThe Pu-Erh is abominable. It is loose Pu-Erh which is generally inferior to Toa Cha and Beeng Cha pressed tea. This is shu Pu-Erh which means it is roasted before storage. It tastes between 3 and 5 years of age, Oolong claims 5. Even loose Pu-Erh absolutely must be aged, 10 years minimum. This Shu Pu was bitter and undeveloped. It lacked body as does all loose Pu-Erh. If you want to find good Pu-Erh that will age quickly, find a store that sells Shu (Black) Pu-Erh Beeng Chas (pressed cakes). Buy a young one and sit on it for 10 years, much more if you have the patience. Loose Pu-Erh does not age with grace.\n\nI cannot give this establishment more than two stars because the tradition of China or Taiwan they missed and the quality is utility grade.
