I love shopping at Club Monaco, but I find the Eaton's Centre location to be a bit small and crowded. If you want to do a more serious shop, head to this location on Bloor. It's not as busy and there are many more changerooms\/staff available. The mens section is a bit of a maze. If you're looking for more, there is a little hallway around the corner from the changerooms that takes you to more clothing. The secret back room also has those old Club  Monaco sweat shirts and long sleeve shirts that were really cool in 1998. The womens side has two floors and a separate pay desk downstairs that usually has a shorter line. Right now, half of the store is cashmere - mostly nude and cream-coloured cardigans, wrap-style sweaters, and shawls. I enjoy their blazers, classic blouses and accessories. \n\nStudents get 20% off.
