I'm not sure why all the negative reviews, but this place is nice & clean. It was a Hilton hotel prior to being bought by Westgate 3yrs ago in 2013. \n\nArrived at 6pm Saturday night, and it took me 4-5mins to check in. They have a concierge to assist you from the start (check in, walk you to room, adjust room temp). They go above and beyond helping you. I'm on the 26th floor (requested) and have a beautiful view facing the Vegas strip. The flat screen is XL mega huge \n\nI can't find anything to complain about
