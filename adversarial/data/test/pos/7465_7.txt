Bobby Flay, why oh why won't you let me chain you to my kitchen? I'd even gut my entire house to give you a kitchen worthy of your gifts. I would also expand the doors to accommodate my inevitable obesity.\n\nThe pisco sour and ketel one gimlet? Both wonderful.\n\nThe tiger prawn tamale appetizer? Amazing.\n\nI ordered the chile relleno - basic sounding, but stuffed with grilled eggplant and manchenga cheese, so not at all basic. My friend ordered the Ahi. Both were fantastic. Perfectly made. The food was unbelievable. The decor was cute. The service was top notch - if not beyond. They even had blankets available for those of us in ladyish type outfits that may have led us to be a bit chilly. It was no thing, they wrapped us in a red blanket, and kept the food coming.\n\nDamn near perfect meal.
