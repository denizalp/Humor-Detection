Will never go back there!!  My husband and I went there without a reservation at 6:09 pm and was told that since we didn't have a reservation she could take us but we have to make sure that we are out of there by 7:30 pm. After the hostess told me that, I looked over at the dining room and there were at least six empty tables. RUDE!!!  We will go to Nora's.  Thanks!!
