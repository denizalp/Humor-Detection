Came in for lunch on a hot weekday. I'm not a big fan of AYCE sushi but Sushi House Goyemon also offers lunch specials. Parking was easy to locate. I arrived after the lunch hour began and the place was near capacity for lunch.\n\nI opted for the lunch sashimi special which was reasonably priced and included miso soup, rice and salad. The quality of sashimi was unfortunately A-ok with the exception of the salmon which was the tastiest and ended my meal with a generous portion of green tea ice cream. \n\nAnother con was the spotty service - I had to flag down the waitress for assistance and also request dessert! Not sure if they were having a off day here but I probably wouldn't return here again.
