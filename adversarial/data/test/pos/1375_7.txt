The Warm Apple Crisp w\/ vanilla ice cream & oatmeal crumbles is the very BEST!  A must!  First!\n\nThe Chilled Shrimp & Crab Louis was amazing!  I love the presentation & how all of it combines so well.. the herbed remoulade, marinated cherry tomatoes, avocados were better than any Louis I have ever had.  Kudos to the chef!\n\nGrilled Ribeye was cooked to perfection w\/ a wonderful red wine au jus, fresh time & the caramelized shallots offered a nice flavoring, even tho I did not eat them.  The mash potatoes under the Ribeye almost tasted like a polenta, so flavorful!  \n\nThe Grilled Octopus was a chef's special & as long as I have supported Wolfgang Puck restaurants he changes his menu up seasonally, like a Spagos for instance, I fall in love w\/ something & next time it's gone.  These creations are absolutely mouthwatering.  The Grilled octopus & potato melt in your mouth.  \n\nThankfully the chef could make the Shrimp Fettuccine that I am so in love w\/!!  The buttery Fettuccine, Scampi Style Shrimp & that garlic is where it's at!\n\nNot a fan of the Italian Sausage Pizza.  It was overwhelmed by caramelized red onions.  The cr√©me fraiche, mozzarella, garlic & Fresno peppers gave it a nice touch so next time, no onions for me.  \n\nThank you Chef Puck & chef's we don't see that truly deserve the credit.  Wish all things could remain the same & I am looking forward to the new one at Caesar's Forum Shops.
