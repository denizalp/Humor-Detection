I love the staff here at Gloria Jeans. Theyre all friendly and always greet you with a smile.  They brew different varieties of coffee daily and always give you great recommendations on flavors.  If you're in a hurry...they're guaranteed to get you in and out in a heartbeat.  Tis' the season to try all their holiday flavors.. Simply delish. So stop in to get your coffee fix!
