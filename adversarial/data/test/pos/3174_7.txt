Wow! The reviews for this place are all over the board. I guess it's like anywhere, it depends on the associate\/ salesman that you get.\n\nPurchase: I had a couple of good associates. Dan (who's been promoted now) sold me a RAV4. He was patient and tenacious. We worked out a fair trade in value and a good price on the new vehicle. They even went outside their normal sales agreement area to get the car colors inside and out that I wanted. The finance guy was a bit of an a$$ and the rate not very competitive but I knew I would be paying it off quickly. That gentleman no longer works there so I'm assuming there were some other complaints. Fast forward and we almost bought a second vehicle there from a different associate but we weren't totally in love with the vehicle.\n\nService: So far I've had good service ( I do miss Volvo in Hickory where you were treated like a king). This place is busy and the service area churns and burns. Everyone has been friendly and wait times have been okay to sometimes longer than usual. I've had oil changes, tire rotations and a warranty part replacement on my lift gate. So far so good.
