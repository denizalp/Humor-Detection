Happy with my dog's stay here.\n\n\nI arrived to vegas and decided to put my baby in a pet hotel. When i arrived to this place I was very nervous and uneasy about leaving my dog in someone else's care. It is very hard for me to trust others with my dog and Luxe Pet Hotel made me feel so much at ease. They let me tour the different type of rooms and play areas. They have very spacious play areas and they take note on your type of dog size and how well they get along with other dogs. They also have a big indoor play area for when weather doesn't permit them to be out doors. There is a big room where you can put multiple dogs if you have more than one pet. It has a queen size bed and TV. The smaller rooms are 4x4 feet with a smaller tv and couch. They also have a grooming room and massage table.\n\nThe prices are reasonable and you can choose between day care which requires you to pick up your pet by 6pm or over night option and pick up the day of by 11am. \n\nThey also have a wonderful pet boutique inside with luxe items (Burberry, Louis V, Chanel, Juicy Couture, Couture) Beautiful selection at great prices\n\nThey called my dogs vet to verify updated-shot records. My dog is NOT fixed and they took her still but will monitor her play time. After the paperwork I felt much more comfortable. When i picked her up she was happy and looked fine. They also text you pictures of your pet during their stay and play time.\n\nI would definitely come again to luxe per hotel if i needed.\n\nI would give the following tips \n- Bring your dog a blanket or their own bed if they are not used to being on other furniture\n- if your dog eats particular food be sure to drop the appropriate serving amount\n-leave and email or phone number to recieve updates
