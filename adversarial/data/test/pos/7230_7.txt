One admission price gets you into the Dolphin Habitat and the Secret Garden (listed separately however and will review on it's own) . For 2 adults and 2 children, the price was $69.  Many other Yelp reviews commented that the dolphins appeared sad and mistreated.  I cannot read dolphin emotions and did not see any outward evidence of abuse.  I just thought the whole place looked old and sad. You can watch the dolphins in the first pool from above or below. There was a second pool where some trainers were hanging around with the dolphins   They answered some questions but I did not find them to be particularly enthusiastic, informative or knowledgeable.  Before we left they started a \"show\" highlighting the people who had paid the big bucks to be \"dolphin trainers for the day\".   Well, I don't think they really learned to train so well because the tricks the Dolphins did were pretty weak.  \n\nI recall visiting Dolphin Habitat about 20 years ago and being very impressed.  However, I don't think anything has changed about this place since then. It really needs a huge maker-over. This is a very poor value (even with the Secret Garden)  and I would not recommend it.
