I am vegetarian twice a week for religious reasons (Don't even go there) so i was very excited about this place.One lazy Monday afternoon i decided to give them a try.\n\nI got the samosas $6 (stuffed with curried potatoes, peas, carrots and fresh garlic) served with a tamarind dip.\nThai peanut bowl $8.50 (sauteed vegetables,mock chicken with pan fried noodles).\nThyme fries $3 (one of the most popular items on their menu).\n\nThe samosas are an epic failure,i'd rather go to an Indian restaurant to get them.\nThe thai noodle bowl was filling and the fries were good.The USP of this place i would say is the fact that they are Vegan and offer a Gluten free menu.The food is reasonably priced with decent portions.They also have outdoor seating.\n\nCheers!
