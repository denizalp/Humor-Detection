I went here last night to meet up with a girlfriend that I grew up with.  We haven't seen each other since we were kids at camp, and we ended up dining here.\n\nI guess this place has two seating areas.  One appears to be more of a restaurant, and the other seems to be more of a bar area.  Both are upscale and classy, but I am not sure why they split it up.  \n\nAnyways, the resturant area was jam packed, but our party sat in the Bar north location.  We sat in the patio area.  Fortunately, they had heat lamps to keep us warm.\n\nThe menu here seemed to be fine, with pasta, pizzas, and a more upscale choice of food.  Great alcohol selection to choose from.  I went with the angel hair pasta and marinara sauce.  The waiter informed me that I could add chicken or shrimp to my dinner.  I went with the chicken.\n\nThe food came out and it was well presented.  The salad that my Girlfriend had seemed to be a small portion, which didnt impress me.  it was like a spoonful of salad.\n\nMy dinner was actually very tasty, but the chicken that came with my pasta was whole, and I had to cut it up into chunks. I guess thats fine, I just found it odd that the chicken was not mixed in with the pasta?  The food was tasty though!  I inhaled it!\n\nAnyways, I really liked this place, but the service was just okay.  Our server sucked at refilling drinks. I had to ask him twice for water, and remind him every single time that my pop was running low.  He never once took it upon himself to refill my water. I hate running out of beverages, AND having to ask for refills!  The place is very well decorated though.  Nice interior!\n\nWill return, since its worth my time, but a little pricey.
