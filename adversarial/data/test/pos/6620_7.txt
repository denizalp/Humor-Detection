Well at least the food was really good. It was a Bean & Cheese conundrum! The service here is soooo terrible I can't imagine going back. Went in on Thursday 1\/19,at 4pm and I encounter \"Terror\" this young Hispanic lady with the look of death. \nShe asks what we want so we all order then my daughter asked for a torta with only beans and cheese.  Terror informs my daughter that they don't have bean and cheese tortas on the menu. I tell her that I know but can I just ordered a carne asada torta but with only beans and cheese.  \nWe spent about 5mins going back and forth about the torta. She advices us against ordering a bean and cheese torta because she will still have to charge us like $7.00 for it.  I said that's fine but it will make my daughter happy.  She finally said OK and I told her specifically no lettuce or any other items just beans, cheese and bread. Order comes with beans, cheese, bread,  and lettuce and butter.  \nHonestly if not for her terrible service and that bad torta this place would be rated 5 stars as a fast food joint. \nMy advice: stick that lady in the back somewhere far away from communication with paying customers.
