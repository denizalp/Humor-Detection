I really enjoy the miserable and rude staff, it's such a nice and refreshing contrast to the usual polite and kind customer service I receive at most other places I shop.  \n\nI plan on remortgaging my house so that I can continue to shop here and pay top dollar for average products!\n\nKeep up the mediocre work! :)
