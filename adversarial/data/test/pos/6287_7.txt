Went to the Social Security office in Mesa to get a replacement card. When I got there found out that they no longer do that. I had a choice of going up to Tatum in north Phoenix or this office in downtown Phoenix. You have got to be kidding! With a large county like Maricopa and there are only 2 locations to get social security cards!!! \nSo, I drove from the Mesa social security office to this one in a sketchy neighborhood in inner city Phoenix. The only pro was that they did have free parking. The department for social security cards is on the second floor. There is a security agent to search your purse. You enter option 1 in the kiosk to get a numbered ticket and start you MVD style wait. They call you by the number on your ticket. There were 18 windows but less than half of them were open. After a 20 minute wait I was called to a window with a young man who looked like he would rather be anywhere but at that window.\nI had all of my required documentation and already had the application for a new card filled out. They don't actually issue any social security cards here--they just give you a receipt and tell you that your card will be mailed snail mail to your home in about 2 weeks.\nI was very glad to get out of there.
