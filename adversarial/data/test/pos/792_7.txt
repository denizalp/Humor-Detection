I have yet to be disappointed by a meal here! It's one of the few places where the sweet tea tastes authentic and since there are free refills, it's a smorgasbord of beverage for me! I love the brisket sub and would probably try to live on that if the sodium and calorie content wouldn't kill me in less than a month. Yum!
