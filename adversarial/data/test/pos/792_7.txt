Omg!! What a show. Im still drooling over the weekend show. Them men!! God's neatest work. They were so good. Ryan was personal favorite but all of them had their own speciality. It's the best place to begin your girls night out. I went there with my girl friends and we had the most amazing time. The stage was on fire. I would go there again and again and again.
