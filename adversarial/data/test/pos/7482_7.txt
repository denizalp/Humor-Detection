The Eggery is the exact same franchise as the Good Egg down at Park Central, just fussied up with a different name. Exact. Same. Menu. Bleh. Had I known, I would have just taken a stroll through the gayborhood to get to the Good Egg, where there is outdoor seating, the people watching is superior, and the pigeons have balls the size of grape tomatoes.\n\nAlas, the Eggery is the Good Egg's fat, dorky older sister. The service is completely adequate -- nothing horrific, nothing staggering. The food is average, but somehow always arrives cold. At our last visit, there was a metric shit ton of people waiting (including a sweet aging tranny in a muumuu, chartreuse ankle socks, and chunky black heels) but the restaurant proper was only half full, if that. Why? \n\nNeedless to say, I won't be back. There's too many other amazing breakfast places in Phoenix and way too few precious available weekend mornings...
