If you have ever read my reviews the one thing about them is that they are strictly honest. No sugar coating involved-\nLet's start with Atmosphere - open and very nice, friendly feel.. Actually excited for this experience-- \nSat down... Waited maybe a few minutes for a waiter\/ waitress to approach ask us what we would like to drink-- Tea is not Free you have to pay \/ wasn't told \/ that usually means it's not a true authentic Asian Resturant- but I know times are changing. Went to order the tapas but noticed they were very pricey- opted for the all-you-can-eat sushi instead--I critique a restaurant on very simple things, Time I get my food\/ how it's presented, if it's hot or cold, and finally the taste.\nBland is the word I would use, for all the tapas I tried. \nWent to order Hamachi Kama on a Saturday night now at 6pm and your Sold Out?? really- ok- but u should tell people who order all you can eat-- that some items are sold out ahead of time-- very rude to just find out-\nNow this is where it gets scary-- \nOrder my sushi, the usual hamachi, bland, red snapper, bland- just no taste of the fish or maybe it's because they Slice the Fish so Thin that I just tasted the rice it was on? \nOrder soft shell crab- it was great! Ordered Kalbi rock STARK cold-- sent it back.. Sad...\nObviously precooked, but ur not busy? Just pure laziness in a kitchen. \nThe Amebi shrimp, sweet shrimp.. Just no taste...\nFinally I ordered the most simple but yet tastiest things that I always order- Masago with Uzura- egg with Quail egg- I love this but this is what actually happened... I go to order and Waiter tells me, \" oh we are sold out of Quail egg\" I think ok, nothing new about this place, everything sold out... Done with dinner ordered dessert and out comes a waitress with 6 pieces of Masago with Quail Egg-- WTH!! I call her over and ask, is that Quail Egg, she says Yes... Wow.... So I don't wanna be racist but that was the most Racist thing I ever experienced in a Resturant. The table with Pure blood Asians who speak your language get what you told me, the white half blood and don't speak ur language, was Sold out... What is that?? I confront you by asking why they got Quail egg? And your answer is to smile - and ask if there is anything else we want. No. No- never again, will I be apart of that... Mortified is the word I wanted to use but posting it here feels like justice. Wow-- yah, service was Great! Not..
