What is up with hair stylists, nail techs, and massage therapists constantly moving around in this town?! As soon as I find one I like, they move and I have to follow them to a new salon. Luckily, Adrianna Hernandez's hair skills are totally worth any drive.\n\nEnter MSS and find a small lobby- a screen shows who is available for walk in services and which stylists are in which rooms. Use the touchpad to buzz in and make your way to their assigned room. It reminded me of a dorm of beauty services- lashes, nails, and various hair services all available under one roof from different staff. Building is nicely decorated, rooms are clean. Metal and glass partitions separate service areas and keep the space from feeling closed in. I like the concept!\n\nAdrianna is amazing with hair- color, cut, and style were all awesome.  Her work is on IG @adrixhairz and I highly recommend booking in advance. Appointment went quick because she's so easy to talk to, and I left looking and feeling a million times better- isn't that why we come to places like this in the first place?! I can't recommend her enough.
