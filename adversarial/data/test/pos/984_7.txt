This place! \n\nI swear that when the *ahem* server came over to take our order, she was going to ask me \"Hey, baby. You got girlfriend Vietnam?\" The skintight, purple uniforms the ladies wear barely cover them. Apparently, this is a place to see and be seen. And you'll see more than you'd care to. Which is a shame, because the food was damn good. \n\nI generally make all attempts not to have a romantic dinner with my wife at a place that fancies itself a club. Fail on that one, as I was a stranger in a strange land. It seems to be a bit of an epidemic around town. A huge table was set up next to us and a stag party sat down for bottle service. At $500 a pop for Grey Goose, I guess someone just got their signing bonus. Service was awful. Already filled glasses of wine were tended to, while empty water glasses were ignored. I've seen that game before. Dishes were basically just dumped at the table. On top of that, everything was very expensive. \n\nAs I said, the food was excellent. We started with the Caprese salad made with buffala mozzarella and heirloom tomatoes. Good start, but needed more than one leaf of basil. We both got pastas as our mains. Which, even in the $30-40 range, seemed like the bargains on the pricey menu. Fettuccine with lobster, artichokes, porcinis and tomatoes in a lobster bisque for the lady. Pappardelle with sausage, rapini, smoked cheese and heirloom tomatoes for me. These were both great and my dish was just what I was looking for. Dolci was fantastic as well. Triple chocolate hazelnut bread pudding with white chocolate and praline wafer and oven roasted coffee ice cream. Yep, it was every bit as good as it sounds. By the end, we were stuffed with a very satisfying meal. \n\nI went out for a nice dinner and ended up at a club. You know what they say about a Jack of all trades.
