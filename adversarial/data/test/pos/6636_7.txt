This is probably a 4.5 star review, but there really wasn't anything to gripe about, so let's ring in the New Year with 5 stars! \n\nI've been interested in visiting Maestro's Ocean Club for quite some time. I'm a seafood lover, and a lover of fine dining, so it is right up my alley.\n\nLocated in Crystals, the layout is interesting. You simultaneously have the feeling of being in the mall, yet separated from it. There is a dome of sorts as the ceiling, so shoppers cannot see inside and gawk at the diners, but the diners can somewhat see out into the mall. Tables are a smidge close for comfort, but that's just a personal preference.\n\nService, as expected, was wonderful. Our server was friendly, personable, knowledgeable and professional without being overbearing. There is an extensive cocktail list, and I enjoyed my cocktail- \"Strawberry Dream\", which is very sweet, but I like sweet drinks.\n\nFor an appetizer, we split the lobster cocktail, which ended up being more meat than originally expected based on the presentation. Although the server warned us about the heat\/kick of the \"atomic horseradish\", it actually was quite bearable, and complimented the lobster well.\n\nI opted for the crab cakes as my entree, and they were also quite good. Perhaps not the best crab cakes I've ever had, but certainly a fine showing. They perhaps could have used a bit more seasoning, or some of the horseradish, but they were full of meat, and the little filler held things together well. We got a side of the Gorgonzola Mac and cheese, and wow!! Huge portion, and holy cheese, batman! Super cheesy!! Really good, very mild though. \n\nFor dessert,  we split the butter cake, and it was melt in your mouth good. Seriously. The homemade whipped cream along with the ice cream may have been overkill, but if you're going to do dessert, might as well go all out! \n\nOf course, Maestro's is on the expensive side of things, but if you want a solid seafood fine dining experience, I wouldn't shy away from it.
