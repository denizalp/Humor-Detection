This is for the Brendon Movies only... I just love their 3-D IMAX... It's the best in town! I've seen all the big movies here & enjoyed all of them... Just got out of Star Trek Beyond & am thoroughly HAPPY!!! They also have daily specials like 2 for $22 on Tuesdays that include tickets, popcorn & drinks or $8 Thursday's that include one ticket, one drink & one popcorn; of course, these specials only work for standard movies, but it's still a great deal!!!
