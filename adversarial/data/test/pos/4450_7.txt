Devious and untrustworthy!\nI learned a few things this past trip to Las Vegas on how Wyndham tries to sell you a timeshare. I will admit, at first I had an open mind for it. The more I listened to the presentation, the more it made since. But let me walk you through how my experience went. \n\nFirst, when I checked into the Flamingo, I was greeted by a gentleman that offered to take me and my girlfriend to our room. On the way there, he offered us some free Cirque du Soleil tickets or some other prizes. Our curiosity got the best of us. He took us to a girl on the counter were she explained that all we had to do was sit in a presentation for 2 hours. He asked for our ID's. I offered my military ID (a pretty legit federal ID might I add), which he wouldn't accept. So we gave him our drivers licenses. Unbeknownst to us, he was probably running a \"soft\" credit check on both of us. So we go the next day to this presentation\/meeting, and they pair us up with a person that has some \"similarities\" to us -- from California. The funny part is that they pair everyone with a person who has some sort of connection. Hispanics with hispanics, blacks with blacks. The presentation ends and it is time for them to SELL. Our salesman, Michael S. from San Diego, starts with \"what do you think\", and yada yada. He presents us with a fictitious number in their system to figure out how long it would take to pay off the timeshare and how much we would \"save\" if we took the offer. Also, he would ask these funny questions like, \"is saving money something you would be interested in\"? Even after showing us this luxurious suite with a view, he would ask, \"is staying in a place like this something you'd be interested in?\" It's just their tactic to keep you saying yes so you can get used to it. (I'll give it to them, they are very creative, even using monopoly money to show how it works; it's for the visual people). When asked if he had one, he gave us a story about how he travels for this company so he doesn't need one.  I think if I would have rolled my eyes a little harder, they would have fallen off my face. Anyways, we're both still a little skeptical, and besides, we went to Vegas to celebrate my girl's birthday, not to get in debt $26,250 with an extremely high interest rate of 17.99%. I kept asking questions, to get these numbers out of him, and his response to me was, \"With all due respect, the offer is for her. You are not even qualified for this\". I mean, this one cracked me up because all I was asking were questions that normal people would ask. Besides, I was SUPER glad that this was not something I qualified for. Well, at this point we were 2.5 hours into the whole deal and were completely irritated. Don't just take my word for it, look at all the other reviews! Search 'Wyndham timeshare reviews'. We didn't even ask if we could write a check for the whole amount, but I'm sure they wouldn't want you to.  Even though this clown said they are not a bank, I am sure that they would really enjoy the profits from that interest like a bank. On top of that, the guy giving the presentation mentioned that they would not try to force you to buy because the are already rich. They actually are, they own hotel and motel chains like Super 8, Motel 6, Howard Johnson, etc., but they sure want you to sign that contract. Let me not forget, right when we were finishing, he asks her to fill out this form with her information and sign it. Of course she decided not to, but his response to her questioning it was, \"so we can track you\". I wish I was joking! First and last time we will take anything of some value for free. They still call her until this day, so if you're sitting there now trying to find out if you should take this deal, they will continue calling you years after you leave. Sorry.\n\nThink of it as a car dealership. The salesman is not your friend, he is trying to take as much money from you as he can. Watch out for these devious people. All that glitters is not gold.
