So delicious! I've been to China town for Korean bbq and this place blows away the competition. The food is delicious, the service excellent and kind, the atmosphere is fantastic with great music and everything is awesome. My go to spot for Korean bbq. Yuhao and Kevin were extremely nice and helpful with choices on the meat. They really know how to take care of you. Highly recommend to come here
