Good - I like the decor. The staff seated us quickly. The menu has some very tasty items. \n\nBad - no paper towels in the men's restrooms. Makes a person wonder about the staff hygiene issues...\n\nAsked for a straw with my water & got a condescending \"we try to conserve\" from the server. She never produced the straw...had ask another staff member & he produced them with them in his bare hands. Gross! \n\nCoffee was good but could have enjoyed more without all of the coffee grinds at the bottom of my cup...grr! Mentioned it to my server...only got a apology.  Any manger will tell that coffee should have been comped...\n\nSausage was cold.  While portions were adequate, it didn't make up for the poor service.
