First of all, a big shout out to Auntie Nadine for taking me here for the first time.  Definitely a sense of community is the feeling you get when you see almost an entire town gather to donate to their community, share their holiday spirit, and experience the lighting of the cactus garden. \n\nIt was also pretty awesome to hear the Las Vegas Philharmonic perform  (please bump up the volume next time ) and for Penn and Teller to be up on stage.   Plus,  you get to meet Santa.  Well only one of us got to sit on his lap!\n\nView my photos.  It is so pretty here at the 25th Cactus Garden Lighting 2018!\n\nWonderful holiday spirit all around!  Thanks Auntie Nadine,  my Belle, Alana, Marlina!
