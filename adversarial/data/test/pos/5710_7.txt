This one is in a basement next to 7 West Cafe. \n\nThe staff is SUPER friendly here and the prices are on par with your typical Vietnamese nail salon (Pedi $25, Mani $15, both for $35). \n\nThe place is cramped though and they only have two spa pedi chairs so waiting is probable. \n\nAlso, the spa chair was out-of-fucking-control and the \"massage\" felt more like I was riding a mechanical bull. Maybe that's why my nails weren't painted quite perfectly.\n\nOverall, OK if you are in the neighbourhood but not worth going out of your way for. Better options in Yorkville if you have the $$
