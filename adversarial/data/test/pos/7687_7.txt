Truly A-OK and just fine. I came here for a party which was reasonably well-organized, and fun. The lanes were in good shape, though occasionally we needed to restart a frame. Getting help on occasion wasn't too hard to find, though checking in at the beginning was confusing and understaffed.\n\nThe smoke residue of the casino below is definitely present, but not intense. Still, if you have any smoke-aversion, you might want to rethink your destination.\n\nI liked the electronic scorecard well enough, though I did miss the graphic arrows indicating the bowler's suggested path for the second ball. Can't say I bowl all that much anymore, but that's something that I thought was a given.\n\nCan't attest to the price of the games (or the party) since I was a guest. The rental shoes were fine, the selection of bowling balls was decent, if not huge.\n\nCame here many years ago, and was glad to see it's still thriving. I look forward to another couple of games soon.
