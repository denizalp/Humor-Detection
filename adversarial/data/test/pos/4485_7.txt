Tucked into the corner of The Churchill is a bright, airy, and minimalist room sporting a conspicuous set of wine racks. After stepping in, I was greeted by a lone man with nothing but a tablet and a clear passion for his product. His name is Chris, a former wine wholesaler who decided on branching out on his own. Affable and casual, he makes browsing wines simple and enjoyable. Like some sort of street-smart sommelier. Just tell him what tastes good to you, what you're willing to pay, and he'll provide exactly what you need. \n\nWhat's great about Chris is he's really invested in procuring wines that meet high standards. He is fond of Biodynamic wines--a term I was unfamiliar with, but have come to love. He'll be happy to explain that better than I can. His selection also avoids added sugars, and is low in sulfites across the board. He really wants to avoid wine that may cause headaches--and while he professes this literally, it happens to be figuratively true as well. \n\nI was never so excited to bring a bottle home to my family. I asked for a smoky red, reminiscent of a Malbec, and it was everything I'd hoped for. My family includes particularly health-conscious people who are sensitive to the unsavory ingredients Chris avoids. They agreed this was a great tasting bottle that left them with no regrets. \n\nI have many lessons to learn about enjoying wine, but that's OK. I've got a trustworthy entrepreneur in the business, and as long as he's around I don't feel like I can go wrong.
