Prices are straight up insulting. \n\n$14.99 for a lb of wings, the girl says its strictly 8 wings per pound. So 16 wings for more than $32 after tax and they have the nerve to even charge extra AGAIN for asking for lots of sauce\n\nUsed to be my favorite place, but the menu prices make me sick now
