It's tempting to want to talk poorly about this place, what with its location and its tendency for questionable characters. The fact of the matter is that the reason I keep coming to the events here is that there is no such thing as a bad seat here. It feels so intimate and the stage spins, so at some point, you will have the BEST view.\n\nYes, it's true that the seats are close together, but isn't this the case at most venues? If this gets me closer to the stage and gives me the ability to see the artist without having to look at a giant screen, then I am in.\n\nThey have recently renovated it, along with their club area downstairs and it is much improved. Their drinks are decent and the bartenders have been friendly in my experience. I have not had to wait too long in line for tickets or to wait to go through security, as long as I get there on time.\n\nOn thing, perhaps the most important thing, is that the sound is inconsistent. I have been there on several occasions in which they had trouble with the sound and had to adjust it. It makes me wonder whether this is the responsibility of the venue or of the artist not having gone through a sound check. Either way, this needs to be fixed pronto please!
