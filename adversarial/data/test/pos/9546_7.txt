Went in for their grand opening special of $9.95 AYCE on 4\/21\/18. Arrived opening time, got seated promptly. Started with appetizers crab pockets (crab rangoon) and shrimp tempura. Taste as usual. \n\nNext onto our main course of AYCE sushi. Ordered 4 different types of nigiri and 5 different half orders of sushi. Waited 30 mins to an hour and we only got one sushi order out if all that we ordered. Other people who came in minutes after us were getting there order nonstop and we had nothing at all but one plate. \n\nI made a complaint and asked another waiter what the heck was going on, we haven't received nothing. Our waiter did not even bother to check up on us at all. Multiple waiters were taking orders and so confused as to what table those orders be delivered. Guests next to us were also waiting, so ridiculous! A different waiter went ahead to retake our order and we lost total patience, waited and waited more. So we decided to not support a penny and we took our business elsewhere. Never have I experienced such horrible, and unorganized Japanese AYCE sushi in Vegas. Sushi cruise was overhyped with their grand opening special. I have decided to continue eating at my fave AYCE sushi over on Spring Mtn. as they are better with their prompt customer service, and presentable quality of food.  \n\nThis same day I also shared this special they had going on to friends and fam but immediately told them not to come after our horrible experience. \n\nTo further a successful outcome with your business, you must get organized and be professional with your guests. I've been a waitress before and matter of fact we all are customers... who wants to wait almost an hour for AYCE sushi order? Menu specifies 90 min eating limit also. Does not make sense. You will not get your money's worth here at all folks! Be advised to go elsewhere! It is not at all possible to rate with no stars so the 1 star rating ain't true. This business deserves no star.
