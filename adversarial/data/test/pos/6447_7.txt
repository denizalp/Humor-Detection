I have been excited to check this place out. We stopped today to use our Pogo pass. We must have arrived at a busy time because the front cashier area was extremely unorganized. There was only one cashier that was able to check pogo pass people in while three other workers stood around.  When I finally got to the counter the cashier walked away and filled a bag of popcorn and delivered it to the bowling area. She did this with a long line of people waiting and the other cashiers just stood there. There seemed to be a lack of direction and poor customer service.
