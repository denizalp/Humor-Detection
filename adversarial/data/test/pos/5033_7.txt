When we first arrived we really liked our suite. It over looked the private pool area. \n\nAs the days went on, it really became a major pain in the ass to get to this tower from anywhere. Nothing is close to it, and the two elevators it takes along with the long hallway walks, leave much to be desired.\n\nIt also had this odd yellow colouring to it which really shows up in any photos you take. \n\nThey acted like giving us this suite in this tower was an upgrade. However we asked to be switched to the other tower, which was ( for us anyway ) much better. \n\nBesides all that, the room was pretty nice. It had a huge bathroom with separate tub and shower, vanity table for doing your make up, separate toilet, and his and her sinks. \n\nI didn't care much for the bath products they provided. Nor did we appreciate one ply toilet paper ! \n\nThe suite itself is a decent size. We had a king size bed and it was pretty comfy. There is also a large dresser so lots of room ( along with closet ) to unpack your clothes.\n\nThere is 2 TVs - one for the bedroom\nAnd one down in the sunken living room area. There is no fridge and the ice bucket was rather small. \n\nIf I came back I certainly would not stay at this tower, but it would be good for people who want a more secluded area away from\nIt all!
