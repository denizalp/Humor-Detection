I've been to a fair share of performances at the Overture and it's of course a beauty of a  venue. Just pass by it on State Street and you'll know this is one impressive building.  \n\nThe Overture gives merit to the adage 'beauty attracts beauty' since this gorgeous place is always lit up with shows that are just as stellar. I was here for Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat (thanks to yelp!) and for the Broadway play Chicago last year, and both of these stood out as lovely performances in a setting that perfectly suited their brilliance. \n\nI'm typically not a big show-goer, but I find myself at more and more shows simply because they're held at the Overture. Doesn't take much to drag me there. Forever impressed!
