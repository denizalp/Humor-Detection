Went again, three times since my last visit, and we brought 5 other friends.  It was great as usual.  Service was lightning fast and the portions just right.  Our friends also enjoyed the food and  atomsphere.   All of us were returning customers except for one couple who loved the sevice and delicious morsels on their first visit.  They will be returning.  \n  We had osyter shooters, nigori-zake, salmon kama, salmon skin hand rolls, spicy tuna hand rolls, and varieties of sashimi.
