It is not as good as the New York one. That is a fact. That said, this New York girl went for the nostalgia and guess what? It fit the bill. The servers dress like the NY ones; the menu is darn near identical as are the to-go bags. The pickles on the table are 100% authentic.\n\nTrue, the matzoh ball soup was dismal but the Jeff's favorite - a potato knish topped with pastrami and swiss -- hit the spot and was made better by the authentic deli mustard on the table.\n\nCons: The people next to us putting MAYO on their pastrami sandwich\nBad matzoh balls\n\nPositives: NY vibe. Homey feeling. Effort for authenticity. Pickles! Unlike their NY brethren, they take credit cards! Put that in your pipe and smoke it.
