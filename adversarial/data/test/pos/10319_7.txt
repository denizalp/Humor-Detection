Super cute shop . Once we entered the grumpy man behind the counter didn't even say hi he just asked in an annoyed way if we were all together ?!?! Maybe because my hubby is white and I'm brown and our kids look in between I have no idea . For a place that is somewhat like a ghost town it seems the people behind the counter would be a little nicer to their patrons . Next time I'll just go to The seasons market and grab some ice cream for the kids . They aren't grumpy . \nOh and gelato is just ok . We've had better :)
