I found the Drago Sisters Bakery, I found the Drago Sisters Bakery.  I want to keep shouting it!\n\nOn the way back to the freeway from Lazy Joe's Fish and Chips, I saw this small shop in a plaza when it was too late to stop.  I made a decision to do a U at the light at the freeway (perfectly legal), and I doubled back and was thrilled when they were open.  I think I put on a few pounds just looking at those delightful pastries in the cases.\n\nAfter getting a sample of the mini très leches, I was hooked.  She reeled me right in with that freebie.  It's heaven!  I got 4 items to go--3 cake truffles; one red velvet, one coconut, and one pumpkin.  I couldn't let the 4th little area go empty so I got a mini très leches to round out the container.  Wow!  Everything is so good.\n\nI think my tongue touched the floor when I saw the red velvet cheesecake.  A word of advice:  the sisters are on the wrong side of Rainbow for many people.  Try not to go here on a Friday evening at 5 PM!  It took me three lights to get on the freeway, but my lovelies are sitting in the refrigerator to be consumed judiciously and with great relish!\n\nThanks, Ken!!!
