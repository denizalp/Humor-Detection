Really a great club--especially if you come at the right time of year and enjoy the outdoors! Came for Halloween and it sure was cool to see all the awesome costumes! Music, atmosphere and drinks are awesome! Only qualm I have is how packed it gets, and the place is already huge! Plus, the crowd it attracts doesn't seem to be the classiest, but not sure that's possible in a club... or is it?
