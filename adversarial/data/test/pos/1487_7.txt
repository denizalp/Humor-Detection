I knew when I saw the reviews here, I just had to stop in!  The restaurant itself is tiny, I'd try to come here before, or after the dinner rush so you don't have to wait too long.  We ended up waiting about 20 minutes before we got sat.  \n\nThere is not a full bar here, just beer and wine.   My bf and I decided to split the mac and cheese, and the pizza (which has no meat.)  The mac and cheese was a home run and was the perfect combo of sweet and spicy.  The \"ham\" that comes on top of it is more like shredded pork.  We ordered their home made tobasco sauce to add to it for an additional spice, which I highly recommend doing.  The pizza was just okay, very underwhelmed.  It was really bland and similar to a bruchetta type pizza and came with a huge dallop of cheese on it.  Pass on this dish.  Dessert we shared a tiny mason jar \"cheesecake\" with a apricot type of sauce.  This didn't really had the texture of cheesecake, but still had a good flavor.  I think it would be better would some type of crust layer at the bottom.  We also shared their maple cake which was really yummy and had a strong maple flavor.  It would have been good with some vanilla ice cream.\n\nService was quick, attentive, and friendly.  If you decide to come here don't leave without trying the winner of the night, the mac and cheese!
