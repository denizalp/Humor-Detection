I'm from Chicago and dying for some fantastic tasting ribs, other than those that I BBQ myself. Everyone pointed me to Honey Bear's BBQ.\n\nThe place is clean and casual, and the service is OK. But the ribs were horrible. The beer was fantastic though and I first thought maybe the alcohol had dulled my taste buds. I remember screaming, \"Either this is a poor cut of beef\/pork or both animals had mad cow\/pig disease!\"\n\nI decided to return and give them another chance, and not order alcohol. I ordered the ribs and again, \"Mad Cow Disease!\"\n\nI won't ever return. How does that go: \"First time shame on you, second time shame on me...\"
