You want to buy a Kia? Come buy from here. Kat and I were treated to a test drive within 10 minutes of entering the store, and a week later we eventually haggled an affordable price for her new car. The customer service was pleasant, the pricing part was gentle-humored enough with our hardballing, and the final business aspect was agreeable. From a buyer's perspective, I would recommend this location for Kia fans.
