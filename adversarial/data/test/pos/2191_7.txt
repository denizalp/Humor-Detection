I wanted to consume less carbs so I politely asked if they wouldn't mind digging out the insides of the banh mi, and I found out that this is actually a common request! Result is a crunchy and thin grilled pork banh mi with less guilt! Iced Vietnamese coffee is a must too. \n\nMy biggest complaint is that they only accept cash. This ain't garden grove! And you're a filthy rich multi million dollar company. YOU CAN AFFORD TO PAY YOUR RIGHTFUL AMOUNT OF TAXES SO STOP INCONVENIENCING ME AND EVERYBODY ELSE
