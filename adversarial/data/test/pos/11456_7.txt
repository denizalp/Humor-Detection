So happy this place is finally open so I can get some tasty ramen at lunch from work.\n\nThe interior is pretty nicely decorated and clean. The kitchen is viewable through glass.\nService was really nice and friendly, I can't remember her name but she was very pleasant with a nice smile, and let me take my time viewing the menu and ordering.\n\nI had the tonkatsu ramen with extra chashu and corn for $8.95++. The ramen is very good but not as good as Monta or Fukumimi.....that doesn't mean anything really as its still pretty new. Its good, and I will be happy to come back and spend my money again.
