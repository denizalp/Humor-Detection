I've only had 1 other colonic at another company, however I can tell you that Las Vegas Colon Hydrotherapy is much better.  Both companies used the same machines, and the process was similar.  However, the customer service was much better at LVCH.  The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly.  They massage your feet and stomach during the colonic.  (Some people may prefer to be left alone, and they will if you request) However, I think you benefit from getting the stomach massage.  Although, it feels like torture during the process.  Getting a colonic is not my favorite thing to do, but this place makes the best of an awkward situation.  I also recommend trying the sauna which seems to help if you get it done prior to your colonic.  There are many other treatments that I have yet to try.\n\nAlso, they have the most flexible hours.
