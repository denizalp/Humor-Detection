My dinner at Prairie a few nights ago was a solid 3.5 stars.  The negative first: it's overpriced. In my opinion they should drop the price of every sandwich and entree by 2-3 dollars. I am not someone who has any qualms about a spendy meal, but the prices here seemed a bit excessive.  My boyfriend had a $15 seitan hoagie that was good, but not, you know, Spak-Brothers-Good. Also my fancy grilled cheese could have been fancier, and elevated by addition of another type of cheese or a few more veggies to make it a bit less Basic.  I like the fried sage on it, though, and the salad that came with it was super-yum.  \n\nI have to give Prairie huuuge props for their solid vegetarian selection!  When I heard about the concept, I figured it would be another meat-themed Pittsburgh restaurant that would have one vegetarian option and zero vegan options on the menu. How nice to be pleasantly surprised by a number of choices, and I do really want to go back and try some of the dinner entree items.  \n\nI am also impressed by the whiskey menu, the quality of the cocktails, and that there are good happy hour specials.  We had both the house mule and the old fashioned, and both were quite tasty and well-prepared.  Our dessert-- vegan apple crisp-- was delicious!!  Seamless service and a relaxing vibe ensures that we will be back soon.
