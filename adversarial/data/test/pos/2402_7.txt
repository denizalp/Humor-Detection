The best cakes in Toronto in my opinion and i've hunted for a store that has it all. \n\nThey have traditional mousse cakes, but they have some great interesting cakes like the Amadeus (tastes like a ferror rocher), the paradise (with passion fruit cream brule, mousse on a rice crispy crust) and various other favourites. I've tried them all now and only go there for birthday cakes now. \n\nThe only problem is everyone expect me to get them an amadeus cake now and its getting expensive ;) I think i need a membership card or something.
