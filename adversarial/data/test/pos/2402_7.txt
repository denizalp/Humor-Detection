Several things that I liked about this buffet.\n\n1.  Cheap.  Lunch price is $15.99, which isn't bad at all considering the quality. \n\n2.  Free wine, Bud Light, and hard cider.  Can't beat that.\n\n3.  Since it's so out in the middle of nowhere, easy to get in and out.\n\n4.  Selection was very good.  Things I recommend - sashimi salad, oxtail soup, pork ribs, cr√®me brule, fried Pollack. \n\n\n\nThings that were meh.\n\n1.  The line was short when I arrived at 12:50 with a party of five.  But it took 30 minutes to get seated.  It wasn't packed, so they slow the flow down since there must be a limited number of servers, not because of a limited number of tables.\n\n2.  The price is right, but still no local or military discount.  However, I'm fairly certain that 80% of the people eating were Clark County types.\n\n3.  That pumpkin ice cream was unedible.\n\nJust asked my son what he liked - Korean kalbi ribs and the mac and cheese.  He said he didn't like the pistachio shots, flan, and tamales.  He's 18 and jobless so he shouldn't be so picky.
