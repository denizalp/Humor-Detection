I JUST WON A FREE TOTE THRU YELP!\n\nFREEBIES\nI used my celly to check-in, and BING! \"FREE TOTE\" MESSAGE! I didn't even know that feature existed with the yelp app! Sweeeeeet!\n\nTHAT prompted me to write a review about my love for Wholefoods! \n\nThe FREE PRIZE feature was so simple. It explained how you can claim your prize, but beware: Do not click on the claim button unless you are ready! There is a countdown clock (3 hours) - and I was writing at the in-store cafe, so I felt a little pressure to finish what I was writing to grab my freebie before I forgot!\n\nBACK TO WHOLEFOODS\nWe only bought our groceries at Wholefoods while we were living in the States. Having been to the Wholefoods in Toronto & DMV, I must confess something. The USA retailers are bigger and cheaper with more selection! But that doesn't make it better. Just better prices and selection. On the flipside, Toronto Wholefoods are much more s p a c i o u s, so the atmosphere has an elevated upscale shopper's experience!\n\nIt was interesting to find that the Wholefoods in the DMV actually sold Maple Syrup from Canada! My face BRIGHTENED at that discovery!\n\nIn the USA - I also went to Wholefoods to buy my sunscreen. It's $16 USD for a 2.5 oz. tube - but for someone with hypoallergenic skin - it is worth every pretty penny.\n\nAnother hit, are the hot food & salad stations. I love that they switch up the items from lunch & dinner so you could go all day and not get bored with the same selection. Even though the selection was huge. The hot food was always hot, and the cold food always tasty. \n\nAnd I always remember the staff at all locations are friendly & very helpful if you have any questions! Please read examples in my other Wholefoods reviews. \n\nAt THIS location - I particularly love the cafe. If I start my day here, with one of their amazing scones (mixed berry, chocolate chip, or cheese & spinach) (i usually buy all three) with a hot cup of green tea earl grey with soymilk,\nI am elated! \n\nWe don't shop here in Canada because, as my yelper friend Kat S. likes to say, \"In the USA, they call it Whole-Paycheck, in Canada, it should be called Whole-Salary!\".\n\nStill, you often pay for what you get! You can count on uber-fresh, high quality food and products here! And the service, and experience, is always always always DELIGHTFUL!
