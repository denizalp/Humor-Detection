Pizza was ok. Caesar salad with dried cranberries not good at all... Dressing was flavorless croutons crazy hard... Break your teeth hard.  The tripple p was good the prosciutto pizza was bland.... I know it's slow and you guys just opened but the staff was way off task more worried about joking around.  Kinda awkward when your the only table in the house. Asked for salad to come out with the pizzas and the salad came out 10 min before. Sorry guys.
