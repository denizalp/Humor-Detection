I can honestly think of no other place quite like Kensington Market, and I mean that in a very good way.  I love the vibe, hip and laid back but yet somehow full of energy.  People watching here is phenomenal - because of the eclectic mix of shops and restaurants everyone feels welcome.  From fruit stands to vintage clothing to some of the best hole-in-the-wall places to grab a bite,  you are just going to love this place.  The street art is pretty fantastic and is obviously a source of pride for many artists trying to make their name known. One thing you won't find here is a a chain store or restaurant, and that's exactly the way it should be.  Kensington Market's charm is that you are supporting local artists, chefs, and store owners.  As i said, there's really no place like it!
