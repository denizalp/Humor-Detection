The pig is my go-to spot for my Korean BBQ needs on Spring Mountain! There are many restaurants around America that share the same name but none of them come close to the one we have in Vegas! (Ellicott City, Maryland  and Annandale, VA I'm taking to you!) \n\nThe AYCE has become a mythical and almost secretive thing at this place as of late. Every time we come here they give us the regular dinner menus w\/o the little AYCE insert. We always have to ask for it.. \n\nThey have also added a few quirks to the AYCE as of late: \n\n1. You need to order from the top of the menu and work your way down. If you try and skip around they have a cow!. \n            A. My theory is this: they try to fill you up with the cheap cuts of meat first. You notice that the brisket, tongue and pork belly are on the top of the menu. hmm?!?\n            B. The second and hopefully true theory is because the spicy pork kills the UFO grill and anything you cook after that tastes like ashes. Pork is cheaper than beef so my first theory may be moot. \n\n2. Only one order of sirloin and kalbi per person. \nSo technically it's not a true AYCE. Quick tip: if you smile at the girls and bat your eyes in such a flirtatious way they may hook up another serving... Sometimes it works...  \n\n\n\n\nI have had their regular menu food namely the Kim chee chigae and dol sot bi bim bap. Both dishes were legit but cost just as much as the AYCE experience. Unless you are craving a Korean pancakes or something specific stick to the AYCE as it provides the best bang for the buck. \n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nPS: Don't forget to wear dark clothes because every seat is a splash zone!
