I don't recommend overpaying and potentially being tricked.\n\nMy husband goes deep sea fishing so we eat quite a bit of fresh fish. When we ordered the \"Hammage\" (Hamachi) Collar on the menu, turned out it was Salmon...when it even says it is supposed to be Yellowtail! \n\nThese two fish aren't even the same color, so I'm baffled they thought people would fall for it. When we asked the server why it was Salmon instead, they said something along the lines of \"sometimes the chef changes the offerings but didn't get to change it on the menu\". They offered to give us a replacement, but what they brought out the second time was either a low quality overcooked Yellowtail or another fish.\n\nDefinitely not coming back.
