I had so much fun at the teaspressa opening today! I had only been to teaspressa about a year and a half ago when they were in an office type area in old town scottsdale. This location is adorable! I love the decor. I can't remember exactly what I got, caramel something, maybe? It was delicious! I asked for what had little to no caffeine and this was their recommendation. People working here are nice, it's a really cool space, I'm glad I don't work too far from here on the weekends so I can stop by!
