Horrible customer service.  I brought a box full of toddler clothes on a Friday and was quoted 15 minutes wait for them to look through.  After 20 minutes my toddler was getting ansy and I was quoted an additional 15 minutes.  I said \"ok we'll be back then\" and went to take my daughter to get a snack.  I called to check if the things were ready and was told \"because you left the store your items get looked at after anyone IN the store, and the purchaser has left for the weekend.\"  UGH!!!  Tell me that before I leave???  \n\nSo we go back Monday morning first thing when they open and ask if they are making offers on any of my items.   The girl tells me, \"we're offering $9.60 cash.\"  I said \"cool which items did you want to buy?\"  and was told she didn't know because they were \"ALREADY TAGGED AND OUT IN THE AISLES.\"  I just looked at her and asked why they hadn't made an inventory or asked before they did that.  She told me \"Well, you're NOT 'ALLOWED' to refuse the offer because you LEFT THE STORE.\"  \n\nWOW.  Just WOW........ Scandalous and dishonest, rude and bad business.  I told her and the manager I would not be back if this is how they treat customers.  The clerk said \"Ok!\"  \n\nAVOID\n\nAVOID\n\nAVOID!!!!!!!!!
