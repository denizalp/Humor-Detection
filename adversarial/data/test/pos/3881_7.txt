Just to moved to Green Valley Ranch from So Cal last May, started getting color and cuts from Alexa based on great reviews the shop has. I've now lost 9 inches in length due to poor product, lack of skill and it has taken almost 2 months for my new stylist to get my hair back to \"normal.\"  Nice people, not good or skilled stylists that know what they are doing.
