I've been to the Bistro before and enjoyed my meal, but this review is for the nightclub. This isn't a bad spot - the music was decent, and the crowd was okay, and we didn't have to wait in line thanks to a hookup. If you just want to enjoy a night of dancing, you can certainly do that at Tao.\n\nWhat took this experience down a notch for me, however, was a snotty female bartender. It was 3:30 and my girl friend and I needed to hydrate. She asked for a soda and I asked for two bottles of water. The bartender looks at both of us and goes, \"Really? That's all?\" as though we had insulted her by not ordering a cocktail. Yeah, bitch, really. Not everyone who comes to Vegas does so to get stupid drunk, although had I been either stupid OR drunk, I would have like you a lot better.\nOne of the girls in our group actually WAS crazy drunk, and this same bartender proceeded to mock her from behind the bar. The bartenders at Marquee and XS might have been cute enough to pull off attitude like this, but the bitch at Tao certainly wasn't.
