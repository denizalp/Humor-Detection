ARIA is the worst hotel I have ever been to in Las Vegas! I had my worst hotel experience ever there. I was there for 4 days of hell. As an athlete I am a seasoned traveler. In my 4 days at ARIA my toilet broke, I didnt get housekeeping services for 2 of the 4 days, I \"lost\" $800 dollars in the Valet area, none of the multimedia items in room worked, the curtains didnt work half the time, I was on hold with the front desk for 7 HOURS one time and the hotel is not even sound proof. I heard people having sex on both sides of me twice during my stay. Aria...you suck!
