I'm not in love with the look of the place, it looks like a nail salon.. It's not \"beautiful\" or anything extra that you would expect from reading the reviews here or checking your bank account after leaving this place. It's expensive. I almost cried after swiping my card for $120 plus tip for a full set and standard pedicure. My nails look nice... But that's it. Ambiance sucks, the nail tech was nice but looks like all the girls are very catty against each other over here. I don't care to hear about how much you hate each other. Get over it, you're at work. Whatever, not sure if I'll come again. Let's see how long my nails last.\n\n6 hours later ..... One nail has already broke. WTF
