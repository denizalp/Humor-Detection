I went to this barbershop for about 6 months before I chose to go elsewhere. You get a good haircut and get what you pay for most of the time.\n\nThe issue I kept running into was not feeling welcome at all. If you are not a \"regular\" you probably won't be treated very warmly. Also, if you don't look like you're from Scottsdale, expect to be treated the same. \n\nEvery time I went in I was treated very cold, even after I tried engaging the barbers and making conversation. It was the same every time I went in with different barbers. Meanwhile those who look the Scottsdale part are treated much better and greeted very warmly.   Go down the street to Flyods 99 if you want a warm experience.
