Hooray Beer! Thankfully this brewery is only 1.9 miles from my house. I know this because I measured... By walking... Ok not really. They took a killer place and made it even better. Just like Noda or Birdsong no bottles. Though you can take home a huge growler that will keep you satisfied for sometime. They favor more toward the IPAs and Pale Ales but still have some good gems in between. A short drive from Southend and right off of the light rail, this place is a must stop. Great beer and great people. Perfect combo!
