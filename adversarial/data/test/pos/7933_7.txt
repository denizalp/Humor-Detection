I bought a vacuum here in 2005.  Max, the owner, is passionate about vacuums and he was so nice (he loves dogs) that I visit him even when I don't need any bags.  By the way, he recommended a Miele for me, though he carries other brands including the coveted Dyson, and he has all the patience in the world for service, cleaning, filtering, and deodorizing, etc...sometimes my vacuum air smells like poop, because I actually vacuum up little dried poop nuggets, it turns out there is a spray for that.  Who knew?  Max does, he knows suction.
