Oy vey! There was a ninety-minute wait at the Hash House a Go Go and not even a bench to sit around and wait. Damn that Rachael Ray. Alas, I went to the Yelp app on my iPhone and found a nearby breakfast eatery that was also averaging around four stars. It literally took us about three minutes to get to Jamm's and big surprise...it's in a strip mall, our third off-the-Strip place that was in a strip mall. We noticed the place was abuzz with customers but not nearly to the level of the Hash House. There was a fifteen-minute wait here, and the diners were not nearly as fashionably attired. \n\nIt's a modest operation, the type that has a cheery hostess and cartoon murals on the walls. The menu is pretty robust, but unlike the nearby Egg & I, there was a lot more thought and care in the execution of the dishes. Jamie W. ordered the $8.45 Reuben Omelet, which was full of strands of corned beef and mounds of sauerkraut. There was also a generous slab of Swiss cheese melted on top and a side of crispy hashed browns (see photo). I went for a similar dish, the $8.50 Irish Skillet, which had the same corned beef accompanied by diced onions, green peppers and potatoes, all mixed into scrambled eggs and melted cheddar cheese (see photo). It was a mess of high-cholesterol goodness well put together. Tasty too. \n\nJamie, in a moment of insanity laced with homesickness for his Midwestern roots, also ordered the $5.25 full order of Biscuits and Country Gravy, which was a gloppy pool on a plate (see photo). I won't deny it wasn't good in a deep Southern kitchen kind of way with the biscuits sopping up all that gravy, though I attempted to re-purpose it as an extra topping for my skillet breakfast. Bloated was the way we both felt afterward but also sated. Needless to say, I also noticed they decorated the restroom stall with the same cartoon murals. Somebody must have had time on their hands. By the way, the waitress was also cheery, chatty and about nineteen. She was refilling my coffee cup with unadulterated pleasure. \n\nFOOD - 4 stars...country breakfasts with deli twists, well executed with simple ingredients \nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...kitchen cozy with Fingerhut touches \nSERVICE - 4 stars...cheery thy name is Jamm \nTOTAL - 4 stars...good diner-style eats can be found in a strip mall
