Wow, Bachi Burger does everything right. Asian fusion meets the bun and holy shit does it ever fucking work. My only gripe? Bachi Burger needs a location in LA! Seriously, this place puts all the other burger joints to shame. I mean, this is what Umami Burger should be doing. \n\nBachi Burger is located 5 miles to the southeast of the Strip in a non-descript shopping center. Being the noObs that we were, the wife and I could not figure out which side the entrance was located at (it's on the north side by the way). Once we entered we were lucky enough to be seated because this place was fucking packed. \n\nAfter perusing Yelp reviews, we decided to order the famous oxtail chili cheese fries. All I have to say is thank you Yelp for recommending the oxtail chili cheese fries because they were amazing. The chef is Japanese Hawaiian and the minute you see the fries you will see the Hawaiian influence because there was a perfectly cooked fried egg on top! The portion of the fries was huge. As an appetizer, it could easily be shared with 4 people. Aside from the egg and fries, it consisted of tender oxtail meat, cheese, scallions, jalapenos, sriracha mayo, garlic aioli, chili, and beans. I mean the combination of these ingredients was simply bliss. My wife and I hardly spoke because we were devouring the mountain of fries like fucking barbarians. \n\nAs for the burgers, my wife had the Kiki Burger and I had the Miyagi Burger. The Kiki Burger was really something. Thick and juicy Angus beef, three different types of mushrooms, caramelized bacon, gruyere cheese, and a sriracha-mayo sauce... oh heaven! As for my Miyagi Burger, it consisted of thick and juicy wagyu meat with furikake (nori flakes), caramelized bacon, crispy onion rings, fried egg and mayo. It was good... a little on the sweet side... let' just say that I liked my wife's burger a little better. Also, if you aren't into fusion burgers, they have a regular Angus burger that you can customize. \n\nSo, we were unable to finish our meal. Too much fucking food. I can't remember the last time I went to a gourmet burger joint and was unable to finish my burger. I think my only suggestion for Bachi Burger is that they should offer a sampler platter because they have so many unique burgers and it was a shame that I couldn't try more. \n\nBachi, I fucking heart you. \n\n*One thing my wife and I noticed was that  a requisite to work here is that you need to be Asian with arm tattoos. But don't let the tats scare you because the servers are super sweet like ramune.
