It's six months later and I'm STILL traumatized... I shudder and snarl every single time I drive past it... Based on what I know to be the definition of \"resort,\" they should absolutely change the name of this place.\n\nI should have known something was awry when I was standing in the lobby to check in and the phone was just ringing. Over and over and over and over again while the person behind the desk ignored it. You couldn't at least answer and ask, \"Can I please place you on hold?\" Common courtesy, yes? That should have tipped me off... (Less than an hour later, I was on the other end of that equation, holding a filthy receiver near my ear, looking for hand sanitizer, waiting anxiously for someone to finally pick up.)\n\nAfter providing my ID, cc, etc... to check in, the woman (amiable enough) handed me keys and a MAP of the \"resort.\" I had quite a bit of luggage as well as my not-a-lapdog dog (and her crate) with me, so I asked if there was a bellman who might be able to help me. \"Sure,\" the clerk said. \"Pull your car up to the entrance and he'll be out.\" So I did as she instructed and waited for help. After 10+ minutes, nobody ever came and she never came out to tell me what was going on, to apologize, etc... Tired and just wanting to get dinner and rest, I decided to do it myself. Thankfully, I had only grabbed my dog and a few small bags when I made the first lonnnng, winding trek from the parking lot to my room. I have to say the grounds were quite nice and I was hopeful. But I could not believe my eyes when I opened the door of my \"casita\" (in this case, translated to \"little house ready to be razed\"). The odor that smacked me in the face (and my pup in the snout) was a combination of rank, stale and mold. The carpet was filthy. So filthy, in fact, that I wouldn't put my dog's toys on it, and my dog (like most) is gross and does odd things with her mouth. That should tell you how dirty the carpet was. The tile in the wet bar area and the bathroom was dirty as well. There were stains here, hair there, and dirt and grime everywhere. There was NO way that I was going to be able to go barefoot, sleep or eat in there. I couldn't even imagine showering in that bathroom, fearing what might become of me if the shower curtain from hell touched me.\n\nI immediately pulled out my laptop so I could look up another place to stay. However, there were no visible networks. I called the front desk to figure out what was going on and (when someone finally answered) I was informed that they don't have wireless internet. What the...? I told her I would not sleep in that room, no way, no how... What did she do? Chuckle! I think she was chuckling because she knew those \"casitas\" are in awful condition.\n\nThankfully, I booked it through a third-party so I was able to switch hotels without too much trouble. The woman at the front desk of the hotel told me that I would have NOT been able to get any sort of refund if I had booked the room directly with them. Yeah, that would have been a problem...\n\nIn short: It. Was. Terrible! \n\nI wouldn't recommend this hotel to an enemy, let alone a friend. Avoid at all costs!
