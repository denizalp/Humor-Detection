Enjoyed a nice lunch here at Pot Liquor with great service!  \n\nTanya was an amazing waitress who gave us excellent recommendations.  She was not only helpful but also friendly and attentive.  \n\nWe started with the Moinks- bacon wrapped meatballs accompanied with jalape√±o slaw and garlic cheddar toast.  The bacon have the meatballs a different spin with a smoky BBQ sauce flavor.  I enjoyed this meaty appetizer!\n\nI ordered the Carolina Pulled Pork Sandwich with the sweet potato fries.  The pulled pork is on a soft brioche roll.  It had a nice flavor but could have used a bit more sauce.  I guess I could have asked for some on the side. I will say the sandwich was piled with pork so it was very filling.  I paid extra for the sweet potato fries. Holy crap... They certainly gave me so many that I couldn't finish them.  Delicious! \n\nThe dining area was abundant with rustic decor.  You can find this BBQ in Town Square towards the back on the west side of the shopping center.  Enjoy!
