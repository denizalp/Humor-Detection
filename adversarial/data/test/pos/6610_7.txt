A group of us went here before going to a show. The food was average, but the best part of the evening was when the waitress put down her tray and started singing a karaoke version of \"I Will Always Love You.\". The key change was hilarious and she belted it like she was Celine or something. \n\nBest part was, it is next to Lotus of Suam which is far better in quality!!
