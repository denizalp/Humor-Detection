So far this school has been great and then not-so-great. It is a huge school first of all, the largest community college out of all of them. I have met some great, awesome teachers and then I have had some grumpy teachers. I'll tell you what you do, when you want to know what kind of teacher they are before you sign up for your class just do what I do:  go onto Ratemyprofessor.com and search for the teacher and read the reviews. They are usually pretty accurate and give you some control over what your teaching environment is going to be like. \n\nHowever, I was racially discriminated against in the testing department and that is why they get only three stars. I realize it is the person and not the school but I won't ever forget what happened to me. The latter I will take up with the President of student affairs. Always stick up for what is right people!\n\nMs.Svoboda shout out! excellent English teacher and Bob Leighty, my extremely tough geology professor. I learned a lot in that class.
