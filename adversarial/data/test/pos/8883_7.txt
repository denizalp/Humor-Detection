4 1\/2 stars. I arrived during the late lunch hour which was a mistake. I parked in the back and was getting looks from the tennant so decided to move. I lucked out BC it was close to 1:00 and someone was leaving. \n\nOnce seated I received their signature warm bean dip, salsa and tortilla chips - so addicting. For my entree I selected the lengua with red sauce rice and beans. The portion was generous and the taste was delish. The home made corn tortillas hit the spot as I made my own lengua tacos.  \n\nThe service here was spot on - friendly and refills without request. I can understand why Zapatas Mexican restaurant was voted best of Las Vegas and will certainly return.
