This groomer may have good reviews but she was less than polite on the phone.\nShe is NOT taking any new clients.  I inquired why this wasn't on her website and she got huffy with me.  When I informed her that I would be putting a comment on yelp she was not happy and hung up me.  She may be good with dogs but not so much  with humans.  Ruff! Ruff!r\n\nI stand by my comments.  I used a competitor and they were fine.  The subject service is not taking clients.
