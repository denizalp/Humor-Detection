Open for about three months, I didn't even know about Juan's until I saw Misti's review and then my gal pals suggested it for dinner because it was close to Sweet Addiction--hah!  See how I pick my friends?  Always thinking about the sugar!  Anyway, we had a solid meal here, going with the flaming fajitas, of course.  I got chicken and my pals shared a chicken and steak combo for two.  Both courses came out in a timely manner, with the flaming presentation for each, literally.  It's cool to see your food on fire.  I enjoyed my chicken fajitas and my pals rated the chicken better than the steak, too.  The chips and salsa were nothing special.  Service is attentive and friendly and the rest of the menu is quite extensive, but for my first visit I had to have the fajitas and not bad at all for $13.95.  I'll come back to try something different next time--nice to have an option for Mexican cuisine on this side of town, near Sweet Addiction AND Perfect Scoop ;).
