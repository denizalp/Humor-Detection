The coolest, cutest, sexiest place ever! Came here one night on a whim and got to meet the owner who is super awesome. She has created a fun new atmosphere to spend adult time for any occasion. I would definitely bring my wife back here for a date night. \n\nA wine bar, floral class music entertainment spot. The decor and set up is uber loungey with different style of live music nightly. Also providing floral to purchase but imagine this, schedule a date night to design a floral arrangement with you friends or you love and have an awesome bottle or 2 or 3 of wine and enjoy live music. \n\nSuper fun and super good vibes. I loved it and it's not the wine talking lol. Located in the beautiful Tivoli Village with a great selection of wine and staff with very friendly and knowledgeable peeps. Two thumbs up here go check it out!
