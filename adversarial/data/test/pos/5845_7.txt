This place is a joke! Being run by \"teenagers\" who are in need of going to school for business management.\n\nWe came in yesterday at 8pm. Everything was good until our food came. My husband ordered the special of the day with the \"meat sauce\" etc. The pasta was super dry and bland. So we asked our server for extra sauce on the side so the food won't be so dry. They gave us marinara sauce ONLY.  Another teen came by the name \"carrie\" and we told her were canceling the order. She insisted on making another one but we said no, it's fine we don't want it. She replies you can't do that. She then takes the food to the back. When we were finished with our meal, she hands us our receipt and said we had to pay for the pasta we didn't eat. I refused to pay for something we didn't eat but she kept insisting we pay. When I ask for management, another young teen with a beard, said there's no management and no contact of manager. I asked well what happens if there's an emergency? He replies, this is not an emergency. I told carrie, I refused to pay for the pasta cause we didn't eat the food, if I have to, I'll pay my only bill I ate and will call the cops to escorts us out. Then she  blurts out, we're a small business here and your no longer allowed here. Totally fine with me, with the bad customer service I doubt I'll ever step back in. I ended up paying only for what we ate and left. \nToo bad, this place could've been good but with the lack of knowledge of customer service, it shows a lot they will not succeed in business.
