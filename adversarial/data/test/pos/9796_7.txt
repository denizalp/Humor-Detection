I cannot review the food because I left before even ordering.  We came here on a Saturday afternoon and the place was empty with the exception of a group of 4 people or so. All the waiters\/waitresses were just hanging out and totally ignored our presence. Then I came up to one of them and said I would like to be seated. He seemed really surprised like \"seated? on a restaurant? whats going on? wat is my life?\" I am not sure if he was high or hangover from the nigh before. We sat down and waited for 15 minutes for the waiter to come, which he never did, so we just got up and left, and not surprisingly none of the waiters even noticed. It was totally surreal.
