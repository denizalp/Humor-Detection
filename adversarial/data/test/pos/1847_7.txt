Another dinner to leave me slouched back in my chair with my hand on my belly, a stupid grin on my face and a contented sigh on my lips.  I brought Ada G., Elaine B. (formally known as P - I kind of like her \"formally known as P) and B here for dinner on Thursday night as I've been talking about it for so long, they wanted to know what all the hubbub was about since I couldn't stop talking about the roll-your-eyes-back-in-your-head brunch I had here last Spring so we finally made reservations and off we went.\n\nWhen you make reservations at Cafe Monarch, you want to let Christopher know if you have any food aversions or allergies, or maybe even if you're really counting on something in particular that night so he can plan in advance.  He shops for the freshest produce and selections for the night are restricted.  That being said, I wish more places did it this way.  It's tiring to flip through pages and pages of menus of nearly identical items.  I'd just as soon be told the chef bought the freshest items possible that day and this is what inspired him or her and this is what will be served tonight.  Will this suffice?  Why yes, yes it does!  Thank you.  Do you understand my point?\n\nWe brought along a couple of bottle of champagne and a white and red.  It's all BYO here and we figured we'd hedge our bets not knowing what we'd be in the mood for.  (By the way, it's also cash or check also - no credit cards) We started with some champagne and Christopher told us for dinner he had in mind a penne pasta with a pumpkin cream sauce, toasted walnuts and sliced Gorgonzola on top.   For the next course we would have a warm salad of fresh artichokes, olives and peppers and for the main course was a beer braised chicken.  All of it sounded fabulous to us, of course none of are picky eaters.  Isn't it just more fun to dine with good eaters?  Pretty much anything he would have made, we would have ate.  No food aversions at our table!  (Innards.  I take that back.  I don't like innards.)\n\nWe enjoyed our champagne while he worked on the pasta.  The smells coming from the kitchen were just intoxicating.  The restaurant itself is so cozy too.  We sat inside this time and the best I can describe it is a cross between a French bistro and Buca di Beppo.  OK.  Total disservice to Cafe Monarch but he has the coolest things all over his walls like Buca di Beppo does.  As for the rest, I could swear I was back in a cafe in Paris.  Our pasta came out heaped on a platter family style.  The sauce was a lovely pale pumpkin hue accented with fresh herbs and lovely, pungent slices of Gorgonzola and crunchy walnuts it was pitch perfect.  We all ate as much as we dared while Christopher came and entertained us with his stories.  In most restaurants when the owner or manager comes by to see if everything is OK that's all fine and dandy but you usually don't want them hanging around spouting their propaganda, but with Chris it's the complete opposite.  You don't want him to go!  You wish you could eat with him every night.  He told us about growing up, what he did last summer, he joked around with us girls, commented on Ada G's. cowgirl sheik attire (I'll let her go into that) and even explained to me exactly how he made a couple of the dishes.\n\nThe warm salad served next came in a small, cast iron skillet.  Baby sliced artichokes were saut√©ed with capers, sweet Italian peppers, heirloom tomatoes and thyme.  It was light, flavorful and a welcome departure to the typical green salad I've been eating all summer.\n\nOur final course was fit for a small village.  A platter of chicken pieces all beautifully browned and braised in Full Sail Ale.  The braising sauce was exquisite spooned over the spicy chicken meat.  The cute, little, pregnant one of us who claims she can't eat much anymore even ate two pieces of the chicken.  You've got to love Christopher, he boxed up all of the leftover pasta and chicken for us into individual boxes.\n\nRight when we thought the best was over he brings over a couple of slices of pumpkin cheesecake with walnut brittle.  I like cheesecake but it's usually something I wouldn't order because it's so heavy but not this one!  Light and creamy, like a baked pumpkin cheesecake chiffon.  The perfect sweet ending to a beautiful meal.\n\nThough I want everyone out there to go to Cafe Monarch because I think it's one of the best restaurants around, I don't think it's for everyone.  Of course you can tell him your allergies and aversions when you call to make reservations and allergies can't be helped of course and who doesn't have an aversion to something or other but meals like this are best when you leave it in the chef's hands.  Relinquish the control you think you need and let him decide what to prepare for you and I guarantee that you too will be slouched back in your chair rubbing your full belly and a contented sigh on your lips.
