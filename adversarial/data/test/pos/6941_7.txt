Therapy was by far my favorite restaurant\/ bar in the downtown area...and we went to several. The drinks were delicious, the food was creative, and the service was great. The atmosphere was also a lot of fun. We were there in the late afternoon, so were ordering from the lunch menu.\nIt is not like me to order anything fried, but the red velvet waffle fried chicken sliders won me over with the salty sweet red velvet.  We also had the chicken meatballs which were moist and kind of spicy....and the deconstructed carrot cake, served with a tiny carrot on the side for effect.\nThe sangria was amazing!  It was my favorite drink from the whole 3-day weekend in Vegas.  It had an almond vanilla flavor to it.  I drank 3 glasses.  Service was friendly and on-point.  My sangria and water were always filled.\nIn the end, since I couldn't get enough, my husband bought me a cute pink Therapy T-shirt.
