$5. $5. $5 Bar Marco! Every every every every... $5. $5. $5 Bar Marco!  Every every every...\n\nAnyways.\n\nWe've been wanting to try Bar Marco's food for quite some time after stopping for drinks on multiple occasions...  fast forward, and Polar Vortex $5 happy hours, brunch, and a wine room excursion are all booked (brunch and wine room will be updated soon!).\n\nLet me sum it up in short.  Normally, I feel Marco is a bit overpriced.  Is it good...?  yes.  Are the drinks worth $12 and the small bites for $10+...? no.  BUT, add in the Tuesday special, and this is one of the best deals in town.\n\n$5 drinks (I recommend the Manhattan), $5 bar bites (if you don't get the burger you're crazy) and $5 other delicious goods (bacon wrapped dates, soup and arancini).  Do yourself a favor and grab a reservation just in case they're busy (it can fluctuate week to week).  Then drink, eat and repeat...  that simple.\n\nWhile it's pricey, judging by our initial food experience, I'm excited to see what brunch holds and more importantly, the wine room!  Updates soon!
