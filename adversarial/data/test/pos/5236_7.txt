*****5 Stars!!\n\nYou get in line and start to build your pizza. You have a variety of fresh toppings to choose from, including vegan cheese and gluten free crust. By the time I paid for our pizzas and got our drinks the pizzas were done. They are thin crust, so they cook fast in the high temperature oven. Our pizzas were well done and crispy, just the way I like them. If you don't like them well done, then you might want to mention that before they go in the oven.\n\n$8.00 for unlimited toppings on an 11\" pizza. Well worth the money and worth the drive from Summerlin. This is arguably one of the best pizza places in Vegas. I will be back and I recommend that you give it a try.
