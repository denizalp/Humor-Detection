When I was looking for restaurants nearby that were still open, I spotted this place.  After I read Rashmi's review and endorsement, I knew it would be good!  I was not disappointed.  The avocado curry was delicious, flavorful, and seemed relatively healthy.  I definitely had enough leftovers to take home (but note the avocado curry reheated doesn't really taste that great).  My boyfriend ordered the pineapple fried rice, which I kind of liked even better than the curry!  They had a lot of stuff on the menu, so we're looking forward to coming back and trying more.\n\nThe purple sticky rice dessert was pricier than other Thai restaurants, but it was also quite a bit larger than most other restaurants. So keep in mind that it's made for sharing!\n\nThe servers were friendly, but also seemed a bit overwhelmed and maybe a little confused with keeping track of which tables ordered what.  They were really trying their best though.
