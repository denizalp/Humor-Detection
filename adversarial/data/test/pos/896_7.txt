In the formerly male dominated world of auto parts it was a pleasant surprise to stop @autozone for a couple bulbs for my vehicle (one headlight and one taillight went at the same time-what are the odds) and find the place staffed entirely by women.\n\nI was directed quickly to the right parts and checked out promptly.  \n\nThat is all I have for you on this parts store review.
