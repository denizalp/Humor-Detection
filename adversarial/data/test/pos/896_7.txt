I love the bus.  No doubt about it.  I catch the 77X from H-ville to and from work and love the option to work, sleep, read, play angry birds, write Yelp reviews, etc. during my commute.  So totally relaxing vs. fighting that traffic in my car.  Not paying for parking, gas, wear and tear on the vehicle?  No brainer.\n\nI'd give 5 stars if there were rail that made its way up here to the hinterlands.  Look forward to that day!
