It was an odd show. Much of the show consisted of file videos from Criss's past. The magic was good; however, for a Cirque du Soleil I was very underwhelmed. I have seen every Cirque show in Vegas. This one has very few acrobatics; the laser show was good (but not incorporated into the act); and the moving stages don't exist. I don't recommend this show.
