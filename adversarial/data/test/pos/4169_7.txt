This place went really downhill.\n\nI went over 5 years ago and it was pretty good. Now, the food is not prepared well. I was surprised how low quality this buffet became. I won't come back.\n\nMost of the vegetables I tried were undercooked. The potatoes au gratin were also so undercooked and rubbery. The meats were so-so. I even tried the sushi here, and it was pretty bad (sushi seems out of place though). Crepes were prepared messy. Salads were over drenched in dressing. The pastries were not so good. I didn't like the Macarons, I've had much better. I have a larger selection of French pastries at my local $13 Chinese buffet in Los Angeles.\n\nNot recommended, save your money.
