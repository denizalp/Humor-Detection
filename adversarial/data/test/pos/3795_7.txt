The prices here are crap. Seriously. They overcharge like crazy for their items, and I can't really understand why. Pants from low-brand names are still running like $20 here... you may as well go to Ross and at least buy them new (although last season). \n\nThe attitude of the front-desk folk is obnoxious and so self-serving and judgemental. You don't even get looked at when you walk in, unless your a hot \"hipter\" type male dude, which I am not. \n\nI tried on two dresses, both of which were a little tattered, over $15 dollars, and had the weirdest cuts and shapes ever (although the fabric was nice).\n\nThe jewelry sections is just pieces of wood strung together with a $14.00 pricetag. \n\nNot going here again. Back to Ross\/Rack\/Last chance.
