seating is scarce but just because food is so yummmmmm. Always enjoy cains but will take one star because the drink lids are so flimsy.. 3 drinks spilled while we were eating and the soda area was a little messy prob from more spilt beverages.. but aside from that I love cains!!! just be careful with your drink
