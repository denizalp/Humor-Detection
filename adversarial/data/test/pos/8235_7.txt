Been coming here since they opened, and am happy to say they have hit their stride. You can do sushi side or hibachi side (the chefs have fun with it & might squirt sake into your mouth if you're good...or maybe bad) Blue bubbles at the bar are always soothing, and they have a decent wine list. Some coming and going of bartenders & sorry but if you tend bar in this area, please know how to make an espressotini!! Please. \n\nAnyway, food is always consistent and good. The \"angry dragon\" is my pick for sushi, always a hit. But talk to who's working and see what they recommend that day... Candace the manager is awesome, she really goes the distance to make everyone happy. Even when a member of your party has stolen the gong & is running thru the restaurant... oh ya, good times, great wasabi!
