I've heard about this place before, and finally stopped in with a friend today for lunch. I'm on a deli kick as of late, and have been craving Gefilte fish like crazy.  I liked it over all, but I must admit, HOW DOES A DELI (THE SECOND ONE AT THAT THIS WEEKEND) RUN OUT OF GEFILTE FISH AND BEET BORSCT?!  HOW? WHY?\n\nI have to say, that was all I wanted. Odd? not to me.  So, off I went scouring the menu for other items.  I will say, the waiter was extremely knowledgeable and explained that all that sort of stuff comes from New York and as of recently, there's been \"issues\" getting their hands on this stuff? Is there a gefilte fish strike going on somewhere? A beet farmer protest that I don't know about? SERIOUSLY?!?!?\n\nOverall Robyn and I had a great time here. We really enjoyed our food, the service was great and it went really well.  I would eat here again, but I would insist on them having Gefilte fish before I go.....(ok ok I'm just kidding, but seriously, I need gefilte fish.....)
