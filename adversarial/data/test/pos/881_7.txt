Yes, this the best fish and chips place in Montreal, but in reality is there really that much competition here?\n\nNo.\n\nThis was the only fish and chips place I saw on my entire trip, and I always took the metro or walked.\n\nThat said it was good.\n\nNice batter, nice fish.\n\nBut, if you're comparing this place to England, then it would be a different flavor.\n\nHere they have maple, sour cream, fried bars, a more modern taste on the classic dish.
