when it's 2:30 in america and the last bastions of late night solice abandon you where do you go? Well you go to Sonic's\n\nAnd late night the chili cheese tots and value menu is on point\n\nSo much so you barely  remember the crusaders of the dark who serve your meals with a friendly hello and delivery of your high carb goodness\n\nDAYUM IS IT GOOD at 2:30~
