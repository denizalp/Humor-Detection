Most important info first: HH is 2-6PM, Mon-Thurs. You're welcome.\nTheir happy hour is one of my favorites in town, and they have the best deal with a chef's board of meats and cheeses PLUS a bottle of wine for only $20. Winning!\n\nWhile I usually visit for HH, the menu is full of great options from apps to desserts- their sea salt caramel bundino is a must-order for me, and their pasta portions are large and shareable. So far, I have yet to try the pizzas but they have a featured daily special each day with seasonal produce. I also hear rave reviews about their truffle bread. Location is gorgeous, opt for the patio if tables are available. Staff have been really great about accommodating tweaks to orders due to dietary restrictions, which is really appreciated.\n\nTIP: Sign up online for their email list for $10 off your first visit and make reservations through the OpenTable app because they're usually busy!
