If you want to maintain your dignity, you'll avoid this dump at all costs. Besides being overpriced, the food took AN HOUR to arrive to our table because our waitress decided that a table buying alcohol was more important. Meanwhile, our water glasses stayed empty and tables around us we're sat, ate and left while we waited. Waitress nowhere to be seen. \n\nOnce the food did arrive, it was the wrong order and the waitress accused us of eating the scallops which never came on the dish. Nice right? It also didn't come with rice which took 20 more minutes to arrive, you know, after we had finished eating. Oh and the kids meal I ordered for my two year old came in two waves, 45 minutes apart. Kids deal with that sort of thing so well! \n\nTo fix it? The restaurant offered half off the meal they accused us of removing food from. Yeah, right. I'd like my two hours back from being wasted at a lousy Chinese restaurant.
