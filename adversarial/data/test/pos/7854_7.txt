For starters,  I'm a super-klutz with a substantial and ever evolving history of committing self-inflicted dings, bumps and muscle pulls and I have some chronic boo-boos that are eased by regular massage.  I'm also a blatant and compulsive massageoholic-knead me like dough and let those endorphins rise-so when I see a Groupon for new hands in the hood I simply cannot resist.\n\nSetting up my initial 80 minute massage appointment was a pleasant and easy booking experience and the same held true for when I called to see if I could use the YELP deal for 50% off a 110 minute massage.  It's the little things; like that seamless no hassle transition that placed this business a notch above others offering a comparable product with a similar price point.\n\nI arrived 10 minutes before my scheduled appointment to fill out some very brief paperwork and was graciously greeted by Sue.  The waiting area is comfortably and attractively appointed and I was offered some water before my session with Anthony began.\n\nAnthony came out to the waiting area to meet me and take me to the massage room.  We discussed my problem areas and areas I wanted to focus on and my comfort level in terms of body area, feet, gluts, etc.  The room was quiet, faultlessly the right shade of dim, perfect volume of mediocre music and the room temperature was comfortable.  A 110 minute deep tissue massage is no easy feat for a therapist; and Anthony was terrific for the entire session, using the right amount of pressure, being accommodating, focused, yet unobtrusive.  \n\nAfter my massage I was given bottled water and *bummer alert* a chocolate which turned out to be a Hershey's \"chocolate flavored\" death cube of genetically modified beet sugar, genetically engineered soy and a host of other anti-wellness non-goodness ingredients.  I like the concept, just not the choice of treat.\n\nElements Therapeutic Massage is reasonably priced even without a Groupon and they offer first time client rates and have a wellness program.  There was no sell to get me to join (which I appreciated) just a natural friendliness and helpfulness from Sue as I was checking out.\n\nElements is a massage experience, not a spa experience, but it's a darn good massage experience.
