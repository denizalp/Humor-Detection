Wow the rudest door guy I've ever met! Told him we were on the guest list and he shook his head and said \"nope! Everyone pays $5. It's not like it's a lot of money. It's only $5\" with the rudest condescending attitude! You want people who come back, not deter people from\nComing in right at the start of their night! \nLay off the drugs dude!
