Oh, Vegas. Why must you torture me so? Every time I swear I will never drunkenly stomp down the strip again, it seems as though, with a click of my heels, I'm magically home again.\n\nThis past summer, I decided to venture out on a journey to an oasis in the middle of the desert, called \"Vegas\" to some, but known as \"Sin City\" to many. My roommate and I decided we should try something new for a change, since whenever I am in Vegas, I am seen stumbling around Excalibur, trying to find my room but having no recollection whatsoever wherever it is. I am geographically challenged. So, we decide to stay at Monte Carlo. It looks pleasant enough on the website, and a five hour journey later (give or take an hour), the interior looked impressive.\n\nWhile waiting in line impatiently, we were slightly spooked because the lady in front of us was rambling about how dirty her room was, and how she filed several complaints about it. She proceeded to fill us in on all the gory details, and I was slightly perturbed. Had we made a mistake? I was tired, and anxious to be in the comfort of my room. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, we were at the front of the line, checking in. I was slightly annoyed, because they were under staffed, and there was no distinct formation...it was all haphazard, to say the very least.\n\nBut I was happy on one note. There was a bell hop, and he was happy to serve us. We were also in no mood to find parking, so we went through valet. They were nice guys, so score for that. Anyway, on to the room. When we got to our room, I was content. I immediately flopped on to the bed, and noticed how soft it was. It would do for later on, when I would more than likely be buzzed, and even a cold, hard bathtub would do for a sleeping arrangement. The bathroom was quaint, but the lighting did not flatter, but I was okay with that. There also was a floor length mirror right in front of my bed, and while it wasn't the most flattering...I felt like it added ten pounds...(or was it my endless drinking that caused that?)...it was convenient for when I wanted to straighten my hair.\n\nThe first night, a friend joined us from Mandalay Bay, and we were determined to go out, but we were side tracked by a bar. Funnily enough, we never did go to the club we were originally thinking of going to, but spent our night away, getting intoxicated. The bartenders were a blast, and we did not feel sleepy until eight in the morning, when both of their shifts ended. I believe that place was called Ignite Lounge, and while my other friends went out, I was quite content staying within the safety of my casino for the night. It was a ritual throughout the trip, and amazingly enough, I met a couple of regulars that were staying at the Monte Carlo, as well. It transformed in to a kind of \"Cheers\" joint. I also met another fabulous bartender at Hit Lounge, and he entertained me for a couple of hours, talking about Las Vegas shenanigans, and actually told me to come on through later on if I wasn't going out, so we could throw back a couple of shots together. He was an older guy, but boy, he was so fun and relaxed! I suppose this is why I love casino bars. Since I'm from Arizona, and I frequent Scottsdale, I am accustomed to the snooty clientele that the nightlife attracts. I loved the chill factor here.\n\nAnd lastly, the food. Well, I went to the standard food court. We were supposed to all go to a buffet, but that plan was a bust. It definitely was an improvement to my eating fiasco at Excalibur. My whole diet consisted of a six inch sub from Subway, and that was my ambrosia for my duration of the trip.\n\nWould I come back and stay here? Abso-frockin'-lutely. I would stay here, JUST for the bartenders at Ignite lounge. Cool, cool dudes. We were even supposed to go to a strip club with them, but that will hopefully be another story for next time. Damn you, Vegas! \n\nPS: And may I add, I guess I had a pleasant stay because of the company I kept here. Remember, it's not the places you go to that counts...it's the people that can make or break an experience.
