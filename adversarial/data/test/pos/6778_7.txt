The food tasted good - but the dining experience and service left a lot to be desired.\n\nI went to Sumo Maya last night for the first time. I was invited out to meet a fiend for her B-day. When we got there at about 8:15pm the place was packed and thumpin' like a night club. Wall to wall people and barely an inch to squeeze by. \n\nWe found our group seated at a large table, they had already been there since 6:00pm and had been eating and drinking all night, so I had some catching up to do. Couldn't find the waitress or waiter - whoever was looking after our table for 20 minutes, so I fought my way upstream to the bar where I squeezed in and out of people at my attempt to get a drink. As expected the bar was slammed and everyone working there was super busy and it was next to impossible to get a drink order in. Finally got the attention of a bartender and I got my drinks rater quickly after I was able to place the order. \n\nWent back to my table of friends and joined in the fun. I was starving and wanted to order some food. About 40 minutes in a waitress finally showed herself only because two friends at my table grabbed her because they needed to tab out and leave early. I asked if I could order and she came over once she was available. My fiancé ordered the Pad Thai Pastor and I ordered the Braised Pork Belly. This is where it got awkward....\n\nI understand busy and when restaurants are busy all you can do is wait, I am fine with that, more drinks for me! - If you could get an order in. I was excited to see that Sumo Maya is so popular, which could only mean one thing...Sumo Maya was doing something right and must be worth the wait. So wait I did.\n\nAbout 30 minutes later my fiancés Pad Thai came, a server - not our waitress delivered it and placed it at our table, so naturally he waited for my order to come. When it was clear that my order was nowhere and most certainly not on its way - I asked him to start eating so that his didn't go cold. I waited, I waited, and I waited....He finished his meal and I finally found our waitress and asked where my order was and she informed me that the food comes out as it is completed in the \"free-flowing kitchen\". This meant nothing to me except that it lends itself to an awkward dating experience when one person has their food and the other does not. I understand appetizers coming at random times to a table, but not so much something that was ordered as a entree.\n\nThe menu did state \"Our unique free-form dining style is designed to heighten and arouse your senses.\" and not having dined at Sumo Maya before and the waitress didn't ask if we were familiar with the way in which their \"free-flowing kitchen\" works, I did not understand what Sumo Maya's \"unique dining style\" was. I thought that this disclaimer on the menu was just a fancy way of saying that everything is a-la-carte and tastes good. Not, you get it when you get it and waiting while your date finishes their entire meal and you just watch them eat is part of the heightened senses experience.\n\nThe music was so loud inside that it was next to impossible to have any conversations with anyone from our group. So while I awkwardly sat and waited for my meal all I could do was sit there and smile and watch my fiance eat his dinner. It was so darn awkward....no food, no conversation and no drinks.\n\nA little insight from the staff when ordering would have been wonderful and probably would have prevented an awkward situation. If you go there on a date, don't expect to be fed at the same time. The portions are very small but tasty. We were both still hungry after we finished the small portion controlled meals and there was no way we were going to make a second attempt at ordering more food...so we left hungry and went on to have a real dinner somewhere else. \n\nThis place is fun and cute but probably more of a pick-up joint and drinking place than a serious restaurant. Only good for apps and drinks, if you can get them! Also...bring earplugs cause it is louder than being front row at a concert.\nGood Luck!
