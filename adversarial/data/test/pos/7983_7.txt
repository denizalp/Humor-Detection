If I could give it zero stars I would!\nUntil Friday night Nikko was my favorite place to dine out in the Charlotte area. My kids knew it was \"Mommy's favorite restaurant\". We went here for birthdays, date nights and special occasions - never leaving with a bill under $300. In the past my friends and I got a kick out of the antics of Joanna the owner. However, Friday night I was appalled! She was obviously high on drugs! She started off repeating herself and not leaving our table after my husband and friends ordered Saki Bombs (she had 1 too - like she needed anything else to add to her buzz). Joanna then proceeded to pick several pieces of sushi off our platter, eat the fish off, spit out the rice - guess she's on a diet and watching her carbs - and put her 1\/2 eaten saliva covered food back on our platter with our uneaten food. If this were not disgusting enough she ate 1\/2 a piece of sushi and shoved the other half into my friends mouth!!! I was appalled to say the least and went to the hostess stand to get the manger. When I returned to the table she was hanging on my husband asking him \"Why you married to such a bitch?\" Carter, the manager, had Joanna removed from our table and hopefully sent home to sober up. We did not see her again that evening thank God! Our very embarrassed waitress and the manager handled the situation very well. Thank you to them. Joanna - thank you for ruining my birthday dinner! Thanks to you, I will be finding a new favorite restaurant!
