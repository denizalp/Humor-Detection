This place has some of the best sushi I've had in Vegas. I am a REALLY selective person when it comes to where I eat sushi. I only go for the good stuff!! It has to be FRESH and good quality. \n\nThis place is doing it right!! Their cat's eye roll and kai's roll we sooooooo good. FRESH as anything. My friend also got some of their nigiri and it was perfection. \n\nStill- Absolutely some of the best sushi in Vegas. Very impressed!\n\nThey lose one star because......My only issue was the service. Our server took FOREVER to come to the table and then after taking our orders she NEVER came back again. We had to flag down a random employee just to get the bill. So ridiculous.
