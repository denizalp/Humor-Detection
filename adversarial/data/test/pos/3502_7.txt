After days of searching for a restaurant to celebrate my boyfriends birthday, I finally settled on this establishment. I was so excited for him to see how beautiful this place is and to experience this seemingly amazing restaurant. \n\nI chose this restaurant because of the golf course feel since my boyfriend is an avid golfer and because he loves steakhouses. I figured this was a great retreat from the normal Vegas feel. \n\nThe atmosphere was very relaxing and romantic however our server is another story. From the second he greeted us he was rude and spoke to us as if we were children. Yes, we were probably the youngest couple around (we are in our mid 20s and early 30s) but that doesn't mean we needed to be talked down to. The server was rude, arrogant and just did not seem to want to deal with us.\n\nIn our opinion, the place is overpriced and the service was the worst we had the whole time we were in Vegas. With so many other options around, we will not return.
