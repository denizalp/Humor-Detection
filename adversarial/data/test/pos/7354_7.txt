I have good things to say about Woody's. \n\nLet's start with the food. It's great. I had seen pictures of the food online prior to my visit, and it appeared to be a good size. My burger was even thicker and juicier in person. Filled with flavor, crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, pretty much a slam dunk. I had one of the unique burgers, it was called the boom burger. It had some pulled pork on top, which was good too. I had a poutine as well, I added a picture. The gravy was this odd sweet flavor, but it was excellent overall. \n\nThe service was fair. It was ridiculously busy when I went, and they were clearly short staffed. They did the best job humanly possible, without coming across as rude. \n\nFinally the decor, I didn't get much of a view of the interior. I sat outside on the patio, which was decent enough. Crappy lakeshore view but what could you really expect.\n\nOverall quite good, worth a visit if you want a great burger, and don't mind paying a little bit more.
