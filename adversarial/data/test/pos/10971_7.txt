Let me start off by saying this: I LOVE ICE CREAM!!!!  Really though, who doesn't?  I no longer get excited for b-days to get presents but rather push them aside like a maniac and just slam my fork on the table until a piece of DQ ice cream cake is in front of me.  MMMMMM Ice cream AND cake, all in 1?!?!  This has to be one of the best creations ever.  Too bad my birthday isn't for another 341 days :-(\nI cursed this location the first few months it opened since I drive by it almost every day and it seems to whisper my name.  \n\n\"pssst, Mike, pssst, blizzard, pssst, ice cream cake\"\n\nAnyways, this DQ is brand new in McKenzie Towne and pretty standard inside.  There seems to be a good amount of staff so the long lines go quick as does the wait for the heavenly goodness.  The prices are standard for DQ (can get kinda pricey given that most ice cream items are around $5, but usually worth it).  Even though the large blizzard is a few cents more than the smaller sizes you probably dont need to get it unless you want to explode like an over-inflated balloon or share with 5 of your closest friends.  I can't really comment on the grill side and to be honest only realized they had something other than ice cream when I pass other locations with the \"1 day only 99 cent burger\" signs which seem to be out year round.  Guess it is one day only, everyday yaaaaaaay.  That is actually the reason I rated 4 instead of 3 as this location does not have the 99 cent 1 day only sign.\n\nApril underdog challenge 2\/30
