I don't know why we come back here -- I will say it's close to us and that's the only reason. My boyfriend and I have sat at the bar, the patio tables near the bar and the booths in the bar area and have waited for at least 15 minutes waiting for a server to greet us. Mind you, several of them walked by and we were staring at the bartenders who certainly noticed us with nothing in front of us and did nothing. The hostesses always look at us like we're crazy for asking for a server to come by, particularly the girl with the red hair. My boyfriend returned his soda very politely letting our server know it's flat, yet they continued to give him flat sodas. I specifically asked for regular salmon in my philly roll, as opposed to smoked salmon and accepted the $2 up charge to do that (no idea why it costs $2 to do that). They give me the rolls with smoked salmon anyway. Then it takes ridiculously long to get the correct order and my boyfriend is already done eating. Nothing bugs me more!! Returned my order altogether. Will never be back.
