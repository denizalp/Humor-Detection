I'm really, really late in writing this review, but I figure better late than never...\n\nI used Just-In Time back in March. This was my second time using a moving company. After my first experience, which was horrible, I was a bit nervous about trying it again. I'm soooo glad I chose these guys!! I can't remember any of their names (because it was a few months ago), but everyone was AWESOME!! The guy who set my appointment and gave me the rate quote was friendly and was able to give me an accurate quote. I liked this because all other companies I had contacted gave me a high\\low range that varied up to $500.\n\nWhen the movers showed up at my house, they were great too. Who knew I could have fun moving?!?! They were very personable and efficient. I couldn't believe at how quickly they had my old house emptied and new house unloaded. The quote I was given was 100% accurate. No surprise charges or fees. They made the move a positive experience.\n\nI've told everyone I know about how great they were\\are and I will recommend them to anyone who is looking to hire movers. If I ever need to move again, I will definitely use them. Thanks guys, you were great!! :)
