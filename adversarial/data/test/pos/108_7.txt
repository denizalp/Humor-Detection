I'm going to update my review for Mido because, well, they deserve an extra star.\n\nI took my neighbors to dinner here last Friday night as a thank you for watching my dog while I was in Las Vegas for a week. \n\nThe service was excellent.  We never waited for a refill.  We were brought the check as soon as we needed it.  And, the server put up with a lot of interesting conversation whenever he happened upon it (and laughed with us).\n\nThe value was phenomenal.  Where else can four adults and two children start with miso soup and crab salad, eat a gorgeous platter of sashimi, a tempura appetizer, sushi until they are filled and a scoop of ice cream PLUS have sodas and wine for $121 pre tip?\n\nMy only suggestion to AYCE newbies is to order the more expensive rolls first.  We just put all our rolls on the first sheet and we got the cheaper rolls like California roll and spicy tuna out first.  Then after a good amount of time, they brought the smaller, more expensive Pancho topped with spicy tuna and the soft shell crab rolls.  It is not a big deal if you have an unlimited appetite, but you might as well get the more pricey rolls with AYCE.
