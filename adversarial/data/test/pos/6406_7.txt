This review is for the ten-year period I have been using Phoenix Pest Control.  They service my 4000 square foot, 1 acre home quarterly for $36.50 per visit.  The price has been virtually the same for the entire ten years.  In addition, they have taken care of bee infestations three times (extra fee for this).\n\nBottom line is that I have not had any significant pest problem during that entire period, although I routinely had unwanted visitors before starting to use them.\n\nThey are punctual and courteous, and very accomodating to my varying times of availability.\n\nNOTE: I have no affiliation of any kind with this company, and they did not suggest that I write a review.
