I have been here twice now and I'm just not impressed. The restaurant has very awkward and uncomfortable seating and the atmosphere has grey and cold monotones. The tables are 1\/2 round tables and it's impossible to share with another couple. I can see why there are very few people dining here. There was only one person working behind the bar. She also came to our table and gave us menus and took our food order. She also brought us our food. She was very nice and friendly and attentive. But why is she working alone and doing everything? The last time I was here I had the short rib sandwich and it was horrible but I thought I would give this place another try. Unfortunately, I didn't like it my second time either. \n\nWe ordered the chicken drumsticks which were tasty. The fish and chips came with only a few fish strips not much bigger than the fries ( the size of your finger) They tasted fine but not worth the money. I got the grilled chicken BLTA and it was the best thing we ordered. It came on a buttery soft bun with bacon , lettuce, tomato, and avocado. The chicken was well seasoned, however the bacon was hard and chewy and the lettuce was wilted. The tomato also did not seem fresh to me. I did enjoy the sauce on the sandwich. It came alone and I feel it should have been served with chips and a pickle. \n\nWe then decided to try a dessert. They have only 2 on the menu. One is ice cream . Our waitress\/bar tender was nice and gave us a sample to try. It's not ice cream. It's more like a sherbet infused with liquor. I did not care for it. It's over priced and way too sweet for me. We decided on the chocolate chip cookie. For $7 it was the worst I ever had. It tasted like it was a few days old, was dry and crumbled and way too sweet. It came in a black skillet but was only slightly warm. It was dry and had no ice cream and no whipped cream on it. For less than half the price, the cookies next door at Starbucks are much better.\n\nWe complained about the food the last time and the waitress that time offered us free cocktails as pictured. They were very good. However, if I want a cocktail I would rather go where it's more fun and lively in a casino. Also, both times we came for lunch, and both times we were disappointed. I do not think we will go back.
