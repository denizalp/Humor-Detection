So, Rick Moonen decided to get rid of RM Seafood's 2nd floor and turn that space to Rx Boiler Room - a gastropub version of RM so it's a totally different vibe.  Dimly lit, velvety seats and curtains, leatherette tables and servers strutting in corsets. Rick Moonen going to our table and chatting with us.\n\nThere's one menu item I didn't fall in love with from RM and that's his lobster roll and I was surprised to see it on Rx's menu - I stayed away from that. They have an interesting drink menu but I can't really remember the drink names because they're soooo long like the Mario (something) Wrong Warp (something).  I wanted to try it but my attention span went out the door upon reading the name. \n\nWe tried chicken pot pie nuggets, inside out French onion grilled cheese, bacon-wrapped bacon n egg, braised oxtail croquettes Dijonnaise, Moonen tater tots, Johnny's big dry-aged burger.  For dessert, we had the matcha panna cotta and the pie Americana.\n\nChicken Pot Pie Nuggets:\nFried pot pie balls with carrots, peas, chicken bits and a bit of soup inside.  It's like the Western version (fried and fatty) of xiaolongbao (Chinese steamed soup dumplings). Great idea but the nuggets could use a bit more soup in them. 3\/5\n\nInside Out French Onion Grilled Cheese:\nProvolone, parmesan and gruyere in the crispy sammie sliced diagonally topped with pickles and served with a warm, slightly onion-y beefstock dip. French onion soup meets grilled cheese, basically. 4\/5\n\nBacon-Wrapped Bacon n Egg:\nToasted brioche with tomato jam, thick piece of bacon topped with a sunny side up quail egg, sprinkled with black sesame and chives with pea mousse on the side. My favorite dish of the evening...and quite possibly of any of Rick Moonen's creative ideas thus far.  I'm not even a fan of runny egg yolks...or egg yolks, period! But I imagined how they painstakingly cracked each tiny quail egg and fried them - I appreciate the patience that went into making this lovely dish. You got textures (crunchy, fatty, creamy) and flavors that compliment each other. There were 3 of us and a baby at the table and I ate 2 out of 3 (sorry, unfortunate person who didn't get to try one. You snooze, you lose). I had to do it. 5\/5\n\nBraised Oxtail Croquettes Dijonnaise:\nAs the name implies...Dijon + mayonnaise = Dijonnaise. Two of my least favorite things combined to create something that actually wasn't bad. The croquettes were more like fried mozzarella sticks in appearance but had savory and mildly sweet oxtail.  Dip it in lemon aioli...oh my! 5\/5\n\nMoonen Tater Tots and Johnny's Big Dry-Aged Burger:\nShawn got a medium rare burger (what a shocker!) with double the truffle cheese so I got tater tots (comes with ketchup and tartar sauce) to go with it. The tots tasted better dipped in tartar sauce. The burger was very messy to eat.  It has pickles, lettuce, tomato jam, Balsamic onions and your choice of cheese from the cheese plate (truffle, fontina, brie, cheddar or bleu). The cheese that was added onto the burger didn't taste truffle-y at all and was more like brie...double brie isn't that good. 3\/5\n\nMahalo Matcha Panna Cotta:\nMatcha green tea panna cotta in a generous serving topped with macadamia nut tuile, li-hung mui pineapples and passionfruit sorbet. Loved this dessert an it was worth skipping the gym for. Creamy mild green tea panna cotta and tart passionfruit sorbet. 5\/5\n\nPie Americana:\nClassic apple pie re-imagined served with vanilla ice cream and walnuts. 4\/5\n\nThese are your basic comfort food items. Anyone knows how to make these dishes and most restaurants have them.  But what's brilliant is reinventing the same dishes and making them seem interesting. I'm still hoping they could re-invent their lobster rolls though.  Service was good although there was some sort of confusion...with the complimentary bread which we didn't get.
