I am a big Mario Batali fan and have really enjoyed some of his other establishments such as Eataly and Mozza, but Carnevino left me wanting more.\n\n\/\/ LOCATION \/\/ In the Palazzo at the entrance of the casino on the strip so no need to walk deep into the casino to find it. \n\n\/\/ FOOD \/\/\n     + Ricotta and egg ravioli: Beautiful ravioli, but the 1 large ravioli I received for the small portion could not justify the anything but small price tag\n     + Porterhouse: Tried a bit of the porterhouse, but it lacked flavor and did not pack the punch you would imagine steak would at a steakhouse.
