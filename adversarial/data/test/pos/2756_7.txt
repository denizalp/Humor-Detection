TL; DR: Security didn't pay close enough attention to my ticket, causing me to go through security a second time. Customs was done via computers with NO assistance if passports couldn't be read. Customs agents were the unfriendliest I've encountered anywhere.\n\n\nThis was my first time flying Air Canada to and from Dublin, Ireland (with brief layovers in Toronto each time), and it was definitely a mixed bag. The return flight and interactions returning through Toronto was the biggest clusterf-.\n\nWe seemed to get through security well enough: bags were checked and x-rayed, and we were scanned. My mom was pulled aside for a \"random\" screening and I waited for her to be finished. We headed to the door to get to our gate and I was stopped by the security personnel who was checking tickets. She said that I was flagged for a screening, and had I been pulled for said screening? (Nope.) It turns out that their first security overlooked four S's on my ticket. I couldn't board without having my ticket stamped. I told her that I wanted a pat-down.\n\nShe had to keep yelling for people to come over to re-screen me, and then I had to then go back through security. My bag was scanned by hand and I was patted down. The ONLY bright spot of that was a man in charge noted I'd be given a pat-down and not put into the machine. (He apparently noticed my pregnancy, but did not assume nor make further inquiries.) I wasn't molested, either: just lightly touched and patted.\n\nTo go through customs was another issue: there are about 20 computers set up where one has to scan their passport. There is no one to help if the passports don't scan. Then off to another line to go to a customs agent, who is gruffer than I've ever encountered.\n\nGetting through all of these \"random\" security debacles resulted in us barely getting to our gate in time. It was difficult to LEAVE Canada! I mean, Trudeau's great and all..but I just wanted to go home!\n\nOverall, the Air Canada staff in Toronto fell short, primarily in security protocol and execution.
