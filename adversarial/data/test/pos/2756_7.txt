Spacious, great beer options, and a lot of restaurants in the area to choose from if you only want to come here for drinks. In fact, I have only ever ordered beer here. The only annoying part is that it is in a basement and every single time I visit them I lose internet connection. But then WIND is shit, so I can't really blame the restaurant.
