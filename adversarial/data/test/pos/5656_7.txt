Fast efficient drive thru service. \n\nThis is the McDonald I frequent the most and have been visiting for years.\n\nFood was mostly ok. Standard McDonald's quality. Though one time I got an ice cold Egg McMuffin.\n\nThis location does get really busy during weekday's lunch rush with all the factories in the area.
