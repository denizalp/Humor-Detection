My friend and I wanted to have breakfast and I suggested this spot as I had never been. It's close to Kiwanis Park which made for a lovely morning of dining and walking. It's located by Food City, which made it easy to find and was perfect since I needed to buy some items from there beforehand. \n\nWe walk in and go to the counter to place our orders. The place is small but cozy and I'm glad we were there early before it filled up. I ordered the pancake combo which comes with two pancakes, two eggs, hash browns, and bacon or sausage (I opted out of the meat). I was able to add a topping so I chose strawberries. My friend wanted to order from their lunch menu and got the veggie burrito. I loved my pancakes, they even looked different from your typical breakfast house pancakes. These looked homey and I particularly liked their ruched edges and dusting of powdered sugar. My eggs and hash browns were good as well, I love my sweet and savory choices. My friend liked her burrito too and prices were definitely fair. \n\nI also got a hot chocolate but it wasn't anything special, more on the sweet side than I'd like. The woman who took our order and got it ready was friendly and welcoming and I liked the vibe here. I came in with the intention of ordering crepes so I may have to visit again to try those.\n\nThey have 10% cash back through Yelp which is a great deal! Still waiting on mine to go through though.
