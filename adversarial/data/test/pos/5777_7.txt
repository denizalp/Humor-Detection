I've been using Toronto renting guide for the last few years now since I'm never around to deal with tenant's issue. Tony McCombe is my agent, he has been a great agent and his service has been a huge help in my property ventures. I would highly recomment him to anyone that is looking for an honest, reliable and trust worthy agent, that can get the job done right. He is on the ball and keeps me inform on everything that needs to be done to help my property ventures go smoothly and stress free. \n\nI am so glad to pick them instead of a realtor to rent out my place, becasue once a realtor help you find a tenant, their jobs will end there, but with Toronto renting guide, they will continue to work for you. I'm onto renting out my second property now, and will continue to use Tony to manage and rent out my unit while i take 6 months off to travel :D
