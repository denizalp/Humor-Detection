After getting use to how reasonable many of the restaurants were in AZ in comparison to the Bay Area, SumoMaya is one of the pricier options we tried but I knew I was in for a treat when I walked in to the sounds of the islands since the manager is from Hawai`i.  Although Yelp hours have them listed as being open from lunch through dinner, I did notice they have an hour break where they close between I believe 3-4PM.  Luckily we made it there in time for a late lunch.  \n\nAdmittedly I was so hungry that I did not get a chance to really savor the individual ingredients (apparently that was Brussel Sprout slaw on top) in the crispy pork belly roll as I practically inhaled it.  What I did taste was very good and the slaw does lighten up what could've been a heavy option.  \n\nThe good thing is after I satisfied those hunger pains, I did get a chance to slowly enjoy my choice of 3 tacos with veggie side which I felt was the best value if you want to try different flavors and in itself would've been enough to satisfy you for lunch as long as you did not come in starving.  Wanting a variety, I got the al pastor (pork), Korean beef, and battered cod tacos with a good sized side of Mexican corn.  The Mexican corn had a nice creaminess to the taste that was nicely offset by the crunch of the popcorn on the top (I do suggest moving the popcorn to your plate when you get it to avoid sogginess).  Out of the tacos, my favorite was the al pastor due to the flavor combination of grilled pineapple, avocado, and pickled red onions that highlighted the pork beautifully, followed by the Korean beef with pickled veggies, with the cod being my least favorite of the 3 as I felt it was too bland for me.  \n\nIf you get the mahi adobo, make sure to add rice for $2 as the protein itself is on the small side and you need the rice to make use of all the great flavors from the sauce.  The chicken mole with plantains came with a small scoop of rice so was a heartier option and really hits multiple taste buds with this dish, from the sweetness of the plantains to the savoriness of the chicken to the slight but mildly spicy punch of the mole sauce.  \n\nOverall, they did a wonderful job in fusing the Mexican and Asian flavors together.
