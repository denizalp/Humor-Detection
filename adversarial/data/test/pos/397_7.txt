Nice little shop that is primarily take out.  There is a small stand up counter you can eat at.  Staff was friendly and helpful to a few of the customers that had questions.  The pizza is thin crust with a little chew and good sauce.  Definitely a place for a couple of slices or sandwich when in the neighborhood.
