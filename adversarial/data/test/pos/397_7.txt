Everyone is complaining that this place is pretentious...well that just happens to be one of the reasons why I come here!\n\nI love the lay out of the store, it's always clean and they let you sample whatever flavours you want downstairs before you buy. The queue is crazy on the weekend so come on a week night if you can to avoid the mayhem. You can bring the capsules back for recycling and they keep all of your info on file so there is no need to remember anything, which is perfect for me.\n\nNespresso has made me a nicer person in the morning so I for one love this store and their product.
