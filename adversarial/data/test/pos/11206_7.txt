I previously reviewed this place 3 stars because out of the two times I went, both times they messed up our orders. I gave it another shot and wahhhlaaa, third times the charm. I got the two drinks I ordered correct, and they were very yummy. And the owner even gave us a sample of another drink to try. I know they're new so I'm glad they're working out the little kinks. Again, like I said in my previous review I love the taste of their boba! Yummm!
