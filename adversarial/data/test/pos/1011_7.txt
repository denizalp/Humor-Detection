The sauce is boss. It's like a peppery ketchup and it's pretty tasty. Cane's serves chicken fingers and chicken fingers ONLY, so if you don't like chicken, don't come! I usually get the box combo, it comes with 4 chicken strips, fries, coleslaw and texas toast. I don't really care for the slaw, so I substitute for extra fries. Cane's will let you sub anything you don't like for anything else that you do like so its a win-win for everyone! One thing to note is they do NOT have ranch for a dipping sauce so don't bother asking. They do however have honey mustard, ketchup and of course cane's sauce. Also they have super good sweet tea to wash it all down.
