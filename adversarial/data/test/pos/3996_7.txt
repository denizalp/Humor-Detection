so i'm always up for a new experience and rogue west was a \"one of a kind.\"  I think at the time, I used the word \"terrifying,\" but in hindside I had a really great time.  They had live music on a Friday night and there was no cover charge.  The only lyrics that i understood from the band referenced a woman's tight nether regions, but who am i to judge, right?  so I just did what anyone would do and sang along...
