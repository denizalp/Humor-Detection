It had been years since I'd been to Hanny's, but after going there for lunch I think I should have waited a few more years. Maybe all of them.\n\nI think the decor is going for industrial retro... something, but it comes across as soulless. The place would be well suited for a dystopian movie where androids come to lament their lack of humanity and try hard to be clever.\n\nThe food is okay, but not a thing on the menu seemed exciting. The servers also seemed bored and\/or bothered to be there. The most exciting part of my lunch there was the elevator shaft you could look down. It has a glass floor so you can see down into the basement. The glass is probably there because past patrons threw themselves down there to escape.
