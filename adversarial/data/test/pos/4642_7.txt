I've been going to Healthcare Partners Medical Group for at least 5 years or more! I'm only rating this place so high because of how much I really enjoy my doctor! I have switched between a few locations because of my doctor's constantly leaving. For a while I even stopped because it was so inconsistent . I had concerns as to what was going on behind the scenes that would cause for such a high turnover of doctors with this medical group. Although this location is at least 25 minutes from me,  I am now back with visiting my newest physician Dr. Whitley! He is pretty awesome and like others I have experienced the whole appointment ordeals as well as even waiting for long period of times in the past. I do believe they may have improved slightly because I haven't had any issues...Yet..so I am hoping we can continue with this trend.
