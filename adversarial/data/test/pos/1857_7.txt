OK... Moriarity. It's an Irish name. I went in to this place with the highest of expectations. And what a disappointment... The owner was friendly when I walked in; greeted me pleasantly, introduced himself, and informed me that his son was in training. When I ordered a pint of Guinness, he told me that he was going to instruct his son on the proper technique which, while making me sweat a little, was a good thing to hear because it told me that they, at Moriarity's, cared. \n\nWell..... First off, they don't have the right glasses. There goes a star. And then, the pint came a long with NO HEAD whatsoever. Apparently, this guy thinks it's supposed to look like a pint of English ale with black food colouring in it. Without the proper head, we all know it just doesn't taste right... the scent of a beverage is half of the experience and the taste!!\n\nOk... so I figured I'd give him another chance. I asked the owner for a second pint while his less-experienced son was out back doing chores.. As is the practice of any Guinness drinker, I ordered my second pint while I still had almost half a pint in my first glass, so as to give the bartender ample time to properly pour my pint and present it just as I'm finishing the previous pint. This dude tells me that he runs a green establishment and, in order to save on water, soap, and other dastardly effects of not reusing my glass, will wait until I've finished before he pours my second pint into the first glass. (Now, I'm all about the environment... and I'd be happy to rotate two glasses in order to comply to such a practice as his, BUT... ). \n\nI finally convinced him to pour the pint for me so it would be ready... he did as bad a job as his son. AND as I tried to enjoy this second sad pint, he stood there and lectured me about the environment... all-the-while Obama-bashing and toting the great environmental conscience of the Republican Party... Boy, was he barking up the wrong tree.
