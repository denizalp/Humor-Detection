Now, you should know that I absolutely love Playa Cabana. Seriously. I'm like their number one fan girl. I love that place. So giving PCH a two-star review is not easy for me. But it is a bit necessary based mostly on the service here. Let me explain:\n\nI've been in here a few times at night for a drink with some friends and to share some appetizers. It is so well decorated in here and has a perfect, neighbourhoody feel to it which would make it an excellent place to share a beer or a mojito amongst pals. Right? Well...not really according to PCH. I always feel rushed when I'm in here. The servers are not afraid to let you know when they're ready to close (even if it's a solid 2 hours before their posted closing time). I've had servers turn the lights on bright in the restaurant, wipe down my table while we still are finishing our drinks, take away our half-eaten appetizers (thinking that we're done...or implying that we should be), and serve us our bill way before we were ready to leave. And again, this is all at like 10pm, which is super weird because they're billed to stay open until 2am (except on Sundays when they close at 11). This sort of service just really annoys me. \n\nThe other thing that makes me less than impressed by PCH is the price of the food here in comparison to Playa Cabana. You're paying more for tacos here...tacos that are the exact same as those you could get at Playa Cabana. That's weird to me. I don't get why I'd pay more for the same taco at a place that might look cooler but treats me with less consideration. \n\nAll in all, just go to Playa Cabana. You'll be happier in the end.
