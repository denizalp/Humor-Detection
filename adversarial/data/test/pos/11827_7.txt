Well... Let's see, I've been to Honey Salt three times now and honestly not sure I'll go back again. I consider myself pretty knowledgable about restaurants and food in general and I just consider my recent experience as unexciting. The food is a little on the expensive side (very comparable to strip hotel prices) and just blah. I understand this restaurant is big into the farm to table mentality (so over this catch phrase) and utilize mostly local vendors but really $170 for lunch for six with no apps or alcohol and one ate from the children's menu. Half of us had water, our splurge was a couple desserts.\n\n   I guess the biggest letdown was the less than stellar food. My daughter had pasta with butter and cheese on kid's menu, no cheese and it was maybe 3\/4 cup of pasta with olive oil salt and pepper, $8. Side of kids edamame, $4. Then my husband had the burger, $17, overcooked, forgot his bacon he ordered with it and the fries, well let's just say they need to change the fryer oil. So... While it was not awful, our lunch today was just very blah. In retrospect there are so many other places I would have rather spent my money.
