I've had two pretty bad experiences here, so I likely won't be coming back. The first of my visits, we ordered food, waited over an hour for it, and after a few encouraging words from different servers and bartenders, we were told it just wasn't happening and we should leave. Not. Cool. \n\nThe second visit was before 8pm on a Friday night with barely anyone else out on the street or in the bar, and began with the bouncer checking my ID, skeptically looking at me (I had a pixie haircut in my license photo and my hair has since grown...as hair does), asking me a bunch of questions to keep me in conversation and standing there, double checking my ID, and finally letting me in. We all got a beer and just stood around the bar--not a rowdy group, not a sketchy group, just some people enjoying a beer--but that bouncer kept coming in and eyeing me. WHAT THE HELL, DUDE. Hair grows, I tend to look young, but I'm not trying to trick you. Seriously. Cool. Your. Jets. \n\nThe projector screen cutting off part of the bar is also pretty weird to me.\n\nI'll never come back here willingly. After getting turned away because they couldn't keep up with business one night and then being watched because a bouncer didn't trust me for God knows whatever reason, I find this place pretty unpleasant.
