Looking for some trendy stylish options that won't break your bank? This is the place to go. They even occasionally have some of the nicer brands in stock, though it can get a bit overpriced. While thrifting around with Leanne C. we spotted a D&G sweater for $65! This is a bit much don't you think? But they have a really good selection and most of the time prices are reasonable.\n\nI do have a major gripe with their parking situation though. They have no parking out back. Like seriously none, and there are signs all over warning you about the towing situation. So you end up parking across the street in the 2 hour parking lot and running across the busy intersection. As much as I liked Frogger, I'm not fond of doing a live action reenactment of it.\n\nI think this place can be summed up as good deals, cool clothes, crummy parking.
