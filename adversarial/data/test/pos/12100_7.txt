Unexpectedly delightful ice cream in a strip mall location (like just about all my good finds in Phoenix).   Honestly, I was just looking for a quick break and much needed sugar on the drive back from (sleep deprived) days in Vegas...what I found was one of the best ice cream I've had in Phoenix.\n\nThis little independent gem does it all...ice cream, gelato, mix-ins...and Karen was amazingly friendly and overwhelmingly generous with all her samples.  I was told that she makes everything herself on site.  Everything I tried was super tasty...but the one flavor that can get me in my car and back to Surprise would be Red Velvet.\n\nPricing is a bit different here...you pay for ice cream by the weight rather than by the scoop...great for me since I really do prefer little scoops....lots and lots of little scoops
