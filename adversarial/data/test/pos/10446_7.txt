Let me start with this: Will I be coming back here after my first experience next time I'm in Vegas? Yeah sure why not. Why only 4 stars and not 5 stars you ask? It's because the advertised \"free\" limo ride to Sapphire's comes with a catch. There's a two drink minimum for each person and with each drink costing $20, that's $40 total for one person. The price for a normal cover into the club. Plus you need to tip the limo driver. The limo driver made sure to remind me to \"take care\" of him when he dropped us off. Usually the limo driver's supposed to take care of the client and not the other way around but ok.\n\nOther than that, I had a good time at the club. You get seated at a table, get your drink order in, and then girls come flocking to you, especially if you continue to buy lap dances. As a normal guy, I do love all that attention. The girls range from skinny Asians straight off the boat from China to super hot, busty blonde girls you'd see in a porno starring Lexington Steele. \n\nI got here at 2am from Marquee and didn't leave until around 5am. At the \"start\" of the night, I'm estimating there were around 75-100 girls. By the time I left, around 40 or so. Still a lot of hot girls to choose from. Just make sure that if you see a girl that you want, grab her quick because she's a hot commodity and will probably be nabbed by another guy if you don't act on it. \n\nLap dances are $20. The two I got (or three or four I don't know) were great. They last a full song and you can touch almost everything. Everything above the belly button is fair game.\n\nBeers are $13. Ouch.\n\nCan't really say anything about the VIP area since I never went back there but girls were quoting me at around $100-$150 for around 15 minutes in the back. Another girl told me about private rooms overlooking the club that go for upwards of a grand. You can see the one way glass of the rooms if you look up next time you're in the main room. I can't really say what goes on in there since I've never been in one.\n\nI think a majority of the negative reviews that you see on here are because of poor planning. If there's something specific that you want or are looking for, make sure to call the club in advance.\n\nNext time you're in Vegas, other than Spearment Rhino, make sure to check out Sapphire's as well before leaving. I'll post another review when I check out their day club this Spring.
