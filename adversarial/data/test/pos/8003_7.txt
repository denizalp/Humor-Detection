This tiny sushi bar and sit down is a great place to have a bite when you're in the mood for AYCE. It's $22 for lunch and $25 for dinner starting at 4pm. It's open tip 3AM, which is a huge, huge plus for me as a hungry college-goer! We need our after party snacks ;) \n\nAmbiance: 3 - Small, but homey. Almost too small for my taste. Sitting at the bar is more roomy than chillin at the tiny table my party of 2 was seated! Fun, American music playlist though aha! I heard everything from 90's to alternative to punk rock. \n\nService: 4 - One thing about a small place, it means pretty quick service. I've deff been to slower sushi places! It only took about 10-15 minutes for all my orders to come out, and most everything was correct. They were also super attentive and really friendly and kind!! \n\nFood: 4 - Food was yum! But nothing to write home about. Yet, I'd still go back! I did especially love the ahi tostadas, and fresh nigiri (all of it)--which I'm a huge fan of! Not the freshest fish I've had, but still pretty dang tasty. For specialty rolls, I'm addicted to soft shell crab, so my favorite rolls always include those. (Bank & Spider are my go-to's) For dessert, you can only have one! Sadly, they were out of green tea mochi :( But I made do with coffee. \n\nDefinitely interested in coming back to taste more nigiri during lunch--gotta save those bucks! Go try their 'small dishes'; it will definitely make you fall in love with fresh fish!
