I don't know much about this stuff, but came here with my husband because he was looking for a safe. We didn't want to be those people, but we walked in 45 minutes before they closed. At least it wasn't like 10 minutes before they closed, right? 5 minutes earlier, we were at The Safe Keeper, but the guy there didn't seem too thrilled about his job or about helping us. So we decided to stop here since it was in the same area. \n\nMarc was awesome! He greeted us as soon as we walked in and spent the entire time with us before they closed. He was very friendly and knowledgable about the different brands, configurations, add-ons, delivery, installation, etc. All of our questions were answered in detail and we were able to take a look at a lot of different safes.\n\nWhen we figure out which one we want, we will definitely come back here!!
