You can definitely tell as soon as you walk up to Switch that it is part of the FEZ-Ticoz family. The decor is bright, modern, and colorful, a style of atmosphere that always makes me feel comnfortable and excited about the food even before I try it. I met Kym S. here for lunch and wasn't feeling so hot the morning after a pretty long night out on the town. Before long (thanks to some great company and satisfying food), I was feeling a lot better!\n\nKym S. ordered the Sangria Chicken sandwich, which came with a side Caesar. It looked great and was massive, but I'll let her comment on how good it was. I was craving something really filling, so I got the Gallette (pronounced Gah-let according to our server) with Beef and Mushrooms ($10.45 plus $1.95 to add a field greens salad), and it was fantastic. I think I was expecting something like a meat pie, which it was not, but I was happy with what it actually was - a thin layer of puff pastry topped with savory beef slices, mushrooms, and a creamy gouda sauce. It REALLY hit the spot. The field greens salad was good, although it was soaked in dressing, which kind of drowned out the flavor of the fresh greens. \n\nThe service was definitely a highlight of the experience. Our server was very attentive and kept checking back with us. He also brought carafes of water and diet coke over, which is a brilliant business move on my part. It streamlines and facilitates service because people aren't constantly asking for refills, and both the servers and customers end up happier. The Diet Coke I ordered was a bit on the pricey side (around $2.75), but I was ok with this given the fact that I had a carafe to refill from. \n\nThis is a really nice spot to meet a friend for lunch, and I will definitely be back. I also think it would make a great place for a casual, low-key happy hour - from their website, it looks like they have drink specials from 4-6:30 (2-4-1 caipirinhas, margaritas, and sangria).
