Many date nights on Mill Ave while trying to make the most of Phoenix night life scene.  Located in Tempe and close to the University.  It's a snippet of the kind of night life I'm accustomed to.  But if you happen to find yourself in Phoenix and wondering what to do or where to go.  Start here.  There's a variety of restaurants and bars to try.  It's walkable and beats sitting in your hotel room watching t.v.  You'll be in college area territory so things can get interesting.
