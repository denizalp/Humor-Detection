Went here last night with a friend who has never been around 9:30 PM. Since we were only two people, we literally got in right away without a reservation. We got seated quickly, had enough time to peruse the menu before ordering, and the food came out quickly as well. We didn't have to ask for refills on our water or ice tea at all during the night, the only extra we asked for was of their sweet butter which the first batch melted very quickly. My friend ordered the stuffed dates and the lamb skewers, and she said both were very very good. I switched it up a little and got the veggies and lentils, tortilla a la espanola, and the warm spinach salad which was ridiculously delicious and at a very good price. For both of us to dine it was $18 each including tip. It was a ridiculously busy night so I was amazed at the quality of the service compared to the Plaza location. We even had a waiter switch and still the ball was never dropped. It was a very smooth visit which reinforces my belief that having a small party is the way to go unless it is a special occasion. Good job, Paradise!
