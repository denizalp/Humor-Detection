Took the 6 hour excursion and Nate was our Pilot WOW!!!!!!!!!  We saw the Hoover Damn, some of the most beautiful scenery on the planet.  We landed at the bottom of the canyon for a boat ride on the Colorado river and the guide a descendant of the tribe that takes great care of the land gave us about the best tour.  You can see just how much they tribe and the people love and revere the land.  When it was time to leave Bert picked us up and flew us to the bus tour portion on the trip Bert was also a really nice guy.  The trip included a visit to the Skyfall amazing, the 4 stops on the tour were all great hindsight being 20\/20 I'd of started with Guano Point 1st then worked my way back.\n\nOne thing is for sure no matter if you a spiritual person or not looking at the Grand Canyon just takes your breathe away.  The fact that man made the Hoover Damn is unbelievable.  The trip was 6 hours in total as worn out as we were we wished it had been longer I don't think you can ever get tired of looking at that scenery.  Again,\nthanks Nate a fellow Dawg for taking care of my wife letting her sit up front to get some really good pictures we'll remember and recommend you guys for a very long time.
