The service is here is really lacking. It was really empty and we were the only ones there. We got no free bread. Our drinks took forever to come out from the bar. We got an appetizer that we didn't even order. And the food was much too expensive for what we ate. Our server was nowhere to be found most of the time. The discount she gave us in the end just didn't suffice. Never coming back. Such a shame to the service industry. I'm still furious about this place.
