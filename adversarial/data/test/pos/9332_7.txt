This club is attached to 8 1\/2 which makes the $20 cover worth paying.  Gogo dancers are yummy.  bartenders are so attentive and friendly.  They do play mainly house music.  Hip Hop music and dance is played on the 8 1\/2 side.  Drinks are reasonable $8 wells, and they do use big drink cups, and they have a strong poor. This is where most locals come, and the crowd is the typical gay fabulousness bitches.
