To me it's not a typical Asian tea and juice spot that I'm used to in the SF Bay Area. Here, workers are a diverse bunch, of both genders, and likely college students. There's a TV that plays clips of martial arts action scenes from movies. That alone gave it an extra star.\n\nThe taro milk tea and hot ginger milk tea were good. Friends seemed to like this place as we went out of the way to go here on our Vegas visit. We got drinks to-go but there were a few wooden tables for twos and fours, with a mixture of visitors and locals.\n\nOn my visits, the line was out the door. Well, that's all relative since from the cash register to the front door allows for maybe 4-5 people at most when stood in a single line.
