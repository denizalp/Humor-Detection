PDQ is very good at making the impossible possible. Seriously, for most events, I use a Botique PR firm for booklets, collaterals, etc. For Golf Tourneys: their turn around on signage is Jedi. Seriously. \n\nNot only can they deliver far beyond most deadlines, they know the specs to virtually every course and can save you that hassle. I've had signs picked up within hours of shotgun (not that I suggest that route, but great to know it can happen; especially when every donor dollar counts in non-profit world; signage matters) \n\nSo for saving my sanity during sleepless pre event nights: PDQ has my eternal gratitude and stamp of approval. \n\nYelp 100 Challenge
