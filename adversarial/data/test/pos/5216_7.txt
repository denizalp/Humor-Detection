I've got a chance to try out this restaurant tonight.  I was surprised that it's pretty full as it's not located at a very popular location; only tugged at the back corner in Heartland area, right beside Made in Japan Teriyaki.  \n\nThe decor was clean, modern and service was prompt and friendly. Every table was given an iPad to order food. You can order each dish by piece, so no food would be wasted as you would know how much you have ordered. Each dish came out very quickly so there's no point to order a large quantity at once anyway.\n\nIn terms of food quality, I can only say it's average ~ very average I mean. Selections for sashimi & sushi were very limited. On the other hand, the fish was very fresh.  Cooked dishes had far more choices (Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Korean). I personally enjoyed the curried beef dish and tum yum soup. Many other dishes were quite bland. Interestingly there were quite a few dessert choices. I liked the deep fried banana, and deep fried milk custard.\n\nThe price is only the pricey side ($24.99 for adult on weekends; $19.99 for seniors)  I would say Prince sushi or Spoon & Fork have better food quality than Heart, but the iPad menu definitely won the novelty category.\n\nDecor: 4 (1 goes to iPad ordering menu and its efficiency)\nService: 3.5\nFood: 3\nPrice: 3
