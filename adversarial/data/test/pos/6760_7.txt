Do you love fist pumping bros converging with several bachelorette parties?  A siren going off every 3 minutes to let you know you're having a good time while a girl standing on the bar pours free shots down your throat?\n\nThere are a lot of people having fun here.  And while I laughed out loud at this ridiculous scene, I'm not all for it. Especially when I have to pay a cover for a place as crappy as Buckhead.\n\nBuckhead is basically a frat party, except people try to pretend that it's better than that.  It's not.
