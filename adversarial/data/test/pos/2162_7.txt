Had a great dinner here.  Shout out to the GM for taking good care of us.  They start you off with a generous serving of chips and salsa.  Chips are just right, crunchy and light. Addicting so take your time!  Shrimp ceviche was great and paired with plantain chips.  A nice sweet contrast.  Steak fajitas cooked with onions, red and green bell peppers. Neatly displayed sides of pico, sour cream, and cheese.  I really loved the tongs provided to assist in assembling the fajitas. Finished every bite.  \n\nService was excellent, didn't skip a beat.
