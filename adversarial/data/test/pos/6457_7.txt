It was my first time here and I would come back if I was hungry and this was an option. \n\nThe staff was friendly and pretty quick, probably because they forgot the bacon that was supposed to be on my sandwich hence the three stars. \n\nThe restaurant was also clean except for the bathrooms. I know there are heathens out there that abuse bathrooms but you've got to stay on top of them.
