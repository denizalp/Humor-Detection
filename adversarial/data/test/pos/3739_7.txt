Had a wonderful pedicure and fresh paint on my nails. I believe the man who did my nails was named Chris. Older gentlemen. Really nice and pleasant. Did a wonderful job. Very relaxing. The massage was great. Got a little anchor design on my toes by Leslie. Will def be back!! Go check them out. It's very clean too which is a huge plus.
