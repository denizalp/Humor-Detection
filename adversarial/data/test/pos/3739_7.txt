First review of 2017! My friend and I loved this spot. I suggested it since we wanted somewhere in Old Town and it was one of my bookmarks. We started off with drinks; I got Mexican Sprite (tasted similar to regular Sprite) and my friend got iced tea. I already know I wanted to order the brussels sprouts nachos from the rave reviews and my friend wanted guacamole so we ordered both. SO MANY CHIPS. I loved the nachos; the sprouts were charred and lots of flavor with the peppers, corn, cheese and the extra sauces they brought to our table. It was fun trying them all. Happy hour meant appetizers were half off, great deal.\n\nWe decided to also get shrimp tacos on flour tortilla and I thought it was delicious. You can choose corn or crispy tortilla and get rice and other sides with it for more money. Diego Pops doesn't do Taco Tuesday BUT they do have Taco Monday, which gets them twice the customers for those thinking they have special deals on Tuesday. \n\nOur server was friendly and funny and the place itself is cute. We sat outside as did most everyone else and they had heaters and candles to set the ambiance. I'd come back, they've got a good selection of items on their menu and food was tasty.
