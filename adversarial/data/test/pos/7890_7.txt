Walked into an empty restaurant on a Sunday at 4 pm and were told they were booked solid. The outdoor seating area with 10 or so tables was completely empty, but without reservations, we'd have to wait at the bar for an hour and a half. I thought that the idea of this place was a gastropub, i.e. a public house. Instead they came across as condescending, pretentious pricks. Way too many other high quality restaurants in Pittsburgh I'll be voting for with my dollars.
