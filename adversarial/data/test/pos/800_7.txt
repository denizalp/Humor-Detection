This is a Habs bar,  I'm a Habs fan, and I come here for one reason - to watch hockey. For that purpose, it's one of the best places in the city. This was my spot for  the historic Canada-US men's gold medal game in 2010 and my favourite place for watching the playoffs. I come with a friend who is a regular, and we're treated very well by the friendly owners and staff (even though my friend has a tragic character flaw: he's a Bruins fan.) Much of the decor comes from the old Forum, and the place will warm the heart of any displaced hockey-loving Montrealer.\n\nThe staff are efficient and friendly and remember your drink even if you're not a regular. I haven't explored much of the menu, but the nachos are good, and there's a small but decent selection of beer on tap.\n\nFor important hockey games, it's important to either reserve or come early; one of the reasons it's a great place to watch the game is that they turn people away if they fill up, which they often do. The regulars here have known each other for years, show up in full regalia, and tolerate each others' quirks (including my friend's inexplicable team choice.) There's plenty of good-natured ribbing, but nothing nasty is tolerated. The crowd is really the main attraction of this place. For celebrating Habs playoff runs and mourning the sadly-too-frequent defeats, these are the people you want to be with.
