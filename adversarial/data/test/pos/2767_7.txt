I'm not sure \"elegant\" is the adjective I would use to describe this restaurant, I would however describe it as DELICIOUS! \n\nRecently came here for a UYE organized by our resident Chinese cuisine experts Wayne C. and Jennifer K. We had a multitude of dishes, the meal went as follows: \n\nImitation snake soup- kind of bland, nothing special really. Filled with chicken and assorted seafood to give it a snaky(?) texture. I did however enjoy the herbs and croutons served on the side as they provided some crunch to the soup. \n\nBraised seasonal vegetables with mushrooms- simple dish to provide some greenery, I am a fan of bok choy and mushrooms so I liked this dish.\n\nBraised duck with taro in plum sauce- HOLY F*CK, I have eaten my fair share of duck but this dish easily ranks amongst the best duck dishes I have ever had. The duck was so juicy, the sauce was sweet without being too sweet and the taro was nice and soft reminding me of a roasted potato. This dish was a winner. \n\nSweet and sour pork with pineapple- The owner made a bold statement by claiming this was the best sweet and sour pork in Ontario, but after tasting it I can say that his hubris is not misguided. The pork pieces were perfectly breaded, crispy, not oily at all, so juicy with just the right amount of sweetness, definitely a far cry from the pork in neon red sauce one sees at your local food court. I will come back for this dish any day. \n\nHoney mustard beef tenderloin- was served in an edible fried taro basket. The beef was tender and basically coated with honey mustard. Again I am a big fan of mustard so this dish was right up my alley. As for the taro basket, I think I have a new favourite deep fried root vegetable. Sorry sweet potato fries, I know we had a good thing going for a while but fried taro is just so damn amazing! \n\nFried fish with pine nuts and orange- I was not a big fan of this, found the sauce too sweet which was off putting. \n\nOyster stir fried with port wine- Holy cow those were some ginormous oysters, nice depth of flavour in the sauce. Pretty interesting to see a Chinese dish made with port wine, clearly the head chef is willing to put a twist on some traditional dishes, very impressive. \n\nDessert- consisted of tofu pudding in a ginger sauce which was good, tofu had a nice texture and ginger sauce did not have too strong of a taste. Jackfruit, basil seed and green tea jelly was nothing special, didn't really do much for me. \n\nOther than the food, the décor can only be described as eclectic. The owner clearly enjoys collecting all kinds of art work, antique pieces and statues giving this restaurant a bit of a clumsy décor. They also have some of these pieces for sale in case one feels like shopping during dinner. I will give them props for the awesome fish tank full of rare (i.e expensive) fish, it is beautiful. Décor aside these guys are making some pretty special dishes and I for one will come back anytime.
