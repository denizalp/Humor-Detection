Newly opened, this mom and pop shop is really charming. Since they're still getting the kinks out, there were a few menu items that they didn't have up and running yet. However, what we did have was quite tasty!\n\nTotal for two including generous tip, 6 dishes and 2 beers: $80\n\nKarage (fried chicken): was good. Nothing crazy, but still satisfying. Came with a mayo. \n\nWarm ramen salad: maybe my favourite of the meal! Came with a few pieces of  prosciutto and fresh cooked okra. Light dressing that was well complimented\n\nDaily veg of the day dish: fresh vegs including okra and eggplant\n\nLobster dumplings: yum! Lobster pieces, not  minced!\n\nTonkatsu: fried pork is generally good! :)\n\nPickled veg appetizer (forget the name): was very yummy, and flavourful. \n\nAll in all, we look forward to returning and trying other items on their menu, and definitely recommend it to others. It's pretty quiet right now, and I think it's an odd location for it. It's one of those restaurants that you hope others don't find out about, as it's nice to not have to book reservations, but at the same time, we want them to do well, so they stick around. The last few joints in that location have not had much success, and we hope Kobo Nobu Cookhouse is not fated the same!
