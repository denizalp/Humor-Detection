Whatever Yelpers want\nYelpers get\nAnd Capital Grille, Yelpers want you!\n\nI've made up my mind to have no regrets\nRecline myself, resign myself, I'm not through yet\nI always get what I aim for\nAnd your food is what I came for!\n\n\nNice classy touch as I walked in with a swagger.  Sham-pania sir? Why yes Lurch!\n\nKudos to Lindsey! Capital Grille was definitely different.  I really enjoy dressing up, but I wish it was little cooler to bust out my blazer, but all is well.  Did anybody checkout the ice sculpture of Yelp -- that was impressive!  Made my random shot of the day!\n\nSandwiches were amazing, my favorite with the crab cake sandwich yum!  I love crab cakes, but who know to put it between a bun and make it a burger.  The Filet sandwich was soft; I thought it would've slide right off after the first bite, but nope!  The raspberry champagne was best I have to add. - Enjoy
