Bye Bye Miss American Pie...\n\nMan, I know I have been around a while when I can sing the lyrics to this song at the top of my lungs while a light show overhead is happening and I am not alone in this experience. \n\nImagine a Telegraph Avenue with the eclectic mix of hippies, druggies (think old men on ectasy), bible thumpers, and kiosks with things to buy along with Billy Joel cover bands, too many children and teenagers, cougars and hookers all on one street. This is Las Vegas in all of its glory and a fun show to watch at least once in your lifetime. \n\nThe music and graphics changed since I was last here, but definitely fun.
