Running errands... of course. That's what I'm always doing. LoL. The life of a stay at home mom. \n\nI was on this side and needed my Starbucks fix. I went in, the staff was friendly and courteous. I have my couple usual orders I always pick from while on the run. I only switch it up when it's a hot hot day and need a refresher. \n\nThe baristas were great. My Salted caramel mocha Frappuccino was perfection and I was on my way. If I am on this side again, I am sure I won't hesitate to stop by. You all know how picky I am about customer service and my flavored coffee, so this was a good surprise.  \n\nI think I will stop by more often since one of my kids friends lives around here. Their constant play dates will be a great excuse, but then again...when do I really need an excuse for my favorite drink of the day!!!  ps... got no pic. I was in a hurry today I guess  LoL
