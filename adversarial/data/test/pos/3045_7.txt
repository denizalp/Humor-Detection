What's not to love about $6.99 steak and eggs and $2.50 for 20 oz. of beer? \n\nLocation: \nOff the Vegas strip - about 15-20 minute walk from Planet Hollywood. \n\nWe came early in the morning, around 10:30 AM and there was no wait for 2 people. The service was kind of slow, but the food was so worth the wait. We were starving by the time our food came, which was good because portions are huge!! \n\nFood: \nMy boyfriend ordered the Steak and eggs which also comes with toast and potatoes. The steak was perfectly cooked with great flavor. I ordered the Chicken Fried Chicken with eggs, potatoes, and toast. The Chicken Fried Steak costs $7.99, but it was so worth it! The Chicken Fried Chicken has gravy layered on top which also goes well with their potatoes! My boyfriend and I loved this dish more than the steak, even though the steak is a great deal!! \n\nI can't imagine myself spending more than $6.99 for steak and eggs, now that I've tried this place.
