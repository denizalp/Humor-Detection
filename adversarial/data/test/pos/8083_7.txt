It's nice to have Thai food nearby whenever I happen to go over to Robinson to go shopping, like many Pittsburgh shoppers. Even better is having a choice between Thai, Chinese, and Japanese\/Sushi in going to Papaya.  However, my last experience here was so terrible that I won't give them repeat business. \n\nBut first, the things I liked about Papaya.\n\nThe ambiance of the location is very nice; I quite like the internal decor, even if the exterior doesn't make it stand out any more than your ordinary Asian food restaurant. I also like how there's a variety of Asian fare, making it easier to please a group of friends. Because they don't specialize in each type of food, the selection of each leaves something to be desired, although I find it to be adequate. And I haven't been disappointed by the food I received.\n\nUnfortunately, the owners of the restaurant gave me a terrible time when I attempted to redeem a voucher from Google Offers (which went through CBS Local Deals to list Papaya). The owner of the restaurant claimed that somebody had been cheating by listing their business on Google Offers, and steadfastly refused to honor it. Not wanting to cause a scene, I figured there was simply a lack of communication between the owner and Google and\/or CBS Local Deals, so we exchanged personal information in hopes of resolving the situation in the future.\n\nThat same night, I emailed the business through their website, and submitted a complaint to Google. Google replied to me within three days and offered to give me a refund for my vouchers. Papaya's owners to this day have yet to get in touch with me (it's been a month since I've been to their restaurant).\n\nIt's one thing to not keep up with the promotions that are floating around the internet regarding your own business, but to punish customers for your own negligence and make no attempt whatsoever at finding a solution to the problem is incredibly unprofessional. What was originally going to be a night out of me treating my friends turned into an embarrassing situation where I had to pay more than I had budgeted for myself.
