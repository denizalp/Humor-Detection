When I was a younger girl, I would tag along with my sisters to go to Name Brand, and it was sooooo cool. \n\nEither it has changed or I have.. I went to Name Brand this weekend and it was really unimpressive. Most of the \"name brands\" here were Old Navy or Mossimo. It seems like they are not very selective based on the overcrowded racks and shelves. \n\nThe staff is young and hip and totally daft. They just kind of flick around not helping people and looking at themselves in the mirror... So pass on Name Brand, there are quite a few superior consignment shops in the Phoenix area, with a lot less attitude and weird smell.\n\nCute, cheapo sunglasses though.
