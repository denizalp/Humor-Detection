We love taking visitors to Forte- the food and staff are great!\nLast night we devoured the dates with bacon, benitzeh, angry ginger lemonade with vodka, Thracian wine, Easter lamb, Varenike potato pies with onion, Solyanka Russian soup and lentil soup. \nMy Bulgarian husband went through his bakhlava like lightning!\nI like the atmosphere and of course Nataliya and her colleagues are very helpful explaining the foods.\nI like the music soundtrack which is fun and very European plus at times on certain nights there is really cool ethnic music.\nIf you have not checked out Forte, don't be the last person in town to love it!!
