I'll leave as fair a review as possible since it's partially my fault I didn't read the fine print before I got a ticket off of House Seats. My fiance really wanted to see the show one last time before it stopped running and I'm always down to see anything playing on the strip so I agreed to go. I had no idea it was an interactive show, had I known I would have never gone. The idea of potentially being called up on stage or having a spotlight on me makes me want to vomit everywhere.\n\nWith that being said the ambiance before the show starts is really nice, it's on Cleopatras barge and there's actually water running around it inside the showroom. It's a very dark and intimate setting although you're sat very close to one another. \n\nThe band was great and Matt Goss is an incredible vocalist however the show got very awkward and felt forced many times. He relentlessly interacted with people even if they didn't really seem to be into it which made me uncomfortable. Yes it's an interactive show but if someone wont even look at you, maybe pass them by?\n\nOne of his songs went on seemingly forever as he went around shaking everyones hand in the entire showroom. The spotlight would lose him randomly so we wouldn't even see where he was while the same music played over and over in the background. \n\nHe also went on a long story about his ex wife and his either father or father in law. There was way too much downtime between songs, I envied the people who chose to sit outside and listen to the show for free without the anxiety of potentially being hit on or made uncomfortable. I know it was supposed to be all part of the \"fun\" but he had his dancers dance in front of men while their wives sat next to them and that would go on for over a minute with a spotlight on the couple. It felt very forced and no one was really laughing.\n\nHe booted up a cover of Hotel California warning if we weren't all screaming along to the chorus there would be consequences so that was my queue to literally run out of the venue. I'm sure for some people these things are considered fun but for me it was my worst nightmare.
