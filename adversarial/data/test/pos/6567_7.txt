The food was good once i got it. I sat down server came over said hello and disappeared for 20 minutes,no bread no service empty wine glass,I finally got up and found the manager.Totally unacceptable.Funny thing was the next day i went to dennys for breakfast and the service there was awesome.Price at dennys 12,price at flemings 140......amazing. How do people get jobs at these places...sigh
