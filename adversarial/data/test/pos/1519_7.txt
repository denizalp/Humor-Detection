ok so I read the bad reviews on here but I still wanted to give this place a try since it's a new place for revloving sushi. Also, I wanted to compare and see if it was better than Teharu Sushi in Tempe. \n\nWell I was not impressed at all...They really need more variety of sushi rolls! The whole time I was there I was just waiting and hoping to see if different rolls would be coming my way but NOPE it was the same california roll, salmon roll or vegas roll just rotating in circles! I don't want to be eating the same rolls over and over! So because of this...my friends and I ordered sushi off the menu. Each roll it took them more than 30-40 mins to make! And this place wasn't even packed! There were total of 3 sushi chefs in the kitchen making sushi too...ugh...I think I was at the restaurant for a good 2 and half hours...\n\nThe sushi itself was nothing special. I only liked one of their roll and I only saw that type of roll rotate around once...\n\nHonestly I would not go back here ever again....If you want the whole \"revolving sushi\" experience go to Teharu Sushi... just sayin....
