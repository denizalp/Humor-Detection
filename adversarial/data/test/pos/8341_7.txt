On the recommendation of friends and several fellow reviewing Yelpers, Diane and I recently embarked on a 45-minute ride to Henderson from North Las Vegas to see if the pasta here lived up to its billing.  It did!\n\nAfter sampling a very good bowl of White Bean Soup with carrots as the soup of the day, followed by a very good Caesar Salad with croutons, Mozzarella Cheese, and a light dressing, I eagerly dove into a large portion of the Mediterranean Sausage dish as my entree.  This steaming hot concoction featured sweet Italian Sausage, Red Bell Pepper, sweet onions, oregano, and Kalamata Olives in a robust Tomato Sauce ladled over really fresh rigatoni.  Although the sausage was indeed sweet, my main was nicely spicy as a whole.  It was an excellent hot pasta offering.  Diane enjoyed her specially requested Rigatoni Alfredo with Tiger Shrimp.  And decadent Ganache-covered Cookies & Cream Gelati capped off a fine introduction to a ristorante with stellar food.\n\nSeating was comfortable in a rather intimate, informal setting.  And we were afforded fine and pleasant service.  Because of a Yelp check in offer, we received a bag of fresh fettuccine on our way out of the restaurant.  That pasta tasted great too, and turned out to be a portion big enough to support four large helpings of Spaghetti, Meatballs, & Mushrooms served up at home over the course of one dinner and one lunch.\n\nBravo to the Pasta Shop's pasta maker!
