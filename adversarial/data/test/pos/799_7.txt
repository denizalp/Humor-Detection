I am writing for the return policy only.  I bought my daughter's Halloween costume on the 8th because we had an early costume party to go to.  On the 30th we zipped her up and the zipper broke.  I called the store as soon as I could and was told that it had to be unworn and sellable to receive a refund  Seriously?  Your product was defective and you won't exchange?  Bad move!!  You just lost any of our future sales!
