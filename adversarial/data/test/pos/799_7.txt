Friendly and helpful staff (5 stars)!!\n\nThe studio with queen size bed had a good layout. The mattress and pillows were comfortable. The cleanliness was 4\/5 stars.\n\nThe shower in the bathroom had strong water pressure, but the cleanliness of the tub and shower area is 3\/5 stars. I didn't feel comfortable taking a bath in the tub. \nThe linens and towels, while visually clean, had a strong smell of bleach to them.  The front desk said the linens are cleaned by a third party. \n\nThe mini kitchen was useful (4 stars)!  It was equipped with full fridge, electric stove, microwave, toaster, coffee maker, and dishwasher. The kitchen cabinets are filled with cups, bowls, plates, pots, pans and a cutting board. There are silverware and cooking utensils (see pics).\n\nThe fitness\/exercise room is located in the lobby level, across from the pool area, and is open 24 hours.  The pool and jacuzzi are open until 11pm.\n\nThe hotel hosts mixers, offering complimentary beer on tap, soda, tea, coffee and different snacks\/appetizers on Monday-Wednesday (see pics). \n\nThe parking (covered area in the back), breakfast, and WiFi are complementary!\n\nOverall, great value, great location and I would recommend!
