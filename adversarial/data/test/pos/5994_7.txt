Ordered 5 oysters from the guy with a bowl cut at 1:27pm\n\nHe calls #25 and we are #24\n\nAt 2pm I go up to him and say \"Sorry Sur but we've been waiting over 30 minutes\"\n\nHe rudely says back... no you haven't been waiting over 30 minutes and actually scoffed and us. \n\nI showed him my receipt and he has the audacity to say you're #24 you need to be patient wtf?!?!? \n\nNo I'm sorry you've actually been waiting 33 minutes or sorry I just spent the last 5 minutes knocking oysters around instead of filling your order.... \n\nRude cocky idiot trying to wink at these two girls while not doing his job. \n\nGreat...great... if he's the owner I hope he doesn't make it.
