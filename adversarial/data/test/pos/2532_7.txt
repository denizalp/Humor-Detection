What a lovely museum! I'm pretty sure it's only museum for Islamic art in North America. \n\nThey have some neat permanent exhibits, but their temporary exhibits are phenomenal! They do a good job of merging the historic with the modern interpretations of Islam and its practice today. I took off one star because their temporary exhibits appear and disappear way too quickly! \n\nIf you venture out to this part of Toronto, do take an architectural tour. The attention to detail in every aspect of the building is breathtaking. I don't mean to use such superfluous language, but I was truly amazed. The amount of time, energy, and attention people gave to the building of the museum is truly great compared to the attention I see some buildings in the US getting and later have architectural issues. \n\nMy favorite spot is the infinity pool\/fountains with a vies of the Ismaili Centre in the background. The ICT is worth a look as well. \n\nAKM is a nice gem in Eastern Canada :)
