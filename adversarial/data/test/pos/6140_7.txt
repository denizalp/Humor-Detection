Was this restaurant featured on a show from the Food Network??? I never would have guessed based on the big sign outside, the framed poster from \"Guys Big Bite\" on one wall, the caricature of Guy spray painted directly on the wall, the autographed photo of Guy on the other wall, or certain dishes on the menu labeled as being featured on the food network.  OK, OK... we get it- you were on TV. \n\nNormally, I would have given this place 4 stars; I used to work down the street and my coworkers and I had take out from here countless times. I have only had the capellini with meat sauce, and the marinara sauce is worth raving over. Today was my first time dining in the restaurant, and will now probably be the last I eat anything from there. I should have stuck with take out only!\n\nDinner was just my husband and me, our bill was $42 (before the tip), and truly was ridiculous for what we had. Paper table cloths on the tables, water served in plastic cups, I ordered a soda, which was brought to me in the can.  We both had small dinner salads, I basically had spaghetti, my husband had some alfredo type dish that was just noodles and bland sauce. We ordered bread, which was an extra $3 charge, but was never brought to us (but also not charged on our bill). I should note as an aside that every time we picked up lunch bread was included with no charge. The waiter tried to upsale everything- I wanted a soda, my husband stuck with water- the waiter pointed out the wine list 3 times. I wanted capellini and sauce, he suggested the Bolognese instead, I declined. I can't imagine what the bill would have been for a diner atmosphere in a strip mall, bad service, and semi-decent food if we had taken any of the waiter's suggestions. We don't mind paying for good food, but the prices do not match the d√©cor, or the service, of the place.\n\nMany other places in the Phoenix area have been featured on Food Network show's as well, not just this one. I'm thinking if you want to try out any of them, skip over this one.
