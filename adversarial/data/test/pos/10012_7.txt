I know very little about Filipino cuisine and by little I mean none at all. The one fella I know who's been to the Philippines shook his head and said, \"To be honest, it's not very good\" when I asked him what the food there was like. So I've never been in a hurry to get to the nearest Filipino establishment. To begin with, they're not exactly ubiquitous. But today I had my first taste and the experience totally made me want to go back and try more things! My friend and I went there for brunch and we had the fried rice platter. Hers was with sweet cured pork (oh my yum!) while mine was with soy-lemon marinated beef, which tasted a bit like something I would've had during my childhood in Indonesia. The salad dressing was nice and sweet, which complemented the garlicky rice. The banana chips were very pleasant as well. The portion was generous, which was definitely a plus. The food, the service and the ambiance totally made for a legit island cuisine type place and as for that dude who told me Filipino cuisine was not very good, obviously he didn't know what he was talking about!
