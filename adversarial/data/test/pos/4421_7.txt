I don't even know where to start...I did receive free tickets from a local radio station, so beggars can't be choosers right? So no complaining about my seats. \n\nThe first word that comes to mind with TSO is WEIRD!! This was my very first time going to a TSO concert and I had no idea what to expect.  I did have expectations for the concert and they were not met at all.  This concert reminded me of a 1980's hair band which was not what I wanted to see.  A lot of hair flipping around.  I'm not too sure why they do that, they ALL did that, the guitar players (reminded me of the Nelson brothers from the 1980's) and the back up singers.  The sound was way, way off.  Certain notes would just sound terrible...the notes would be too loud when they should have been muted.  Some of the singers were way out of tune and I felt they were trying too hard.  \n\nThey did play their popular Christmas songs : A Mad Russian's Christmas, Christmas Eve\/ Sarajevo and then they butchered, let me repeat that BUTCHERED the Christmas Canon.  \n\nI just felt that it was they were trying too hard.  I have to concur with some of the other reviews where they kept egging the audience on for applause.  I've never seen performers do that at any other concert I've been too.
