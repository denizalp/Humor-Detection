I was on the road toward Vegas, in need of a place to stay, so I did what any plan-lacking, impromptus guy would do. I stopped at the most convenient Starbuck, got on my favorite travel site (epicure.rovia.com), and located the cheapest, but nicest, hotel I could find. According to the price, the pics., and the map, the Tuscany is one I opted for.\n\nSo here's the turnout: $14.00 for two beer and $28.00 for the room.\n\nAs you drive in, there is a good impression made by the design, the overbuilt portico and the bell boy standing out front. The lobby supported the first impression, and even the bar and the pool area indicated that the rooms just might be equipped with jetted tubs and a wet bar. This was not so. The room was bigger than your standard hotel room, included a sofa, and the bed was nice, but I wasn't going to be soaking in a Jacuzzi, or sipping a Pina Colada. \n\nI began wondering how they stay in business when they charge only $28.00 per night. It wasn't until after I slid under the covers, my head hit the pillow, and I closed my eyes that I understood. Then commenced the rumbling of footsteps and wheeled suitcases just outside the door. Every 15 or 20 minute I was startled awake by some late-night gambler returning to his room, or a red-eye checking in for the night.\n\nNeedless to say, I was robbed of my slumber, and I regretted going cheap. Next time, I'll put my beer money toward a better room, and go without the drinks.
