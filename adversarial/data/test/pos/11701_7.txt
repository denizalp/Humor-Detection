This Hooters is located in the Hooters Hotel & Casino (I love you, Las Vegas!) so I assume that it is be considered one of their flagship restaurants. I've eaten at Hooters only once before in my life (in downtown Hollywood), but we were looking for something after we went to a Golden Knights game (and subsequently spent 3 hours boozing it up with friends afterwards). Surprisingly there aren't a lot of hot food options at 2:00 am on a Thursday night, but Hooters was open with immediate seating so we took a shot. \n\nThe menu is straightforward with lots of guy-friendly cuisine (chicken wings, burgers, french fries, etc.). Everything sounded super appealing because we were starving, but we ordered the fried pickles, a massive pile of wings, and the grilled chicken caesar salad (yes, they do have a \"healthy\" section). \n\nOur server was absolutely delightful, professional, friendly and fast! The kitchen was too! Forget waiting a long time for food late at night -- our yums came out so quickly. It took less than 10 minutes for the fried pickles and less than 10 after that for our entrees! \n\nI was shocked at how delicious this food was. The fried pickles were hot, crispy, and not greasy at all. They were served with an appropriate amount of dipping sauce (extra at that!) and were full of salty goodness. These are among some of the best fried pickle chips I've had anywhere. For real. \n\nHubby ordered the wings extra hot with extra blue cheese and well done. He loved how they had a little spicy \"bite\" and a nice crispy crunch when he bit into them. He said the spice was appropriate and they were cooked just right. \n\nMy salad was also delicious! Usually at a place like this the healthy options are nasty -- but not here. This salad could stand alone at any chain restaurant. It was loaded with seasoned grilled chicken, and it was a high quality dish. It puts the inferior salads at BWW to shame.\n\nWhen it was time to pay our server was fast with the check so we could get out and get home. It was well after 3 am at this point, after all. \n\nAs a female, I've always been a little iffy about dining and supporting Hooters because of their sexist attitudes. I have to say that the outfits weren't as skimpy as I feared, and there wasn't any of that \"forced flirtation\" that ruled the day in the 1980s. The atmosphere was very chill, with dark lighting, quiet music, and a friendly (not skeevy) vibe. I loved my meal and experience so much that I can't wait to return. \n\nAnd I NEVER say that about a dang salad.
