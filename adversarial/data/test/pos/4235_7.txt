Burritos so good they're worth the impending food coma you'll go into after eating them! Seriously, I'm glad I went here on a Sunday because I needed to take a long siesta after munching on these Mexican morsels. \n\nI shared a shredded beef burrito and a green chile pork burrito. Both came out in a speedy amount of time. The server asked if we wanted salsa, I requested one each of the green and red and it came out in a generous portion in little styrofoam cups. The green chile pork was absolutely delicious! The green chile had a lot of savory spicy flavor and the pork was plentiful and tender. The beef was good as well but I really enjoyed the green chile sauce in the other burrito. The salsa was also superb. It tasted freshly made and went well with the burritos. They did seem to forget about the horchata I ordered so I had to remind them at the counter but it was brought right out to me as soon as I mentioned it. The horchata was creamy and sweet, a perfect way to cool down on a hot day. \n\nService was friendly and sweet. One of the ladies at the counter went to the tables making sure everything was to our satisfaction.
