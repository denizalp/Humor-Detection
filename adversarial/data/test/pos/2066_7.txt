Such a great atmosphere. We sat on the patio and ate pretty much everything on the menu! so delicious! \n\nThey also rolled out a tequila tasting cart and each table got to try a few top shelf tequilas and learn about the history. VERY COOL!\n\nWould defiantly recommend Taco Haus to anyone looking for a relaxed environment with great drinks and amazing food!
