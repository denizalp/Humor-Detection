R.I.P. Rave Cinemas \n15 NOV 2007 - 17 JAN 2013\n\nWell, it was good while it lasted. Unfortunately, everything (good) comes to an end and the Rave had ended: http:\/\/www.lvrj.com\/neon\/amc-will-take-over-multiplex-187082551.html.\n\n\nThe first film I watched here was District 9 (2009) and my good buddy happened to pay for the tickets; fast forward several years and many (over a hundred and ten?) advanced screenings (which are all free) later, and in the end I paid to watch exactly ONE film here which was so piss poor I actually have to delve into imdb.com to be able to name ('Sucker Punch'). Coincidentally, on that same day I took the ill-fated two-feet sub challenge (they cheat) at Johnny McGuire's next door and that place has shuttered since as well.\n\nTuesdays were 5$ tickets every week (besides holidays)(not that I cared because I never paid for tickets) and 1$ hotdogs (although they were barely worth that) for the final Tuesday presumably because AMC sells a different brand of barely 'meat' as their dog of choice. \n\nUnlimited free refills for you fatties that buy over*sized large popcorn (8.50$?) and sodas (4.50$?). Gone now too with AMC taking over, more than likely, since they positively suck at everything they do. So throw away the old cups you used to sneak in, crazy ladies that were known for being apt to running over small children with your motorised scooters; they are worth no more than the cheap cardboard they are constructed of.\n\nThe many free screenings may very well be gone too for us cheapskates since the only time AMC had an advanced screening in the valley was for 'The Grey' and they required 'AMC Stubs', which costs 12$ annually, for each person to be able to attend (making it a 24$ \"free\" advanced screening if you were taking a date). I don't like Liam Neeson that much. \n\nMight as well scrap off the 'Best of Las Vegas' stickers on the glass wall in the front because AMC is taking over and it's a done deal. It was good while it lasted. - E
