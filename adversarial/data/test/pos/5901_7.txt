Much like with any expansion, sometimes things get lost in the process. The original location in Phoenix had really great carne asada. This location in Scottsdale is adorable, and the service is good, but the food has taken a bit of a hit. Don't get me wrong, it's still a decent lunch choice, but your socks are not at risk of getting knocked off.\n\nParking is a nightmare, so be prepared for that, and overall it's not a bad spot, they have a huge backyard that is really cozy and nice, but the quality of the food is kind of dissapointing. Perhaps if I never had Gallo Blanco or Tacos Atoyac, I wouldn't know any better, but I have, and I do.
