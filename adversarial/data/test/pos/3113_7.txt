I wanted to like this place SO badly and throw it into my weekend morning routine. Cute (from the outside) local joint, dog friendly patio, about a mile's walk from my house, beer on tap...but it's just not working. At all. The 4 star-rating as averaged on Yelp was pretty misleading unfortunately.\n\nThe interior is a little dank, which is fine if you're not into atmosphere. Not that I think every coffee shop should scream corporate remodel, but there is a way to tastefully execute shabby-chic and then there is disheveled. It's kind of like the island of misfit coffee shop decor found its way here rather than a cute modgepodge of retro sweet consignment finds that could potentially make this look work. The furniature was definitely wobbly and the patio setup a little awkward. Nice to have water bowls for the pups though.\n\nDesign aside - the coffee was terrible. Just terrible. The brewed coffee tasted like hot water that happen to be brown. The \"americano\" was equally tasteless. After receiving the full bakery tour (including a detailed explanation of every item provided free of charge by the eager barista), I settled on the almond poppyseed muffin. Not bad - but pretty crumbly. The dogs liked it at least. My hubby's bagel sandwich looked like it was going to be our best bet. Le sigh. A quick lift of the top exposed what appeared to be rubber cheese - you know the kind. When I argued that perhaps they used quality sliced cheddar, my hubs replied \"I made enough grilled cheese as a bachelor to know what a Kraft single tastes like.\" No rebuttal. And no returning.
