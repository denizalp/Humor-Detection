This review is for their piercing services: specifically, Joe. I got three piercings done at the same time by him (two lobe, one conch). He could not have been more gentle and calm in terms of his overall demeanor and the prep\/piercing experience itself, which is what you want when you're about to go through with a piercing! Joe was also very thorough. He took multiple measurements to make sure things were even. With the conch, I told him I would eventually want to put a ring in it (he had suggested not doing so now because the movement of the ring could lead to a higher risk of complications\/longer healing time) and he asked questions about exactly how I wanted it to look in the future, so he could make sure he pierced at the right spot\/angle. He gently placed a ring on my ear so I could see what it would look like eventually, asking if I wanted it to hang or just be horizontal. The piercing itself wasn't that painful, I think I heard it more than I felt it (ew, right?) and it hasn't hurt since! I easily slept on both sides two nights after I got them done. After the process was done, he meticulously explained what I should do for after-care. It was late and the shop was supposed to close, with someone still waiting to be pierced after me, but Joe still made sure to give me his full attention, answering all my questions and never making me feel rushed. Point is, he was really thorough and so nice, and I think it's the main reason why the process was so enjoyable. I would recommend seeing Joe at Tattoo Cafe to anyone ready to go through with a piercing! I will return here for as long as I'm in Cleveland!
