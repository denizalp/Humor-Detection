On a recent culinary meetup with our party of 16, Lago was plenty accommodating. Upon our arrival, there was a private room setup with four large tables arranged in a fashion to comfortably seat our large group. The setting was in order for the memorable meal that followed. \n\nA three course prix fixe menu was offered as a value to those who didn't wish to order from the full menu. Our server, admittedly new to Lago, was plenty attentive and patient with our group. \n\nTo start, my accomplice and I shared a bowl of steamed mussels and clams in a white wine garlic broth. The clams, I am unhappy to report, tasted gritty from sand left unrinsed. The broth, nothing I couldn't have constructed at home. \n\nNext, I had the grilled lamb chops with pumpkin gratin, brussels sprouts and pomegranate vinaigrette. Now, I've ordered lamp chops at other fine dining establishments and have only received a small chop or two of this delicate meat as an entire entrée (I'm talking to you Johnny's Downtown). At Lago, I was served an entire rack of lamb with about 8 ribs each! Cooked to my choice of medium rare, they knocked this dish out of the park and certainly made up for the first course. Damn this was good! \n\nThroughout the meal, my other gracious friends let me sample their lobster gnocchi and separately, the veal tortelloni. The flavors of each were intense and left me wanting to come back in the very near future to sample the rest of the menu. \n\nFor dessert, I ordered the tiramisu which is standard for me. My partner, the goat cheese crème brûlée which was absolutely phenomenal. My only complaint was that I would've ordered an entire portion of that instead of my tiramisu which by the way was also very good. \n\nOverall, the entire dining experience seemed to go off without a hitch. It was nice in getting to experience good food with the company we were joined by. See you soon Lago. I'll definitely be back soon.
