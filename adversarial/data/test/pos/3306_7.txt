Didn't expect good Asian food in Arizona but I was wrong. This place has great lunch deals and food. \n\nFirst off, my friend's salad was made perfectly. The teriyaki salmon I ordered was overflowing with sauce. \n\nThe portions were also huge for lunch. \n\nI don't eat sushi but they had a very specific menu to order from. \n\nAwesome times. It's right next to The Yard next door. If you're debating which one to pick for FOOD, go to NORI.
