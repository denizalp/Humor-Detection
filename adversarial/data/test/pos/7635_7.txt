Every time I think about this place it makes me cringe!\n\nAtmosphere\nThis place is a nasty grease hole. Absolutely GROSS!\n\nMenu\nThey offer local Hawaii food\n\nFood\nWhen they first opened I would go there to get the lau lau and kalua cabbage plate.  It was pretty good.  As time went by they hired Chinese cooks and that place went down the shitter. My kalua cabbage was fatty and they chopped the cabbage up like slaw and stir  fried it with tons of oil.  I was PISSED! I also ordered the lau lau which was dried out the luau leaf tasted bitter. I'd rather not go on about this place because it only makes me upset.\n\nBOO! This place is a NO GO!
