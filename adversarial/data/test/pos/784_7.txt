Picture the scene.  A beautiful spring day.  A coworker and I decided, \"What better way to spend the lunch hour than dining al fresco and enjoying the delectable properties of fine encased meats?\"  Now I'm really a Wiener World kinda girl, but my coworker really had the taste for fine hotdogs served out of the back of a church.\n\nSo let's see, which particular blend of sodium and nitrates appealed to Susan's palatte?  The Locavore looked tempting.  The Imposter (a veggie dog)?  Uh, no thanks!  The Chicago Impostor?  Possibly.  The Buffalo?  Hmmm, a dog with blue cheese and buffalo wing sauce!  The New Yorker?  A dog with 'kraut AND onion sauce?  Hey, now we're talkin'!   http:\/\/www.franktuary.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/03\/NY.jpg And with a side of coleslaw and pickle spear!  Mmmmm!
