Ling & Louie's is quite alright... nothing that leaves me instantly craving a return trip; but good enough that I'm really glad to have tried it. \n\nWe started off by trying a couple of their appetizers; the crab wontons and the coconut shrimp. Both were pretty tasty and were served with a sweet and tangy tropical sauce that I quite enjoyed. I do wish that the crab wontons would have been a bit crunchier though. For our main dish we split the \"F'n Sliders\" which were these mini burgers loaded with strips of steak. They weren't too bad, but were pretty messy and hard to eat without feeling like a slob. The best thing we had was probably the Tom Kai Gai soup... slightly spicy but very flavorful. This is the type of place that'd probably work a little better with more of a Pei-Wei's type of set up,,, it has more of a casual, almost bar-like atmosphere... it doesn't feel like you're at an Asian restaurant when you're here. \n\nIn the end... it's a cool concept (Asian dishes with more traditional American fusions) it just didn't wow me like it could have. Still it's a solid spot with a fun menu that you should try. 3.5\/5.
