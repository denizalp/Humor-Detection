I really love these fries!!!!!!!!\n\nEither way, decarie hot dog has always been and always will be my favorite spot for fries. They even have picnic tables outside now!\n\nPS- I took away a star because I saw a fly floating in their vinegar which either meant it's a complete fluke.. or they don't check for stuff like this very often. Anyway, the fly was dead so it's no biggie..
