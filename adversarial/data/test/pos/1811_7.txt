Yet another thai place that serves fake thai food. I'd bet $10,000 that the mushrooms they use are those oyster mushrooms out of a can. I did actually enjoy the drunken noodles but not enough noodles. Oh, and I called before ordering & asked if they had dairy-free thai tea to which they replied yes. But all that REALLY means is no milk. So no, they do not carry ANY dairy-free milk alternatives for vegans which is lame, lame, LAME!
