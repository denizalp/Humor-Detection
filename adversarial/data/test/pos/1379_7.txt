Do not make the mistake of going here. Rumor around with the people I spoke with was that they had unbeatable prices. Who wouldn't be interested in that. When I went out - I met with Dee. Super nice. She was a little ADD  - talking about this and that - but super nice. Gave me some pricing on cabinets - which my amish dude matched in price and by quality ten-fold. But she asks to bid on the counters separatly - so ok.\n\nSo she tells me to head out to view the granite they have - they can order more but they have a bunch of slabs up on north mattis. I check it out. A visit later and I decided on the one. Talk to the guy at the location, then call some chick on the phone (at their place) and decide I want the two on the lot - provided she can get two more from the same cut. I get an email from her 10 minutes later that too bad - so sad - the ones at North Mattis were sold.... (um I talked to your entire family that works there and they weren't but now they are). AHHHHH but don't worry. She'll hold the slabs I haven't seen until end of day if i bring over 8 grand. And then she'll try to find a couple more that look similar. WAAAAIIIITTT whaaaaa? So I tell her um no - I'm going to need to see them and find some that all come from the same cut because I'm not going to turn over that much cash for product you \"think\" you can find matches too. I got an email from her moments later that her husband said I should take my business elsewhere because I seem to change my mind alot. NO PROBLEM!!!
