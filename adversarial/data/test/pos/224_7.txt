After finally getting to Cure again, I have to say this just might officially be my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.\n\nMy friend and I were so obsessed with the small salumi we had last time that this time we ordered the large salumi. And we finished it all. Please don't judge us. Actually, I don't care. It's worth the judgement. This is a charcuterie fanatic's wet dream. The duck speck and the lardo are just ridiculously good, and thankfully those seem to be two of the staples that stick around on the menu. Even the pates were delicious, and I really am not a pate person.\n\nWe also got a salad, because that cancels out the fact that we just ate a table full of fatty meat (shush, it's sound logic). It had cinnamon croutons and bleu cheese and some other stuff. It kinda tasted like Christmas. I was into it.\n\nWe also got a main course to share. I know, I'm not sure why we thought this was a good idea. It was wayyy too much food! Next time I will (attempt to) control myself, but questionable decisions aside, I would have been super sad to have missed out on the cider-braised veal cheeks. Even better than the pork sampler I had the first time I was here, with the same simple, unpretentious style. Nothing fancy, just a whole roasted baby onion and some crispy kale leaves and an impeccably cooked piece of meat.\n\nThere's honestly nothing I dislike at Cure, besides the fact that getting in can be difficult on the weekend. I was turned away as a walk-in several times before finally planning ahead and making a reservation. But it's worth it!
