Lee Lee is a well run international supermarket (predominantly Asian).  The store is clean and well organized with packaged goods separated by country of origin across the expansive aisles.  The store has a fairly large selection of domestic and international beers including craft beers, wine, and sake.  \n\nThe meats, seafood, and poultry sections offer tremendous variety although it doesn't seem to rate quite as high on the freshness scale as Mekong.  On the positive side though, the wait for special cuts of meat\/poultry and cleaning of fish is shorter than Mekong on most occasions.  \n\nThe produce department has a wide selection of product offerings including hard to find items displayed in a well organized manner.  The check out process is extremely efficient to handle the large volume of customers who pass through the registers daily.
