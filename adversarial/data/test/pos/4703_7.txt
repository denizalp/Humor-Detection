A hands down must see attraction. The first time I saw it in 2006 they played My Heart Will Go On by Celine Dion. It was so beautiful I almost cried! The strip side offers the best views in my opinion. \n\nThe fountains are set in a 9 acre manmade lake.  They incorporate a network of pipes with more than 1,200 nozzles that make it possible to stage fountain displays coordinated with more than 4,500 lights. It is estimated that the fountains cost $75 million to build. The fountains were created by WET, a design firm specializing in inventive fountains and architectural water features.\n\nHere are the fountain show times: \n\nMonday - Friday \n3:00 PM. - 8:00 PM. \nshow every 1\/2 hour \n8:00 PM. - 12:00 AM. \nshow every 15 minutes \n\nSaturdays, Sundays and Holidays \n12:00 PM. - 8:00 PM. \nshow every 1\/2 hour \n8:00 PM. - 12:00 AM. \nshow every 15 minutes \n\nHere is a list of all of The Fountains of Bellagio Music: \n\nTitle: One, Singular Sensation.
