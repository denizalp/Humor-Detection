This is quite honestly a 5 star mcDonalds.  Consider this rating a judgment of this mcDonalds vs. the other mcDonalds I have visited in my life, and not a rating against a real eatery.\n\nThe good:\n- they are open 24 hours.  I have been here in the dead of the night on my way to the airport at least 5 times (we're talking 4am on a Tuesday) and the young man who works overnights ALWAYS makes me breakfast foods even though it's not 'supposed' to be breakfast time.  He never even gives me a hard time (he's probably like \"yay someone to talk to!!\")\n- I ALWAYS have a special order.  It's usually \"NO...[ingredient(s)]\" and it has ALWAYS been right (although writing this means it won't be next time)\n- There is a drive thru and the one at Gerrard Square does not have a drive-thru\n- Their coffee is GOOD. This is not just a fairy tale rumour.  It's good coffee.\n\nThe bad:\n-it's mcDonalds\n\nWould I go here again?\nAbsolutely, especially when it's the only thing open at 4am.
