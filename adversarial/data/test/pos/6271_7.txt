Cheap, delicious and open 24\/7. This place is legit!\n\n*They have a salsa bar with unlimited red sauce, green sauce, cucumbers, the carrot mix and limes. \n\n*They speak English \n\n*It's clean and beautifully decorated inside \n\n*If you are a rolled taco person they roll them and cook them fresh to order chicken or beef. \n\nSo far my favorite is the Carne Asada burrito, but since I don't want to look like a double wide trailer I've only had it's goodness once. My lifestyle is low carb so I get the grilled steak platter with no rice or tortillas. It comes with beans and a side salad with fresh avocado and a tomato slice for $3.99. I'm completely satisfied. \n\nEverything I have tried has been pretty damn good. I just wish they offered the free warm chips like the place before.
