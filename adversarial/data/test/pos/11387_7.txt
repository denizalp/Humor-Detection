Came for lunch and was expecting at least as good as the last time I came, but was not satisfied with any of it. I got the Thai spicy chicken. They only gave me 4 tiny pieces of chicken and all the rest were big chunks of jalape√±os and onions. Was in a very salty sauce, which made it impossible for me to eat! Next, I got their noodles. They were below average in taste and were super greasy. Half of the noodles were sitting in oil. Disappointing again. Lastly I got the bourbon chicken, which was just average. A few of the pieces were really dry, but the taste overall was okay. I guess the thing I enjoyed the most was the lemonade. Will not be back.
