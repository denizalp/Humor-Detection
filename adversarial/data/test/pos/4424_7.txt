I had a buddy from out of town staying with me this weekend, and he enjoys his beers.  We had lunch at Pizzeria Bianco down the street, and then decided to stop here on the way back.  I was driving, so I ordered a Coke.  My buddy got a flight of beers.  The setup of the place is pretty cool.  The bar is huge!  Bartender James was super chill and very friendly.  My buddy thought the beers were just ok but really liked the atmosphere.  James hooked me up with my Coke for free.  Cool spot and I would definitely bring people back.
