TLDR: It's an old, wooden, country cabin that looks great from the outside but is just shy of living up to it's potential. That doesn't mean you should avoid it.\n\nThe Good:\nStaff - super friendly, very nice and although they couldn't always address our needs, they wanted to. I'm shocked by all the reviews stating the staff are awful. Frankly I find it suspicious. I witnessed guests treating the staff so rudely, in Vegas they would've been kicked out, but the staff never yelled back. I'm wondering if there isn't some Yelp vigilantism going on. Our front desk clerk was friendly, even asked in a covert manner if my wife knew about the champagne and strawberries we had added on, so as to not spoil the potential surprise with the bill. I thought that was a nice touch, shows experience with people on a couples get away.\nLandscaping - the grounds are amazing, it had just snowed about a foot and looked like a post card.\nChampagne and strawberries- add on to the room, we felt like splurging, were pleasantly surprised. Huge strawberries covered in chocolate, toffee bits, syrup and served with whip cream. Cheap champagne actually was pretty good! They ask you when you want it delivered at check in.\nA Cut Above Restaurant- I liked it. See the separate review, but I think it's good for the hotel, with its own pros and cons.\n\nThe Not So Good but Not So Bad:\nRoom - Bed was comfy, we got the balcony king, I'd say there's really no reason to get the balcony, it's about 2x3ft, no chairs, kinda gimmicky, save the extra $30 or whatever a night and get more booze at the bar. Heater works, too well actually I woke up sweating, but that's on me. They have a TV with Dish but who cares, hopefully you aren't there to watch tv. I'm 90% sure the room wasn't fully cleaned, the bed had fresh linen but trash bin full, soaps were all used and hand towel crumpled by the sink....oh well, pretended we were camping, I've slept in worse. The decor in our room looked Indian\/Burmese\/Thai or something akin, not sure what that's about, would've expected pine cones...nitpicking now...\nConvenience Store - not really much here. Some soft drinks in bottles, coffee (\"it's just plain coffee, nothing in it\"), and a few snacks. No toiletries. But at least they tried.\nBar - didn't go but they had a respectable menu and the drinks we ordered at the restaurant were well made by the bartender. More on that in the restaurant review.\n\nThe Bad:\nAge - unlike wine and Hollywood actresses, this little gem is not getting better with time. There is a layer of soot, sawdust and road salt that could be viewed as rustic and charming or indicative of a need for a good scrubbing. Are you half full or half empty of cobwebs?\nAmenities- excluding a restaurant and bar there are none from what I could see. Hard to call this a resort, it's just a hotel with a bar and restaurant, which today is pretty standard.\nToothpaste - we forgot toothpaste. Our bad. There was no way to remedy this. Front desk, no toothpaste. Convenience store, no toothpaste. I've never been to a hotel that didn't have sundries like toothpaste, toothbrush, shaving kit at least for sale.\nOther guests - this place draws a weird crowd. I feel bad for the people who work there. Not sure if it's a factor of rowdy locals blowing off steam or the proximity to LA but the other guests were terrible to each other and the staff. Weird. 2016 is over people, start loving each other again!
