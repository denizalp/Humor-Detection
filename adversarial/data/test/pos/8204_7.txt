Why did I keep eating??\n\nBasically, you come here for those deep fried delicacies known as boneless wings.  I've tried the potato wedges, burgers, wraps, and salads, and all are average at best.  Don't waste the stomach space.  There are many sauces to choose from, my favorite being the spicy Mango Habanero sauce.  \n\nHere's what you do:  \n\nCall in an order of about 20 boneless wings just for yourself on a football Sunday.  Make sure nobody is home of course, this is going to be a shamefeast.  When you return with your saucy bounty, close the curtains, lock the doors, and get carnivorous.  Nobody likes a quitter, so just like a marathon runner you'll have to push through.  Yep, I just compared running a marathon to stuffing your face with boneless wings.  SHAZAM!
