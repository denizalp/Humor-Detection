This place is simple for me and I have rented it twice for my trips to Vegas. I get a rental from a guy I know for a decent price, and I was not hassled much by the time share sales devils. There are some great qualities and a couple annoyances.\n\nPros:\nClose to the Strip\n24 hour pools and Jacuzzis (OHHHH YES!!)\nFlat screen tvs\nFridge, washer and dryer\nAbundant parking\nConvenient general store\n\nCons:\nEarly check out (10am, for real?)\nAC was malfunctioning\nDisappointing Gym\nOther hazy things I don't fully remember\n\nBoth the Vegas trips I took here went fairly well, and the staff is pretty accommodating. I'm sure I will come back here at least another couple times, so hopefully the negatives will be fixed or forgotten.
