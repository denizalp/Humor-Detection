This is the worst bar I've ever been to. I was looking forward to checking it out, but was extremely disappointed. It took ten minutes for us to be acknowledged, and when we finally were, I didn't even receive my drink at all. We were planning on ordering food, but couldn't get anyone to take our order. So after waiting for our bill for another twenty minutes, we left and will not be returning.
