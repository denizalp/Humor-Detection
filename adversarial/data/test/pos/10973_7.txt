Have you actually seen a pig in a fur coat?!? You won't see one here but at least you can enjoy all the eccentric items on their menu!\n\nI had a 5PM reservation and surprisingly there were no other guests until I finished my meal.\n\nThe three dishes I ordered:\n\nRabbit Rillette - $10 - rabbit meat, solidified oil and on the side sliced toast with pistachio and cherries. Sorry Bugs Bunny but this jarred dish was delicious! The meat is bottled with the rabbit meat topped with a thick gloss of oil. Take the toast and spread the meaty mixture on the bread and then top it off with the pistachio and cherry marmalade. If I were to order this again, I would scoop out the stiff oil and spread the meat directly to the toast. Great choice.\n\nLamb Carpaccio - $14 - corn shoots (made it extra sweet), egg yolk, salsa verde and thinly sliced lamb. We enjoyed this dish but there were only 3 slices of lamb and wasn't enough to justify the $14 price.\n\nVeal Neck - $21 miso, carrot, turnip, ramps, radish. This dish was the loser of the night. We didn't enjoy it because it lacked flavor and ended up wasting it.\n\nThey have regular seating and a community table in the middle of the restaurant. If you come here, make sure you come early and get the attentive service we received. The server gave me recommendations and explained each dish spot on.\n\nEven though I didn't have any pig during this meal, this place deserves a visit because of their variety, presentation and ambiance.
