I don't get prescriptions filled here. I don't get photographs developed here. I don't do anything besides treat it as a convenience store of last resort -- and within that specific scope -- I am able to purchase items I need quickly without much hassle. \n\nThere is overpriced lip balm here. \nThere is overpriced sunscreen here (right next to the lip balm).\nThere is overpriced shitty-brand coconut water here.\n\nMost of the time the staff is alright. Sometimes they are rude, but that is probably because some Fremont Street Zombie took a shit in the middle of the floor that hour. (Shit happens.) \n\nI still would not get my prescriptions filled here (if I had any), or my photographs developed here (if I had a camera), or do anything besides purchase one or two items, max, for maximum price gouging benefit of Walgreen Co. (WAG)(NYSE). \n\nBarely A-OK. YMMV.\n\nPostscript. No free parking (unless you are on two tires and powered by your legs and gluts).
