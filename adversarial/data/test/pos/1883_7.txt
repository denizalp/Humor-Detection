Oy, try the french toast.  Today's version included pomegranate seeds and syrup, fresh whipped cream and maple syrup.  It was accompanied by a generous garnish of assorted fruits and chunky \"home fries\" (more like roasted potatoes).  The coffee too, was excellent.\n\nTwo friends also enjoyed their basic breakfast specials, and one raved about the corned beef hash.\n\nA nice vibe was supplied by 50's kitchen tables and chairs and good music.  The friendly and attentive server was also a plus.  I'll definitely go back with my lovely wife.
