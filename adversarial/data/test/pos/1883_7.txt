This place was alright. From the previous reviews I didn't expect much, so I wasn't disappointed. The food was good, but took forever. The beer was crappy, especially when served in a plastic cup. The service was ok, the server did the bare minimum. The prices were a little above average, but you're in Vegas, so it wasn't terrible. Mehhh, we only ate here because we were too lazy to walk to another casino and didn't wanna Uber somewhere else. However, this wouldn't be my top choice.\nWe sat at the bar, ordered water and beer. The beer was served in a plastic cup, which is gross and had I'd known I would have ordered a bottle. The water came in a plastic cup also, which we were charged 75 cents for. I wouldn't mind, but we were never told or given another option. We sat forever before we got our food, a little over an hour. The food was good though. I ordered the Cajun Mac and cheese which was delicious. It had a good flavor and the chicken pieces were juicy. My buddy ordered the bacon cheddar burger w\/fries, and he said it was alright. I can't speak for him because I didn't try it and was too busy eating my food.
