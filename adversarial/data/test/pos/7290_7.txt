best little cozy spot in Harbord Village. was introduced by a girlfriend, one of the best salads in Toronto, their chopped salad. one may think, that's being overdramatic, but i problem you it's very very satisfying. it has the perfect ingredients to make eating a salad SO exciting, the perfect texture (my fav. being their chickpeas) and the jalapeño spread on the side. we also had their famous chocolate cake, gluten free! it's the perfect amount to share and rid yourself of any sweet tooth cravings. their vanilla ice cream pairs with it perfectly, with torched marshmallow, topping it all off. their menu is very unique, from plating to serving, the servers tell you the exact ingredients in each dish. i think the prices are reasonable for Toronto, but it's the service that makes it outstanding. service the first time, fantastic, can't remember his name but he was hilarious. \n\nmy second time, i took my sister here for her birthday. we called ahead to see if they could accommodate us, luckily they had the chef's rail available, which we didn't mind at all. i got the salad but of course, and she tried their burger. she loved it, perfectly cooked at a medium rare, the sauce was delicious - it was served with homemade taro chips. she was so happy and said she can't wait to come back. and of course we had the cake. great meal as expected. \n\nmy third visit here, was by far the best. i had made a reservation but when we arrived (already 15 minutes late), the table wasn't ready. i looked around and saw maybe a table available but didn't say anything. the hostess had remembered me from a previous time when i tried to come by for the dessert (put it was full), which i was vey impressed with. we sat waiting at the bar and went ahead to order our entrées while waiting. my friend ordered the burger and i couldn't decide, so stayed loyal to the salad. yes i really enjoy it that much. food came before our table was ready so we just stayed there. a gentleman came by later to check in, i recognized him from previous times. he proceeded to apologize for not having a table ready. he proceeded to comp our entrées. it was extremely nice of him, especially when i didn't complain or even utter a noise about any of it. in addition to that, because their menus changed for the season, the cake was no longer there! i did nag about it being my go to, he asked the kitchen to prepare the new dessert, IN ADDITION, asked them to bring out a slice of the cake. i was so happy, he made my night - couldn't believe how hospitable he was! \n\nneedless to say, it's one of my favourite restos in Toronto. i know thus is an essay but note: when making reservations, i love that you're able to text them! once you're in their system, you will never be asked for your name and number again. the fact that he went above and beyond to show appreciation for his customers, it was extraordinary (later found out he, is the manager\/co-owner). you do not find that of customer service around anymore, trust me, i've dined at some of Toronto's top restaurants. i will always be coming back to Rasa! highly recommend, you must come here if you haven't already!\n\ni have yet had drinks here but their cocktails look great - also looking forward to trying their tasting menu!
