I live my life a quarter mile at a time. Or at least between oil changes. \n\nLiving up to my Fast and the Furious dreams as a child I bought another car and have babied this thing since I got it. I thought I'm going to the dealership for everything that goes wrong with this guy and even the oil changes. \n\nI made my appointment online and told them my preferred method of contact was email. So I get a wake up call at 7:00AM on Monday morning telling me my appointment was at 10:40AM. Okay, guess I'm going into work late today. Dropped my car off and about an hour and half later it was finished. The guy I talked to was totally cool and their staff that I encountered were all friendly. \n\nMy only reason for giving this three stars was their car wash. My car was pretty clean but a bird had defecated on the side of my car so when offered to wash it for free I thought \"Why not?\" \n\nNow I know. My car looked like it went through a gang bang of garden hoses. It was still wet when they brought it to me. There were water spots all over the damn thing. I was pretty upset with that and had to get a professional wash to get that thing back in shape. \n\n\nTL;DR Cool people, but don't accept their free car wash. I'm sure there is a fundraiser carwash at your local 7-11 that can do a better job.
