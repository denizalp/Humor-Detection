Bucca di Beppo advertises Italian family style dining....well, I don't know much about Italian families, but I know there wasn't enough food for my Jewish family.\n\nThe way the sizing works at Bucca di Beppo is that a small dish feed 3 and a large dish feeds 6...except that those numbers are not very accurate. \n\nMy family was celebrating my grandmothers 75th birthday and this was the only place she would even consider going. She loves the atmosphere and she loves the food. I understand where she is coming in those regards. The atmosphere is very warm and inviting  (4\/5) and the food is pretty decent Italian fare (3\/5-a little skimpy on the sauce). It's really just the amounts I protested.\n\nOur party of 9 ordered 1 large dish and 4 small dishes. By Bucca di Beppo's logic, that amount of food should feed 18 people and yet my family was scrounging for food by the end. We all expected to walk away from that table completely stuffed and regretting that meal the next morning when we stepped on the scale, but we all walked out feeling pretty light and not at all regretful.\n\nMy problem is not with the food at this restaurant, but with their measurements. I think I'll go back to Bucca di Beppo, but this time I'll come knowing that I need to order much more than they recommend.
