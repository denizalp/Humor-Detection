Couldn't find a smoothie place, so I turned to ye olde Yelp. Told me I was 110ft. away from the Waffle Cafe. Well played Yelp, well played.\n\nI walk in and the fellow behind the counter greeted me with a big smile and hearty, \"Good morning.\"\n\nI ordered up my strawberry smoothie and it was up very quickly. So far so good.\n\nNow the food review. Simply, the smoothie was delicious. The big win.\n\nDuringy brief wait, I took a look around and it's a pleasant looking place, simple in decor. Not fancy but perfect for a breakfast joint.\n\nThey also have, wait for it... waffles. They look pretty tasty. They advertise organic and gluten free foods. Also on the menu are Boba teas and spiral cut potatoes on a stick. \n\nReasonable pricing, quick friendly service, and a very tatsy smoothie. They have all three restaurant issues covered.\n\nI'd really like to try their other foods, but it's a long drive for me to get up here. But I'll certianly remember them and will stop in if I'm on this side of town again.
