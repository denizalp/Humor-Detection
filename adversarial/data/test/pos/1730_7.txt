After eating lunch we wanted to watch some football at a bar or brewery.  My wife found this new brewery on Yelp since we were in the area.  It looked good so we decided to try them out.  We found parking in front of the brewery.  There wasn't much parking but there were signs there that said this parking is just for customers only.  That was nice.  We walked in and it was busy because there was a big birthday party going on.  So that took away from our first impressions.  We went to the bar and found a couple seat at the end.  \n\n     We got a drink menu and ordered our drinks.  Once we settled down we could look around and check out this brewery.  It still was busy and they were getting out a cookie cake that was really calling my name.  I wanted to say I was in the party and grab piece so bad but I didn't.  They put the football game on for us and we ended up having a good time.\n\n I ordered first their Bayernhof and then my second drink was their Belgian Blonde.  I really liked both drinks but the Belgian Blonde was the best.  I really liked that beer.  My wife ordered their Ipa called the Hidden Hammer and she enjoyed her beer as well.  \n\n     Once things settled here we could tell this was a really nice brewery.  The party was dying out but their was a family with kids playing Giant Jenga.  We love Jenga at breweries!  They were loud but it wasn't annoying.  Eleventh Hour has a  very nice layout and open concept.  The bar is big, they have long table to accommodate a lot of people, and when it is warm out the garage door windows will look great and feel great too in there. The atmosphere was really nice and we wish we could have stayed longer.
