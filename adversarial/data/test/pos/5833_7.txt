Quintessential dive bar, complete with awesome food, courtesy of Naked City Pizza. I have no idea how they would survive without their partner business, or whether they've ever tried. Lord knows that's the only thing that brings me in!\n\nLot is on the small side but I've never seen this place particularly busy. They have a good pool of regulars, and everyone I've seen behind the bar has been polite. There isn't much in the way of d√©cor, but they can mix up anything you could want. I'm not there enough to know about specials or events, but their pricing is on par with other neighborhood bars.
