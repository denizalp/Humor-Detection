They really nailed the anime theme. I was impressed by 28GO's robotic wall decor. Theirs is minimal but effective. On the other hand, Anime Ramen is in your face. In a good way. I love all the canvases spread out around their walls. There's barely an empty spot. With bright and playful colors, they've done a great job of transporting you to a different world.\n\nI admit that I don't know that much about anime. A Rurouni Kenshin piece on the wall looked familiar, but I had to ask my friend to confirm. However, I was excited to see them playing Howl's Moving Castle on the screens--it's one of my favorite Miyazaki films.\n\nOh right. You probably want to know about the food. I figured I should try the Tonkotsu Ramen as a baseline comparison metric. To be honest, I haven't been to Monta in a long time. And at 28GO, I had something different. Nevertheless, Anime Ramen's Tonkotsu was delicious. The broth was flavorful without being salty (though I've never experienced the overly salty broth at Monta that other people seem to complain about). I didn't even add any condiments to spice it up--my friends went to town with the chili pastes and powders and the like. I was content to savor the soup the way it came out.\n\nI'm not willing to crown a Vegas ramen champion. I'm a fan of all three places and I hope they all succeed. With this place opening up, the Vegas noodle scene has literally and figuratively gotten a little brighter.
