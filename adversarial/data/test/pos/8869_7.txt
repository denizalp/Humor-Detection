Coffee just okay. Actually, it was a vanilla latte that needed more heat. I like my coffee not too hot but this coffee was just too cool!\nFlavor was okay but nothing to die for. The beans are smooth but I maybe should have ordered an extra shot.\nThe barista was only marginally interested in helping the customers as she had a laptop open and ready to go when no one needed coffee. \nI am sure there are times during the day when there is no one around and so this place may be rather boring to work in. \nThe decor was clean and functional. Nice artistic touches on the wall.\nIf I need coffee and I'm in the mall then this place would work for me.
