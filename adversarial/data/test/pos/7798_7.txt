Can you put a price on a breathtaking view? Apparently you can and it is $30 for an omelette and an ice tea. With that said though, it was a fabulous omelette, the restaurant is in the middle of the Four Seasons Resort and the view from the patio could be used by the Chamber of Commerce to inspire people to come visit Scottsdale or at least remind people who live here that our chosen home is spectacularly beautiful.\n\nSeriously, the omelette was among the best that I have ever had. The eggs were fluffy and every bite was chock full of all of the goodies that I got to select from on their extensive list of choices. The hash brown side dish was not bad but what set it into the stratosphere was the tomato-bacon \"jam\" on top of it. I could eat the jam by the spoonful.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is a faux haute western theme, \"authentic\" right down to the leather smell that they must pipe in. Makes you want to saunter up to the bar and order a sarsaparilla (wearing $300 jeans).
