I'm laying in my hotel room bed now with a pounding headache and nauseated, but I had a BLAST. \n\nJust about all the staff that work there are enthusiastic, and not jaded. Being an American, I was pleasantly surprised to hear them say \"My Pleasure\" instead of \"You're welcome\" in response to our Thank You's. Is that a Canadian thing? Either way, it's lovely to hear.  They work hard to keep the park clean, so I was very impressed with that. The ride staff keep up a great attitude the entire time, so their enthusiasm is greatly appreciated by all the parkgoers. When The Guardian ride went down for a system issue, their staff went along the line to explain the situation and to entertain any questions that the people had - I thought that was stellar in how they wanted to keep up morale (and it saved from any unnecessary grumbling). While I waited 30 minutes outside for the Guardian ride, I could hear the enthusiasm of the staff from a neighboring attraction ride encouraging happy screams, you could hear the pep and fun in their voice for every iteration of riders. \n\nThe rides are awesome. If you are willing to pay the price for a Fast Lane or Fast Lane Plus pass, do it. The price will make you cry as you fork over your money, but the time saved from bypassing the long lines is utterly worth it. You can get off a ride and immediately go back to the front line and ride again until you're happily puking your guts out into the flower beds. This amusement park is ride-heavy with a fair selection of carnival games. \n\nThe strawberry and vanilla ice-cream topped funnel cakes are delicious. \n\nCheck out the website for discounted pricing. The tickets and parking are discounted online, so you'll save some bucks if you pre-purchase. \n\nIf you'll excuse me now, I'm going to go pray to the porcelain gods. The day was totally worth it, but my body is totally paying for it now. That's what I get for doing the Time Warp and the Behemoth (twice), 3 aggressive rides in less than 15 minutes at closing time. Well, that and the fact that the Fast Lane Plus pass means no wait time and maxing out rides. We got to ride like 5 rides in our first hour there, to include the Leviathan twice in 10 minutes. In a nine hour span, I've maxed out my scream quota for the year.   Do the passes if you can!
