Fudgie Wudgie had a booth at the recent Heinz Field Rib Fest that Kay and I attended. \n\nI walked by said booth and wasn't gonna get anything until I saw the Marshmallow Pops. \n\nYa see, I like fair foods, always wanted to try a Fudge Puppy, and this was the closest thing I could find to one at the moment. \n\nIt's 3 chocolate-coated marshmallows on a stick, a shish kebab for the choco-addicted if you will.\n\n 2 bucks and 4 bites later, and I forgot that I was here for the ribs. Serve these at a campfire, and I just might rough the great outdoors more often. Damn. \n\nFudgie Wudgie used to be right near my place of work before they moved, and I never stopped in. Regrets...I have a few...
