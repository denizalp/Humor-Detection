I heard so much about this place, so we had to come and try it out. I wasn't too happy about it when I heard it was cafe style but it actually was kind of fun and the service was great. The lady who took our udon order was very helpful and nice. Took her time to explain what was what. My husband had the beef udon, which was very flavorful. I had the miso sesame noodle. The flavors from the miso just exploded in my mouth! Everyone there was extremely nice, which always get big kudos from me.
