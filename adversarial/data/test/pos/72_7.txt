The staff of this \"establishment\" are some of the rudest, most condescending individuals I have ever met in my life. They will not give you ANY money, and you will have much better luck at Sunset Clothing Exchange, which is right up the street (Plus they actually have friendly staff). The people who are buying the clothes should not be buyers; judging from the way that they style themselves, they know nothing about fashion whatsoever. Everyone who has stated that you will not get any money from them for designer items is right... they would much rather have trite, \"trendy\" studded vests from Target than a pair of Miu Miu sunglasses.\n\nI was there about a year ago, and one of their young female employees was laughing, snarking and making faces at me. I had no idea who she was. It got to the point where my friend actually pulled her aside and said something. Today, their manager called me something that I can't even print on here. I had never seen him in my life, either. I have never done anything to these people except for sell my clothes to them.\n\nAvoid this place at all cost, they should change the name to Juggalo Exchange.
