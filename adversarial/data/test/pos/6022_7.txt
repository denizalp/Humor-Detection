Alright, so there isn't anything great to say about the decor or the layout of the restaurant.  It's rather... uh.. lacking in ambiance.  There are a couple of basic tables and chairs and some old lookin' posters on the walls and a crappy tv by the cash register, so I always take my food to-go.\n\nThe staff is nothing to rave about either, they're usually pleasant, but I can't say they go out of their way to interact with the customer.  Which is fine, I just want to place my order and go home, so less talky - more cooky.\n\nOn to the most important aspect of this place - I love the Pho Ga and it hasn't disappointed me yet (if you take it to go, they compartmentalize the garnishes, chicken and noodles and broth).  The egg rolls are always tasty and come with a nice spicy oil dipping sauce.   The spring rolls with the peanut sauce on the side are decent.  Com Ga Nuong (chicken in a spicy reddish sauce, cucumbers as garnish - which helps cool the heat of the sauce, and sticky rice) is my back-up order when I'm not in the mood for the Pho Ga.  \n\nAgain, I'd suggest take-out rather than dining in.
