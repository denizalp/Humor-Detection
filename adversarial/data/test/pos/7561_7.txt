Open 24 hours. The only restaurant in the casino open 24 hours. Breakfast served all day. Large menu with many options. Frest local ingredients are used here. The prices are very reasonable. The service was very good and even the manager came to our table to check on us. \n\nI had the Denver omelette. It was cooked well and had lots of veggies and ham. I also ordered the French toast. It was large enough to share. Included 8 pieces. It was good and curbed the craving. My boyfriend had the chicken noodle soup. It came out piping hot and smelled delicious. Two other people in our party had the chichen and waffles and egg breakfast. Everyone enjoyed their meal. The portions were just right. I was happy with the food and service here and can't wait to try more of their menu items.
