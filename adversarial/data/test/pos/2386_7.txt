I am hesitant to call this place a real restaurant as it is semi-fast food\/cafeteria like in my opinion.  You go up to the counter where they have pastas lined up in a window and you order and after about  minutes, bam...your pasta arrives at your table.  So, I'm trying to keep this in perspective. I would liken it to Fazolis or something like that.\n\nMy wife had the spinach and artichoke mac & cheese while I had the shrimp scampi.  I will say that my wife liked hers but I was totally underwhelmed and since she has the ability to write her own review, this one is on my experience.  I was very disappointed when the pasta showed up with salad shrimp.  There was just a vast gap between what I expected to arrive and those salad shrimp that showed up.  I have never seen them used for shrimp scampi before and I must say, I think there is a huge difference in taste and texture.  Needless to say, my experience was highly disappointing and I don't think I will be back as I feel I could get a lot more value for my money elsewhere.
