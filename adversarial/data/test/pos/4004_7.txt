Very nice and fast service! Was able to schedule an install 2 days after calling in. Angel came in and mounted the TV up within 30 minutes! He was able to quickly grab power from a near by outlet ran it through the wall. He also set up an HDMI connection from the TV to the center of our conference room. Drilled a perfect hole and everything!\n\nOverall really great service and a really cheap price!
