I have been a member here since May of 2015. I have always told people this place can be adequate as a \"beginners gym\". \n\n(+) Great selection and amount of cardio equipment here. Probably the best thing going bout this place. There are plenty of treadmills to be found here, in addition to stationary bikes and ellipticals. \n(+) If you have the black membership ($20 a month), you have access to massage beds, which can be a nice little perk. They do limit you to 10 minutes per day on them, though.\n\n(-) Like most gyms, the place can be a bit \"clique-y\" and front desk people are not very friendly for the most part. A couple of them are nice, but they are the exception to the rule.\n(-) This place is known for some of the ridiculous gimmicks they have that do anything BUT promote a healthier lifestyle...like the monthly pizza parties (epic people watching btw. Nothing like seeing two guys well north of 200 lbs each bicker over a last slice of pizza..lol..fucking classic), the monthly bagel offerings, and the buckets of tootsie rolls at the desk 24\/7. \n\nI guess what was the last straw for me, and the reason why I found a new gym and terminated my membership here, is that they have a member here they allow to workout with his parrot. \n\nYes. You read that right.\n\nThere is a larger man who walks in and walks on the cardio equipment with a parrot on his shoulder. Sometimes the bird ends up perched on the equipment. Am I the only one who sees this as pretty unhygienic? It sure felt that way when I asked the staff about it. First I was told \"don't worry, he doesn't actually work out here\". \n\nWait. What?? It is still a gym, no?\n\nWell, this guy is on his phone pouring sweat with the bird on his shoulder, so he was sure as hell working something, somewhere. Was the bird always on his shoulder? No. At times it perches on the equipment. What happens when this thing wants to take a shit? \n\nPoint being, It's a bird and doesn't fucking belong in a gym. Somebody should have told this guy that in no uncertain terms. Instead, I am looked at like I am the one with the problem because I don't want to work out where they let animals in\/around\/on the equipment. I actually feel sorry for that guy. It's obviously a desperate cry for attention that he feels he can't get without having a bird perched on his shoulder everywhere he goes. \n\nBut whatever. Keep it out of the gym. It doesn't belong there. \n\nWhat if I were allergic to birds? I can't even have a reasonable expectation that Planet Fitness will keep these animals out of a gym.\n\nIt's a joke and inexcusable. \n\n1 star.\n\nSeriously, there are several gyms in the immediate area and ALL are better options than Planet Fitness.
