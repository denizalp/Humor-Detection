Yay my first horrible review! Ok I have been going to Patties on and off for a couple years, know a couple people there and are usually pretty nice. Bartenders are always only decent, quite often give you attitude even if you are just trying to make conversation and check how their night is going they respond with , \"what are you a fucking detective\"? ...\n\nNo Motherfuc*** im just trying to have a conversation you insecure rude pri**.\n\nFast forward to tonight, its a slightly rounder hispanic gentleman working the bar AS SLOW AS HE POSSIBLY CAN. HE WOULD GET MY BEER READY BY PLACING IT ON THE BAR IN FRONT OF ME BUT NOT HANDING IT TO ME, THEN WHEN HE WOULD START MAKING ANOTHER PERSONS DRINK HE WOULD GET ANNOYED AT ME WHEN I TRIED ASKING HIM TO FINISH MY ORDER AND HAND ME THE GOSH DARN DRINK!\n\nDidn't tip him, in fact he deserved to tipp me. I am so pissed at their horrible service they even pissed off another lady sitting right by me trying to get a drink and having the same issue.\n\nAll I can say is if your going to be a bartender , you better be good at it! No matter what you do, be professional.\n\nI hope they fire this dude because I wanted to jump behind that counter and teach him how to bartend.\n\nWhat a joke this place is....
