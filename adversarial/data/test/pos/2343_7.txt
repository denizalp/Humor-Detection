Best Thai in Vegas?  F*kk yeah!\n\nThis spot has been tagged as a bookmark for years.  I finally got around to checking it out here.  Boy, have I been missing out!\n\nWent with other yelpers recommendation: crispy duck with curry.  Holee sh*t!  Best duck i have ever eaten--ever!  EVER!  Every day I was in Vegas, I couldn't stop thinking about the DuCK!  Consider having the curry on the side to help maintain the crispiness of the duck...\n\nHawaii folks help me out.  Can i find a comparable offering of crispy duck on Oahu?  Where?!\n\nTry the crispy duck, you will thank Yelp for guiding you here!\n\nAnother popular entree... pad kee mao with soft shell crab.  The flavor onslaught continues!  Another winner!  I am not a soft shell crab fan but gobbled up theirs!\n\nSoon after, I was floating off the ground in a food coma!\n\nGarans Lotus of Siam will be my first stop upon my return to Vegas!
