You ever visit a place and have such a good experience that you forget to write about it?  Yeah, it might just be me, but that's what happened here.  I had visited here a long time ago and never wrote a review.  \n\nThe last time I was here I got exactly what I ordered, perfect service and had a wonderful time.  This time I had called ahead to place an order for pickup and had the same great service as if I was eating in house.\n\nOf course it doesn't hurt that we got the Gobblerito to go.  You can never go wrong with that.  The whole Thanksgiving meal wrapped in a burrito.  Just to give you the run down of what's wrapped inside: turkey, mashed potatoes, black beans, corn, stuffing.  Then you get that covered with a helping of gravy and have your cranberry on the side.  If this isn't a nap inducing meal, I don't know what is.\n\nI do like this location as there are ample places to sit and it's always lively in here.
