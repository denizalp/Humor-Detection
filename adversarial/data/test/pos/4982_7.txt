This is a fantastic addition to Plaza Midwood. \n\nThe store is across the street from the Penguin and next to Shine. It is an old house and easy to miss if you aren't being alert.\n\nIt is adorable. This is the best place to find local\/organic gifts and treats. I bought the most adorable earrings for $8 from \"Not Made in China\". The candles are fantastic. You can find items from baby stuff to household cleaners that are environmentally friendly to knick knacks to vegan friendly food\/treats. \n\nMost of my holiday shopping will be done here.\n\nAlso, consider becoming friends with them on FB. They seem to always be doing something exciting- from walking around\/working out in Plaza Midwood in 80's gear, hosting a FROCK shop (traveling trunk show) or playing live music.  They always seem to be supporting other local businesses, musicians and artists. \n\nI am really hoping that ecolicious becomes another piece of the fabric of Plaza Midwood (possibly the cheesiest sentence that I have ever written on Yelp- but so true). This is how community happens- when local businesses get involved in their neighborhoods. The community-driven geek in me absolutely loves it.
