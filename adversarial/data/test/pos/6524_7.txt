I've eaten here before and the service was horrible and the cleanliness was subpar in my opinion. \n\nJuly 4th I decided to give them a try again. \n\nThis was a terrible mistake. Don't get me wrong, everyone was nice - just incompetent. We asked more than 5 times for someone to take our order, and finally a busboy stopped by and took our order. Now we didn't know he was the busboy until after he was scolded by another incompetent idiot and told that he wasn't permitted to take orders because he's only a busboy. \n\nKeep in mind we've been waiting 20 minutes and have asked 5 times to place an order. \n\nFinally some haggardly lady comes out of nowhere and takes the order of the table near us that was just seated. \n\nWe ended up leaving without ordering and no one even said anything to us as we got up and walked out.\n\nThis was disappointing and I would not recommend this location to anyone. Save your money for a business that has their stuff together - this one simply does not care.
