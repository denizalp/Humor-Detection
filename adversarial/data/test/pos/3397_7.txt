Go here for happy hour!!! They have cheese, pepperoni and margherita pizza on special for $7.50 and it's so delicious. My husband and I may pack on a few pounds because i think we will be going here every week. They also have other great specials, so be sure to check them out.\n\nMy other favorite aspect is the atmosphere...it's like cheers. The Coronado community has chosen this great place as their stomping ground and we were welcomed into the community right away - great group of people! \n\nWho doesn't love a place with good food, great people and an overall awesome experience!?!
