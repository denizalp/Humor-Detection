This place is beautiful, but a bit overrated. The staff think that they are soooo special and the act as if they are doing you a fvor by letting you in.  I came here at about 10pm with my dad who is 50--he was curious about the place so we went in, haha. We sat in the lounge and had some drinks and made fun of all the cougars who were batting their eyelashes at men half their age.\n\nThe drinks were ok, but this place is nothing special. I'd much rather go to Tryst at the Wynn.
