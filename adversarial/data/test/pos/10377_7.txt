I went to The UPS Store to print a silly little gift certificate I made for my niece. I asked the associate if I could print something from my USB drive in color on plain paper. He informed me that whatever color the file is will be the print color. I handed him my USB drive. He plugged it into the computer and pulled up my file. He printed it, but the print format was wrong and I showed him how the certificate was smaller than what it should've be. He tried to format it, but was unable to. So he called another associate over. In the meantime, I took the mouse, formatted the printer, and printed the certificate before the second associate made it over to us. I tried to give the first associate the certificate that did not come out right, but he said to take it and I wouldn't be charged for it. When he rang me up, I was charged $2.50 for \"Computer Use \/ Hour\" and $0.49 for the color copy. I WILL NEVER PRINT ANYTHING AT THE UPS STORE AGAIN! I had my hand on the mouse for all of three minutes, never touched any other part of the computer, and was charged $2.50. Ridiculous! Office Depot charges $0.59 for color copies from a USB and does not include \"Computer Use\".
