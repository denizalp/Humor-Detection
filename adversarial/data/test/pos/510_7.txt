This was my favorite restaurant. But not anymore. Today is my Birthday & thanks to them my day is ruined & I walked out crying & I still am.\nI called them on the 29th & asked if I could make a reservation. They said they don't take reservations & since it was a party of 3 it would be ok & won't be too full either as it's  a Tuesday .\nWe went to Postinos on College Avenue Tempe. They said our wait was 1 hour. We got there at 8.30.\nThen I called Postinos in Arcadia & told them we were at College Avenue & the wait was 1 hour & it was my Birthday & we didn't want to wait here outside in the heat & I asked if they were full as well & if there was a wait there as well. The guy who answered said there was no wait & they were not full & that the restaurant at College Avenue is always full. I told him we were heading  there & if we could put our name on the list. He said they don't take names over the phone.\nWe took 17 mins to get there & with parking I would say 20 minutes. \nWhen we went in the lady there tells us the wait will be 40 minutes. I had my old Mother also with us. She is 82 years. There was no place to even sit & wait. My Husband went in again to ask if we could sit somewhere & they tell us we can sit at the bar. The bar stools are so high & my Mother couldn't sit there, but we thought we will try as anything was better than standing in that warm air outside. When my husband came out & went back in with us, the lady says Oh! Someone just sat there so there's no space. She then says she will ask the Manager to talk to us.\nThen we asked if we could sit at the table outside, at least while we wait. We waited there for 25 minutes & couldn't take the heat anymore. Someone was nice enough to give us 3 glasses of water. The Manager never came out to talk to us.\nI was so disappointed & fed up. Tears just rolled down my cheeks as it was my Birthday & this is what I got. \nI couldn't take it anymore, I told my Husband let's just leave. I just wanted to go home.\nI went in & cancelled my wait & I told the lady please thank whoever answered the phone & said there was no wait. Thanks to him my Birthday Celebration was a total disaster. I asked her what happened to the Manager who was supposed to talk to us. Then she says she thought I said I didn't want to talk to the Manager.\nEverything was an excuse made for their benefit.\nShe says she didn't answer the phone & there was nothing she could do about whoever told me anything. I told her it was not her fault & that I was only telling her what happened, as she was the only one there.\nI even showed her my call log to prove I had called them. I then requested to speak to the Manager & explained to him what happened. He really didn't seem to care. He said from the time I got from College Avenue  to Campbell Avenue, they could get busy & there could be a wait. He said maybe when I called there was no wait but it got full in 20 mins. \nIt seemed unbelievable to me that in 20 minutes a whole restaurant just filled up so much inside & out & also caused a wait of 45 minutes. Just cannot happen.\nHe was not apologetic or didn't even try to check if he could get us a table or offer any options at all. He was very off handed & just couldn't be bothered. He didn't even check how long more we had to wait or ask us if we would want to wait a few more minutes. Nothing at all. He just seemed happy that it was 1 group less & he could wash his hands off. He Just said it is what it is.\nI walked out then & heard the Manager & the lady who seats Customers having a good laugh. It might be a laughing matter to them, but I want them to know that they ruined my Birthday. I planned so much & wanted to go there as that's always my special occasion restaurant. We went there for our wedding Anniversary for brunch & last year my Husband had a surprise party for my Birthday also at Postinos. I wanted it to be my Celebration there this year too.\nInstead I am now going to bed hungry as I just lost my appetite & I am so very sad. I came home & cried so much. It was past 9.30 & too late to get dinner from any place & I was not in the mood to sit & order. We went to a drive through & got some food for my Husband & My Mother.\nSo thanks to The lovely people at Postinos my Day, I planned so much for was ruined.\nI will never go back, as it will be bad memories.
