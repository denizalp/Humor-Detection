Excellent\/reasonably priced food. Phenomenally cool space. Personable\/knowledgable staff. Fast\/attentive service...\n\nBeen here multiple times & tried a number of dishes. Both; recommendations from the bartender or owner, & some ordered on a whim based off menu descriptions. \n\nEither way, completely satisfied every time. Seriously good food\n\nFavorites so far...\nBAHN MI CLUB (rivals chinatown's best!)\nCHILI GARLIC WINGS (no joke, may actually be the best wings I've eaten)
