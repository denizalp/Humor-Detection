This clubhouse has all of your essentials, pools, gym, small play ground, grilling area; lounging area, bathrooms, showers, lockers... not the fanciest of clubhouses but will meet all of your needs.\nThere are three pools: a baby pool, main pool, and a lap pool. The pool area also has a hot tub, can be nice on cold days. There are also showers and bathrooms in the pool area. Very convenient!\nThe gym is again, nothing fancy but meets your needs. There are free weights, treadmills, elliptical, bikes, Smith machine, a home gym type of thing, power tower (for abs, dips), sit up bench, cable machine, back bench, mats, medicine balls... plenty of stuff for a good workout. \nI mainly use the gym and pool and have enjoyed the accessibility of both.\n\nSome things I dislike are the lack of redirection of kiddos at the pool. If splashing and jumping in the pool is not allowed, then it should be enforced. \nHomeowners are allowed to have two guests at the club house. However, the only way you can have guests is if you are on the deed of the house. Now this information was given to me by front desk staff and makes me SUPER uncomfortable. I don't see why information about who is on the deed of the house is so easily available. If this information is at the community clubhouse, fine, but it should only be accessible by a manager... May not be a deal breaker for someone who's moving into the community but really is TMI.
