My first experience with \"El Y Ella\" I will admit went well. I walked in 30 minutes before the salons closing and the women available was more than happy to help me. She took her time and my haircut looked amazing! I decided to take a friend who had hair down to her waist. She was also wanting to donate her hair and get a new look. I was excited because my first experience was excellent. I made an appointment for 5 pm on a Friday for my friend. \nWe walk into the salon and we were a little early. My stylist told us she would be with us in a few minutes. The problem is that when I walked in my heart sank. The stylist I wanted was doing somebodies color. It didn't look like she was too far into it either. It was also about 4:45. Ok, no big, I assumed she would be able to juggle both clients. 20 minutes later the girl looking bored behind the counter (Miss Greeter Ray O' Sunshine) tells my friend to go to a groudy looking sink in the back of the dark salon. I didn't know you can wash someones hair well in 2 minutes. She allows us to hang in the back of the salon and both stylists (only two were working that night) are still going strong on their clients. 20 Minutes later \"Miss Thang\" moves us from the back of the salon to a chair. 10 minutes later the stylist (who by the way keeps calling me the wrong name and won't stop gossiping about other clients and their lives) starts in on my friends hair who is a nervous wreck at this point. She cuts it just below her ears. Fine. She starts in on styling. Ok, we're finally going somewhere. She stops. Crap. She tells us she needs to work on her clients coloring \"real quick\". 20 minutes later she is back to my friend. To top it off, I don't know what the deal was but there were flies all over the salon. Then from out of nowhere the stylists son starts going off the handle. Here we go!!! No idea where he came from but he started throwing a tantrum like I've never seen thrown before. I mean this kid was grabbing things and throwing them! The stylist left my friend to go and tend to her spawn. Totally fine. Evil happens. 45 minutes later, the other stylist had to finally take over. My friends hair is completely dry and I am both upset and embarrassed that I had recommended we go to \"El y Ella\". My friend was being totally cool about it and all I wanted to do was make like goop and slither under a door and go far far away. Meanwhile the stylists kid is still going in a back room where she eventually had to drag him away to. I mean, you can hear thumping and bumping on the wall. I don't know about you but after 45 minutes my mama would have thumped and bumped on my behind. Actually, there would have been no 45 minutes!!! The stylist finished up my friend and all we wanted to do was just go. The stylist finally comes out from the back of the salons dungeon apologizes \"Sorry Melissa\". Obviously, no tip was left, I didn't care to fight to get half off on a haircut or whatever. We left 2 hours later. Mind you, the haircut came out looking lovely. But first you may have to almost get a toy car chucked at your head for it.
