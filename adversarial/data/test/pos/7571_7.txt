This is the place to go for freshly crafted tea drinks where they brew your tea of choice on the spot. I intended to go here to pick up some tea leaves for my niece but I left with a delicious matcha shake and some gifts for myself. Brew Tea Bar used to be my #1 choice for milk tea in Vegas but Tea and Whisk took over that spot and without a doubt I'd return here whenever I'm in the area. \n\nPros\n\nJapanese Shake: I'm not a fan of milkshakes but it was highly recommended and I was honestly blown away with how tasty my matcha hojicha shake turned out. Plenty of matcha but the creaminess of the shake was satisfying without it being too overly sugary. \n\nService: The staff here is knowledgeable with their products and even made suggestions on the preparation for each teas I brought. They easily make recommendations based on what types of teas you like. I even overheard another customer stating she didn't like her drink since it didn't taste the same as she ordered previously and the owner immediately took the drink and made it to her liking without any problems. If you're picky about your drink, let them know ahead of time and they will craft your drink to your liking considering the amount of time they put in to each order. \n\nLoose Leaf Teas: They have a wide booklet of loose leaf leaves to buy by the ounce and was able to sample some before making a purchase. The pricing was more than fair considering how fresh the leaves turned out. I also appreciated that each bag is sealed tight. \n\nOverall, excellent spot for FRESH tea drinks and ideal if you want a wider selection of tea options. The only downside when ordering their drinks is the wait time but trust me as long as you're in no rush then the drinks are worth it. Check out their website as they offer specials and tea tasting classes.
