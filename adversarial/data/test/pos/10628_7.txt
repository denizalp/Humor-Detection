Hmm....where do I even begin...\n\nI found out about this place because of Food Network...as it was the only PHO PLACE to ever be featured on the food network. In addition, it was one the FEW pho places to have a PHO CHALLENGE. I was a big FOODIE\/MAN vs. Food wanna-be, so I was huge on FOOD CHALLENGES or LARGE PORTIONS OF FOOD.\n\nThe restaurant and location was very easy to spot, it had the freakin FOOD NETWORK advertisement on it too!\n\nUpon arrival, the first couple of things that you would see were the different sizes of the bowls they had owned and the huge grand prized check for winning the pho challenge. \n\nLet me tell you...THE PHO CHALLENGE BOWL IS HUGE...and to knowledge...there has ONLY been ONE PERSON to EVER finish the CHALLENGE...which I find is slightly incorrect. IF THE INCREDIBLE HULK WERE TO ORDER A BOWL OF PHO...it would be that! The thing that surprised me the most was that the person who finished the challenge was a normal sized, non-obese, asian female. WEIRD RIGHT? Either this female had some amazing swallowing attributes or that the people in VEGAS just arent into food challenges.\n\nGoing onto the food, this place isnt your ordinary PHO place...it is quite pricey...but pricey for a GUUD reason. Ok, I understand that paying $15 for an XL large is insane, but hey....the food was guud, very enjoyable, more bang for your buck aka LARGE portions...and plus...everything (or most things) in VEGAS are expensive\n\nThey also had FILET MIGNON pho...i think it was priced near a$100?? and the WHITE BOY SPECIAL (chicken pho) which gave me a chuckle when I read the label.\n\nThe noodles at this location were different. The noodles were still rice noodles, but THICKER! Never had them this thick before, but they still tasted awesome. Its always nice to have something new. \n\nThe soup....THE BEST THAT IVE EVER HAD! Something about this place just made the soup very enjoyable and made my stomach extremely happy. The taste, the flavor, the color were all indescribable...indescribable in a guud way!\n\nOVERALL...I REALLY love this place and I WILL ALWAYS VISIT THIS PLACE ONCE WHILE IM IN LAS VEGAS. This is my go to spot and it is my HANGOVER CURE after a crazy weekend.\n\nVERY WELL RECOMMENDED!\n\nUNTIL THEN!! ^-^
