I was not sure if it was a chocolate store or a sit down place.  A little confused.  But I was greeted right away by two lovely ladies and they explained to me they are a chocolate store and in the back they have a cafe.  OH!   They had pre-packaged chocolates on the right hand side of the store and then on the left hand was a la carte hand cut chocolates you can buy in each.  I got dark chocolate covered pretzels....  The dark chocolate had this slightly bitter and sweet taste.  It was so so good.  Then I got a bunch of other dark chocolate covered each thingy from the case.  I have to say....  It is not super sweet chocolate that you eat one and you go into a sugar coma.  It is just a perfect balance...  I need to come back to the cafe.  I heard the cakes are to DIE for.
