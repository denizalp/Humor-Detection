As long as you don't expect service with a smile, then this will be a good spot for you!\n\nI sampled the fried chicken wings, fried scallops, fried whiting filet, fried jumbo shrimps, and French fries. As I review this, I realize how calorically wrong this plate sounds but if you are going to indulge in seafood, this is where you want to be. \n\nAnd everything for me was a sample because the portions were so large that I wasn't able to finish any one thing. It made for great leftovers the next day, though.\n\nThey sprinkle some dust on the fried seafood after it comes out the fryer but I wouldn't be able to tell you what it is. It looks like sawdust but has no taste and the \"friendly\" cashier ignored me when I asked him what he was sprinkling on my food. \n\nEven with his attitude, I still give this a 4 star experience. That says a lot...\n\nThere is a take out only restaurant so unless you live in the area, be prepared to eat in your car...like I did.
