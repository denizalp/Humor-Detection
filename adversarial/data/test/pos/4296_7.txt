\"Candy is nature's way of making up for Mondays.\"\n\nWhat's better than a kid in a candy store?  An adult with dental insurance, a paycheck, and a credit card in a candy store!  Woo!  I was at Rally's one day reliving my childhood of what was once the best fries ever when I decided I'll stop into Sweeties.  I've always seen this behemoth of a shop but never strolled in.  I figured it was just another store filled with stale overpriced candy.  Boy was I wrong.  As soon as I walked in, I was in awe.  Not the jaw-dropping kind of awe but the pee-in-my-pants kind of awe.  There were shelves upon shelves of different kind of candy.  Lots of retro brands, hard-to-find and somewhat extinct candies, and imported sweets.  I nibbled on a few pieces of candy and left with a bag full of soon-to-be cavities.  My dentist will be going on another abroad vacation soon, funded by Joyce W.  You're welcome, Dr. Reidhead!\n\nJoin us in Sweeties Paradise, leave feeling just a little ashamed of yourself, then eat some candy because life's too short and  you can hate yourself later.
