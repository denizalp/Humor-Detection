Meh, not worth $49.99. Came here around 8:30PM on a Sunday. No line, plenty of tables, and not too busy. Besides the crab legs, there's really nothing that was even above average to my taste buds. The salmon and halibut were overcooked, pastas were bland and everything has a strange plastic layer that you must disturb to get to.  \n\nEverything just looks like it's been sitting out for hours, even when they just bring it out. The soups were just... scary. \n\nThe gelato was good. Service was good. The food was just disappointing. I've had tv dinners that tasted better.\n\nSo sad. I wouldn't recommend this buffet at all.
