It's a hot afternoon; even the streets are sweating... you walk up the steel grated steps and open the door...\n\nNow, the heat washes past you, like the waves on desert highways, and you can't help but feel transported to a place that knows what real heat, is all about. \n\nArroma and music blasts you in the face, like that same desert's wind and enter you must... upon this new threshold.\n\nJust so you know... at Jimmy's, you gotta yell... cuz the music is so bleeding loud... and, it's nice to yell sometimes... to yell, without anger... just to be heard...\n\nI'll leave the interior description to you... \n\nJimmy's is a true eastern Mediteranean (I learned to spell that in grade 6, forgive me) shop, all the wares that one might expect, and all the smells that give the glands reasons to seep.\n\nHmm, I'm wondering if this review is turning into something more... sorry, \n\nJimmy's is the best place to get flat breads filled with glorious beef, chicken and falafel fillings. They also sell houka pucks, weird and wonderful canned goods from the world-wide and they are some of the friendliest people you will meet. \n\nMy only crit.. is the upstairs eating chamber... don't go there, go outside and feast on the amply packed \"I can't eat another bite\" Shawarma and donair and falafel.\n\nCheers,\nTed\n\nP.S. no spell check... sue me.
