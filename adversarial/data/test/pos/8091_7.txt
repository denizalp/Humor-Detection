Over the past few months, we have been on a search for the best red velvet cupcake (or something similar to a cupcake) in town. Sadly, we did not find it at Nothing Bundt Cakes. Don't get me wrong; It was okay, but it didn't even come close to the quality and taste that we experienced with Tammie Coe's red velvet cupcake. I think we got spoiled by having her cupcake first, because all of the other variations have failed to impress us as much, if at all. There were two major problems with the bundt that we tried here: First, it was too heavy. Maybe that's just the nature of the bundt itself, but we found it to be way too heavy and rich, which only allowed us to eat about half of the thing. Two: It didn't have a lot of flavor. I know that might sound contradictory to my last statement about it being rich, but just because something is rich and heavy doesn't automatically mean that it has a lot of flavor, which this dessert clearly didn't have. It was missing that \"wow\" factor, that melt in your mouth so good you want another one, type of feeling that we get with TC cupcakes. I'm glad we tried it once so that we can scratch it off our list of places to try, but I really doubt that we will be going back for any more bundt's. Oh well, on to the next place! \n\nP.S. Any suggestions for a place to try red velvet cupcakes (or bundt's)are welcome!
