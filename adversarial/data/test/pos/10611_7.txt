I was in the mood for some Trinidadian food and thought I'd give this place a try after learning that the owners are from Trinidad but sadly I was disappointed.  Read on for more....\n\nLocation & Aesthetics - Located in Phoenix or rather in Glendale as Yelp would list the address; however if you're using a GPS as I did to find the place and use the Phoenix address as was printed on their business card (previously given to me), you will be directed to a residential area.  You must use the Glendale one listed, and you will know that you've found the right place when you near Bethany Road and the U-Haul depot. \nParking can be hit or miss as they share the parking lot area with other business so I can envision the area becoming full.  If that's the case, then unfortunately there's no other place to park as the street is busy and one cannot park there.  Thankfully there was a tattoo parlor that closed which opens some parking spots.  \n\nMenu - Situated below the order counter and is self-explanatory.  \n\nService - The staff was nice, friendly, warm, and welcoming.  Any questions we had was answered promptly despite not having any except for the occasional question asking if certain Trinidadian foods was available, e.g., if 'Buss-up-Shut (paratha roti) or 'Sada' roti was available?\n\nFood - I ordered the curry chicken with channa and a side of 'Buss-up-Shut' (paratha roti).  The wife ordered the same except she had regular roti (sada roti).  We were hoping to order some Trinidad soda called 'Solo' but was disappointed to see that the restaurant didn't carry this (-1).\nWhile we waited, we were given a complimentary bowl of pholourie (fried batter shaped into balls) with some dip which was supposedly was tamarind but didn't taste like it.  Sadly the pholourie wasn't large and fluffy, wasn't well seasoned as expected, and tasted very bland as well as the dip which, if it was tamarind, would've tasted tangy and sweet but definitely didn't.  \nWhen the meals came, we discovered the plates was very small and as such the food was overflowing from the plate after being piled high on it (-1 for inappropriate sized plates).\nThe channa and chicken tasted okay - both well cooked however the accompanying curry in which these items swam in was very bland and didn't at all taste anything like the curry from Trinidad which by the way, the country does make its own brand.\nWhile we ate the meals, we were provided with a complimentary plate with a 'Doubles' - two bara (fried flat bread) with channa.  The bara tasted tasteless with no seasoning and one could surmise that only flour and water was used to make the bara.  The channa was okay although the plate was heavily seasoned with pepper and sadly we couldn't take another bite of the 'Doubles'. (-1 for the food)\n\nI definitely wouldn't be back here based on how poorly the food tasted as it wasn't anything like what Trinidadian food tastes like.
