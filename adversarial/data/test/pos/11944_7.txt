I dont want to rate a place 1 star but just couldnt find anything positive for the extra star. place is crazy smoky and they serve food. I would have givin the food a try but bartender didnt come over to acknowledge us for about 5 minutes. Thats a crazy long time if a bar is slow. He was hanging with another guest or friend on the other side of the bar. Main reason for 1 star was the cook going behind the bar then as he went back in the kitchen he started to pick his nose. that pretty much ended the visit.
