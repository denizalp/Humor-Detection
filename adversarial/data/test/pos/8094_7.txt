I rating this place LOW because their CLUB HOUSE MANAGER knowingly ripped off out of town players!!!!\n\nI was party to a hole-in-one on a par three. Crazy amazing shot and the first one for my friend who hit this spectacular ball. Afterwards our foursome returns to the club house to collect on his buying of drinks, when the CLUB HOUSE MANAGER congratulates and then UPSELLS my friend on buying a commemorative  paving stone with his name on it. The stone will have his name and iron used on the hole that will be placed alongside the cart path near the hole. Not wanting to pass this up, my friend didn't have the $400 or so dollars to this pay for lifetime achievement. So, myself and another gentleman in our foursome ponied up the cash to make this memory real. The CLUB HOUSE MANAGER has my friend fill out a form with his details, club, yardage, hole and contact info, and collects our cash. Relays he will call my friend once the stone is placed. \n\nFast forward one year later, after no update call, my friend is playing the course today and the only thing evident is I'm out some cash, there is no paving stone, and I'm sure the CLUB HOUSE MANAGER has no recollection of how he spent the money he took from us. \n\nTERRIBLE! Open theft and lousy customer service.
