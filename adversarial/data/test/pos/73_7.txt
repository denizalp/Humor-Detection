I briefly stopped through WinCo Foods this past weekend with the 'rents. They love this place. I am becoming a fan. \n\nI would have to describe it as a warehouse meets a normal grocery store meets Sprouts meets Food City. Warehouse because of it's size. Normal grocery store because of the products offered and product size. Sprouts because of the awesome bulk bins - Jelly Belly's in individual flavor bins, Gummy Bears, and well I pretty much didn't get past the candy but I hear they have granola and lot of other things. And finally Food City because of the prices. \n\nI was also able to fined E.L. Fudge cookies that I haven't been able to find anywhere else... so FYI if you like those, WinCo is the only place to get 'em. \n\nI like the whole baggin your own groceries! I am irritatingly particular about how I like my groceries bagged, that's why I am usually the A-hole at Fry's with 47 things in the self-checkout lane. Deal with it! \n\nIt is a bit of a drive for me, but I think on the weekend I can spare the extra drops of gas to frequent this establishment.
