Holy moly. Oh my goodness. Go here. \n\nIf you like that soft serve stuff in any of its reincarnations (cones from McDonalds, Menchies and other pay-by-weight places where you load your chemical soft serve with skittles, Twizzlers, and sour keys), either you'll hate this place or if you are open to new experiences - you'll be blown away. Fact: I am not like the person I described above.\n\nI love gelato, more specifically, I love home-made\/made on premise gelato. Ok where do I start? I love the concept of this place - what an amazing idea. It brings all of my favorite flavours to a medium that is so widely accepted! The quality of the gelato is excellent so I think it will help encourage ppl experience new flavours that they otherwise may not have any interest in, like Sour sop, Green bean, Durian, Lotus Seed, Red bean, Black Sesame, etc. They do it creatively as well by mixing it with something more familiar, like Vanilla lotus seed and coconut green bean. Of course they have familiar flavours as well, like strawberry-lychee and mango.\n\nThe product is very good - smooth, silky, creamy. Very clean with no aftertaste. The right consistency and not icy at all. I tried the black sesame (features crushed black sesame seeds for an interesting texture), banana avocado (more banana than avocado, but avocado doesn't really have a bold flavour so I think this imbalance keeps it from being bland. very creamy), vanilla lotus seed (has half lotus seeds in it), and cashew (creamy, tasted like cashews).\n\nThe service was excellent. The customer in front of me tried too many flavours despite the long line up behind him (sample abusers ARE THE WORST) and the counter help was still so nice. Service with a smile. They are also very happy to give recommendations. There's no seating inside, but they have benches outside which is nice, and great to sit on to enjoy Baldwin street on a beautiful summer night. Probably not ideal in the winter but who cares. \n\nI love that they serve their gelatos out beneath the counter containers like they do in Italy. The counter is in an L shape with small labels on the glass. The flavours are also written outside on a chalk board, and posted inside on a board. They must make their gelato in small batches because I was there around 8 or 9 and they were sold out of 5-8 different flavours.\n\nLast point: Since extensively travelling Italy years ago with my BFF, I've had a love affair with gelato. I am willing to pay a premium for a good product b\/c there are too many unnatural (aka bad) tasting gelatos out there. Luckily, for $3.75 (small) you get a good sized amount and get to try two flavours so it's easy on the wallet and for a very satisfying amount. Def looking forward to going back and trying out the flavours I missed out on.
