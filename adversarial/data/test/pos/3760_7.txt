This place has been on my radar for a few years. I had envisioned a HUGE venue & it was. I'd recommend getting your tix ahead of your visit & arriving on time as they do sell out especially for the night tours. Our talented guide was Genevieve (not sure on sp don't hate me girl) a passionate native. She was fun, attentive & super informative on Vegas history & signage. She kept us involved with some questions to the group & kept the rule breakers in line. All in all if you're interested in Vegas history at all go visit this gem in the desert. It's really fun & the photo ops are really cool.
