New Years Eve...I'm teetering between choosing 2 or 3 stars, so I'll err on the side of positivity to kick off my first review of 2013. \n\nMy first impression in dealing with the hotel staff was not the most pleasant. I called and was placed on hold for about 10 minutes by a clearly frazzled phone operator. When she came back online I wanted to do two things: \n\n1) Verify our hotel reservation (the link in my confirmation email from them stated that my reservation could not be found) and \n\n2) Check on the possibility for an early check in since I would be off work early on the 31st and didn't want to drive to the other side of the valley just to have to drive all the way back up to BFE Fountain Hills. \n\nSo here's how 1 & 2 played out:\n\n1) The operator said she was not able to find my reservation either and asked me to call her back in 15-20 minutes so she could help me sort things out (weird...but ok whatever). Or if I don't call back, she'll research it later and call me back if my phone number was on the reservation that she couldn't seem to locate.\n\n2) Before she hung up on me I also asked to find out about early check in...then she said I would have to call them back the next day for information on that. Huh? I have to find out about early check in on the day that I would be checking into the hotel? If I was one of those people that like to have a plan laid out in front of me prior to beginning my journey, I would've been REALLLLLY ANGRY about that...but since I'm not, I was only very perturbed...not angry...just irritated. \n\nAnywho, I called back the next day and spoke with awesome Paul who was able to: \n\n1) verify that my reservation was still active and \n\n2) set up a 2pm early arrival time for me to check in\n\nWhen I got to the hotel, the parking lot was mercifully empty, I got rockstar parking (I didn't know about the valet until later) and checked in. The front desk ladies were very pleasant to deal with.\n\nOnce in the room I noticed a couple of things, 2 queen beds instead of 1 king (not that big of a deal, at least they got most of the feathers out for me ahead of time!), both beds sounded as if oversized pandas had been having their freaky-deaky way on them and the squeaking was unBEARable...there was nothing that didn't cause them to squeak, even tossing my cell phone onto the pillow made it squeak...good grief!...but the ickiest was when I took my shower and the water wasn't draining. Gross!!!! \n\nSo I called to the front desk to see if they would move us to another room, they said that the hotel was COMPLETELY FULL and that they'd just tell the supervisor about it later that evening. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a knock on the door and it's Mr. Hotel Repair-Guy (also a very nice person). (A heads-up that someone was coming by would be nice, it takes a while (for a modest lady like myself *giggle*) to change out of a bathrobe to let someone into your room. Needless to say, he was unable to fix the squeak even after dismantling the bed frame and mattress and said he would speak with the front desk...20 minutes later they had moved me next door. Nothing really said about inconvenience or anything...just we'll get you a new key and move you across the hall (couldn't we have done that an hour ago so I could've taken a nap before getting my NYE party on?). \n\nThe hotel is ok (great job with the stone work), but really not worth what we paid for the night there ($340) for just a regular room with a view of the parking lot...no bueno!!  \n\nAlso, we walked in to the hotel's New Years Eve party which was BEAUTIFULLY decorated...but didn't seem to be put together very well (and empty), I think most of the patrons must have gone over to the casino like we did to ring in the new year, and *CASH BAR* is a real turn-off when you pre-pay for an event like that. How about some drink tickets or something??
