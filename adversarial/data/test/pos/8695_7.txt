I can't really comment on how this location was before the remodel but I can compare it to the 200+ DDs I've been in during my life...and for one outside of the Northeast it does a pretty good job. And god knows its better than Starbucks. \n\nI've never experienced an extended wait or a line and I've always had my order delivered to me in a timely fashion. The don't toast the English muffin on the breakfast sandwich automatically, as has been my experience everywhere else, so make sure to request it. It makes all the difference in the world. The donuts themselves are not nearly as large as they should be. (The largest ones I've ever seen are the ones at the DD on the corner of Mass Ave and Haviland St...they are seriously the size of bread plates) the glazed donuts should have more glaze but they will make do if you are craving something sweet. They also offer something here called long johns? I've never seen those, or heard of them before, but they look like long rectangular Boston cremes. \n\nMy main reason for stopping in here is to get tea and hot chocolate, which never disappoint. Unlike the DD near where we used to live in N. Scottsdale this one serves hot chocolate the proper way- out of a machine baby. Since this location is on my way to campus at the moment I will definitely continue to stop there. Once the light rail is up and I'm taking that in I'll switch over to the Mill Ave location.
