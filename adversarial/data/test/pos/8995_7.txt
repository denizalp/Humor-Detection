We came in for dinner on a weeknight. It wasn't super busy, which for us was perfect. We sat at a little rustic table and were greeted promptly by the server. There is a huge menu board with listed specials and all the desserts. The server went over everything with us... Pay special attention to that board, lots of good stuff on there! \n\nThe menu isn't overly extensive but there are plenty of options for everyone. We ordered the Shishito peppers... Omg... Cauliflower with the peppers was utter perfection. It was a generous portion and we both couldn't get enough. We will be ordering this dish religiously from now on. I ordered a vegan avocado roll. I thought I had asked for asparagus but I'm positive it was only cucumber and avocado. It was a generous portion and pretty delicious. It wasn't the best roll I've ever eaten... But it was good enough to order again. My boyfriend ordered the pork belly Kim chi fried rice... It came out in a hot skillet... Still sizzling. Being vegan, I couldn't try it... But judging by his reaction and raving review... I can definitely say, he loved it! For dessert... We opted for the strawberry red wine sorbet... WowZa! For only two bucks, they make it in house and it was fresh and full of real fruit. The wine aroma carried throughout each bite. We will definitely be back to try the other sorbet options! \n\nI ordered a Prosecco with a strawberry as my cocktail. It never disappoints. My boy boyfriend ordered the Bessie cocktail. It started out well but ended pretty awful. We probably won't be ordering that one again. \n\nOur waters were always full and our server was very accommodating. She asked the proper questions to the kitchen to ensure my food came out vegan and properly. She also warned me about the shrimp paste in the rice:) nice touch!! The prices are fair and the environment is perfect for a friendly lunch or a romantic date night! We will definitely we returning!
