Dutch Bros is amazing. Everyone who works there is super friendly and upbeat. You will always leave there in a good mood. I don't know how they all have such great memories but they always remember our names & favorite drinks. They make my 6 year old feel like a rock star. Every time something good happens in his life, whether he beats a video game or moves up a belt in karate, the first thing he wants to do is go tell his friends at Dutch bros.  Aside from the stellar service, the drinks are deeeelish! None of that overly roasted, burned flavor of Starbucks. Not a coffee fan? Try the grapefruit green tea on a hot day. Yum!
