After several visits to John Cutter's next door, we were tempted away to Toros. Being a long time Tapas fan, and with Firefly in the news every other week, we really wanted to like this place. After reading mixed reviews, I was concerned, and hungry...ok, more hungry than concerned.\n\nI have a rule about new places. I assume that the servers know what's best. I often ask the servers to bring me the best, and leave it at that. Some servers shudder, some embrace the challenge, some know their menu so well, they barely blink before deciding what to bring. Our server, Omar, was the third type. He quickly decided on three items, all perfect, then two more, still perfect. What did we have? Well, come on by and ask your server. You see, our drinks and menu items were tailored to our tastes. Your experience may be different, but I hope, equal to our experience.\n\nI saw a lot of poor reviews from a few months ago, but my understanding is that they have a new chef. Check it out, it may be better than you had previously experienced.\n\n-Skacey, former Elite :-)
