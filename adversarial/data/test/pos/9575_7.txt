Came in here tonight thinking, I'll shell out $40 on enjoying a little Happy Hour. Wow, saw your \"Under New Management\" sign...but did not expect that they would push a customer away.\n\nRestaurant\/Bar Rescue...do you work with Chains too!?\n\nI went to the hostess stand, and asked if happy hour was only in the bar? She said no, everywhere throughout the restaurant too. I opted for non-bar. I also asked if there was food on the happy hour, oh yes of course was the response.\n\nTo start with a drink...I was chilled so thought some type of a hot drink would be a good start. Waitress, we don't have hot alcohol drinks...the only thing hot, coffee. Poor girl, never been to a bar before? Never been to an Irish bar? ...haha, oh wait. This is an Irish bar. I guess hot totties, Baileys, and other hot drinks are...Polish?\n\nI didn't want to even explain because it was so embarrassing. So I went with coffee. \n\nShe also have me a menu...no happy hour menu. I inquired, can I get a happy hour food menu? She looked confused...um, yah I'll check on that.\n\nShe delivered the coffee. And then asked if I wanted food...as though the happy hour menu had never been discussed. Ha! My mind was blown...so I asked, did you get a chance to get me the happy hour food menu? Perplexed, she slowly responded...ya, we don't have anything like that. \n\nI really didn't know what to say...so I said, I'll just stick with coffee. Boy oh boy...not sure what to say or think!\n\nAs I sit here enjoying my coffee (which is VERY good btw) I look around, and at 6:05pm...there are seriously 3 maybe 4 people in the entire place. I look across to The Outback Steakhouse reception area...standing room only. And on the other side of the restaurant is The Salty Sow...I KNOW that place is wall-to-wall right now, as it always is. \n\nCrazy to me! But can't make this stuff up. \n\nTell you what Phoenix, if you wanted to try the Tilted Kilt...you need to hurry because they will be shutting their doors soon! Well, on the positive side...there's no wait.
