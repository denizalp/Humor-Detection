This is nice as far as Vegas pools are concerned especially  considering the age of the casino.  \n\nHowever it is completely overrun by children and I know it's all they can do in Vegas but you shouldn't go to Vegas if you have to bring your kids with you.  \n\nIt may be worth the $10 per person for the adults only pool.  It's a nominal fee they have an abundance of nice padded deck chairs and you get to avoid the rug-rats.\n\nYou also get free bottled water in the adults only area.  Peace & quiet on your adult vacation heck is pay more than the $20 I did for me & my wife.
