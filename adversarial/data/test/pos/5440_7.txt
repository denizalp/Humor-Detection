You're downtown, you want interesting pizza options without the 5 hour wait, and your hunrgy...\n\nThat's me.\n\nFunny thing is, I actually didn't like this place at first, but now it's a first choice.\n\nIt's a cute little place with delicious food. Never had a problem, and rarely do I wait (but I'm an early eater). Never tried their lunch options, however.\n\nI recommend the pesto salad, prosciutto pizza, and you need to try a crepe. MARSCAPONE AND NUTELLA?????? Umm, OK!\n\nDROOOOOL....
