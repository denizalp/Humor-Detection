Wow!! Excellent Thai food! We ordered the orange chicken and pad see-ew which came with rice. It was quality and affordable food for late night! The orange chicken was crispy and the flavoring was great, had a nice tang to it. The pad see ew was cooked to perfection. The chicken was savory and fresh, the noodles were delicious and the egg was savory. Great late night, open til 4 am!!
