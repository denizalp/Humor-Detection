Stopped in for breakfast and a few pastries. Ok wasn't really planning on stopping here but walked by and saw someone with a breakfast sandwich that looked amazing and decided I wanted one too. I had a croissant breakfast sandwich that was everything I hoped it would be. They did forget my tomatoes so I had to ask for them but that's not to big of a deal. The coffee is also served pipping hot. So much so the I had to let mine sit for a good 30 min before I could even drink it. I had a hard time deciding what sweet treat I wanted. They all looked amazing. I went with the macaroons. They were good. Not as good as I was hoping for. I wish the flavors were a bit bolder but they satisfied my sweet tooth.
