Terrible. I probably shoulda known better than to order pasta from a greek place, but this is just false advertising and horrible cookery. The \"chicken alfredo pasta\" contained neither sauce, nor seasoning, spices, salt - nadda. It was a bunch of shredded chicken placed over soggy pasta, covered with a huge layer of plastic-y mozzarella cheese. I'm sorry, but if you're not gonna give me classic alfredo sauce (which i was CRAVING), and instead you're gonna try to put a Greek spin on an Italian classic, at LEAST make it flavorful! And call it something else!!!\n\nYou'd think they'd have gotten the Baklava right, at least - nope! Stale filo dough, a strange sour taste, and none of the sweetness or butteriness you'd expect. Absolute fail. Phoenician cafe is much better for baklava, and they don't make the mistake of trying to serve pasta. Lesson learned!
