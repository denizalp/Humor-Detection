After visiting this museum, I wish I was one the mafia's wife or mistress because damn...they treated their women good! haha. Or even a Mafia Princess. Shoots. ;) I would love to live their lifestyle with all the glitz and glamour of early Las Vegas.\n\nLocals are $10 admission fee plus you have to pay $5 (cash only) for a parking fee. I was there for about 2 hours...could've definitely been longer if I actually read every single infomation they had posted. I loved learning about the rise and fall of the Mob and their attempt to take over Vegas, but power, greed and $$$$$ got the best of them.\n\nThe museum is three stories high and it's located in an actual courthouse where hearings from the Mob used to be held. I got kind of an eerie feeling when I was in the courtroom watching a short documentary about their court hearings. I wondered if there was ever a gun fight that happened there. \n\nI would definitely recommend this place for tourists and locals alike. It's great getting to know the history of Las Vegas and how the Mob created and also changed Las Vegas. Come stop by the heart of Downtown Las Vegas and make a day out of it. As much as I love how the Las Vegas Strip is nowadays, I miss the old school feeling. So I appreciate how Downtown LV still have that \"back in the days\" feel. Plus having The Mob Museum here is like the icing on the cake.
