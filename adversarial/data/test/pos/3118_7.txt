First time here & I WOULD NEVER COME HERE AGAIN!  First and foremost the employees here are welcoming that's why they get at least one star. \n\nWhere to begin....Im a hard critique when it comes to manis, full sets, and pedis. I tend to be very picky on how my nails and toes are done but i mean who isnt?! I heard of this place through a cousin of mine, her nails were always done very nice so I thought \"let me give this place a shot since I can't wait till I go back to Cali to get them done.\"\n\nA Man named Jack is who did my pink and white acrylic full set. Jack seemed like he knew what he was doing which he did but NO FULL SET should ever have left over gel around every single nail!!!!!!! On top of that after the gel was put on and dried there were bumps, the excess from the white tip that were filed off, weren't buffed off correctly, each finger were filed and shaped differently JUST ALL TYPES OF WRONGS! I will  kindly give him thumbs up on applying the pink and white acrylic correctly.\n\nThen came the woman who did my pedicure *slaps forehead* lets just say half assed on scrubbing my feet then had the nerve to tell me, \"she couldn't scrup the rest of my calluses because my feet were already soft\" when CLEARLY you could see more calluses. Isn't that what a pedi is all about?! Making your feet look and feel brand new? !?! Not to mention the way she painted my toes were HORRIBLE.\n\nI haven't been satisfied in a very long time with a couple of these nail salons here in vegas. They need to thoroughly do their jobs WELL!!!!\n\nEND OF STORY!\n\nnever coming here again. For $95 for a full set of pink and white acrylic plus gel on my toes was NOT WORTH EVERY DOLLAR! Sorry
