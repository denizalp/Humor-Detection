I had never even heard of rolled ice cream until my girlfriend introduced me to the concept when we visited Toronto, where all of a sudden there were like, a million places that do it. Actually, there are only two, but you know what I mean.\n\nI think Frosty Roll has a lot of potential. And I know saying that makes it sound like I'm about to also say something negative about it. It's kind of like how you say a person has a really good personality after you find out they're unattractive (jerk). Frosty Roll is a great concept, and it has a lot going for it, but there's room for improvement.\n\nI'm not factoring in the fact that there was no air conditioning during our visit, because it was probably just broken. Ah, the joys of property ownership! Plus, if I'M complaining about it, imagine how much the staff must hate it. Regarding the ice cream itself (which the real reason we're all here), the flavors are very interesting, and they seem really awesome. I know that makes it sound like I'm about to follow up with something negative. Well, I am.\n\nI went with what most others probably did: the Nutty Canadian. The Nutty Canadian sounds fantastic, with maple and walnut ice cream, walnuts sprinkled on top, and maple cookies tucked in in the shape of maple leafs. That basically sounds like the American equivalent of a bald eagle wearing a baseball cap soaring in front of an American flag. But it was just really underwhelming. I was disappointed to find the ice cream was reeeeally bland. Since the ice cream was flavorless, it made the nuts just seem watery. The cookies weren't particularly interesting, either. For some reason. Except their shape. That part was fun.\n\nIt takes a while for your order to be completed, but it also takes a long time at the other place (if not longer). This type of ice cream is simply a process.\n\nThe staff seems really nice, and like I said, I see a lot of potential here. In the restaurant, I mean. Not the staff. It would be super creepy to talk about whether or not the staff is attractive in a Yelp review. It would be creepy to do that anywhere, actually.\n\nIf I lived in Toronto, I would keep giving it a shot. I hope you will, as well.
