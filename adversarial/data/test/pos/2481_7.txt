Of course there are a lot of mixed reviews here. This location is in the Airport. \nTerm. 4 Sky Harbor on the US airways side.\nKid working the counter was nice and tried to handle everyone as well as he could. The lady behind me was yelling because, there was no Bacon left.\nIt was 5:00 at night on Easter Day.\n I got a Burger and Fries and an Ice Tea. I thought they were all really good.\n Not too bad of a price either.\nI did not wait too long for my food and it was nice and hot when I got it.\n\nThe woman was still yelling at the kid because they were out of bacon.\nHey, everyone just remember, it is not the fault of the emplyoees when things run out. That is management that does the ordering.\nPlus, you are making everyone work on Easter,I am sure they would all rather be home with their families. So spread the Joy not the Hate~
