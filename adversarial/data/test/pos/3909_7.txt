Buffet of Buffets Marathon - Stop #4 of 7 1:30 PM\n\nOur 4th stop in the Buffet of Buffets day long marathon.....Flavors was a pleasant surprise.  We were seated quickly and the 1st thing our group did was rest for a few minutes to build up our appetite....ha!  The weight of 3 Buffets in 4.5 hours was beginning to hit us hard.\n\nAfter a few minutes, I got up and took a walk around the buffet.  There were so many great looking items.  I went for some Chow Mein, Fried Rice, and some Pizza.  All of it was outstanding!  The Pizza was especially good....I went back for seconds.  \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/dYMhfzyZyklXELmYq_wfKg?select=ZeAbshtIHc8YWntKI1uEXA\n\nIf I wasn't on my Veggie Fast, I'd have some of the Meat at the carving station....it looked really good.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/dYMhfzyZyklXELmYq_wfKg?select=m27rfSCwfa0LnZyBw6yqyA\n\nOverall, it was a great experience and a pleasant surprise.
