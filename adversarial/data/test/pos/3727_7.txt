Super over priced for mediocre food!\nWe started with the fried calamari. It was average, similar to an appetizer from Applebee's.\nThe steak was good, but not cooked evenly. The asparagus was sour & disgusting. The Lobster bisque, which our server highly recommended as being one of their best items, tasted like it was out of a can & prepared with old frozen lobster pieces....and we paid over $100 for this crap dinner.\nI definitely recommend going elsewhere... There's a lot of better restaurants to choose from nearby.
