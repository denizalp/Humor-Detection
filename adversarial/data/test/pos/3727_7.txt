This park is very convenient to my house, which is the main reason I come here quite often. There are several different trails you can take, depending on how much of a workout you want (or, in my case, how hungover you are). Yes, it does get crowded and parking in the NW lot can be difficult, especially on the weekends, so go early, by about 7 am. I do think the trails are nicer since they have been widened, but show a little trail etiquette: just because the trail is wider does not mean you get to hike 3 or 4 abreast! Take a look at the trail maps to see which ones are loops and which ones are not. I didn't do this one time and wound up somewhere out on 55th Ave - my 3 mile hike turned into an 8-miler through the scenic Arrowhead community.\nAnd, contrary to other Yelpers, I do like when people say hello. Don't do it, and you may hear me whisper \"Bitch\" under my breath as you pass by!
