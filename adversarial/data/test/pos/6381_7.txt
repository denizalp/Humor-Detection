After taking an exhausting 4 hour test at the testing center down the block I was starving. I used Yelp and found this place. I thought it was a restaurant but as it turns out it is a convenience like counter\/deli cafe inside a business park. I almost left but decided to try it. Frankly I was too tired and needed food. It is a great idea for the workers in that office park. \n\nPros- the staff is great, the food is okay. I got the cashew chicken salad sandwich, chips, and drink. It was a gorgeous day so I sat outside. They have many tables inside and two or three wrought iron small tables outside. It was really nice sitting outside, relaxing and staring at the fountain in the plaza. I know there will not be too many more days one can be outside this time of year. The place itself makes varied sandwiches and meals and also has a counter with some pre-wrapped food items and stores.\n\nCons- way too expensive! 10 bucks and change is too much for a sandwich type lunch like the one I got. While good, that is more than the price of a sit down restaurant, full service, full plate sized lunch or even dinner. My guess is they are charging for the convenience to the plaza workers.
