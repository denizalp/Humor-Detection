I've been to Bliss\/reBAR twice so far, once for an event and just the other day for a great lunch on the patio.\n\nThe service has been very good each time.  I love the outdoor patio space and the circular bar with the rebar tree.\n\nThe food is solid so far as well.  I shared an order of \"comfort cheese crisps\" with BBQ chicken and onions.  Tasty stuff.  Then I shared a caesar salad and a bliss burger, loaded.  I particularly enjoyed the burger.\n\nThe bottom line is that I really love the outdoor space here for the nice weather - outdoor dining and relaxing at it's best.
