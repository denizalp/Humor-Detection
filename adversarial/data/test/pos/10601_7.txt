First off, reviews like mine are the reason why you shouldn't use Yelp when looking for a place to stay. I have never vacationed at this property.\n\nHaving said that, Rumor is pretty awesome. I've been here previously for a Spy On Vegas open bar event. I once stopped by with Anthony M as part of our Yelp Drinks bar hopping. And last night, I finally attended the monthly Yappy Hour event (every third Thursday from 6-9pm) after years of it being posted in my Meetup group.\n\nTheir grass and pool area in the middle of the (former apartment?) complex is a fabulous space for events. During Yappy Hour, your dog can freely roam off-leash while you sip on some cab (or some other included drink of your choice). To borrow from Sambalatte, you get to sip and savor while your dog socializes. There are purple hammocks strewn about among the various palm trees. Just a sweet spot to enjoy the Spring evening breeze.\n\nRumor has it, the hotel itself is pet-friendly.
