I definitely did not miss the location across from Eaton's (What a disaster)\n\nSeeing this place is new on the block, i tried their breakfast, a safe bet\nIt was a quiet Saturday, I had my 2 eggs and sausage plate and the daily paper.\n\nThe waitress was super friendly and filled up my coffee at least 4-5 times.\nI didn't feel rushed or anything since it was so quiet.\n\nThe eggs were pretty big and the meal hit the spot.\nThe decor is not as kitschy as before but still a throwback but very clean and bright.\n\nI went back a week later to try their Big Bopper burger, with mushrooms and cheese.\nThe burger had a nice charcoal taste to it, it came with skinny fries which were ok.\nA nice little bonus was some coleslaw and pickles\n\nA very solid choice for the area, they do deliver as well, so it's on my short list.\nThe menu is significantly cheaper than the Dunn's across the street and with a nicer and less claustrophobic interior
