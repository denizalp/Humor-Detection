Beautiful resort with excellent service and amenities...\nI'm typing this review as I'm sitting outside on the patio of our casita after a fantastic night's sleep in a comfy bed and room service breakfast.  I know... tough life, right?  \n\nWhile the resort is a bit much on the southwestern decor, and it's really spread out, it's situated right next to Pinnacle Peak and it is quiet and gorgeous with fantastic customer service.  But - you'll pay for it!  We treated ourselves to a night here and we're balancing it out with a night of camping tonight.  Quite the contrast, i know.  Next time I'd do it in reverse order.  Either way, it's a treat!\n\nIf you are looking to get away and just want to stay on site at the resort, this is a fantastic option.  Fun bar, beautiful sites for outdoor weddings, big ballrooms, nice rooms, etc... it's close to Greasewood Flat, but that's about it!\n\nWe're off to spend some time at the pool now - I may try to stop in for a quick workout in the fitness center on my way there.  4.5 stars for my experience here so far - a wonderful option for a vacation or staycation depending on where you're coming from.  Enjoy!\n\n--\n\nAfter spending the afternoon at the fitness center, pool, and spa, I have to give Four Seasons a full five stars.  Overly friendly staff and amenities, I don't know what I was thinking before... ;)
