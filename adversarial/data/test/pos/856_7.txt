Love this place! \nMuch better than Fresh and Easy, a little less cheaper than Whole Foods!\n\nThe store is very clean and organized!\nCashiers and workers are helpful and kind!\n\nSprouts provides fresh produce including fruits, vegetables, meats, seafood, baked goods, nuts, and grains! They also have a deli section-- providing a quick sandwich for lunch, if desired! \nAlso lots of natural, organic, and gluten-free groceries to choose from!\nNone food related items they have are beer, wine, supplements and vitamins!\n\nThey have monthly deals and coupon books! Great place to definitely check out!
