Really good pizza. Really good New York style. Stopped for lunch and bought a single slice for 2.99 (February 2018).\n\n It was a giant slice and thin crust that had a wondeful crunch bottom. I had extra pizza sauce and the sauce is light and very clean flavored and delicious.\n\n Just right. The staff is eager to please and nice.
