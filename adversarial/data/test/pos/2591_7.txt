I'm not a member here, which means that my drop-in prices are on the high side for the experience, but the couple of times I have been here, I've been pleased...\n\nI tend to book massages with short notice if and when my schedule allows.  Both of my visits to this Elements Massage studio were with less than 24 hour notice, and my most recent visit was with less than a couple of hours notice.  Whether luck or not, I was just happy that they could accommodate me!\n\nI've had a 60 minute and a 90 minute massage here, both with male therapists, and both with medium pressure.  Both times, I found the therapists professional, and I walked out with less tension in my body than when I walked in.  Neither one was the best massage I've ever had in my life, but they were far from the worst!\n\nBe prepared, there will always be the pressure \/ ask to become a member when you check-out, but not in a super pushy way... and also, note: this is not a \"spa\" experience... it's similar to a Massage Envy, which is A-OK in my book, but again, will not compare to the pampering feeling of a day spa or resort spa!\n\nAll of that said, I'm sure I'll keep this Elements in my rotation for next time I am in \"knead\"of a massage.  Bonus - they do accept Spafinder giftcards!
