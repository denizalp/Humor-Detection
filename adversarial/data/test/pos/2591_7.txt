Greedy, Greedy, Greedy\n\nStopped in to have a slight crease steamed out of my Borsolino and also to look for another Panama.  After spending a few minutes steaming my hat, Watson showed me his stock.  I told him I'd think about it, and asked how much I owed for the steaming.\n\nI was absolutely shocked:  $25.00!!!!  The only thing this marketing and customer loyalty genius accomplished was to guaranty that I will never buy from him and will tell anyone who will listen to avoid this shop.
