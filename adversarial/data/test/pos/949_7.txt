IN THE FORM OF GREATNESS\nTwice in one weeks leads me to believe this place is a pretty darn good choice.  The Striped Sea Bass was absolutely perfect from the double side of brussels sprouts (no carbs) to the finger licking sauce.  The decor is elegant yet nontraditional which I absolutely love.  High five to the cow hide seating!\n\nMIXED FEELINGS\nOther than the Tuna Tartar the rest of the Trio of Tuna appetizer is fit for flinging across the room.  During my second visit that week I opted for the Five Pepper Seared Ahi Tuna simply because I got nervous aka tipsy after the three glasses of Continuum I downed.  From what I can remember and I'm digging deep here, it was good but not great (insert cough, Dante's in Tremont has the best ahi tuna by far).    \n\nBAD TO THE BONE\nCloses at 9pm on Sunday.  Yikes, where is the after-hours spot now that I'm all sauced up after a two hour dinner, a bottle of wine and a gin & tonic.\n\npeace, blessing, salad dressing\n\nThe Kim
