Went here w\/ an open mind, it is IHOP after all but we decided 2 give this newer loc8ion a try. This locale is defin8ly bigger w\/ more tables + seating areas than the 1 that closed off 19th ave\/Glendale, but still a bit of a w8 (which we kinda expected esp bein' it was the wk~end). There were people w8ing everywhere: inside, outside & in between the double layered doors so we sat in some random chairs just inside, lining the wall while attempting 2 face each other in convers8ion so it didn't feel so awkward 2 us & those eating right across the way. \n\n  A little after 20 min our name was called & the hostess showed us 2 our booth w\/o uttering so much as a word 2 us. Maybe she knew our server wouldn't b right w\/ us but it felt uncomfortable not having any exchange @ all. We had awhile 2 go over the menu as we weren't acknowledged, nor offered drinks 4 another 10+ min.  No biggie, we started playing guess who our servers gonna b when a rude gal rather aggressively said 'excuse me' rather loudly, proceeding 2 shove her sweeper under our booth while we tried raising our feet fast enough, only 2 hit our shins on the table leg. Really?? Had 2 go about it like THAT & it couldn't that have been done B4 we were seated?? Uhm, ok..... \n\n   Finally our server Celsa S came 2 let us know we were her table & get our drinks, she was actually a Pretty Good Server (once she got 2 us) & we already felt 2 invested in our time already spent 2 consider leaving. There Rn't as many options 4 Veg~heads on the menu here but finally went w\/ a Spinach Red Pepper Melt on sourdough which was TWICE the sz than when we've gotten it other loc8ions & DELICIOUSLY PERFECT!! They went w\/ the Veg (egg substitute) Omelette since they didn't have the Garden Stuffed Crepes on their menu. The Mango Mosa drink was also better here as it had Fresh squeezed orange juice instead of the concentr8 when prepared elsewhere. \n\n   The FOOD was Exceptionally better than service this go round & hopefully they can train certain staff such as the hostess & 1 of the sweeper gals 2 lighten up a bit as people r paying not just 4 the food but the experience as well. It doesn't require much 2 b pleasant ~ if it's 2 much of a strain 2 b nice. So even though we like the atmosphere & better service @ 67th\/Peoria in Glendale, we may give this another try from time 2 time (just may have 2 bring some shin~guards next time)!
