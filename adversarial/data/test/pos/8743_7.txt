Easily one of the best authentic Korean barbecue places in Montreal. Granted there aren't many places, especially AYCE places, this place still stands out by the quality of the food they serve. \n\nI went there with a small group of 4 people on a Saturday evening. At first, we wanted to try the Mon Ami location at Ville St-Laurent. A combination of a long line up in front of the restaurant and bad weather led us to go to this NDG location. We called around 6:30pm and luckily, we were able to get a confirmation for 7:45pm. \n\nGetting there by bus and metro is not the most convenient way. I would strongly recommend taking the car if you plan to get there. As it is a very residential area, I do not think there will be any issue finding parking.\n\nOk enough talk now, let's get to the real thing: the food. What to say, their menu is fairly simple, with few choices of meats, vegetables, and their \"famous\" fried chicken. This restaurant is a self-cook type of AYCE, so you will have to cook the raw meat yourself. That being said, the cuts are pretty thin so the cooking time is fairly quick, especially when you are as hungry as we were ;) The meat was well seasoned most of the time (much better than other AYCE I would say because it is mainly less salty). One small downside, however, is the fried chicken because we do not get to chose what part of the chicken we get. That being said, the chicken was well fried. \n\nService itself was also great, with fairly quick response time as we put in orders (then again, when compared to other AYCE places). \n\nOverall, very great Korean bbq place that I would strongly recommend if you want proper (and real) Korean bbq owned by Koreans.
