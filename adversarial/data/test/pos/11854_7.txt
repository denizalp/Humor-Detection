Coming here dinner with friends was expecting beef hot pot. I have to admit I was excited. But then when I sat down it was quite a surprise, it is a steamer that where food is place in the center, there wasn't any pictures to take, most of the pic you find here is adequate for explanation.  We are present with a piece of paper, a menu, some say it's self explanatory, I'm just confused looking at it. The server just don't seem to be friendly enough to explain how this works even when I ask twice, maybe it's because my mom didn't make me handsome enough or I'm just too dumb.  Eventually we figure things out by randomly ordering or what I call it ordering everything on the menu. \n\nThe kebab is just different cuts of angus beef or pork with the light salt. Nothing technical, just as simple as it gets. \n\nThen the disappointment came, the slice of beef was steam with your soup base, no seasoning, no salt just as plain as it gets. I mean you can dip it with your sauce but it's still plain all the way inside. \n\nThe finish was the soup base that you cook your food with, the congee we ordered, again in its natural state, just cooked, it's as tasteless as it gets.\n\nIf I want to taste something in natural state or eat something healthy, I would just eat at home. If You can appreciate the taste of plain boiled beef, just as simple as it is, this restaurant is for you.
