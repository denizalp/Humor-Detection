***Yelp Challenge 2016 7\/100***\n\nThis is just a review of my first visit. After my daughter has her second appointment, I will be able to give you a through review of how well they did with her.\n\nThe ambiance here is awesome. My daughter walks in and sees a huge fish tank. Then walks to the left where there is a room with two iPads and plastic wave model that you walk through to get to a video game. There is a projection TV that was playing Rapunzel. Tons of seating for the kids.\n\nMy daughters dentist and assistant was patient with her. My daughter was screaming bloody murder and they stayed calm and collective.\n\nFor the next visit, my daughter has to be put to sleep and has to get two crowns. I am pretty confident that they will do great with her and LOVE LOVE LOVE that the dentist sits with you and reassures you it will be OK because YES I am one of those parents LOL
