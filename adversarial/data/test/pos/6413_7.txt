Homers was able to get me in for my state inspection pretty quickly and only cost $65! They said that MOST repairs and inspections that go into the shop are done the same day - so no rental needed!\n\nTurns out that I needed work on my brakes (which I had been suspecting) and they did the repair. From what I know, they gave me a pretty good price. JR was really informative and patient. After he gave me the quote for two rotors and four brake pads, I called around to other places to see how they were. HOWEVER, I accidentally dialed them again asking for a quote and it was super embarrassing because he recognized it was me! He was really nice about it though.\n\nShort story, they have great reviews, did good work, and were more affordable than the other places. I really appreciated that they didn't try to force me to replace all four rotors like Baum's Blvd Mechanic tried to do.\n\nIn the end, it cost a little more than the quote though, so that star isn't there :\/
