Gee Gong is hands down one of my favourite hole-in-the-wall destinations for one thing - Peking Duck. The first time Gee Gong was recommended to me, it was from a friend from work that handed me a hastily scrawled name and address on a scrap piece of paper with a simple tip, \"Get the duck special.\"\n\nFor less than $30 you will be well fed, starting with the traditional thinly sliced duck meat with it's sinfully crispy and slightly fatty skin. Accompanied by a plate of fresh wrappers, cucumber, green onion and hoisin sauce, you will be a very happy person in short time.\n\nAs you are finishing the first round, you will be hit with a barrage of food, featuring duck including a simple soup with greens and a mound of duck fried rice with the usual additions like shrimp, peas, a little pineapple etc.\n\nYour breath will not be taken away when you visit Gee Gong, and frankly, its something I come to expect from a place that has surprises up its sleeve in the form of honest, non-pretentious Chinese food for the people. The service is friendly and fast and the teapot is always full. I love this place for what it is.
