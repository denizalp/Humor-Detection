Nice mall, plenty of stores. My only gripe is sheriffs that scan everyone's license plates in the parking lots. Their looking for parked cars with expired tags, suspended license and repossessed vehicles. They will follow you out of the mall, or call the tow company to tow your car. Remember all cars parked get scanned. Avoid this mall if you have car issues.  I shop online.
