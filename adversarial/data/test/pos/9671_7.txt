Absolutely the worst water park experience I have had. They clearly rushed to open this place the landscape isn't finish so there's rocks everywhere. Some of the cement is painted so when your feet are wet it's slippery and the stairs are plastic and very slippery when wet. The lines are extremely confusing and slow moving. There is one set of narrow stairs the leads up to 4 slides so it takes forever. They base the slides off of weight and constantly had to tell people they were too \"fat\" to ride this ride and when you finally get to the top and go down the slide there is rubber stoppers to slow you down making the ride extremely just not fun. I will never recommend this park or go back it's just a terrible experience.
