So far so good! What lured me into coming here was the variety of toppings and creative combinations that they have to put on top of your hot dog. \n\nMENU:\n\nThey have the favorite regional classics; including Windy City, Coney, Tucson, Carolina.\n\nYou can also customize your hot dog too! Choice of beef, bacon wrapped or Vegan one!  Also hot link that's made locally.\n\nThe dogs they serve here are Vienna Beef brand, but the owner told me the bacon wrapped ones are Nathan's.\n\nThe fun creations: 9th Island! with Pineapple relish and Spam of course! There's one with Mac and Cheese too. \n\nAlso novelty items they sell are vintage sodas in glass bottles with retro labels.  Upside: made with pure cane sugar, downside: a little pricier for the amount you get. There's no fountain sodas, so you thirsty soda addicts, don't count on refills.\n\nORDER OF THE DAY :\n\nI ended up getting the Trailer Park with Beer Cheese, Fried Onions, coleslaw, watermelon rind bbq sauce and SPAM!  Yes you read right, Spam! Hot dogs don't scream healthy eats, so sure more nitrates, why not! I live for cheat day\/weekend. Anyways good stuff!  Especially the beer cheese and watermelon bbq sauce. The hot dog buns were soft and our weenies were steamy! \n\nOh try the crinkle cut fries!  They made these perfect!  I mooched some fries off of Mr.  B's order.  Crunchy exterior and potatoey moist inside . It doesn't taste like those store bought ones which I hate.   I regret not getting my own now.\n\nLOCATION - ATMOSPHERE\n\nThis joint is located in Pebble Marketplace, where Smith's is the anchor. Hightop tables and barstools make up most of the seating in dining area. Cool graffiti wall art for deco. \n\nPRICE: \n\nAverage... if you look at it from the \"it's a gourmet dog\" perspective. I personally think \n$6.28 for my dog is a little out there, but don't mind paying, because the toppings they added on justified the cost. But among the hot dog places we dine at, we spent the most amount here. The owners said they will have daily specials and deals coming up so look forward to those.  \n\nIt's family owned and operated. Staff was really welcoming and helpful!\n\nBottom line, cool niche for foodies. This place fits right here in Green Valley!
