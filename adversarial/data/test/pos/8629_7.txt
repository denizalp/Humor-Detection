Beautiful new spa, comfortable chairs- unfortunately, the quality of services not reflected. Don't take me wrong, the ladies are all pleasant, but the experience leaves a lot to be desired \nTo start, the lady at the front desk was clearly a smoker - I don't enjoy inhaling the fumes one bit!\n\nHad my lashes filled and took almost two hours! I don't get volume, more of the natural look. The technician was painfully slow and her nails were ridiculously long and curved - I was nervous having them around my eyes the whole time. it'd be great if the fill was consistent but I ended up with one eye having more lashes that the other. I actually have gaps in the lashes and have to go get it fixed in   week at the most \nI'll definitely be looking for different salon
