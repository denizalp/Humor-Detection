Firstly, the dudes behind the counter are legit. They know exactly what they're doing, and because the place isn't accommodating too many people, they can artfully and carefully craft their creations. \n\nThe yellowtail was some of the best I've ever had outside of Los Angeles. The sushi is light, well portioned and proportioned. I never felt like \"This could use a little of this\/that\".\n\nAlso... what is it about that purple rice? It's subtle, but I find it to be a superior vehicle for the fish to white rice. Maybe I drank the Kool-aid, but who cares?  I'm in!\n\nI encourage you to go. My stomach is literally growling as I write this review.
