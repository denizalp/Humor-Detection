There are many unexplained wonders in this world...the parking lot full of cars every weekend night at this place ranks as one of them.\n\nThis is a fish place for people who have no clue what good fish is....it's the \"Golden Corral of the Sea\" whereupon every senior within 5 square miles goes for what reason I can't explain...cheap eats?? This place attracts a clientele that resembles what would happen if the cast of Hee Haw and Golden Girls got together...but enough about the regulars, your here for the seafood, right.? Wrong.\n\nI wish I could say the food explained the phenomenon I referenced earlier, but it doesn't. There is nothing unique, special or different about this places. It's a crowded version of Long John Silvers....if that. With a line for the salad bar that resembles a military mess tent.\n\nBetter plan: Go to Harris Teeter, buy yourself some nice Tilapia, Flounder, Sea Bass  or better yet, some Pacific (not Atlantic!) salmon. Go home, fire up the grill, and go to town. Now you're eating decent seafood. I can promise you , you won't get anything at this place half as good.\n\nAnd just what the hell is a \"fish camp\" anyway?
