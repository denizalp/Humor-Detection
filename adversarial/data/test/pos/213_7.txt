I really enjoyed Island Flavor's other location and was glad they opened another location on this side of town. Know for their larger portions this location didn't disappoint!\n\nI stopped in for my favorite mixed plate of Kalbi ribs and Furiake Chicken and added Fried Rice instead of the white rice and its served with mac salad. Perfect flavors all around and it was enough for two meals. I also grabbed a piece of the Chantilly cake that was in a small cooler near the door. Perfect dessert for me, not two sweet and the cake was nice and moist.\n\nVegas is known as the 9th Island and with eateries like this all we are missing is the Beaches, Weather, and so on and so on.....! At least we can eat good!
