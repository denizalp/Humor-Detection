A club is only as fun as the people you go with and what you make of it. With that said, I had one helluva time.  The bouncers were friendly, and it was a breeze to get in.  Our table waitress Crystal was adorable and attentive.    \n\nThey had storage boxes at our table to put our purses in.  Nice touch.  The venue itself was nothing breath taking - not ugly by all means, but for Vegas - usually it has to have some je ne sais quo, right?\n\nThe music was typical - hip hop then change - then something else - then change, but all together was fine.  My girls were dancing on tables, having drunken fun.  And thats all that matters.
