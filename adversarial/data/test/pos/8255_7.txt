I haven't bowled in years.  So when a group of friends put together an outing here, I had to come.  We bowled on a Saturday afternoon around 1 pm and the place was wide open.  They had the black lights, neon, loud music, and lasers going on...kind of weird to have cosmic bowling in the middle of the day....whatever, it was cool.\n\nWe paid $20 for 2 of us to play 2 games each....$5 per game.  Price comes with the shoes.  The selection of bowling balls is kind of limited.  It took us a little while to find a ball for us to use.  Bowling was fun though...very laid back and everyone had a good time.\n\nThe food options here are ok....Hot Dogs, Pizza, Fries....typical bowling alley food.  On the plus side...they serve Nathan's Hot Dogs...so at least they're quality.  The Pizza is plain though...below average.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/brunswick-via-linda-lanes-scottsdale?select=W8kuwKmK0s-yqa3Z_yWD0w#W8kuwKmK0s-yqa3Z_yWD0w\n\nSome other notes - They also have a pool table in another room.  There are lockers available to store your stuff.  If you want to drink alcoholic beverages, they have a small lounge\/bar...will have to check that out next time.\n\nOverall, it was a very good time.  Since it's in the neighborhood, we'll definitely be back.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%
