This is definitely  take out quality...not that that's bad.\nI order pad see-u w\/chicken. It was good but there was only about 6 chicken pieces in order and  the rest noodles.\nI just want what I pay for. Stingy is going to kill business.  \nThey stopped  their lunch special,  which was disappointing. Strike 2!!!\nThere's  a couple more items I will try to give them a chance to redeem themselves.\nWe shall see...\n\nStay tuned for updates....
