I had a spontaneous moment today, which lead to me stopping by Chicken on the Way.  I've never eaten food from here before and didn't know what to expect.  I usually stick with boneless meat, so this truly was an adventure for me.  I told the lovely older woman behind the counter that I'd never darkened the doorway, so she took me under her wing (no pun intended) and made sure I understood the menu.  It's not complicated but I had a few questions.\n\nI ordered a single wing to say that I actually tried the chicken and was stunned by the fact that you can choose what chicken part you want.  I also ordered a small potato salad and one corn fritter.  The woman kindly told the deep fryer guy to throw in some complimentary fries, as I should try those too and if I like them, surely I'd return.  This was very sweet of her and I couldn't have asked for friendlier service.  \n\nThe food was piping hot, for starters.  The chicken was greasy, as most fast food chicken is, but I liked that it didn't taste salty.  The potato salad wasn't chunky, but instead reminded me of course mashed potatoes.  Despite this, all of the right flavors were there.  The fries were good too and I loved the corn fritter.  If I were a celebrity being paid millions to gain weight for a movie role, eating copious amounts of corn fritters to do it never would have crossed my mind until today.  I would return to Chicken on the Way just for an order of these.  \n\nMy lunch indulgence cost me $3.00.  What a pleasant surprise!  The box of calories I purchased cost less than a Starbucks coffee.  Little lady, you knew what you were doing.
