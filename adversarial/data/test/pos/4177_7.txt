EAT HERE! This has become not just my favorite Indian restaurant but favorite restaurant. I caught myself eating here 3 times in one week.  Whenever I ask my date where we should eat, this seems to be the answer. We are definite foodies and should be ashamed of how much of our income is spent on eating out.\n\n****I've never eaten at a buffet that has such fresh food.  They don't put out tons of food and let it sit, they continually replace with small fresh and hot portions and tend to keep an eye on what needs to be replenished.\n\nIt's 9:30AM on a Sunday morning and my love and I are laying in bed, WAITING for this place to open. We consulted Yelp for the hours and began to browse the reviews, just knowing there would be some comments about the service, or a waitress named Beauty. Beauty is definitely a character, and is one of the reasons we love this place so much. To anyone who says she should brush up on customer service, nah, brush up on your sense of humor.  She's a riot. Laugh with her, smile at her, she is a delight. I will never tire of this place ...1 hour and 30 minutes until it opens ... and I hope Beauty is there.
