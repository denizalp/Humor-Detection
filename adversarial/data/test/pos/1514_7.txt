The Griffin gets majority of their stars for the heavy handed pours they dish out. Those were some potent drinks that justified the prices. We were able to find a spot around a table near one of the fireplaces. If you don't come early, this place will be packed and you'll be left standing around while everyone bumps into you. They do have a back area to get your dance on if you so choose. The crowd is a pretty mixed bag -- anything from hipsters to hoochie mamas looking for attention. Overall atmosphere is pretty laid back and it makes for awesome people watching. I saw so many regrets in the making, it was pretty great. I would come back to The Griffin again, for the heavy drinks and great people watching.
