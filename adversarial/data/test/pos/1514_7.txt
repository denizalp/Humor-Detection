Disgruntled staff. Normally I love cafe rio, but this team is unmotivated and miserable. They aren't happy to be there, and even more unhappy that I showed up to order a burrito.\n\nBack when they first opened, I was excited to finally have a cafe rio near my house. And now I'm so sad, because the employees ruin the experience with their attitude.
