I would like to thank everyone at AZ Tile that helped me with my account. My home builder sent me down here to pick out the granite for our kitchen. The first problem was the design center had a completely different sample of granite then what AZ Tile had in stock. The colors of the granite we picked were night and day. We were able to re-select our granite choice per the builder and design center. This started the second issue, which everyone gets different pricing depending on how they are contracted with AZ Tile. So while I was down there having to pick out new granite, no one at AZ Tile could help me by sending me in the right direction to stay in our level\/price range we already paid for. I was sent into the warehouse blind. I had to walk around and choose a few different granite pieces I liked and then had to send them to my design center. After hours of searching I picked a granite in our price range supposedly because I was not shown the break down of price difference between the two color selections. Of course they didnt have the size I needed in stock according to the builder order, so we had to wait and have it shipped in from Utah. Then 2 days later we find out the builder ordered too much and what I needed for my house was in stock at their location. So now we are to the 4th different trips down to AZ Tile. Finally 2 hours later, we were able to fulfill my granite order. I had a lot of people helping me due to the errors of my home builder and design center. Most of the problems we ran into were not AZ Tiles fault. Thank you so much for the help and patients, I really appreciate it.
