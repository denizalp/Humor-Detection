Gelato! \n\nDolce Gelato is a great addition to The Danforth area. I am a little bias when it comes to frozen dessert especially when it is hot out!\n\nGreat selections of flavours, Great Services, Opens Late, Trendy Vibes and there are NO ice cream parlour in the area that is as good as Dolce. Or I am not even sharing there is any??!\n\nYelp Drinking Buddy really enjoyed his choice of gelato... and I love gelato so much that I am enjoying my gelato even when I am coughing so much... cough cough... YDB can I taste yours?? cough cough...
