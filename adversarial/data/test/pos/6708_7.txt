The worst vets ever,,,they have not even basic knowledge of docs problems. They only know to send you to tests, tests, and tests and they are not able to give a diagnosis to the animal. They only charge you money with no help for the dogs. Also they put you through insurance as TRUPANION, that don't cover nothing. They only wants your money. Please all of you stay away from this vet clinic in Marda Lopp. This vet Daniela, said that my dog has cancer,,,,I can't explain so much stupidity in vet in Calgary, Unbelievable. Their reviews are own people that lie on the reviews. All of you stay away. Try to get vets from USA they are loving and try to help you online. The vets in Calgary rip people off.
