It really is the best experience - service is spot-on, food is really impressive. \nI had a Manhattan which was perfectly sweet up front with a manly kickback. \nTable bread is a rosemary ciabatta served with seasoned lard which I have never had before and I almost sucked down the entire little pot of it. \nBison carpaccio was goddamn astounding, albeit a bit too small for two to share, but could be fine for just one. \nOf course the filet side of the porterhouse is a lot softer than the strip side, it's good to eat the strip side first and finish with the filet. \nThey leave the bone at the table for you if you're so inclined to scrape down that really soft, red goodness... \nOH, and the potatoes? With ricotta and the poached egg? I could have drank it like a milkshake. \nWe skipped dessert. We didnt want to wash out the flavoring of the aftertaste of 8 months of dry age. I just kicked back and enjoyed the assy taste of the back of my own teeth for a while. \n\nI absolutely will be returning.
