Let me first start off by saying, \"I truly love Las Vegas\", it's my second home and truly a great city. The past week I had the pleasure of staying at two Hotel and Resort Casinos on the strip. One was fantastic, the other... Not so much. Unfortunately the Flamingo was the \"not so much\". \n\nI first stayed at the Monte Carlo and can't say enough good things about and it was a fabulous stay. I reviewed it earlier in the week. Normally I wouldn't have stayed at the Flamingo as I like the more moderate to upscale resorts. I figure if I'm going to stay on the strip for 7 days I'm going to spoil myself. What brought me to the Flamingo was my father and stepmother. They paid for my wife and I's last few days and it happened to be at the Flamingo. \n\nMy first impression was \"Seedy\"! I was not impressed what so ever. And it was how I always imagined it would be, not good at all. So we checked in and my stepmom payed for both our rooms and it came out to over $2500! WHAT! Now, my parents did get a huge suite but damn! Being a Vegas veteran I knew she could have gotten a better room at a better resort but she had paid already so it was to late. My wife and I get to our rooms and the room looked like it had modern twist on the 70's, not impressed. To top it off there was a HUGE mold growth in the corner of the shower! How it was over looked for so long should tell you how important the employees feel about their place of employment. Luckily, once we complained and showed the front desk people the picture, they reluctantly changed our rooms and my stepmom was comped $260. \n\nThe Elevators in the Flamingo are very old, dangerous, death traps. They are accidents waiting to happen and every time I stepped into one I feel I had to kiss my wife good by just in case I didn't make the trip to the lobby. Plus, they all have their own personalities, on one the door would slam, I mean SLAM shut, others would creek, one stopped on every floor, one sounded like it was on its last leg. Basically those elevators aren't safe. And don't get me started on their horrendous parking structure, one word: Ridiculous!\n\nAlso, the people that stay at the Flamingo are an interesting bunch. I'll say this, people at the Aria, Cosmo, Caesars Place, Venetian and the likes are much more pleasant to be around. \n\nThe Flamingo gets one star because the employees there are serviceable and took care of our needs. I can't in good faith recommend this hotel when there are much more, better hotels around. Stay elsewhere my friends.
