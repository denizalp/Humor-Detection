As legit as a consignment store gets. Takes phone orders, maintains an active Instagram account with posts of all of their new acquisitions, and has a tremendous selection in-store. \n\nCountless times have I seen them receive some really awesome looking and\/or rare pieces. They get everything from basics to designer clothes, shoes, and accessories, although it really varies from time to time. The best part? All of the prices are CRAZY cheap! Normally a $100 shirt? Find it there in 9\/10 condition for $40.\n\nStay well-dressed. Keep your eyes peeled for new pieces in your wardrobe.
