WWC is our weekly hangout. A friend bought his house nearby specifically because it's within stumbling distance of a bar. This bar.\n\nI've been here probably 30 times in the last six months, usually on Tuesday night when they have their \"buy a dozen, get a dozen free\" special. (It's also good on the \"buy 8, get 8 free\"!) Clue: the specials are not available to go, but you can have them delivered to your table and immediately ask for a box. Beer specials are usually a choice of one or two different bottled beers for a discount and maybe a special draft. Tuesday has been $2.50 Corona\/Corona Light night for at least six months.\n\nThe wings are very good. Meaty and well cooked with enough sauce (choose from 33 different sauces from \"virgin\" all the way up to \"Braveheart\"). \"Boss\" is my favorite. They recently introduced a new menu with more pub grub items like quesadillas and different burgers, even ribs. Trust me, you want to stick to the wings.\n\nAs said elsewhere, parking is a bit of a pain if you get there during peak hours. Don't park in front of the nail salon or the dry cleaners when they're open - they will tow you quickly. There's a lot across the street. And yes, the bathrooms can sometimes get a little out of hand. This is one of those times it's good to be a dude. ;-)\n\nEvery so often, they have a live band. Sometimes they're pretty good. Most of the time, however, they are entirely too loud. I know I'm old, but I'm not that old. I am here to hang out with friends and eat chicken and drink beer. Not shout at them. It was so overpoweringly loud once, I had to write my order on a napkin for the waitress. Maybe the management will get a clue and notice how the place empties out when the noise begins.
