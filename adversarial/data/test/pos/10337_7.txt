I have had this hotel on my list of places to stay since it opened it doors. I've made my way up and down the strip 5 stars and finally had occasion to stay here. \n\nI had a one bedroom suite for a few nights with a view of the Bellagio fountain and the north side of the strip. The room was huge, with a sectional, 2 large TV's, kitchenette, 2 person tub, mini library, and 2 sinks. Large balcony with a patio loveseat to just come out and relax on. Lucky me, someone at the front desk hooked me up with an upgrade.\n\nOne day I decided to go to the boulevard pool. It is barely pool, mostly Astroturf and seats. The bamboo pool was closed so I went to the pool at Marquee, which was hilarious. Apparently you can't get even a seat without $150 of bottle service, but you sit at the bar for free. NO ONE WAS THERE. They were hyping buying a seat all the way up the elevator and no one was at the pool! AHAHAHAHAHA. I walked out really quick.\n\nFood selection here is ok, but not as good as other properties. If the two popular venues here are the chandelier bar and the secret pizza place, there's a problem. \n\nThis hotel gets 4 stars for being hot stuff, and not 5 because I didn't appreciate the hookers outside my door at 4am bitching about how cheap the guy next door was. Hello security? They don't let riff raff like that troll the halls at the Wynn.
