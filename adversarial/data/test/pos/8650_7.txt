First, I'm really not a fan of cupcakes, but I occasionally make an exception for these guys. That should encourage you to go :-D\n\nI've been to both locations and the only noticeable difference between them is the size. The St. Sulpice location is somewhat bigger and offers a few tables while the University location is quite small. I don't remember seeing any tables there, but one reviewer said they had some.  \n\nLes Glaceurs' cupcakes are SUPER moist and they're generous with the icing (perhaps TOO generous, lol!). The cake portion isn't overly sweet, likely because the 2-inches of icing takes care of any sugar craving you might have. My favorite is the Red Velvet - I love the cream cheese icing. Mmmm! \n\nThey also offer a gluten-free version of the Red Velvet cupcake, which is great - but  the downside is that they keep these frozen and it takes one hour to bake them. So... if you're in the mood for a gluten-free cupcake, don't expect to pick it up and go. You'll have to wait an hour.  They also make custom (beautiful!) cupcakes for special events, so look them up if you want something different for your party\/ conference\/ wedding - whatever!
