I came by here from reading Yelp reviews and saw the Lobster Enchilada Special! I wasn't too hungry but needed some food in my system before a show.\n\nI never had lobster enchiladas but it was amazing! They also had a habanero sauce which made the enchiladas taste much better! They also have happy hour from 3pm-6pm which would help quench your thirst. \n\nI would definitely come back here for food when I'm in the area. You would have to order and pay prior to sitting but it all works out.
