This was my first time going with the boyfriend and my my my! how I loved thee. I had gone when they had just opened, I believe they had been open for 3-4 days? The moment we walked into the door, we were greet by a really nice young lady who greeted us to the table. She explained the menu and the daily specials. The specials were kind of far away for where we were sitting so we took a picture so we could go over it in our seats. Everything on the menu looked so good so it was kind of hard deciding what we wanted!\n\nWe opted for all three oysters they had at the time. The prices for all three differed by maybe 50 cents so we wanted four of everything. All I remember is that the $2 oysters being too salty for our tastes. So after tasting all of them, we decided to get three more each of the other two that we had liked. We love oysters!!\n\nFor the main dish, the boyfriend got kimchi fried rice and I had gotten the steak with miso hollandaise sauce. For being a Korean person, I am usually picky with the kimci fried rice but I have got to say, it did taste really yummy!! There were even two slices of pork belly in it which was different but I loved it! Also, the waitress had said she had actually made the kimchi herself which I thought was really awesome. Home made kimchi for the restaurant! The steak I had gotten came with the miso hollandaise sauce and it was sooooooooooooo good! I was literally licking the sauce off of the plate due to the deliciousness. It had also come with thin waffle fries that also tasted really good with the sauce. \n\nFor dessert, we had gotten the pot de la cr√®me and holy shiznits! it was sooooo good. I wanted to get another one but we decided we would get too fat haha It comes in a cute little jar that looks like its meant for candles. IT. WAS. SO. GOOD.\n\nAll in all, the atmosphere of the restaurant was also really cute. It reminded me of New Orleans or San Diego kinda, the ambience of it all. The chef\/owner? of the restaurant had also come over to ask us how we were doing and asked us what we thought.\n\nI would definitely come here again!!!! maybe 2-3 times a month, yeah! that often!
