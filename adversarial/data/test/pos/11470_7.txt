Look, to me a movie theatre is a movie theatre.  I just want to go out and see a movie on a big screen.  That's it.  So I really resent the hidden $2.00 fee they charge for \"service.\"  I only go to sundance if I have no choice.  AND WTF is with assigned seating?  \n\nI get the fact that in the netflix era you have to try and do something special to make people go out to the movies.  Adding a starbucks style cafe is not going to cut it.  \n\nThe first time I was here a guy came out and introduced the movie.  What the fuck.  If I want to know about a movie, I'll read about it before I go.
