Girls, this is the only show on the strip you need to see. Be prepared, you may be pulled on stage for a lap dance, or to fake an orgasm. You never know. I always sit at the up front tables when I go, the men walk out on them as they strip. Whew. There is a not a bad seat in the house though, as the boys make use of every area of the room. Great for girls night out, birthdays, bachelorette parties I have seen guys in there with their girlfriends....The dances are pretty routine, but not so much as it's portrayed in Magic Mike haha. Cheesy as the dancing may be, it sure does please the ladies. Don't focus too much on a \"good show,\" - focus on the men. That's what it is for. You think men go to strip clubs to judge their dancing? No. Watch those bodies ladies, whew. The way the guys look at you with just that desire in their eyes is all you need girls! The interaction they make with the audience is intense!\n\nThe first time I went they pulled this like 70 year old lady on stage who could barely walk - she was ALL OVER those boys having the time of her life! It was hilarious! I've been pulled up twice, one time just got a lap dance, the other had to fake an orgasm which was SO fun (don't judge me) they said I can pick a guy and touch all I want, just fake it the best I can. Marty, you are mine sir. Hot damn!
