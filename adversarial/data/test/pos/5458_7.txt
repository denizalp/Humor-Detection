All things in moderation is not too bad for you, so I use to go there once a month - at best. I can't afford all the calories a homemade cheeseburger and onion rings can put on the old spare tire.\nBurger Shack has been around all my life. They even opened one up, near where I grew up, but that one closed a loooooog time ago.\nThe homemade burgers are pretty good. The fries are standard stuff you get at a burger joint but the over-sized onion rings are very good. Again, it will clog your arteries if you have them on a regular basis. Lucky for me, I only can get there when I go downtown for meetings or I might be having a quadruple bypass. The souvlaki is a good choice too.
