Okay, so the ambience is lovely, and the drinks are superb, and there is a fuckload of meat on offer, all of which seems like it should mean that I absolutely loved this place.  And I'm not sure why I didn't, except that I was turned off by the nickel-and-diming: you can get a charcuterie plate, sure, but it doesn't come with bread or olives or cheese--if you want any of those, you have to order it separately.  And maybe it's just because charcuterie is everywhere right now, but there wasn't anything about Black Hoof's that stood out.\n\nStill, the service was fantastic and the pickled octopus was absolutely delicious, so I don't regret the meal by any means.  Just, I probably won't bother to go back.
