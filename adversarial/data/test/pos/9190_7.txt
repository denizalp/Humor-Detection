I never really craved Fried Chicken, back when I was a West Coast, health conscious gal. That is until I discovered the spicy, crispy, juicy goodness of Bojangles fried chicken. \n\nThey don't have these out west, so I didn't know what to expect. There is almost always a well-valued special. This location is very clean and looks relatively new. \n\nFirst off, I never expect bright-eyed, smiling service at fast food places, but this Bojangles was a pleasant surprise. Ever-so polite, prompt and friendly, the staff at the counter, managers in the kitchen and the folks at the to go window are always cheerful. There is definitely something to be said for the management at this location or region. It's not uncommon to see a manager walk out to deliver food to a table, drop bo-rounds into a fryer or set the pace. \n\nThe food here is dependable, usually pretty fresh and a bargain. They also have Wi-fi here which is pretty cool. Breakfast is awesome, bo-rounds are irresistible, and chicken is spicy. It will satisfy your fried chicken craving and have you licking your fingers and picking at the bones. What more could you ask?
