This is my response to Roman Y's very rude comment on my original review: \n\nTrust me Roman, you can't make this stuff up. I assure you, I am not a competitor. I'm a mom, and a foodie. I do know a lot about customer service though. I have worked in the service industry for years, and both of my experiences at Vogue were textbook examples of what NOT to do. \n\nExactly what would be my motivation for making up a review? Isn't the point of Yelp to learn reviews from the customers? In a way, it's kind of like having secret shoppers. \n\nFurthermore, if you don't want to hear reviews about your restaurant, don't put yourself out there. A smart business owner uses criticism to improve their business. This is just another example of making excuses instead of just fixing the problems. No restaurant can be perfect all the time, but when those problems are brought to your attention, you, as the owner should go out of your way to make it right, not give me a long story about how it's not your fault, and there's nothing you can do about it. I'm willing to forgive a lot when a manager or owner makes a sincere effort to correct, and then go the extra mile to retain my business. \n\nThe bottom line is, I WANTED to like this place. I was excited for the opening. Our first visit was the week of the opening so I figured that was why we had such a crazy bad experience (it's still no excuse). But when we decided to give it a second chance several months later, and it was still terrible, I was very disappointed. You can get on here and call me a liar if you like, Roman. But, it will not make your restaurant better, and it will not change the fact that I had two memorably bad experiences which I have told to everyone I know.
