This truck is really good. I don't care what the syrups are made of it tastes damn good and it reminds me of the sno-cones I grew up enjoying at Dodgers games. They have tons of flavors so there is something for everyone. I had one with strawberry and cherry and it really hit the spot after a long and hot summer day. You can follow them on social media to find out what the flavors of the day are and don't forget to ask about the bogo card. When looking for them they are usually parked on the camino al norte side near the gas station.
