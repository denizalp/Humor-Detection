Part hipster cocktail joint, part fine dining, part rigger bar. I'm as confused as a roughneck's sleep schedule by you in some ways, but in other ways I quite like you. One thing's for sure, your gin cocktails are a damn fine way to celebrate some time away from the oil patch.\n\nLet's go with \"hipster cocktail bar with the intent of attracting oil and gas workers.\" A few years ago? Brilliant. With today's oil prices... Well, let's just hope everyone is still at the bar for happy reasons.\n\nIt's an upscale casual joint that you would feel comfortable hitting up after work while still rocking the suit. But let's face it if you're an oil & gas exec you probably live in that thing.\nIt also seems like a lot of guys are comfortable hanging out here in their Carharts too. But let's face it, if you're on the operations side you probably live in those too.\n\nSlogan -  DERRICK Gin Mill: The OGs of O&G. That's for you. You can have it.\n\nDrinks - Kickass cocktail creation with a heavy gin influence. I was really infatuated with a liquorice Negroni. Sweet, with a bunch of liquorice bitter and some nice gin bite. If you like your classic cocktails, go here. \n\nI also wrapped my lips around \"The Roughneck's Old Lady\". Shh, don't tell. She's topped with a cointreau foam. Fluffy orange deliciousness.\n\nThe beer selection is more what I'd suspect for an oil and gas bar. Craft cocktails, sure, but nothing but the big name beers. Maybe for that one guy in your group who just won't jive with the adventurous cocktail scene? If you won't order gin at a gin mill, you're probably just going to order a Budweiser anyway. It makes sense to me.\n\nTheir menu throws yet another curve ball. It's traditional Alberta in some ways but with a healthy dose of unexpected. They don't follow in the Gastropub ways that Calgary has become accustomed to, but instead looks to be a little more... fine dining? Yeah, fine dining. Like a mix of Alberta roots and fine french cuisine. I'd like to go back and see what it tastes like. You've piqued and puzzled my interest, DERRICK. I'll see you again.
