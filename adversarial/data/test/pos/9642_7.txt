A little ways off the Stonecrest stretch lies the Camfield Corners shopping center. Given that this strip mall isn't as traveled, I was surprised to find such a well regarded Deli next to Bi-Lo. With little knowledge about the best around here, I decided to give Katz a go for lunch.\n\nFirst thoughts of the restaurant was a rendition of a classic NY-Style Deli. Not much in the decor but clean and straightforward. They have a big case with deli meats and salads (the starchy one's like potato, pasta, tuna, etc) and a huge menu full of all kinds of sandwiches, burgers, and catering options.\n\nI'm a simple guy: I see \"Charlotte's Best Reuben\" on the menu, I order the Reuben. Food came out quickly with a side of Potato Salad and the open-faced sandwich was HUGE. I cut the thing in half only to be slightly disappointed. For $13, I expected a lot more corned beef than what I got. The meat was topped with the sauerkraut and cheese as if to almost conceal the meat, the sandwich was more 40% kraut, 40% cheese, 20% meat.\n\nEverything about the sandwich on it's own was good. Fresh kraut, quality beef, nice rye bread, and soft, mellow cheese. It just seemed like proportionally it was off and the value really wasn't there. I would argue that the \"Charlotte's Best\" title wasn't well defended today.\n\nIf I'm ever back in the neighborhood, I'd give something else a try. It appears that everything is a bit on the pricier side, the lady in front of me paid 8 DOLLARS for one slice of cheesecake (granted it was a very large slice, but still!). They keep a lot of typically unseen items on the menu like chopped liver and whitefish so I would come back for something new.
