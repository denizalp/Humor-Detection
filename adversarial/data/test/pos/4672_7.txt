I've only been here after 2 AM, and it's always been a flaming trainwreck of an experience.\n\nI've had to figure out if the waitresses were doing this as a halfway house job, I've had staff members not apologize while picking pieces of steel wool and green plastic scrubber out of my food, and I've witnessed an armed robbery.  The food is decent, for the hours they're open.  \n\nTry Tom's Diner or Eat 'n Park instead.  Heck, go to a grocery store instead.
