These donuts are the best ever!   I don't care if they shorten my life 5 minutes...it's worth it!  You can taste every light and creamy, fluffy layer when you bite down into a chocolate long john...with just the right amount of delightful chocolate on top!   Try a buttermilk bar...crispy on the outside lite and tasty in the middle...there are no better in this town!  O boy do I want one right now!
