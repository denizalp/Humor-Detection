I'll admit that I don't entirely remember the whole night at XS, but if, no WHEN, I go back to Vegas, I will definitely be hitting XS up again. It's probably my favorite club that I've been to in Las Vegas.\n\nMy girl friend and I paid a little extra and skipped a rather long line since it was on the night of a MGM fight, and the place was packed. As I walked in, I remember that the decorum was amazing. I'd love to go back and photograph it since there was (thankfully) no photographic evidence of our sisterly debauchery that particular night.\n\nWhile the drinks are pricey, the decor, the vibe, and the crowd make up for it all - even the cover fee. Most people are in their early 20's to 30's and it's a rather classy place. The outdoor area by the pool was chilly in mid-December, but toss back a large shot (or 6) of Grey Goose and you're all set! \n\nXS embodies all that Vegas should be. And more.
