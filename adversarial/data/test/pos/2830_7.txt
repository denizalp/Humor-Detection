During my recent two-pronged stay in Calgary, I stopped in at Map Town twice. Digital products are fine, but there's nothing like a paper map between my fingers as I try to figure out where I've been and what directions I wish to go. I left with maps of Fort McMurray, Vancouver Island, Iceland, Northern Italy, and El Camino de Santiago. I look forward to giving them the analog workout that they deserve.
