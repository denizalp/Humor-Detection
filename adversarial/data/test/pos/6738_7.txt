In case you're thinking about heading here for tempura (I realize that is not likely...but just in case), I wouldn't recommend. However, their name is Go Wild Sushi, not Go Wild Tempura, so I won't totally discount their offerings. The restaurant is spacious and an unexpected beauty. And, I appreciate the gigantic projection for catching Sunday football or some other can't miss programming. The service was also friendly. However, the tempura shrimp were baby food soft, and the vegetables didn't have quite the crisp you expect of tempura. Was it a poor ordering choice on my part? Perhaps, but still, shouldn't a girl be able to get some fine fried items on a cloudy afternoon?
