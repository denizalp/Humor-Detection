Vegas is all about bling and flash.  Even when you're traveling for business.  Who wants to roll down Las Vegas Blvd in a crappy mid-sized boring car when there are so many hot cars just sitting, waiting, practically begging to be driven in the Hertz rental car area?  Not me, I say.\n\nTime to turn on the feminine charm.  Aka, flirt my ass off and pray for an upgrade.\n\nOctavio, my little rental car angel was working the desk in the Gold Club pick up space this week.  A few bats of my eyelashes later, and I was cruising out of the airport in a new Mustang... at the cost of a mid-sized sedan.  Hot.  And fast.  And kind of awesome.  I heart you, Hertz... and especially you, Octavio.  *kisses!*
