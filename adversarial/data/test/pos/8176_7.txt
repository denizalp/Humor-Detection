Um, this airport sucks, okay? Avoid at all costs. \nI flew through here two times last week. Both coming and going we experienced hour-long runway delays. Seriously. When landing, we had to chill out someplace random b\/c another plane was at our gate unexpectedly. And then there was no skybridge. And then we had to circle around a few times because the airport gods grew tired of us sitting and waiting. Then, both times we took off (heading to and from Tally), we had to wait, stacked up on the runway, for 45 - 60 minutes. Case in point, the pilot actually told us excitedly once we were NINTH for departure. Unless CLT is your home, fly through ATL.
