I was in the market to find a new nail salon in Las Vegas.  I recently met up with a friend and LOVED her nails when I saw them and so she recommended I try Diamond Nails and Spa.  She also said she had a fabulous massage while she was there.  \nI stopped by today just for a gel polish change.  I recently tore one of my nails and my purse yanked majority of the rest if it off since the tear wasn't enough lol.  \nI had a nail tip done that fixed the problem right up and I LOVE my nails--service was quick as well which is always nice when you're out running errands already.  I will definitely make this my new go to place for nails, thanks again!(:
