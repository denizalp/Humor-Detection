I was going to buy an Omega Speedmaster Pro today, I went to the European Jewellery in Eaton Centre not for browsing or asking random questions; I was the real buyer! However, I left the store after a few minutes because I couldn't bear their ridiculously arrogant attitude.\n\nI've just found all these poor reviews on Yelp and I'm happy I didn't buy anything there .
