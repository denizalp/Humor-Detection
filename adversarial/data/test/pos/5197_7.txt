Although I wasn't wowed by Hot Beans - this new spot by the same people really impressed me. \n\nThe space was bright and clean - something I'm sure that took a lot converting it from whatever pile of garbage was there before it and full of young, semi groomed and tattooed people. \n\nI opted for the sausage vegan sliders on biscuits with mushroom gravy and a pile of fries. The gravy was delicious - as was the rest of the plate. It was as good as meat filled food (fyi vegans: meat filled food tastes pretty good). \n\nI sampled the collared greens as well - they tasted like...thanksgiving dinner. I'm not sure why that is. But they did. Next time I'll go for a big plate of those, too. The bigger mains go for about $12. The restaurant is cash only but there is an ATM.\n\nPleasant! I felt like I was eating unhealthy vegan food. Very satisfying.
