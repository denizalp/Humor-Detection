I stayed here for a few weeks while I was starting a new job in southern Nevada and in the process of moving to Las Vegas.\n\nThis place was the nicest of all the extended stay properties that I stayed at.  It's not perfect... it is an extended stay facility after all.  \n\nI did find the room size adequate for myself.  When the wife and kids came to visit it got crowded fast.  The bed was comfortable and the kitchen was okay.  The staff was friendly.  The location is great... right off the freeway and close to the Strip.\n\nThe pool wasn't bad.  The best part was watching couples make out in the pool.  I'd sit on the third floor balcony and just watch the nightly action in the pool.  Who need pay-per-view porn when it's happening right there in your pool.  Seriously, it happened almost every night.  Luckly there is enough chlorine in the pool to melt your eyes to (hopefully) kill all the nasties.  Plus I'm a bit of a sick bastard and didn't mind jumping into the water.\n\nI'd stay here again if I was between places.
