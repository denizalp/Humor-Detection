The place has such potential to be awesome, but the staff is and will continue to be the reason this place with never be anything better than mediocre.\n\nThe service is so slow, I could place a drink order here, probably run across the street to a different bar order and finish my drink, all before my drink is even ready. \nThe waitresses like to add in their own tip or charge you for things you didn't order.\n\nSecurity, someone please tell me why I have to get a stamp EVERY TIME I go in and out of this bar. Isn't one stamp suppose to show that I've already been in and I'm good for re-entry? Also why are the \"doorman's\" there so RUDE? \n\nDo yourself a favor and head down to Gold Spike on Freemont, way better atmosphere.
