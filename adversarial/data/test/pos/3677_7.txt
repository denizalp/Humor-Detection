Horrible service. The first time we ordered delivery from Joey's our food arrived on time and was very tasty. Pizza was excellent. We felt we had found our new pizza joint after just moving to this side of town. \n\nThe next time we ordered, we waited over an hour to be notified that they were \"out of pizza.\" Waitwaitwait. Lemme get this straight. Joey's Pizza...is out...of pizza?? K.\n\nTonight we decided to give them another shot. Hopefully they've restocked. This time we were told, \"Oh, you're going to have to find someone else, we don't deliver that far.\" *click* That far?? Call me unreasonable, but after double checking on Google Maps, we live 2.77 miles away...not to mention they'd delivered to us before! What gives Joey's?!\n\nWe loved the food, but after these two lame experiences we're kinda just over it.
