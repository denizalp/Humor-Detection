Hands down the best buffet in all of Vegas and I've been to them all countless times over the years.  The only other buffet that comes close is at the Bellagio, but the Wynn's is better.  Rio is great too, but the Wynn serves a considerably higher level of cuisine.\n\nNormal dinner is $35.95 and I saw that on Fri\/Sat nights, dinner is $38.95.  I've had the dinner buffet here before and it was fantastic, but this time, I hit it for lunch and it was only $22.95.  The selection is not all that different from lunch to dinner and at that price, is just a few dollars more than a buffet at a place like Harrah's.  If you go for lunch, you can have the very best and it won't cost much at all, now that's true value.  Quality and selection-wise, there is just no comparison and with the exception of the Bellagio, nothing else comes close.\n\nI'm not even going to begin to describe all the incredible items that I saw and enjoyed.  One of my favorite regular items in their selection is the smoked salmon.  That's the first thing I go for every time.  Yikes, I must have eaten the price of admission in smoked salmon alone! :)  Even their dessert selection is downright astounding...all I can say is highly, highly recommended!\n\nIf you do only one buffet in Vegas, this is the one.  When I die, heaven better look like this!  Long live the king.
