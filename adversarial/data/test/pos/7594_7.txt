Updating this review for the same awesome guy that did a smog check for Silvie, my 2007 Toyota Corolla, last year. This year is because I appreciated his honesty when he noticed how low my mileage was. \nI honestly didn't get an e-mail notification through MyDMV about a registration renewal with information (e.g. smog check required), and they don't send posted mail if people have a MyDMV account. Checked the DMVNV website, which clearly stated that smog\/emissions checks are required for annual registration renewals. So yeah... Thought I needed a smog check for my first registration renewal, since I got Snow (2017 Kia Soul) last summer. Nope!\nThis dude was like: \"Hey, let me ask you something: did you get this brand new last year? With zero miles on it?\"\n\"Yeah, why? What's up?\"\n\"You don't need a smog check. The DMV should be more clear with registration renewals, but you're covered for the first registration like when you bought new, and the first registration renewal. I'll just see you next year.\" \nMind blown! Seriously, how often do you come across honest guys like this? Sure enough, I just renewed my registration online with no hiccup. Since he didn't even want to charge me for a tip, I'm leaving him a review. Liked him for his honesty and friendliness that I've seen every year I go, even if it's once a year, and the convenient spot (uncrowded business plaza). Hope to see him again next year, or in August when my fianc√© needs to renew his tags.
