After a sweaty yoga class I decided to treat myself to a healthy meal at Kaleidoscope Juice! It's a cute juice bar located in Old Town and its such a happy place! The staff is amazingly friendly and totally stoked to give you suggestions on what to order. I got an açaí bowl and revive juice shot to boost my immunity since I've been traveling. The açaí bowl was filling in the best way possible and I appreciated that I was able to get a protein and greens boost in it as well. The revive shot was spicy but I definitely felt awake after I chugged it down!\n\nIf you're looking for cute yoga gear, jewelry or fun gifts for a fellow spirit junkie, you'll love the assortment of retail in the space as well. So many things to love about Kaleidoscope and I will definitely be back away soon!
