Great name, friendly folks, and my favorite spot for framing in the city considering the quick turnaround and frequent bargains.  Not really 'crafty' as those genes clearly surpassed me and went to my sister, these folks have always been helpful with the limited things I need and although the congested aisles really affect my ADD its something I easily get over considering the quality for the price.
