Happy hour at BJ's Restaurant Brewhouse is worth a look!\n\nOffered on Mondays through Fridays from 3 pm to 7 pm, and reverse happy hour on Sundays through Thursdays from 10 pm to closing.\n\n$1 off all Draft Beer and Cocktails\nHalf off all Mini Pizzas\n$2 off all appetizers (BJ's Snacks & Small Bites not included)\n\nYou can only take advantage of their happy hour in the bar area - so cozy up to the booth or the high tables!\n\nFor our party of three, we shared three flatbreads and we enjoyed them all!\n\n* Fresh Basil with Italian Sausage \"Mozzarella, Fontina and Parmesan cheeses, fresh basil with a hint of oregano, sliced Roma tomatoes and a touch of Italian sausage.\" ($8.95)\n\n* California Club \"Grilled chicken, crisp Applewood smoked bacon, tomatoes and mozzarella cheese.  Drizzled with roasted garlic aioli and topped with fresh diced avocado.\" ($8.95)\n\n* Grilled Chicken Pesto \"Basil pesto sauce drizzled over mozzarella and fresh Parmesan cheeses then topped with grilled chicken, red onions and sun-dried tomatoes.\" ($8.95)\n\nI can't remember which one was my favorite, but I know we were impressed by all of them and happily finished them.\n\nI also enjoyed their Double Berry (10 oz) \"Berry Burst Cider & Lindeman's Framboise\" ($5.95), which is part of the HH. \n\nIt definitely gets packed though during these hours, so get in there early.  We barely got up from our booth when another party was happy to take it over. \n\nIt's a busy restaurant with means the noise level is high and parking can be challenging.
