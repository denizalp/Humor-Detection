Generally a bad experience.  Waitress cleaned the table by wiping her hand across it.  Quick order of food took a long time, waiting for the cheque also took a long time.  Drunken patrons at bar swearing loudly and the management did nothing.  Nachos were stale.  Overall a dirty, low class place, and I will never go back.  Don't be fooled thinking this is like other English pubs, like the Firkin franchise!  \n\nUPDATE:  I just discovered that they tried to put through a second charge on my credit card bill.  AVOID THIS PLACE, AND IF YOU HAVE TO GO, PAY BY CASH!
