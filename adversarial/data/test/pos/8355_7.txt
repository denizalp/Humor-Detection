Brows too thick? Need some weed whacking?!\n\nWELL, the secret is OUT! The amazing owners of Fabulous Eyebrow Threading present...the north location! This location can be found right next to the garden center of Walmart at 215&Decatur! There is a string of stores there now that everyone is now able to access!\n\nLet me just welcome North LV to one of the best brow services in town! Mearcy has stationed one of her best threaders at this new location! I brought my parents in for their secret Grand Opening today, for which they made all of us look beautiful for free :) Seriously, she fixed my uneven brows and made them look more....hot. Ha! I am crazy happy that there is one closer to me now!!!! \n\nFine, fine, in being honest, I have been going to this threading business for a year now and it's really the only place that I let touch my brows. they really know eyebrows, more than any of their other services offered. \n\nwhen it comes to beauty, people need to find businesses they can trust, it can be a hard road to find the right one. but FET is really knowledgable.\n\nThe crew that works here are patient, funny, and professional! Not to mention they use -organic- thread so that it doesn't irritate or hurt your skin as much :D Remember that it is a beauty place, so if you want something very specific with your service..VOICE your opinion! Don't be afraid!\n\nSo let the WORLD know, there is a new threading place in the North, and it's super reliable!!! (You can look up their other location). \n\nNot to mention, their brow service is cheap and only $10!!! \n\nSPECIAL DEAL: I asked the owner if they were having more free events and he said, no, but for their Grand Opening month of March, they are doing a first time, $5 eyebrow threading special!!!! you have to present a flyer. So wander in and come out looking sexy!!!\n\nSeriously, I'm trying to honestly help you all out because beauty doesn't usually come this cheap for a great job.
