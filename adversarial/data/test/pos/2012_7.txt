The Beer House, its English translation from Beerhaus (which you probably figured out) is much more than a house but a temple dedicated to the art of beer. Beer, beer, beer is my thing. You could invite me to any party in the desert with no water but as long as there is plenty of beer I am there. The bar\/restaurant is located in the newly opened area known as \"The Park\" set between the NYNY hotel and the Monte Carlo. If you do not make it to the beerhaus you should at least walk around the area. Everything is nice and new. If you are walking from the strip just head west between the 2 hotels when you see a wide opening. I only visited the area at night so I do not know what it is like during the day. \n\nStopped in after catching One at the Mandalay Bay and wanted to get me some nice cold brews. The place has a nice open feel. If you have been to a Wurstkuche or Wursthaus it has the same concept. You order your beers one place and food at a different stand. It was close to midnight when we arrived and they had a reverse happy hour going with the food items at $4\/each. Beer wasn't too expensive. I went with 2 different flights at $12 each just to sample a variety of beers. I was surprised to see the number of Vegas brews they had available. There some good stuff here. The food was okay. I ordered a brat and some fries with cheese. The brat was the better deal. I was a little confused with the food order because they gave me a light up buzzer but told me they would bring out the order but I told them how would they know where I was sitting. After the server walked around for a bit she was able to locate me. \n\nThey have live music going. The band likes to have fun with the crowd. Mainly playing some 90s-current alternative\/pop\/country. There are plenty of table games outside and jenga inside. You can write all the inappropriate messages on the blocks and nobody cares. HAHA! Staff was very nice and the customers were very friendly. I will definitely make this a regular stop when in town. Happy drinking!
