To begin with I don't really mind paying 6.50 for a well poured Guiness and the gent behind the bar pours the best pint I have had since I was in Dublin.  According to the bartenders in Ireland the foam should be just as wide as a bishops collar and the pour here is spot on.  5 stars for the beer.  I have not tried the food so I can't comment on that.  Why did I take two stars away?  Apparently the owner enjoys his Guiness.....a lot.....at the bar.....drunk.  No no no no no.  It ruined the evening.  Loud, obnoxious, and drunk.  I will be back, but I won't step in the door if he is there again.
