My overall experience at Divine Eatery would better be described as deserving 3.5 stars, but what the hey, right? Located up in North NORTH town up in the quiet community of Providence, Divine Eatery is situated right in front of an apartment complex and a smattering of mostly local businesses. \n\nVEGGIE BURRITO ($10.95): Kind of pricey for a breakfast burrito, especially because there's no side! I wish there was more potatoes and that they were crispier. If there's such a thing as scrambled eggs being too moist, yup, that happened. The burrito was just okay. I would order something different next time - maybe pancakes! 3\/5\n\nSTEAK MELT SANDWICH ($10.95): My husband opted for lunch instead. He LOVED his sandwich and raved that the meat was \"the good stuff\", i.e., not fatty. He also upgraded the fries to garlic fries for an extra $1. The fries were great! Super fresh! 4.5\/5\n\nSERVICE: The server was pleasant and the chef\/owner was warm and friendly. Even though we came in 30 minutes before closing, the server didn't rush us at all and told us to take our time. Our server also sent us off with a to-go cup of a fountain drink ($2). Thanks! Cuz we thirsty! The chef chatted with us and told us how she used to work in the casinos and opened up her own restaurant for a more ideal work schedule. 4\/5\n\nATMOSPHERE: Tables and chairs are mismatched and the cafe is pretty small. The walls are lined with artwork from local artists available for purchase. Music (from the chef's Ipod?) plays in the background. 3\/5   \n\nReturn Visit?\nI'd come back sometime in the future. \n\nPRO TIP: There's a BOGO entree coupon for Divine Eatery in those Entertainment Books for 2015.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #31
