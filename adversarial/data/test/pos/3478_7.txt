Just for those of you who think of visiting this place... \n\nhttp:\/\/www.ktnv.com\/dirtydining\/155848485.html\n\nThis place has been listed on Dirty Dining (a Las Vegas news segment) back in May of this year for having 40 demerit points, which is one point from being shut down in Las Vegas.\n\nI don't know about you, but if a restaurant is EVER featured on a show like this for the same reasons that HAG was, it's pretty much dead to me. They can claim to have changed, but from what I see anytime I want past the place, it hasn't...\n\nBeware!
