I come in and say \"Hey there, I am looking for a lid switch for a whirlpool ultimate care II. Do you guys have that?\"\n\nLady at the desk says \"I can't do anything without a model number. I think it's so funny when guys come in thinking they're all cool acting like they know about stuff with a model name.\"\n\n\"Oh, okay. Well I don't think I'm cool, but whatever. I'll call someone at the house and get the model number.\"\n\nI come back in within a few minutes and give her the model number. \n\nShe starts looking up the part for me, and says \"so does that make sense to you now?\" \n\nYeah, it makes sense why you have so many terrible reviews. No wonder everyone hates you. Maybe you shouldn't degrade your customers intelligence for no reason at all.
