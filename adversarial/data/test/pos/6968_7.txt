My nails look great... Don't get me wrong. But for a simple shellac mani pedi... I don't think it should've been $70. After tip, $84. \n\nMaybe I should've looked at the prices before coming here. The place itself is very nice and the nail techs definitely take their time on you. Lynn did a great job on my nails.
