New York New York Las Vegas, quite fittingly, gets the dubious honor of having the first Shake Shack on the west coast.  I was looking forward to its opening for a long time and when I finally came by to visit for a late night Shack Stack, it almost brought me back the memories of having my first one two years ago at the original Madison Square Park location.\n\nThe location does a good job of recreating the look of the original location with its outdoor seating area.  I think once construction in the area is complete, it'll look like a great homage to the original.  The restaurant inside is very spacious with plenty of tables and seats and I like how the decor includes some Vegas-like elements to keep the location original.\n\nWhen I came by at around 10pm the place was pretty busy but fortunately the line to order was really short.  I ordered my Shack Stack and it was ready for me in matter of minutes.\n\nShack Stack -- http:\/\/bit.ly\/1RiEX3F\nCheeseburger and a 'Shroom Burger topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce\nSeriously, this burger is heaven with the burger and the gooey cheese stuffed fried mushroom.  Although this Shack Stack wasn't built as well as others I've had in the past (the burger was sliding over to the side), it's really a minor flaw to what was pretty much a tasty burger.\n\nLas Vegas also currently has the dubious honor being the only city in the United States to have both Shake Shack and In-N-Out Burger.  For me, I can't say which is better.  To me, they can both co-exist because they both have different menus and ingredients.  Shake Shack is a long awaited welcome addition to the Strip and I'm glad they're open late so you can stop over for a late night snack on the Strip.
