Meandering my way through all the shops, I spotted this little chocolate kiosk. Chocolate always calls to me, so I stopped to stare.  The women manning the booth was friendly and chatty. She mentioned that Vincent pilon is food network a lot. I had never heard of him, but I thought I better buy some goodies anyway. \n\nWell, the woman helping me forgot to put the box of chocolate truffles into my purchase. I was SOOOO sad when I realized later. So, I can't vouch for his candy, but I did try a cupcake, a brownie, and a chocolate candy thingy.   \n\nCupcake was awesome. Best peanut butter frosting I think I have had. Wow. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/FSeu1caOVyk3Ua_aWuVsHA?select=FlTAviwV5jhR8MkiSb-GNA\n\nWhite cupcake with coconut. Had to try 'cuz I love coconut. Nope. Dry and no coconut flavor anywhere. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/FSeu1caOVyk3Ua_aWuVsHA?select=F0MKTsUqiGCijRJ5vElyJg\n\nBrownie cookie.  Yum. Good and rich. A friend said it is too rich and choclately. What does that even mean?  How can anything be TOO rich and chocolately. So obviously, this was GOOD. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/FSeu1caOVyk3Ua_aWuVsHA?select=qZ6SQSgu97ZUH2ywQ8LtxA\n\nChocolate Crisp candy bal. Good. Nothing out of the ordinary. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/FSeu1caOVyk3Ua_aWuVsHA?select=IaFTMmAaarW1V96ZXhnyFA\n\nA solid 3.5 stars for good Peanut butter frosting and brownie cookie.
