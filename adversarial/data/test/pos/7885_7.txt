If the experience couldn't get worse. It did! I go in for my follow up to my angiogram and expect to just see the doctor and go on my way. I'm informed I have to do another EKG. They hook me all up only to tell me to take my bra off. So they have to unhook me from the machine. They did say I could have one of those crappy paper gowns, but If your a larger girl you know those things never fit! So off came my bra and I laid back down. Now during this time 3 other nurses came in and out of the room opening the door enough that anyone walking by could see in. I'd really rather not display my \"girls\" for all to see. Not to mention it's steaming hot in the room. So I'm sweating my bum off while they are telling me to relax. They obviously had none of my information from the hospital cause they asked me what the results were of my angiogram. They proceeded to ask me a lot of questions I figured they would have already had and then said the doctor would be in soon. There we waited for 20 more heat sweltering minutes until finally Dr. Chanderraj came in. \n\nI'm happy everything ended up being ok. I never want to have to come back to this location again! I hope if your reading this you don't have to go either!
