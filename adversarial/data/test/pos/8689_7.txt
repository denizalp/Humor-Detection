When in Mesa, you've got to hit up some of the best Asian restaurants in the city. \n\nWe had just walked for about 3 hours, fueled mainly on trail mix, jerky, and Cheetos (okay, so the Cheetos were all me). So we weren't going to mess around when we got in here. Premium All You Can Eat was the way to go. And we certainly ate all we could, and then dessert on top of that. \n\nI was lucky enough to have two grill masters as dining companions this Sunday evening, so my friend and I sat back and watched the many plates of ordered meat get cooked in front of us: bulgogi, pork jowl, shrimp, rib eye, spicy samgyup sal, more bulgogi... we had more, but hell if I can remember it. \n\nThe truth is, you don't need to be a grilling pro for this. It's so simple. Just toss your meat on there and flip. The servers come by often enough to check up on you. There's also a button on the wall for you to press if you're in desperate need of more bulgogi. The servers came by quite often to our table to turn up our fan and change out our hot plate. We had a great time. And all our food was so flavorful and delicious. I think the only thing we weren't completely sold on were the shrimp. Those got messy, removing the veins and shells.  \n\nFor sides, we requested bowls of rice, japchae (glass noodles), and soon dubu (tofu stew). Nothing to write home about with these, but they were just fine for sides. The tofu stew had a nice spice to it and had maybe oysters in it? Not bad. \n\nThere's a time limit of 2 hours, and at about 1.5 hours, we were slowing down. After finishing off the last of what meat was left on the plates (can't let that go to waste... oof), we ordered two coffee ice cream macarons and one vanilla. The perfect ending.
