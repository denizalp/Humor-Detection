I honestly don't know where the negative reviews are coming from in regards to the service, but more about that later. The food here is excellent, the restaurant itself is clean and modern and the service levels were excellent. They also will custom your orders too (mild, spicy, extra spicy) The bread is fresh and my favourite was the beef curry :)
