Let me just start off by saying whenever I'm hungry and have the funds to go out (which is a rare occurrence) or have friends\/family in town, I turn to PJ.\n\nNever faltering in it's deliciousness, PJ offers so many options for most eaters out there. The only kicker (which doesn't disappoint me because I don't consume it) is they don't serve any meat other than the chicken variety. So, if you're looking for a juicy steak, go elsewhere.\n\nThat said, I really think you should stay, because, day-um their food is good. When I go there, I get the usual: a Philly chicken pita (with substituted tofu) and an iced green tea. The perfect amount of food to be full but not stuffed, and an even perfect-er price. \n\nIf I'm extra hungry, or gluttonous depending on my mood, I'll add in a trio-hummus plate that is almost too good to be true. Their menu is extensive and offers a lot of Mediterranean variety. They also have banging specials every once and a while that will only make you fall deeper in love.\n\nOther than the food, 9 times out of 10 you'll get good service, and they're always willing to make exceptions\/substitutions for you, which is lovely coming from a self-proclaimed veg with a lot of veg and vegan friends\/family members.\n\nThe atmosphere is always comfortable, and with their rotating art selection, there's never a dull piece of wall to be seen.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for an excellent meal that won't break the bank, PJ is your place.\n\nP.s. They have a little known secret that I'd like to pass along to you because, as if from my dreams to real life, they do breakfast (!) on Saturdays and Sundays. AND, again as if from my brain to actual existence, they have daily happy hour from 2-4 p.m. \n\nGo. Go soon and go swiftly.\n\nThanks be to the PJ Gods.
