It's your friendly neighborhood Costco!  I wouldn't call it the smiliest Costco in town but who cares, it's a Costco and you know the drill: cheap stuff in bulk, free samples, and any trip could quite possibly end in you buying a TV.\n\nThey generally round up samples at about 5PM, with the weekends having the most variety but weekdays providing bigger portion sizes.  Saturdays and Sundays are insane.  It's Phoenix, so people don't really get the idea of crowds.  The giant carts don't necessarily help the situation either when you have people standing in the middle of an aisle, cart parked diagonally across a lane.\n\nRegardless, amazing deals, free samples, cheap food, cheap pizzas, and it's a friggin' Costco - you'll love it.
