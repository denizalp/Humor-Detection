Awesome food! Tina was quite the hostess, server, etc. She pretty much does it all and does an amazing job! It is not your typical chain restaurant, go there with an open mind and patience. It is a real pleasure to have such a personalized dining experience in the Phoenix area. We were the last table served on a Saturday night so we had the pleasure of having Tina sit and visit with us. She has such a spunky personality! It was a true delight. A quick tip, BYOB, the restaurant does not serve alcohol. Looking forward to our next visit! Wonderful night, great food, great people - thank you Tina!
