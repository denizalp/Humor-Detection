We hadn't been at Flemings in a while and they have a new happy hour menu.  I was excited about the Mushroom Farro burger, a new vegetarian option. Our food was served quickly outside in the patio, staff was very courteous and efficient.  The Farro burger looked amazing but it didn't taste great.  The mushroom patty crumbled,  fell apart as soon as l planted my utensils in it.  Moreover it was dry and starchy.  It was passable but not acceptable within the  Flemings standards l expected.
