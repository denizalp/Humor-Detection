it's like eating in your best friend's living room. so warm and inviting, the tuck shop lures you in with a very friendly atmosphere and delicious looking food. we showed up with another couple (they dont take reservations) and was told it was going to be an hour wait. we were already invested and really wanted to try out the menu, so we hunkered down at the bar and selected a couple of wines and beers and chatted it up with the bartender and other staff. bartender\/staff were super friendly and full of helpful tips about pairings or which dishes were the best. 30 min later our table was ready (under promise and over deliver!) and we were well on our way to a fantastic meal.\n\nall plates are shareable so trying a little bit of everything is recommended.  started with the cheese curds (deep fried. NOM) and the wild mushroom salad. freaking fantastic, fresh, and clean. then the lamb meatballs came out. wow... just.. now i'm thinking i have to go back and eat them as i write this review. they were incredible flavorful and not gamey at all. just perfect balls of meat served on top of \"spaghetti\" (spaghetti squash) with a marinara sauce i wanted to steal the recipe for. \n\njust an incredible experience that you should share with friends\/family\/a hot date (because you'll totally get laid)!
