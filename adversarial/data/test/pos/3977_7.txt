Yo Pretzel, Yo Pretzel Yooooo!\n\nFor realz, Go Pretzel may be my new ish!  Pretzels are one of those things that are hard to mess up, but sometimes it happens.  Too greasy, too doughy, stale.  There's a a secret technique to having a tasty little twisted dough treat.  This place has it down!\n\nI couldn't resist the Cinnamon Pretzel (although the toasted almond one will be my next conquest) with sweet glaze.  The pretzel was fantastic.  Cooked perfectly, not too doughy, but had that fresh baked taste.  It had enough sugar to coat all my fingers, which means it was just enough!  The sweet glaze is pretty much cinnamon roll icing.  It tasted a little like icing and was incredibly thick.  I may have dipped my finger in it after I was done with my pretzel. \n\nSpeaking of the end....of my pretzel.  I was sad when I finished it.  I wanted more, which is the point of having quality products.  They also had a variety of other flavors of pretzels and dipping sauces.  If you're looking for the total lunch package you can get a Pretzel Dog (a pretzel wrapped hot dog) and a dessert pretzel.  Done and done! \n\nI'm hooked!
