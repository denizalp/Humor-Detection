If I could give 0 stars to this place for their service center, I would.\n\nI've given this place two chances and each time, I've left disappointed. Go somewhere else!\n\nThe first time I went in for maintenance, I'm fairly certain that they sold all of my information to a warranty company.  I'm new to the area and very shortly after my service visit, I began receiving mail warning me that \"my warranty is about to expire!\"  While I didn't fall for it, I know that other people could.  Terrible practice.\n\nThe second time, I went in for scheduled routine maintenance on my vehicle on a Sunday afternoon.  After waiting for almost 2 and a half hours (they told me it would take 1.5 hours), I was informed that my rear brake pads had totally worn through and my brakes were now hitting the metal brake rotors which would need to be replaced.  They quoted me over $500 for this repair.  My car is 3 years old and I've never had any problems with it...no weird noises, no issues driving, nothing.  \n\nOnce I told them that I wouldn't be getting the repair done that day, the price on the brake rotor replacement went down two more times.  Hmm, sounded a little fishy to me....\n\nAfter talking to a friend, I was referred to a local auto body shop.  The shop told me that the dealership was wrong; I really had 15% left on my rear brake pads (which they didn't even suggest that I replace until my next oil change) and there was absolutely no reason to replace the brake rotors.  \n\nSo happy I trusted my gut and didn't go through with a costly repair that wasn't even needed.  This dealership is not trustworthy and I will never be returning.  Just out to make a buck...  Take your business anywhere else!
