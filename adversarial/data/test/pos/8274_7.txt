Wow.....wow, wow, wow WOW!!!! I made it back here less than two weeks after the Yelp Elite Event for a dinner with co-workers. If I come back here a million times, the view here will always leave me awestruck. There can't be a better place in The Valley to bring someone special to take their breath away.\nSince there were five of us and we love to share, we were able to sample a little of everything. We started with the scallops and duck ravioli. At the Yelp Elite Event I pretty much had a permanent spot at the scallop station so we all know how I feel about the scallops. The duck ravioli was delicious too. LOVED the appetizers.\n\nI have to say that those of us who ordered the filet mignon for our main suffered severe buyer's remorse after my co-worker shared her venison with us. The venison was tender and smoky flavored and not at all gamy tasting. Served with sweet potatoes, I am KICKING myself for not ordering the venison. I do have issues with eating animals whom I classify as lovable and beautiful so venison, along with lamb and rabbit are usually off-limits. Had I known what the venison was going to taste like, I think I would have made an exception (FORGIVE ME, BAMBI!!)\n\nMy filet mignon with horseradish crust, was not bad but especially compared to the venison seemed a bit dull. That didn't stop me from eating all of it.  I have to give them props for the bread they served because it came with a choice of mushroom truffle herb butter, arugula pesto (which was AWESOME) and the THIRD spread, which for the life of me I CAN'T remember was awesome too.....it really was a toss up between the pesto and forgotten spread.\n\nWe also enjoyed some delicious cocktails and a great bottle of malbec, and later some desert. I can only vouch for my Tahitian Vanilla Creme Brulee which was a great way to finish our meal.\n\nThe service was impeccable, although my co-worker and I were both given the lobster bisque when we ordered salad. This is hardly a tragedy though because I got to enjoy the lobster bisque too.\n\nDifferent Pointe of View is definitely a place you'd come only on a special occasion but it is, for this Yelper, one of the best fine dining options in The Valley. Just review the menu carefully and listen to your server....you don't want to be out-ordered!
