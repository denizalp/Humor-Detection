Every eight or nine years someone runs into a car I'm driving and then I have to remember how to deal with the repair and insurance rodeo.  Thankfully these folks made it as painless as possible.  A couple of weeks ago a gal ran a red light and scraped by the front of my car.  It was only a matter of inches & low speed, so the damage to my car was minimal, but it's new enough I wanted to get it fixed.  \n\nI stopped in to get an estimate and John was very thorough and was great about explaining their process.  Then Kim and I talked about dealing with the insurance company since the accident was the other driver's fault.  She has been doing this a long time and her knowledge is priceless and totally put my mind at ease.  \n\nThe day I dropped off my car they shuttled me over to Enterprise so I could pick up a rental, and then by the end of the week my car was ready.  When I picked it up, John was there to say hello and Chris did an excellent job of explaining what they did to repair my car.  And then Kim let me know everything was taken care of by the other driver's insurance company.  Thank you to Allard Collision and thank you to my fellow Yelpers for guiding me to them.  The 5-star reviews are spot on!  If someone else crashes into me in 8 or 9 years I would definitely go back to Allard.
