Being less than a hours drive away from AT&T Park and the SF Giants, I have given AT&T the title of nicest park in Baseball.\n\nUntil now.\nMy taxi dropped me off at the Robert Clemente Bridge (one of my fav pastime ball player growing up) and the view from there was gorgeous. \n\nPlenty of photo ops from across the Allegheny! First word that came out of my mouth:\nWOW. Is what I have to say about PNC. Architecturally, I believe that AT&T and PNC are pretty even. However what sets them apart is the Downtown Pittsburgh skyline and Pittsburgh FOOD!! OMG. I had TWO Prim Bros sandwiches at the game, it was soo delicious. AT&T Park has the garlic fries (which would have brought me to climax if I had that and the Prim Bros sandwich).\n\nThe game I went to, the Pirates came back from 4-1 against the Rockies and scored 10 runs in ONE inning! So I was pretty jazzed to witness that comeback!
