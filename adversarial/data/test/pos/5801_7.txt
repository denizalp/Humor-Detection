So.... I've read previous reviews for this place and was inclined to try it since I was in Rock Hill for the day running errands. \n\nMuch like Buffalo Bill in Silence of The Lambs, it's nicely tucked away in the corner of a strip mall.... small but quaint with a nice little patio. I opted for the patio since it was a beautiful day. \n\nI ordered the Cuban Sammich & water. \n\nI've never had a Cuban before,,, so I can't draw comparisons... but I wonder if the turkey should be dry like sawdust?!?\n\nIt was a relatively small portion, for my standards, but I'm a power eater... so I'll live with it. \n\nSince I'm a cheap-ass, I was somewhat disappointed in the portion\/price ratio of my sandwich:\n\n6\" long hoagie roll (cuban bread) cut diagonally and then pressed flat, no side, glass of water. ------$8.16 w\/ tax.\n\nSeemed a tad bit excessive (price wise) but I do plan on going back and trying a few different items on the menu.\n\nOverall: A good experience. The jury is still out if I like it or not but eager to go back sometime soon. The staff was very friendly and the food came out almost immediately. Cozy and warm deco inside the building. I was digging the salsa music playing in the background..... I was beginning to jam to the tunes playing but nothing is more disturbing to watch than a white boy grooving to latin music. They probably thought I was having an episode and forgot my medicine.
