My 4lb dog is scared of everything and is so timid that taking him to the groomers is as stressful to me as it is him. I made an appt. After Heather talked me through their process and treatment of my shy and fear reactive dog. She literally spent 15 minutes on the phone with me and then she called his vet to get his shot records so I didn't have to. While dropping him off he acted like a ferrel animal but they remained calm and assured me he would be fine. I told them as leaving if they could not groom him I would not be upset and to just call me. I received a call five minutes later, fearing that they could not groom him, however it was Heather calling me to tell me he was behaving so sweet and amazing! She even texted me a video! After only an hour, which says something as it usually takes hours to groom him, I picked him up. His groom was amazing. Exactly what I asked for! Now let me say, the facility is the cleanest you will ever find. So clean you can't even smell animals in there. I am also allergic to cats, extremely sensitive to animal fur and I sensed nothing upon entering there place. Will be back again! They have my future business!
