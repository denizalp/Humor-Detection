When I go to buffet's I understand that it is difficult to control quality under heat lamps and with customers constantly scooping food.  That said, when I go to  relatively new buffet at a premium hotel like Aria, I have certain expecations.  They are:\n1) Clean and organized\n2) better quality ingredients and preparation.\n3) good service from the staff.\n4) Variety\n\nSadly, the Aria buffet falls short on 3 of the 4 characteristics.  \n1) To begin, Aria is clean and organized although it uses the space poorly.  The food is categorized by food type with a round seafood section and wall hugging American, Italian and Asian sections. The Asian Section and Seafood are the focus of this buffet with several dim sum options in Asian and multiple types of mussels, both raw and drowned in broth or sauce.  \n\n2) I was very disappointed with the food quality and preparation.  The crab legs were tinier than those at asian buffets and not really worth the effort.  The muscles were varied and good and were actually the highlight but the cooked muscles were drowned in sauce and did not taste like they were properly cleaned.  The carving station had a lot of options including game hen, prime rib, flat iron steak and sausages however the prime rib was bland and the flat iron steak dried out from the heat lamps. The game hen was actually the best of the meats as the leg and thigh were most and well seasoned.   The shrimp were small, probably 41-50 count and did not taste very fresh.  There was only a small sample of very basic sushi.  The baked fish was overcooked and unpalatable.   The charcuterie was a poor comparison to Bacchanal as it contained only three types of meats to go with dry crumbly cheeses.  The meats were tough and fatty and definitely not premium quality.  I couldn't even sample the mac and cheese which was a liquid mess with the oil separating from the cheese.  The buttermilk mashed potatoes were ok.  Deserts were very good and possibly saved the evening but the gelato bar did not get adventurous in flavors.\n\n3) The staff took forever to take my drink order, clear my plate, and refill my drink. I was able to get up, get a second plate and return and eat half the second plate before the first plate was removed.  my tea was never refilled.\n\n4)  Very disappointing variety.  First, they bill the buffet as \"a new way to buffet\" but there is nothing new about it.  I was excited to see so many steam bins for the asian section but turned out they were doubled up and just americanized favorites such as dumplings, pork buns, shumai and the best of the bunch, the leek pancake.  They were not well cooked either.  Other than the dim sum, there were very few asian options. The fried rice was highly disappointing   The Italian section was also disappointing as it contained only pizza and spaghetti and meatballs. Other than the meatballs, which were nothing special, you could have had a better meal at Cici's.  The seafood section was great if you like muscles but lacking everywhere else.  I didn't expect 500 items but I did expect something to set it apart which I didn't find.
