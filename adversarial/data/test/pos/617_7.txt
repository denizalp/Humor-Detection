I love love love perfume.  I'm a cheapskate when it comes to buying things for myself but one thing I do indulge in is perfume.  So when someone approached my friend and I as we were rushing out of the 3 Mile shops in Las Vegas and he was coming out of a perfume shop, I couldn't help myself.  He foreign-accented me into buying their big bottle of Hyacinth perfume and gave me all that free stuff with it:  hand lotion, eye gel, body wash, shea butter body lotion, hand\/nail treatment, face wash, etc.  I was E-X-C-I-T-E-D!\n\nI kept the perfume and its buddies in the nice little shopping bag he gave me, set it in the corner of the car next to a bag of clothes and chocolates, and left for San Diego.  By the time I reached SD, the bottle was BROKEN!  Wtf!  I've had perfume bottles stuffed into luggage, shoved into gym bags, tossed into piles, and no problem-o.  This thing???  It wasn't even next to anything break-inducing!  I wasn't driving like a maniac.  The only thing I was guilty of was driving with my windows down and the heat on in summer because my car was overheating (and NO, I didn't call the M&M store to complain about the melted chocolates).  \n\nSOOO  of course I call the Yves Chantre store as soon as I notice it's broken.  Store associate was great, took my number down for the manager to call me.  Did the manager call?  No, of course not.  I call again and another nice store associate gave me the name (\"Dasha\") and number of the manager.  Did she answer?  No, of course not.  Did she return my call?  You guessed it!  No way!  Not even a \"I'm so sorry, this NEVER happens with our products, it must have been a fluke!\", etc, etc, etc.  I called a couple more times and one time she accidentally called my number and hung up right away.  Lame.\n\nI realize there may be only limited things that can be done (if anything at all) to rectify the situation, but I expected at least a phone call regarding the product and why the bottle was so easily broken.  Are all the bottles so cheap?  I mean, I don't expect to be able to play football with the damn bottle but at least be able to carry it reasonably in a bag in my car???\n \nBtw, when I bought the perfume, I was told that the promotion they were offering that day was because it was a grand opening (just opened yesterday!) and that it was special pricing, etc.  However, google search showed this other review on here for this same package in *2007*!  I'm not sure if this is all part of some scam to sell perfume in cheaply made bottles and claim limited time offers but I think it speaks a lot to the quality of a company when the manager won't even have the courtesy to call and at least back their product up.  I assume this must only be because this sort of situation happens often and the company is not looking for repeat customers, hence the false advertising as well.\n\nSo, ladies, go ahead and put your pumps on and run, don't walk, AWAY from this store.  If the product is so damn special, then pack it in something decent.
