I received a phone call from Delias corporate office after my first review. They lady who spoke with me sounded very concerned about my experience and was trying to make the situation right. After speaking with her she gave me some useful information that educated me on the dry cleaning process of my dress. I appreciated her time and told her I would update my review because I appreciated her reaching out. Unfortunately the review did not go up because I just received another phone call from Delias cleaners in Queen Creek and my dress now has a hole in it! So not only did I drop off my very expensive wedding dress for them to clean, it didn't get cleaned the first time, they ruined the belt and had to sew that back on, had to re-clean it and now sent me a picture with this hole right in the center of the chest! ARE YOU KIDDING ME!??? I took all the strength I had to not cry and yell at the lady who called me to inform me of this. I told them to stop the process completely and to return my dress to me ASAP! The more I left my dress with them, the more it has been destroyed!!! I am completely devastated and very saddened that they didn't care to do their best and take great care of my wedding dress while cleaning it. My very beautiful and expensive wedding dress is now ruined. They didn't even really care when they called me I just got an ohhh sorry about that. Not once BUT TWICE they have destroyed my dress! Its been almost a week since the lady called me from the cleaners. I now have no idea where my dress even is and what they are doing with it!
