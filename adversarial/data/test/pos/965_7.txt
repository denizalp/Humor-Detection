No bachelor party in Vegas is complete without the obligatory visits to \"Establishments\" and shooting fully automatic firearms. Side note: someone should consider combining both...\n\nAnyway, back to this review,  Range 702 has its fair share of good and bad. Setting up the reservation for 8 people was extremely easy and convenient. I was able to email Ariana and she reserved our packages and setup our shuttle pickup from the hotel we were staying at. When we got there I gave them my name and everything was ready to go.\n\nBecause some of the guys in our group were not big on shooting, they wanted to split a package so they could at least try out a gun or two.  Unfortunately Range 702 does not allow this which is a bummer. I mean, they let all the non-shooters go inside the range anyway, so what's the big deal? Also, the girl at the front desk gave us a bit of unnecessary 'tude and told the guys to man up and buy their own packages.\n\nOnce we were on the lanes everyone had a fantastic time. The two instructors\/guides were great. Both were ex-military and extremely helpful and cool to talk to. They allow you to pose for as many pictures as you want and keep all your targets. Considering that each gun only lasts about 10 seconds, documenting it helps make it a more memorable experience. (That's what she said)
