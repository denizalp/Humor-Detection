I got sucked into wanting to go to the salon bc of instagram. I called to make an appointment and left a voicemail. I got a text the next day saying it's Chrissy's assistant and to send pics of my hair. I did that and waited and waited... I sent another asking to make an appt and again NO REPLY! \nI'm sure unless you have over 10k followers on Instagram you won't  get a call back. Typical Scottsdale type business. I'll go elsewhere.
