This is a nice Starbucks. It's located one level below street level in an upscale food court. Lot's of people in and out, yet it was fine for cooling my jets for an hour or so. The walkway of the mall above has opaque tiles and you can see people walk over as they hustle and bustle on their way.\n\nI wish I had one of their Tevanas right now.
