I am moving to Charlotte in a week and called to set up my utilities.   My experience with Piedmont Gas was fine UNTIL I learned that they wouldn't turn on my gas until FOUR DAYS after I moved in.  In December!  I am absolutely aghast by how terribly this company is run.  Fortunately, I'm in good enough health that I can run to a store myself to buy electric heaters to stay warm (aka alive)--but what if I were elderly and living by myself?  Does Piedmont Gas just leave the less fortunate to the elements?  Playing it a little Darwinist, aren't you Piedmont Gas?  Or maybe you are just a horrible company?  You set a very bad example for Charlotte.
