The Grind isn't so much a grind as a pretty nice looking bar with solid burgers.  They are huge-I shared one with my wife.  We also had onion rings which are tempura battered.  It was a nice, light batter but they were a little underdone.\n\nIf Yelp had the old half star I would have rated The Grind 3.5 stars.\n\nI like the decor here, especially the appearance of the front from the inside\/outside.  Also upside but not downside.  I'm looking for more upside than downside in general...
