I would go to Superior Pho any day of the week, that's pho sho! (Teehee). \n\nHaving never tried pho before, I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but was blown away by how flavorful the noodles and broth were! It was one amazing bowl packed with a variety of flavors, making each bite more exciting than the next. Although I acted like a complete animal, slurping and spilling all over my clothes (and other people's clothes), I came away feeling like I had just had a first class meal. The service was quick, the staff friendly, and the overall atmosphere welcoming and wonderful. I will definitely be going back!
