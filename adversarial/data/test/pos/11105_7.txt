I first visited TheSmoke at their original Collingwood location after a long day on the slopes and discovered it as one of the highest reviewed spots in town due to it's recent feature on the Food Networks \"You Gotta Eat Here\". Fast forward to 2016\/17 and they've brought their smokey, cheesy, beefy big flavours down south to Vaughan for everyone else to enjoy! Score!\n\nI've only been once so before anyone flies off the handle with why only 4 stars and not 5 - it's because I have had only one menu item so far so I want to try a few more things before giving what I know will be an easy 5-star. \n\nI stopped in for lunch with a friend and we decided to get a pair of sammys with fries as an easy option. I went with the W.B.B.B.B.B.S sandwich. So what the hell is that? A sandwich with 3 strips of Wild Boar Bacon, Back Bacon, Bacon with double smoked cheddar, Lettuce, Tomato, and Chipotle Mayo on a grilled Bun.\n\nIf you lost count that is 3 strips of 3 different kinds of bacon, which means you get a sandwich with 9 strips of bacon total. This was decadence incarnate and I happily ate it without breaking much for breathing.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier on, this is all I've had here to date, and I would love to try some of their crazy signature cocktails and their craft beer selection to go along with all the BBQ treats that I didn't get a chance to try.\n\nCan't wait to go back again really soon and get smoked!\n\nEatcrest Out!
