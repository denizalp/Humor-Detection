My hispanic friend brought me here the other day for dinner.\nI never crave tacos but when I do eat tacos I'm always game for carne asada.\nWow... talk about how big their tacos are?! I ordered 3 and ended up only being able to finish 2.5. Also got their watermelon juice. I'm a fan and would come back here again if I'm in the city craving carne asadas. \nParking not a problem.
