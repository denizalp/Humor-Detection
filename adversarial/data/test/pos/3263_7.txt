This place is so disgusting.\n\nWe needed a pet friendly room last minute, so we tried not to be too picky. After price shopping, The Quad was a more affordable option, so we decided to give it a try and make the best of it despite the poor reviews. Why oh why didn't we heed everyone's warnings?\n\nI called a day before to make sure that early check was an option, and what the cost was. Normal check in is 4 PM, but we arrived around 1:15 PM or so. After finding a parking spot in a small, cramped, poorly marked parking garage, we made our way through the construction and cramped space to the front desk. I'm fine with paying the early check in fee, but our room wasn't ready. This option should not be offered if the hotel cannot honor it. We ended up sitting in our car running the AC for an hour so that our dog wouldn't get overheated.\n\nWe were put in a pet designated room, which was hard to find, and which absolutely stank of animal urine. The bathroom also reeked of sewage. The carpets were dirty, as other people mentioned, and the furniture was old and dingy. The bathroom was crusty and gross. The bedsheets looked OK (no obvious, visible black marks like others have mentioned), but I wasn't happy sleeping there.\n\nThe next morning, after checking out and making our way out of the parking garage, we saw that a pipe burst on the ground level and that there was some flooding. My husband asked someone directing traffic what to do; the man very rudely replied that if we decided to drive over the water, it was our responsibility to cover any damage. My husband then asked what he recommended, to which he replied that we go back, park, and wait 2 hours. This wasn't an option for us, so after watching a couple other cars cross, we did, too.\n\nDon't stay here! There are other pet friendly hotels, both on and off the strip, that are better than this. Even if you're just looking for a cheap place to sleep late at night while spending all the rest of your time in Vegas at nicer places, do not stay here.
