Snow ice that melts in your mouth..mmh (insert heart eye emoji)\n\nI never had snow fluff or snow cream until Snowflake Shavery. Honestly, I'm in love. It's located in one of my favorite plaza in Chinatown with popular joints such as Monta ramen, Raku and Curry Zen. \n\nWalk in and you are immediately greeted by the friendly workers. Menu is simple and displayed on the wall. You can choose the flavor\/sauce\/topping and given the option of 3 different sizes. They give you a lot so small size is usually enough for me. The largest size is called monster. Indeed, that thing is ginormous. \n\nYou can customize any flavor and toppings or they have one put together. My order is always the mango snow with lychee jelly. I like it simple. Mango snow is made with real mango and has a bold mango flavor. Texture? fluffy and heavenly. Lychee jelly is really sweet but I love the combination of mango and lychee. I also like their mochi topping. \n\nThey also have snow shake which is a blended drink. My favorite is the mix of cookie & cream and fruity pebble, with snowflake sauce. Their blended drink is thick and filling so I rarely get it especially with all the good eatery in the plaza. \n\nIt's not ice cream and it's not frozen yogurt. Snowflake is something much better.  It has that \"slap to the face\" factor and when it hits you, it hits you harder than Sharkeisha. Go get you some.
