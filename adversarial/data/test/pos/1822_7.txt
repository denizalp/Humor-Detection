Cardboard crust pizza. Umm, no thanks.\nTwo different cocktails...tasted exactly the same....and not good. Very sour and off-putting. The food was very below average. We had bruschetta, and pizza along with spaghetti with clam sauce. \n\nGross-gross-gross- and gross.\n\nWill DEFINITELY NOT be going back. And would never recommend to anyone. Gross!!
