Pros:\n\nIt's like high school only shinier!!\n\nCons:\n\nIt's like high school except ruled by creepy old rich lechers and aspiring gold diggers!  And whiter drugs!\n\nOn the flip side the recent FBI bust means the tax evading crooks will probably be shut down soon.  So if dropping $500 to reinforce your very own self importance fantasies is your cup of tea, hurry over while there's still time to be $omebody!
