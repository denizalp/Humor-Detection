Smaller place in a strip mall. Could be easily overlooked, but oh, so worth the stop! \n\nExcellent food. Black beans were simple but seasoned perfectly. Traditional pork was very good, but dry. So definitely ask for sauce on the side.\n\nSkirt steak was delicious and garlic sauce for the plaintains was very good. \n\nAll the sauces were delectable and made the meals that much better. Dessert was perfection, sangria tasty and magic hat on tap...loved everything!!
