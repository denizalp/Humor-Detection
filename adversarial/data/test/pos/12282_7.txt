Good japanese italian bakery by the wonderful Miss Suzu. (hence the name Suzuya. \"Suzu\" + \"ya = shop) \n\nfreshly made items daily. \n\nMy most recent visit was after the monthly Chaiya Monastery Food Festival with other yelpers. I had ordered the mont blanc (usual favorite item to get) and by recommendation of Nelson and Sylvia, i got the custard pudding as well. \n\nIf you dine in, they'll put your dishes on a japanese style tray, with utensils. Payment is easy through their mounted square system. \n\nCustard Pudding - very smooth and creamy. Not too sweet. Have a sauce on the bottom, similar to one with a flan. great combination. forms a wonderful medley of flavors \n\nMont Blanc - a dessert that is wonderfully prepared. whipped cream in the center, with piped lines of super aromatic, flavorful chestnut paste-like cream around forming the exterior. topped with a perfectly peeled sweet chestnut. \n\nI've tried a few other desserts as well but not too fresh in my mind. XD But nothing has disappointed me yet. All are prepared wonderfully with an italian taste with a japanese flare. Not too sweet. Even my mom loves it !
