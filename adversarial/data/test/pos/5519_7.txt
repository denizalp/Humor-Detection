After watching a show at the Benedum my wife and I were hungry and needed to find a place to eat.  We had some restaurants in mind but my wife found this place on Yelp and we decided to try it out.  She said it was a newer restaurant but we didn't know how new it was until we got here.\n\nWe knew Pirata was located in Market Square but it took us a few minutes to finally find it.  Luckily we had our treasure map!  (That was a joke for the comedy).  Anyways we walk in and it's not too busy but the restaurant looks great.  It was an unusually warm fall day in the Burgh so they had it all opened up in the restaurant.  You could tell it was new and it looked nice and modern.\n\nSo we walked right up to the bar.  The bar was a good size and you could see the televisions really well too.  It's a good set up.  The bartender greeted us and we dove into the food and drink menu.  We were hungry so we knew we wanted some kind of appetizer before our main dish.  The empanadas intrigued us.  They had three to choose from.  The Jamaican beef patty, pollo pricasse, and the beef picadillo.  We ordered the Jamaican beef and the Pollo one.  They were $3 each and we both shared them.  They were good and the salsa type dish that came with it was good to dip in.  We probably would have liked it spicier but it was still good.  I preferred the pollo the most.  I could have eaten a few more of those!\n\nLooking around you can tell that this was a new restaurant.  They were having a little trouble with their background music and getting it right.  The bartender wasn't too sure about some things on the menu.  The owner\/GM\/Manager was all around making sure things were good.  It just felt like they haven't been doing this for too long.  Nothing bad about that but you could just tell.\n\nWe decided to order their fish tacos.  My wife didn't want the fish fried so she asked the bartender if they could grill them.  The bartender didn't know if they could but she was nice about it and said that she would ask the kitchen.  She came back and said that they could grill the fish for her fish tacos.  I decided to do the same thing.  \n\nI didn't mention this before but when our empanadas came out our fish tacos came out at the same time.  I really don't like when the appetizer and your main dish come out together.  The head guy there that was walking around walked past us and asked us if we had asked for the fish to be grilled. We said yes because we couldn't tell by looking at it if it was fried or not.  He said it was fried and he will get us new tacos.  I was fine with that because it gave us a little more time to enjoy our appetizer.  He was really nice about it too.  He didn't let us find out for ourselves.  He was proactive and that's what made a big difference this night.\n\nHe came back about 5 minutes later with no tacos.  He apologized and said that they will take care of the tacos for us because they are being delayed.  What had happened is they grilled the fish but it wasn't to the satisfactory of the boss so he sent it back.  I love that!  They knew that we were waiting for our order so they probably rushed it and it wasn't right.  A lot of places would have just sent it to us and had us send it back and we would be very unsatisfied.  Again he was proactive and took matters into his own hands.  Great job my man!  It sort of reminds me of Gordon Ramsay's kitchen on TV.  He probably smashed that fish with his fist when it came out poorly!\n\nA few minutes later the fish finally came out and it looked really good.  I started eating my fish and it tasted great.  My wife bit into her fish and it was actually cold in the middle.  It was a little raw which was disappointing.  She sent it back and they started another order for her.  We shared my tacos so she didn't have to wait.  Then about 5 minutes later her tacos came out again and they were cooked all of the way through this time.  We ate those together and they tasted really good as well.  Since we weren't paying for them we weren't upset.  They were upfront that they were new and working out some kinks.  We found out that they had only been open for 2 weekends.  So we understand what was happening here and they gave us great service.\n\nThis is going to be a very good new restaurant in Market Square.  The atmosphere was really nice, the food was really good, and the staff made no excuses for their mistakes other than they were new.  They admitted to them and made up for it.  We will be back to give them another chance here at Pirata!
