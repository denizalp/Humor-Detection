Came in for dinner on a slow night, on the later side of the evening.  Lots of open tables and booths.  The hostess asked if we had reservations, we did not.  She tried to seat us at a little table.  Not a very nice table.  I asked for a booth.  She seemed hesitant to do so, then did.  Okay fine.\n\nOnce seated our waiter Joseph came over said he would return with water, Edamame and to look over the menu.  After he came back I asked for a large Kirin beer and large hot sake.  Come to find out, you can't just order a large hot sake like every other Japanese restaurant in America.  He explains to me I need to buy a bottle (Various sizes, all big bucks).  I can see where this is going, and just tell him we will stick with the beer.  I'm not paying $37.00 for a small bottle of sake.\n\nAt this point I can tell he's not loving us, and we are not loving him. \nI asked if they have Albacore.  \nNo, we don't.  We have blue fin tuna.\nThe menu says $6.00?  How much do you get?\n$6.00 per piece.  \nI ordered (4) pieces, $24.00.  Fresh, yes.  Worth it, no!\n\nI ordered one Spicy Tuna roll, $12.00.  It was small, and well chilled.  Even the rice.  Sushi rice should be warm.  My guess is that it was pre-made and refrigerated.\n\nI decide to go with (2) large plates.\nMISO-MARINATED CHILEAN SEA BASS roasted organic vegetables and oshinko $29\nCHICKEN TERIYAKI-SAMBA STYLE organic chicken, aji amarillo, purple potato mash, crispy onion $26.\n\nThe Miso Cod was good.  The Chicken was okay at best.  Purple potato mash was weird.  Neither dish came with rice.  Disappointing.\n\nThe hostess tries seating another couple at the same small table she tried to seat us at and they tell her they want a booth too.  \n\nAcross from us is a booth with a older Asian business man with two women, a blond and a brunette.  High end escorts I presume.  I guess the booths are reserved for that clientele.\n\nHe drops the bill, and I see there's a $7.00 charge for the Edamame.  I point out to him we didn't order it, he brought it out with the water.  Confused, he said \"Well, you ate it\".  Yes, that's true.  Since you brought it out with the water, we just figured it was like bringing out some bread.  Neither of us requested this.  Just a guess, but I think they must do this to people all the time.  \n\nHe had enough of us, and us of him.  He took off the Edamame, we paid the bill, left exactly 15%, and left.  We would never return to this restaurant nor would I recommend to friend or foe.\n\nIn the course of our three day stay, this was the only negative experience we encountered at the Palazzo.  What a shame, it was our last night.
