My absolute favorite sandwich spot!!  The sandwiches here are simple yet so delicious, cheap, convenient that it's 24\/7 and there are many different selections to choose from.  My favorites are the chipotle chicken avocado and the carribean jerk chicken!  They run less than $10 and are a good size to keep you full.  The line here is always crazy long but it goes down pretty quickly and efficiently.  It is hidden by one of the entrances into Planet Hollywood (I always get so confused trying to look for it).  I recently found out there is a EOS in downtown Disneyland so I can grab a sandwich there when I'm in Socal and don't have to go all the way to Vegas to get one.  The service here is never a problem so I have no complaints.  A must stop when you're in Vegas or eating on a budget!
