If people ever ask me what ethnicity I am, they usually say something like...\"What are you?  Italian?\"  I guess it has to do with how I look and the fact that my name is Vince.  Turns out, I am not Italian, but for 45 minutes last Saturday...I felt Italian.\n\nCugino's is exactly what I look for in an Italian deli.  Pasta and cans of tomatoes on the shelves, a nice selection of meats, cheeses, olives, and sausage, and a couple old school guys behind the counter with white shirts and white aprons.\n\nI walk up to the counter to the appropriate greeting of \"How ya doin?\"  I respond to that question with the appropriate answer (which happens to be the same question) \"How ya doin?\"  The guy behind the counter then asks, \"Whaduya havin'?\n\nWe ordered the Italian Combo#2 and the Meatball Parm sandwiches, a couple bags of chips, and drinks.  The total came to around $20 and we both left stuffed.   The Italian sandwich came loaded with salami, capicola (gabbagool), provolone, and I asked to add some pepperocinis.  Don't forget about the bread, which is the key to the success of this sandwich.\n\nWe will be heading back in our next Vegas trip for sure.  This is a nice lunch option and break from the smoke filled and overpriced casinos.
