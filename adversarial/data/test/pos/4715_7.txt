I drove 100 miles to go to this place because of my love of French food . \n\nI came here mainly because of the reviews on Yelp Which were mostly favorable. \n \nCome on Yelpers seriously ? \n\nThis place was such a huge disappointment .on every level . \n\nWe didn't even Finish our meal nor did they bother ask how things were . \n\nUsually if they come to pick up the plates and most of the food is still there\nThey ask how was everything. Nada!\n \nI didn't seem to me that they really cared.  I could go in to great detail but \nWhy bother , they didn't ,\n\n\n A sub par experience on every level.
