Terrible, just terrible customer service. I called twice there was no answer. The voicemail was full so I couldn't leave a message. When they returned my call I was astounded with his condescending tone. He was mad that I had called more then once. This would have been avoided if I was able to leave a voicemail. He spoke to me as if I was a degenerate criminal burdening him with my questions. I was greatly offended.  My ignorance was treated as stupidity. Being a single mother just getting over debilitating health issues I have run out of options and had turned to them for help. I did not realize that that help came with a belittling conversation that ended when I was hung up on for not understanding the his terminology. Clearly he sits on a throne of judgement and enjoys being better then the criminals he speaks with.
