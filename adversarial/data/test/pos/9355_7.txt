Seriously one of the best placed to go if you need a waxing. \n\nI love that they use a hard wax!! Truly is way better than soft. I've been to different people for each of my appointments and they were fabulous!! I wish I remembered all their names!! \n\nI went to Portia for my first brazilian in a long time and she was top notch! Very friendly and made me feel comfortable.\n\nAlso, the receptionists are great! They truly make you feel welcome.\n\nPlus the price is reasonable!! I love you birthday suit because you make me look awesome in my birthday suit!! YEEE-HAW!
