Yes to Portuguese sausage, eggs, and rice, with a side of Aloha Shoyu.  Yes to real plates and silverware instead of plasticware and styrofoam trays you'd get at a drive-in like L&L.  And yes to all the Hawaiian decor that makes you really feel like you're back on Oahu.\n\nNo to their breakfast prices.  We paid $5.75 for a breakfast plate, which is the same amount for the breakfast buffet downstairs, which also serves portuguese sausage, eggs, and rice.  However, if you don't want to wait in line for that buffet AND you're not that big of an eater, Aloha Specialties upstairs of the California is a fine option.
