For the price they are charging, it is indeed pretty good value. However, they really need to look into training their servers. I had reserved a party of 15 for teppanyaki this past Saturday. When we got there, some of my friends were already there. When he kids saw each other, thy got excited and started running around. While we were telling our kids to stop, this  particular oriental waitress, just grabbed the hood of my friends' 6-year old daughter and scolded at her. \n\nI was like, yes, we were aware that kids running around was dangerous, but we were already doing something about it. But she should NEVER laid her hand on any child. \n\nThen my other friends with young children arrived. My friend started to put his bag and coat on the empty besides him, the same lady went to him and said \"No, you can't put your stuff here. You reserved for 15 people, you are getting 15 chairs. I will have other customers coming in, and we will need this chair\". And of course, there was no more customer taking the seats next to him.  That was just plain rude.
