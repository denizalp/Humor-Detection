Can Party Cake withstand the hellish onslaught of Bethel Bakery?\n\nBethel does have a better selection. \n\nBut does Bethel have better glazed pretzels, brownies (love the flour on the bottom and that buttercream frosting), chocolate logs?\n\nDo they have those gloriously rich apple fritters, which look like meteorites until you sink your teeth into them?\n\nHow about those fat Pecan Sandies with their gritty, almost smoky flavor? \n\nOr that cool blue storefront? \n\nPerhaps it's neighborhood pride (bias?) on my part, but I cannot concede to Bethel Bakery just yet. \n\nParty Cake is the light to Bethel Bakery's darkness. We're talking virtue clashing head on with wickedness here. All that is holy hangs in the balance...
