$22 mediocre roastbeef sandwich\n$18 slightly above average burger\n$4 gatorade!!!\n$4 mountain dew!!!\n21 minute wait for to-go order\n\nShoulda gone with the Johnny rockets down the corridor.  A perfect storm of hunger, procrastination  and indecisiveness led us to settle for this 3 star joint on our way back through the hotel after visiting the shark reef.  Yelp don't lie.  Trust what you read and dine elsewhere.
