Looking for a place to kill a couple of hours before a Yelp event at SMG at Epicentre, we decided to pop a squat at the bar at BlackFinn for some apps and dranks.\n\nMy GPS managed to navigate me directly to the EpiCentre parking deck (hooray!) where I got a prime parking spot.  Parking in the deck  - $3 per 30 min with a $20 max - so if you are there for dinner and a movie, prepare to pay $20 for parking.  Find the elevators - there are no signs that I could find on the side that I parked on to tell me that - but find the elevators, they will take you directly up to where you need to be.  After wandering around like a tourist for a bit, I walked upstairs to BlackFinn.  It was around 4:30, so I was sent to the bar downstairs, as the upstairs wasn't open yet?  Whatever... we found a spot easily at the big bar downstairs and were served by a friendly bartender who kept us drowning in drinks for 2 hours (great job!).\n\nFor apps, we sampled the pretzels served with cheese sauce and the queso (more cheese) dip with tortilla chips.  The soft and warm pretzels, instead of being coated in coarse salt, were lightly sprinkled with what I think was parm cheese - good job - very good, much better than me flicking salt off all over the bar area.  The cheese dip was creamy and had a mustardy undertone to it.  The chipotle queso and chips were also very good.  They both made for great snacks to get us ready for dinner at the movies.  \n\nFriendly, efficient staff, typical uptown restaurant\/bar prices, good food, workout from up and down the stairs - yay BlackFinn!
