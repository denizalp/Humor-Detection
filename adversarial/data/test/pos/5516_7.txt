Great food, great waiter, terrible hostess. We arrived to an empty restaurant with all open tables and were forced to sit at the worst table in the restaurant, a table in the middle by a pole. I will stress again that every single table in this restaurant was open at this time. When I asked her this table, she said yes. Perhaps they need to work on their hostess to keep up with the superb quality of every bring else, including the service and the food. If you come for anything, make it he sticky buns and lemon souffl√© pancakes!
