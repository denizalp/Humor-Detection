To give you an idea of my mindset going in, I have zero experience with dancewear and dance shoes. My parents did not have me take any lessons growing up, I did not take dance in high school. \n\nSo I was really excited to sign up my seven year old daughter for ballet folklorico dance lessons. One of the teachers recommended this store to me for dance shoes. I checked out the website, saw that they were not at all close to my home. But I figured the dance instructor wouldn't steer me wrong and I took the time to drive all the way to this one location. \n\nWhen I arrived, the staff seemed stand offish. I thought maybe they were just having an \"off\" type of day and dismissed it. I asked for help in the dance shoe department and the sales lady was sort of exasperated that I had not brought my daughter along. She was in school, so no, she wasn't with me. She said, as if this was some sort of common knowledge, that dance shoe sizes are NOT compatible to shoe sizes. They're completely different! The dancer MUST try on the shoes to know which size they would need. And with my zero knowledge of anything dance related, how was I supposed to know this????????????\n\nObviously, I feel this is not common knowledge. And being the dance shoe experts, I don't see why they wouldn't know enough to advertise this little nugget of information on their website. It would be nice if it said on the website that the dancer must be present to try on shoes. This way people are not driving to this south Scottsdale location from all over town only to find that they need to make a return trip with their dancer. \n\nUpon my return trip, the customer service had not improved. Which leads me to believe that this must be the norm. Sales people complaining about how customers come in not knowing about dance shoes (seriously?)....sales people not knowing how to use a cash register...sales people that don't smile and appear to dislike their job. Which is not my fault. If I didn't like my job, I would quit and find something that I did like. Life's too short for that. And it's too short for dealing with the \"customer service\" that is provided in this store. I would say find another place to shop. But if you are forced to go here because you do not have a choice and need dance shoes, make sure to bring your dancer with you!
