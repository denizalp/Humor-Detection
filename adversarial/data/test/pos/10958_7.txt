Five stars, hands down!!\n\nFOOD: I ordered the Ms. Croque Madam and it was divine! Perfection at its best. Its smoked ham, crispy bacon, over easy egg on lightly melted gruyere with a creamy delicious Dijon mustard on a crispy French baguette.\n\nENVIRONMENT: lovely! You instantly feel classy like you're in a scene from Sex and the City having brunch and liquor with your girl friends catching up on the madness of your lives.\n\nATTIRE: it says casual and we went that way... in just t-shirts and jeans, but the other patrons make you feel out of place because they dress pretty nice. But the restaurant doesn't care what you dress like.\n\nMy friend said the Dijon was a little too overpowering on hers, but I loved it. So heads up... if you don't like mustard, go easy on it or ask for it on the side. Otherwise, it's a perfect combination of ingredients.\n\nSERVICE: The Swiss hostess was lovely and sweet with an enchanting accent! Our server, Amy, was so awesome!! I'd travel all the way back from LA to AZ just to come here for the service. She was so funny, sweet and friendly. She made our big group of 5 feel so comfortable and happy even though initially we felt out of place because we weren't dressed as snazzy as everyone else was. She has a way of making you feel comfortable and at ease. She's the best server I've ever had at any place ever. I wish more servers could be like her, I can't say enough about how awesome she is. She clearly loves her job and goes above and beyond her duties to make you feel at home and like you have known her forever. At first we ordered mimosas and they were delicious, the freshly squeezed orange juice was perfect in it, but we were feeling a bit more adventurous afterwards and we asked her for a recommendation. She suggested something with Patron Cafe XO. I told her my favorite types of drinks and she instantly came up with something right off the top of her head that sounded like a heavenly concoction, a White Russian Patron Cafe XO. Basically a regular White Russian with Cafe XO instead of Kahlua. Being that White Russians are my favorite drinks, this one definitely hit the spot and I found it much much more delicious than the usual White Russian. Mmmmm! I went out and bought Cafe XO right after that because of that drink.\n\nLove this place, love Amy!!
