Just my kinda place...plunked down in the middle of an industrial area just south of the airport.  Grease monkeys across the street, plumbing supply next door.  Dad's in the back tending the smoker, parking cars, chatting up customers, and handing out bottles of water from a Yeti to those in line.\n\nTook a half hour to get in, but I finally get there and the dude's behind the counter slicing up these handsome sides of smoked meat and passing out samples of homemade sausage.  I love my veggies, yes, I do, but this is why I'll never be a vegetarian.\n\nI was flanked front and back by 30-year-old tech geeks and I totally \"out-meated\" them.  Stand back, men!  Gimme a pound each of the beef brisket and pulled pork and a half dozen of them sausages...plus a pint each of all of those sides.  Jalapeno cheddar grits (grit-tastic!), husband-pleasin' beans, cole slaw and potato salad...how will I ever make it home?\n\nEat in their 3-table dining room, on the picnic tables in the parking lot, or at home.  And, frankly, why would anyone want to shame themselves by wolfing down every last juicy shred in public?  I'm happier at home, armed with a roll of paper towels and my Tide pen.\n\nWhen it's done, it's done.  Pity the fool who doesn't respect the fact that good meat takes time...a lot of time.\n\nI've already sampled everything and it's as good as it gets!  Husband better get home...soon...
