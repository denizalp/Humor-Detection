Yo this place is weird and small and stupid cheap. Zero qualms with this place. Walkable to pretty much every Toronto thing you want to do. Stupid cheap. In a residential neighborhood so it's decently quiet. It's def not \"nice\" but it's cheap, and clean. You want nice, go to a bed and breakfast or some shit. \n\nGets the job done. Then use the saved cash to go eat. Done.
