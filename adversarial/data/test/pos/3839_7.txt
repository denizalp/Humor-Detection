I do not like giving low ratings to local businesses. But this one is barely a business. For one, they don't bother to keep their posted hours! Came by twice to shop, and they were closed- once an hour before close on a weekday, and again an hour after opening on a weekend, how frustrating!\n\nThe store stock appears to be carefully selected, the mannequins are nicely styled, and they have a cool jewelry display. Unfortunately I have no idea if they're priced well, as I haven't been inside. I want to spend my money, but apparently they don't need it.\n\nBoth times I visited, neighboring businesses (Other Mama and Rice Shop) encouraged me to try again- they had good things to say, and I thought it was awesome to see businesses supporting one another! But either adjust your hours to something you can keep, or fire whatever employee isn't showing up. Or maybe just have a website instead.
