Parked here the other evening for the Goo Goo Dolls & Collective Souls concert across the way.  This place has quite the foot traffic, I assume the location is why (insert wink emoji please)!  \nThe parking garage, is well compact and far from the most genius layout. \nWe perused the hotel, it's so, so. \nMy friends and myself kept making sarcastic jokes about 'The D'.  Well, I'm here to tell you, I know what it must stand for ha!  I took a picture of the 'fountain statue' out of front.\nThink about it...
