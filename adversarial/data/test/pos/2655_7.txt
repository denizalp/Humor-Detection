After the adjacent sushi restaurant suspiciously closed, I decided to move my sashimi fetish (two to three times a week) to Ganto Sushi. Needless to say, it's been a one-sided relationship from the onset of the relationship, with me continuously seeking validation with little to no response or fanfare. I'm not asking for much, really, I'm not. All I want, is the correct order, fresh food, clean fish, tactful presentation, a friendly smile, a hello and a goodbye. In this day and age, am I asking for too much? I even moved my first weekly order to Tuesday, assuming and believing the product would be fresh. No, was I disillusioned? Yes friend, me, disillusioned. Yesterday was the final straw, the other shoe dropped. You see, at my organization, I provide to 70 individuals, $15 weekly in Ritual credits to buy lunch. Ritual is a great app., which makes it easy for people to remotely order food at participating restaurants, and run to the establishment and pick up their lunch. Easy right? No. Two of us ordered sashimi from Ganto Sushi, my order was an 18 piece with brown rice (apparently I have a conscious). We get back to the office, my order is a 9 piece with white rice. There goes $30. This is where it gets nasty. 30-minutes post-lunch, my fellow co-worker is violently vomiting in the stairwell trying to get to his car to go home. Fearing the absolute, I decided to cancel all my afternoon meetings and quickly made my way home via highway 404. I didn't make it. I didn't make it. Insert awkward pause. I had to make a drastic pit stop at Tim Hortons. I had to push a senior out of the way. Once finished, I thought I was in the clear, no. I had to make another pit stop at Home Depot. Although I will admit, Home Depot has great toilet paper. This is the sixth case of questionable food issues from Ganto Sushi, and they've been put on our \"do not eat at\" list in the office. I can't and will not recommend this restaurant and it's unfortunate it's located on King W. My apologies to all at Tim Hortons and Home Depot.
