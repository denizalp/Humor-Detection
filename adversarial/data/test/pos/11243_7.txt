I love PSC. Known colloquially as \"SANDWHICH SHOP!!!\" it's like an oasis in the drunken wasteland of 3 AM Old Town. PSC is open 24 hours, and any restaurant in Phoenix that is such gets an automatic 3 stars in my book, no matter how abysmal their service\/food is.\n\nLuckily, the sandwiches here are great. And after a few dozen cocktails, they are absolute perfection. Not to say that this is purely \"drunk food.\" It's probably not. I think PSC's food is legit, and I hope that they don't get pigeon-holed into that category, but I haven't ever really been here in the day so I'm not really sure how I would react to the place in the sunlight. But if you couldn't already tell from the previous reviews, this place gets rushed by the drunks when the surrounding bars close at 2. It can get PACKED in here. Claustrophobia-inducing, fire-code-violation packed in the insatiable lust for roast beef and provolone. Sometimes there's a bit of a wait, but biting into a piping hot, mastercrafted 9th Street (spinach, roasted peppers, and cheese) makes it all worth while. Yes it does. \n\nHighlight: PSC is the only place that provides an arena for the crowds of BS West, Saddle Ranch, and Axis\/Radius to mingle together in intoxicated greasebomb love.
