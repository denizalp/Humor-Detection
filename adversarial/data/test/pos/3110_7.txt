\"Hi, can I use your faucet?\"\n\"What for?\"\n\"I broke up with my girlfriend and she tired to claw my eye out.  I need to wash it out to see what's going on\".\n\nDon't worry, it was some random dude saying this at 8:30 AM on a Saturday morning, not me.  Jay's is kitty corner from the Platinum and a nice option if you're there or at the Tuscany, although a nearby 7-11 is a good option too for just food \/ drink.  My main hookup at Jays was 2 for $2 cold vitamin water and some sweet sunglasses.
