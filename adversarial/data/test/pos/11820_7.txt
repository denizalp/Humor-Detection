You will find here:\n\n1) mediocre frostbitten sashimi\n\n2) scallops that will get you sick\n\n3) a den of witches. \n\nThe first two are self explanatory. The third will be explained in detail.\nThe food here is okay run-of-the-mill americanized sushi. Three star fare. The ambiance is good so that miiiight bump things up to a 3.5 star.\n\nHOWEVER the unique service forces me to ding my rating down to a two.\n\nThe waitresses here are chinese. I am chinese. I also understand chinese. So when the waitresses conspire to secretly sell my coworkers and i their crappier alcohol, i understand what is going on.\n\nCome on.....  \n\nHiro is where it's at.
