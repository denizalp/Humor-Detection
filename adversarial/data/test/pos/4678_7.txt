We decided to try Osaka's happy hour last night and this place is a winner!    Our dining experience included friendly-efficient service, high quality food, clean environment, and reasonable prices with an extensive happy hour offering.  We sampled a variety of rolls and appetizers, and everything was exceptional, A++. \n\nThe only other thing I'd mention is the place has only been been open a few weeks and it was already quite crowded for a Wednesday night.  The happy hour dining area is fairly small, since it's primarily a teppanyaki joint.  We arrived at 5:30 and barely got a table.  So arrive early for happy hour as more people learn about this place.
