The guy behind the counter is annoying and loud with his completely over-done italuan theatrics.  Must be the owner because If he's an employee I would have fired him a long time ago if he worked for me.  Espresso was very good, Italian style.  However a bit disappointing that they have no raw sugar.  When I asked I was rudely told \"it turns brown when it goes in.\"   I'll not return.
