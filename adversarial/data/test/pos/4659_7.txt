This place is very well-organized. A different technician administers the various tests. Think The Emerald City where Dorothy goes from one station to the next for a buff here and a shine there. Then the Wizard comes out from behind the curtain to give the final decree. Dr Reddy (female) is a wonderful wizard.  Special kudos to Stacy who smoothed out a stressful time and did me a big favor. Thank you.
