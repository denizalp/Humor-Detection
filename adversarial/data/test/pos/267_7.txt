I am still thinking about this place and it's been 2 weeks since I ate there.  Maybe love at first bite?  Must be, because I am completely enamored.\n\nThe service wasn't that great but they made up for it with their delicious food.  I got the special, I don't even remember the name but I can't sing its praises enough.  Rotini noodles with a creamy white sauce and sausage...\n\nIf I wasn't on a date I would have eaten the entire plate.  To see a single noodle go to waste was a total shame but I really liked the guy.  \n\nEven though this place is a 20 minute drive from my house, I'll be back.
