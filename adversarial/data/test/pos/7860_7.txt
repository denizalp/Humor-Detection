Best mechanic in town hands down!\n\nWhen other mechanic shops lie and break your wallet, don't fret, come here!\n\nLocated near Chinatown and very affordable! \n\nIt usually takes them a few days because of how busy they are but I will be a loyal customer for life! Thanks Sonnic for taking care of my vehicle!\n\nFor all of the labor I needed done, I was quoted $900. I paid $350 here.
