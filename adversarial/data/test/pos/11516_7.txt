Furla is an Italian handbag company founded over 80 years ago but is of high quality. Although the name did not sound familiar to me, it sounded familiar to one of my colleagues who had lived in Italy for a long time (and is originally from Europe). \n\nI had bought a mint-colored wallet during their opening weekend at a 50% discount (part of their grand opening\/Memorial Day sale). The style of the wallet was exactly like one of Prada's wallets but for 1\/3 of the price.\n\nCome the next day, my European co-worker told me that Furla is known in Europe for being similar to Prada (designs, style, and even material) and is actually quite expensive. I was told that Furla is expanding well into the U.S. now so the brand is not that known.\n\nThe store is nice and clean -- as to be expected, the store is brand new! \n\nIf you go (and please, DO give Furla a visit... their handbags and other accessories are soooooo cute and the colors are AMAZING!!), ask for Lily. She is the kind sales associate who helped me and my family out. I will be coming back for a handbag soon enough. :)
