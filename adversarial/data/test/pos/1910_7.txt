OK seriously this place was ridiculous. One of the best meals of all time. So much food and I could barely dent but YUM! This is my first time visiting Sotto Sotto and I loved it! I ate there just recently with a friend from Toronto who recommended this restaurant. \n\nThe atmosphere is amazing, with the rustic architecture and dimmed lighting. It's a very beautiful restaurant that's located underground, it gives you the sense you're in an old wine cellar. My friend lives in Toronto and this is his favorite place. He is french and really picky so if he compliment your sauce you know you've done something right. I really love that their pasta dishes are authentic Italian pasta dishes that do not swim in sauce as we do in America! PFFFFFFFFF!!! GROSS!!!\n\nI had the spaghetti scoglio ( I dont know if I spelled it correctly) but its pasta mixed w seafood, it was really good, and the pasta was cooked perfectly, we shared the seafood grill platter, my favorite was the grilled calamari ahhhh so amazing, we shared the gnocchi with rose sauce, it was also very good and we also shared bites of various desserts which were all extraordinary and they also have soy ice creams which were so rich and creamy, my favorite was the hazelnut soy ice cream. They use a lot of local ingredients which I like because its important to me. My friend from L.A came with me and she loved the place as well, everyone enjoyed every dish they had, and we had so much fun dining at this place. The waiters were very nice, not to mention service was very quick. I guess you could say I had a scenic view since Javier Bardem was sitting at the table across from mine ;) Overall, amazing little place with authentic Italian food.
