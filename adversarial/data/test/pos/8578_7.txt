I'm probably imagining half of the details in this review, and they're a pastiche of three or four visits to Palatte, but whatever--here goes.\n\nI arrive at 11:30am sporting shades and a mild hangover.  The wait is twenty minutes, so my friends and I shuffle across the cobblestone and pebbles, under archways of roses and jasmine, scavenging for temporary seating.\n\nMy friends score the antique bench and plastic deck chair, and I resort to a tiny seat inherited from the haunted nursery school in Silent Hill.  I make a diorama of Luke Skywalker and some Fisher Price people visiting the toy farm I find under the table.  My friends rate my artwork with crayons on coasters.  I silently begrudge them their comfy seating--until they bring me a double greyhound.\n\nOnce seated, it's all uphill.  I usually order one of the tarts (caramelized onion?  triple mushroom?) and a fresh OJ, but I've tried people's french toast too and it's delicious.  I don't think they make anything poorly here.  And yeah--you're sitting under umbrellas in what looks like it was a plant nursery twenty years ago until they let it die and cut it back just enough to keep that secret garden feel.  Neat place.
