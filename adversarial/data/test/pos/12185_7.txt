I don't remember anywhere in the contract that stated if you didn't pick up your belongings after week... In a locker with a padlock, they would cut the lock off and remove all of your items. Including the Nike workout shirt, Nike workout pants, a Nike bra, A yoga mat, and my bag to hold it all. When I tried to get back they said they threw it all away. Yeah I bet!!!  When I signed up for this gym I told them I work in travel and may leave some things in the walker while I was traveling but I would always come back and use. Never was told they would cut it off after week. Well there went two hundred dollars with the stuff!!
