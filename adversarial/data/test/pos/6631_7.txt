Uh can anyone say this is meat heaven?! \n\nObviously this place is the s$:! with all of the reviews and if you love meat you should definitely stop by here. My husband and I ordered a combination of pork and beef dinner which is called the family dinner. I remembered after the 3rd piece of meat that came out I felt so full and we ordered the small. The appetizers that come out are so good! My favorite was the steamed egg and it was cool seeing it bubble. They are quite efficient in changing out the grill plates depending on what your meat is and helping you cook it as well. They go through so many dishes it's amazing how many dishes they have. Back to the meat of the story though, the beef was definitely my favorite whether it was the rib eye or the short rib it makes my mouth water just thinking about it. It was tender and flavorful and I just want some right now at 9:30 in the morning. I also ordered the cold noodles which I don't remember the Korean name for it but it was tasty and a great way to pair KBBQ. Service was excellent and for all the meat that we had to cook we were in and out fairly quickly.
