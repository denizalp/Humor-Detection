I was glad to be leaving.  \n\nFirst off, I totally got the whole concept - building a hotel around a historic arcade. \n\nBut... converting the old shops, WITH interior windows, no less, into drab rooms? Come on.  I was in denial as I was dragging my suitcase from the tiny reception area to my room - this cannot be happening.  But it was.  \n\nAnd soon I found myself in a small rectangular room with ugly furniture, heavily curtained glass door and what looked like a shopfront window (for obvious reasons) behind me and three windows with curtains that could hardly open on the far wall in front of me overlooking... the second floor of a big parking garage.  I kid you not. Said garage was so close that I could see the cars parked there and decided that I probably wouldn't call to complain about the curtains that didn't open after all.\n\nThroughout the whole stay I came to a conclusion that there's no way natural light could get into the room.  Instead, the room's source of light  is the garage's big fluorescent bulbs.  At least, I thought to myself, there was consistency.  \n\nIt was room 225.  Yelpers beware. \n\nBy far the worst hotel I've ever stayed in.  And I'm not even discounting skanky-ass motels that I used to stay at roadtrippin' during my college days.  Maybe it's the expectation gap.  When you hear Hyatt you expect a certain level of standard that this hotel failed to meet. \n\nI was glad I won't be coming back.
