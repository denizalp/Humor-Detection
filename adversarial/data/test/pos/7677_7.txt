Since my visit to NOPA in San Francisco, I've been dying to find a spot with a similar vibe in Toronto. I think I've found it. About halfway up the Ossington strip is the umlautted BÃ¶hmer restaurant. A former garage turned fine resto, it's spartan and stunning. Concrete floors, beautiful wood candeliers, touches of green vines in wine bottle sconces, all in a gorgeous cavernous space. Touches like the coat rack behind the host's desk are impressive in their simplicity. A communal table the length of a limousine bisects the dining hall, and I really dig how spaced out the tables are. It's loud in here, and I like that. My kind of atmosphere.\n\nThe menu is Napoleonic: short and impressive. In fact, the food options are easily dwarfed by their wines and cocktails. I started off with a Ginger Julep (Bombay and ginger liqueur) with fresh ginger and mint. Yes! So good. They also make their own water here. You heard me correctly. You'll be charged for an initial serving of bubbly or still water (if you want it), and it's unlimited thereafter. It tastes nice, but I'm not really sure how they \"make\" it.\n\nOur meals were pretty damn good. We started off with a trio of tartares: venison, scallop, and salmon. The venison (topped with a quail egg) was tender and flavorful. The seafood was served in the passionfruit hulls. I'll admit the the salmon was so-so, but the scallop with it's marrow-like texture was buttery and smooth.\n\nMains were equally impressive. I scored the chicken fricasee which was gently fried chicken in savoury jus served with the most amazing mushrooms I have ever tasted. My DCs had the arctic char and roast duck. The char had a deep flavour to it, as though poached in brine, and the duck was meaty and rich -- almost like steak.\n\nIt was pretty much a flawless dinner experience. If I had to pick on one thing it was the mewling manner of service. Our server was more than bit cloying in his affectations: \"I would like to bring some more water to your table, if that is all right with you,\" followed by some awkward wrist movements. It was weird, but whatever.\n\nYeah, it's pricy, but I can't wait to go back.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: The BOH-ld is so beautiful.\n\nMenu Readability: Short, simple and to the point.\n\nNeed to mention: They have a cocktail \"named after the winning 1856 democratic ticket James Buchanan and John C. Brechenridge.\" Yep.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: I will lift my ban on umlauts to dine at this spot.
