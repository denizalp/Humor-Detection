I waited to review this place until after my stay at the Cosmopolitan a mere 7 weeks later so that I could do a comparison. I didn't think too much about this place and would have given it 3 stars, but after my recent stay at the Cosmo, my appreciation for Aria raised its ratings. \n\nMy initial opinion of this place was that it appears they were trying too hard but fell a little short. There were so many little blemishes on the property that I'd never noticed elsewhere. Such as the hardware on the padded, embroidered walls (which were unique by the way) were screwed on so tight that the indentations were  extremely noticeable. It took away the beauty of the walls. The drawers in the room had really bad scratches, which I thought was strange to see in such a fairly new building. A long, orange power cord was left in the room, in plain sight. These and a few of other little things seem petty, I know. However, they were noticeable enough to grab my attention as I never cared to inspect such things (the wall thing sounds ridiculous but trust me, it'll catch your eyes). \n\nThe one thing that I took for granted until I stayed at the Cosmo was the modern technology. Hallelujah! Everything was controlled via a touchscreen remote control\/pad. I can turn off the lights and blinds at once with ease. \n\nThe decor of the room was decent, I don't recall being blown away, but I wasn't disappointed either. Everything was standard\/expected of a 5-star hotel such as double sinks with granite top, secluded toilet, and stand up shower - with seats!\n\nOverall, if you're not a picky hotel patron like me then you'd love this place.
