I live right at Central and Dunlap. 3 TIMES now I have gone in at 8pm to try and eat something and its the same result. The waitress tells me the kitchen is closing in 15 minutes and they are RUDE...also the drinks are EXPENSIVE.. and the room is so dark I have to use my phone to see the menu. Instead I went to a burger beer place around the corner spent less money and got triple the service I needed and drinks were large and under 5 bucks. RUDE Dillons should just close and be done.
