I absolutely love the food here, from healthy crisp salads to bacon and cheese covered loaded tots, the food here is GREAT bar food. Food here is QUALITY AND QUANTITY. Great foods to go with wines and beers, by the way, if you have a late group you can order cocktails by the pitcher. YAS! \nMy favorite salad has to be the Blue Cheese and Pear Salad, great pairings of pear and blue cheese and walnuts and cranberries. Another favorite item on the menu of mine is The Fried Louie burger, a cheeseburger with a fried egg! \nThey definitely have great happy hours, especially on Tuesday, 5pm-close, you can grab a burger and either tots or fries, for only $5.00! That's a deal you can't miss out on. \nThe only downfall and the only reason why I docked two stars is because I've been here so many times, and every time, the service here disappoints me in some way. I understand that it is a place where you seat yourself, but every single time I come here, I have to wave down a waiter to take out order after waiting about 10-15 mins. I'm very understanding when the say \"sorry about the wait\" but 3-4 times out of 5 that I've been? That's a bit much, and it's usually not even that busy when I come by. Even after ordering, service is so slow. Every time something is needed, it's given to my table when it's not needed anymore or when we've already finished our food. It'd be so much more enjoyable if the staff was more quick and attentive to the customer. \nEh, at least the food is good though, I'll be back for that, not the service.
