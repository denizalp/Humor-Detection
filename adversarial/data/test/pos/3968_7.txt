I had bought a dirtbike a few months prior and got completely ripped off. The people are friendly and helpful but too friendly. They gave me an extended warranty and told me it comes with it only to find out that they charged me 700 for that same extended warranty plus other additional charges that added up to almost 1600 dollars. WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH THEM AGAIN.
