Thank you, Prosperity staff and guests, for not laughing out loud at me and my friend from out of town who, last Saturday night, had three Sangrias apiece and then proceeded to play THE MOST EMBARRASSING game of pool known to man.\n\nThe Connect 4, 1990s-era Trivial Pursuit, and Slang Scrabble (can this please be a real game and not just the drunken one we played out of necessity?) were awesome too.
