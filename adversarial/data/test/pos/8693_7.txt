I'm surprised I have never reviewed this place since I been coming here for years. This bar that's located on top of the Stratosphere hotel is a great place to see Vegas. Its really pretty here during the day or at night. \nSince you can bungee jump from the top of this hotel don't be surprised that as you are sipping your cocktails you see some jumpers on the side of the building.\nFYI you need to go through metal detectors and security before allowed upstairs.
