Drawn to this restaurant because of the proximity to my house and the outstanding reviews I read before making my choice on coming here. Upon walking in the \"cleanliness\" of the place wasn't nearly as close as described in the previous reviews. About 60% of the tables were left dirty and with plates on them and it was a slow day (Less than 4 people including myself and my girlfriend). I ordered the flautas and she ordered a vegetarian huarache. Food came out at a pretty reasonable time. The flautas were alright (definitely not worthy of paying 8$ for and deserving of a 5 star rating) and the huarache was average, up until she encountered a stone in her meal (typically found in beans when you didn't strain and clean them properly). She bit down really hard and hurt her tooth immensely. Upon that happening she handed it to me and I flagged down one of the staff, and who I believed to be the owner of the place.  I told him very calmly what had happened and he took the stone, didn't apologize and went right back to the kitchen. I was under the impression that he was remaking what she had ordered, but that was not the case he decided to ignore it. I finished my meal and tried talking to him about remaking it or giving her compensation for the meal where the stone was found. After hearing him tell me \"this was impossible it couldn't have happened\" and me reminding him that it did happen, and I gave him actual evidence. He very angrily opened the cash register gave us 2$ less than what we paid for and slammed the register shut. Will not be returning, was not satisfied and was very disgruntled when I left. Would advise anyone who was planning on coming out of their way to find something better, because these reviews do not reflect on my experience whatsoever.
