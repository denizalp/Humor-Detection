Had the buffalo chicken sandwich - very impressed!  Bleu cheese crumbles are added (and very strong), so be sure to ask to have these removed if you're not a fan of bleu cheese.\n\nThey offer three different styles of fries - thin, thick or waffle fries.  I had the thin - they weren't bad, but I've had better.  Definitely not worth 5 bucks.\n\nSpent 41 bucks on two sandwiches, one order of fries, and one coke.  But you can't expect anything cheap in Las Vegas... where the taxes were nearly 20%... eek.
