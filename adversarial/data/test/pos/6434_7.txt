I'm kind of embarrassed it took me this long to hit up this place. Coffee shops really aren't my bag -- don't get me wrong, I need coffee like a fat kid needs Arby's. But I really would rather putz around my apartment in my boxer shorts working at my own pace than be at the mercy of some other place's WiFi signal and also avoid getting hit in the nuts by someone's obnoxious kid (it happens more than you'd think). \n\nBut I stumbled here one Saturday afternoon after a friend recommended their used LP selection. Another record shop on the West Side? Yes, please. Brother, they have WAY MORE than used LPs. Their new AND used CD and LP selection really is one of the tops in Cleveland. (I say that as primarily a somewhat-snobby indie rock fan.) \n\nBut any place that has multiple Numero Group releases, Guided By Voices vinyl bootlegs, and a whole shelf dedicated to the Velvet Underground obviously has its finger on the pulse of what hipsters like me enjoy. If not for just coffee, I will definitely be back here spending more money than I should on vinyl.
