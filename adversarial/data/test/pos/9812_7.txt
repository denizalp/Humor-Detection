I am a pinball fanatic. I play as much as I possibly can, and I am fortunate to live in a city that has an abundance of pinball options. Therefore, I was really looking forward to my visit to the hall of fame. I have to say that overall it was disappointing, mainly because of the state of repair of most of the machines. As a matter of fact, not a single game I played worked perfectly. Not one. The captured ball on Metallica didn't work. the ac\/dc had a runaway pop bumper and the drop targets were wonky. iron man had issues. These are all newer machines so the availability of parts isn't an issue. I can understand older machines having problems, but there really isn't an excuse for newer stern machines to be broken. \n\nUnfortunately I have to echo the sentiment expressed in other reviews about the attitude of management. My girlfriend was playing Theatre of Magic and, surprise, there were gameplay issues. One of them prevented her from getting a hard earned replay. She mentioned this to the gentleman working, and his response was \"there's nothing I can do about it without taking it apart\". That's fine, but do you have to be rude about it? When your customers are bringing issues to your attention about games they are spending money on, the appropriate response isn't rudeness. \n\nI'm afraid I can't recommend a visit to the hall of fame, and that's a shame because it could be a world class collection.
