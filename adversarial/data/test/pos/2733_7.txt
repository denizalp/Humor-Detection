I went in and asked for something that would be similar (flavor-wise) to an eclair. LOL he didn't know what an eclair is! Kids! Haha.  \n\nSo I asked for a donut with maple icing and a dollop of creme on the top. Could have gone with chocolate but the maple just looked good!   Great donut, no complaints.
