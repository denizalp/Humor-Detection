Warm food and free wifi --Â both are crucial on a cold, winter's eve for a Calgary traveler. The Purple Perk offers both!\n\nWhile visiting YEG for a work trip, I happened to be in the neighborhood and looking for somewhere to get some computing done, while having a decent meal. The glow of the lights drew me in and once I saw jambalaya on the menu, I was enticed to stay.\n\n\"Jambalaya in Calgary, 'eh?\" is what I heard in my mind. But Purple Perk's version is good! Having been to New Orleans, I wouldn't say it's the most authentic version, but it was warm, everything in the bowl was cooked and the jalapeno corn bread added some extra pizzaz.\n\nWith the location and the wifi, the joint was packed! But it seems like people come and go frequently, so finding a table wasn't too bad. And I was only there for about 45 minutes, leaving the space for someone else to take. \n\nA nice coffee shop with a full menu isn't always the easiest to find. The Purple Perk more than served its purpose.
