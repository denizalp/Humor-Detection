I'll make it short and sweet........I wish we would've came here a long time ago with my child.  She's having so much fun and the environment is great and filled with fun and excitement.  I love the concept of all the bounce units in one spot and the kids are definitely safe.   \n\nHonestly if rather come here instead of go to the chuck place lol.  I met the owner and some of his family members and they are down to earth and genuine.  \n\nThe price is great for the entertainment value.  I read a negative review about someone complaining about the price...that's nonsense!  You can't keep your child entertained anywhere for the price of admission here.  \n\nBring your kids and kick back and watch them have fun and tired themselves out!
