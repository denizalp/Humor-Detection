I've been to this location a couple of times and I've never been disappointed by the service or the food. Personally, I love the fact that they serve cretons and buckwheat crepes, plus other not so easy to find delights. Plus, their kid's menu has great value and selection. My little one loves the banana chocolate crepe as a special breakfast treat.\n\nFor a busy place that is usually wall-to-wall on Sundays, I have to say that they have certainly trained their staff right! They are aware and listening to their patrons, making sure that every little detail is right, even at a table of nine where there are five children!\n\nKeep up the good work!
