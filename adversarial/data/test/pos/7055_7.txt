Chinese food is legit here. \nYou know how? \nIf mom says the rice is good, then that means they know what they are doing here! It's all about the rice. \n\nWhat we had on separate occasions:\n-Roast Duck and Roast Pork combo plate - I really liked the roast pork because it was basically roasted pork belly, sliced thin with crispy skin. The duck was meaty and tasty, but we did get some pieces that were not meaty. I guess, they all can't be meaty. \n-Green beans and scallops with XO sauce - the flavors were good but I would need to ask for it to be spicier next time. \n-Salt and Pepper Pork - I did not enjoy this because I found that most of the pieces were mainly fat. About 50% meat and 50% fat. \n-Stone Crab porridge - this is not on the menu and you need to talk to the server about their specialties. I think they may have just made this up? It was incredible because I got to eat the yummies in the shell! \n\nThere is also a pre-prepared food counter if you need to pick up Chinese BBQ and food, fast. \n\nI would definitely come back, for some more roasted pork and crab.
