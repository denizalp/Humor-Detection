We went there for lunch a little while ago. Place looked like they JUST moved in but we asked and they been there for over a year. We order some gyros and i was unplesantly surprised to see that meet is coming gout of the fridge and being thrown on the grill as little flat patties. Bleah how non traditional and fake. It tasted alright at the end. But just barely. I am not going to be back to the place, its just way too \"Fake\".\n\n\"Very Nice! NOT!!!\"\n\nEugene
