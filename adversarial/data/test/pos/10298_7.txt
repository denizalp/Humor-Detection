One of my long lost friends came to town and it was time to wine and dine! Our group was 10 deep and we were super hungry. The day before, I got the opportunity to try Soho Japanese restaurant for the first time, so I had super high expectations. I heard this place was more of an upscale, modern take at a sushi joint, so I was pretty excited!\n\nThis joint is located in a pretty weird strip mall close to Flamingo and Decatur. The inside, though, is completely different. Such a gorgeous setting! Dark wooden floors, aesthetically beautiful wooden designs on the wall, dim lighting and an open kitchen. The interior design work is elegant and high end! When we sat, we were greeted with warm wet towels for our hands and a plate of yellow beets and strawberries. Our server was Naomi and she was definitely sweet and accommodating. The server assistant was just as accommodating. At the end of our evening, we were greeted by Janice, the restaurant manager. She was by far, the most personable employee! I really enjoyed her presence and energy. I really think highly of businesses who have managers humble enough to converse with guests. Awesome! For dinner, here's what I got:\n\nHamachi\/Yellowtail sashimi platter for $11. This is probably the best deal of the day! 5 very thick slices of hamachi on a plate. The fish was super fresh, not a lot of fishy flavor. Those sashimi cuts were on point! HIGHLY RECOMMEND this dish!\n\nMiso soup for $3. This soup was definitely strong on the miso side. It was really salty but didn't hurt the overall experience at all.\n\nHamachi\/Yellowtail nigiri for $2.50 per nigiri. Another fresh pick! The hamachi was topped with a jalapeno miso sauce and micro cilantro which definitely enhanced the overall taste. \n\nHamachi kama for $10. Whenever I visit sushi joints, I always get this dish. Love yellowtail, love the fact that it's grilled and love that it's super flaky yet very marbleized and flavorful.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my time there! This place really takes the time to showcase their love for food. From the garnishes to the side dishes, to the main course, this place focuses on serving great food and aesthetically pleasing dishes. I highly recommend this place for a date night or catching up with friends. Such a great experience, one that will keep me coming back for a long time!
