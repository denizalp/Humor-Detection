We both had burgers. One had green chili and the other had bacon and sauteed mushrooms. The burgers were cooked well done as requested and contained some very good black angus beef. The onion rings ($1.50 upcharge) had the slight edge over the sweet potato fries. Only a few things were slightly wrong.\ngarlic mayo - had no garlic taste\nbun - was crumbly and broke apart.\nhostess - told me she \"could not guarantee to put my game on\"\n\nHostess was like a teenager, so I dismissed the comment, but bartenders seemed clueless about how to switch channels. Eventually, it got worked out. Nice bar though with tons of seating and TV's, so without a huge number of choices in FH, this place seems to have the market cornered on good burgers.
