So, if you'll notice, a lot of the reviews on this page are 5 stars. Except for a one star review at the very bottom and, of course, this review. Keep this in mind.\n\nLet me start by explaining how my car ended up at this auto shop. I was on my way to vegas for EDC, and about 20 miles outside of our destination, my car broke down. I managed to get it towed to Lee's (which was a struggle with AAA but, what are you gonna do.) When I go back the next day to see what's wrong with my car, they tell me to wait while someone goes to check it out. After an hour and a half of waiting, I'm told that the timing chain is broken. \n\nLee's wanted a $1500 deposit up front for parts they were going to order. I looked up how much a timing chain cost online, and it was nowhere near this figure ($300ish if I'm not mistaken). When I asked for the breakdown of everything they wanted to order, the guy helping me begrudgingly listed the parts off rapid-fire. I had to ask him to slow down and repeat himself, to make sure I knew exactly what they wanted $1500 for. Here's what they wanted to order:\n\n-Timing chain kit\n-Intake manifold gaskets\n-Valve cover gaskets\n-Oil pan gaskets\n-Timing cover gaskets\n-Water pump\n-Silicone kit\n-Coolant\n-Oil change\n\nThis seems to me to be a BIT more than just a timing chain. They also said that to repair the car, I was looking at a $2500 starting point, but that the ultimate price would likely be around $3000 for other 'miscellaneous' things they needed to do. They told me they'd call me back on Monday after they've made a thorough examination of the car since I was sure as hell not going to part with $1500 at some unknown auto place in Vegas. They agreed.\n\nMonday rolls around, no call. Tuesday, same deal. I don't think it was Thursday until they called me back to tell me that, actually, the radiator had overheated and damaged the engine, and that my car was totaled. \n\nSo, let me reiterate: they wanted me to drop $1500 on special-order parts (timing chain and all that other unnecessary shit) BEFORE they had actually even TAKEN A LOOK AT MY CAR TO SEE WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS?\n\nWhat a joke. I'm having the car towed to a family member's colleague's mechanic so he can take a look at it and actually tell me what the problem really is, and if there are any other solutions (like, getting a rebuilt engine instead of a new one).\n\nTo get my car out of the shop, I needed to pay the fee for them to look at the car, which came out to $170 (2 hours labor at $85.. steep, but whatever). Then, when I called them back, the price had shot up to over $500. Turns out, the storage fees they said they'd waive were instead included in the price. They wouldn't honor the fees being waived, but I managed to talk them down to a final price of $245. \n\nSo basically: this auto shop is SCAM CENTRAL. All the owners of cars breaking down on the i-15 being towed here are inevitably going to be SCAMMED, just like I was.\n\nDon't let this happen to you. Oh, and those 5 star reviews? You bet your ass they're fake.
