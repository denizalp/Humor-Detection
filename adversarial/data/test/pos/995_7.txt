Yelp Challenge 365 # 178\/365\n\nI can't believe there is only 1 other review of Hawaiian's Las Vegas location. Do I have the wrong address????? \n\nWell, and for not much longer, you would arrive and depart out of Terminal 2 at McCarran International Airport. To a large degree Terminal 2 is a good thing because Hawaiian is one of a few airlines who fly out of Terminal 2 so foot traffic is less, security checkpoints are easier and shuttle bus service is available as well. \n\nIF you are flying the pineapple express which leaves Las Vegas at 1:55 am the downside is the terminal and counter does NOT open until 11:30 pm so if you're at the airport before then- you jus have to sit and wait. Also, the vendors up at gate are closed. \n\nThis may not be an issue once the relocate to the new terminal
