Apex, I'm not going to lie...I complained to my friends about leaving the strip to try you out.  I just didn't see you coming because, WOW, did we have a GREAT time! We can't decide if it was the service or the view that tipped us over the edge, but doesn't matter because they nailed it.  Thank you Apex for playing great music, not being snooty to us in our 40's, welcoming us and treating us sweet the whole night.  We had an amazing table with an incredible view.  We can't wait to go back--definitely worth the trip...the PALMS is back.
