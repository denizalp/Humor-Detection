We stayed at the Golden Gate for Halloween. I had a decent experience the first time, a few years ago. This round was slightly less impressive. The room was hot during the day and freezing at night. After two consecutive nights of the heater not working and mornings with runny noses, I called down to the front desk. I explained that neither the air conditioning nor the heat was working in our room. Much to my surpirse, I was told that neither the air NOR the heat was activated in ANY of the rooms. Furthermore, it would NOT be. I explained that the room was stifling during the day and bitterly cold at night. \"Sorry. We can bring you another blanket.\" We were able to tolerate the incredibly loud noise directly below from Fremont (and that is on any given day, holiday or not), but to not give a paying customer the option for warmth? Last, but not least...the shower would consistently turn scalding in a split second. For the duration of a five minute shower, I was scalded six times. Unacceptable all around.
