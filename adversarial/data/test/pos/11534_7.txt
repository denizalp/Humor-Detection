I adore it here; it's so cute and should I say \"girly\". The bakery is small but cozy, complete with comfy chairs, wooden tables, wicker accents, floral details, and beautifully decorated cakes on display. There's also a poster of Audrey Hepburn in \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" on the wall. Last time I went here, they had a gigantic gingerbread house in front and Christmas songs in the background to celebrate the holiday season. The service is so friendly here, which is another reason to come to Crown Bakery for your carbohydrate fix. \n\nCrown Bakery serves hot and cold drinks and other treats like Pat Bing Soo (Korean Shaved Ice). But what really make this bakery amazing are the baked goods- pastries, cookies and cakes galore. I love the flavor of Korean-style breads, from sponge cakes to peanut cream buns to their signature Mr. Kim Bun.  The Mr. Kim Bun is delicious- an ever-so-soft bun intertwined with peanut-butter crumbles and red beans. I couldn't stop eating it even though I promised myself I would only eat half. I especially love the red bean mochi bun, which is a hybrid between bread and mochi filled with red bean and fried to crispy perfection. What results is a sweet treat with a chewy glutinous outside and a creamy red bean center. It's rich, sweet, and oh so good. These mochi treats are located on the cashier counter. \n\nIn my opinion, Korean-style breads seem healthier and lighter than traditional American desserts like cupcakes and cookies. And while the best Korean-style breads are found in Korea, Crown Bakery is, so far, the best Korean bakery in town.
