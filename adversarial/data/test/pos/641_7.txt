Arrived at the location on Eastern during regular business hours on 5\/7\/2017. Attendant puts a sign (he will be back in 30 min) up and walks into the service station and sits down to play on his phone. I ask him he can smog my truck, i don't have 30 minuets to wait and he then has attitude. Guess what, you are going to be out of a job soon when people quit spending money with Jiffy Smog. When that happens you can play on your phone all you want until it gets shut off! I will never spend another $$ at Jiffy Smog, and do my best that no one I know does either. Have a wonderful day Jiffy Smog!!
