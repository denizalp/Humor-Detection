Don't buy the sushi here. That's all, you'll thank me later. I bought the arizona and the Las vegas roll. 6 pieces each - for 18.50?. The flavor is bland. The portion and size is the smallest of sushi I have ever eaten.   There's no eel sauce on their sauces on the side. \n\nLiterally 18 dollars for 12 pieces of sushi?\nI will never come back here. \n\nHad to drive through McDonald's to satisfy our stomach. Can't believe I went here for a sushi.\nProbably the worst sushi I ever tasted, as the other person with me said \"frys cold sushi is better than this\".\n\nPlease stay away if you want sushi...
