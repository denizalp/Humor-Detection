Lame-ass Liquor Store.\n\nI can't check out of this place without the guy behind the counter asking \"Air Miles, bro?\" in the most half-baked surfer voice I've ever heard midtown.\n\nWine selection blows goats, from cheap favourites (they don't carry Cantina di Negrar's $12 Valpolicella) to vintages (I once went in for a bunch of California Zins, they had none of the four I was looking for(.\n\nBeer shelves are poorly stocked.  Even worse, all the good beer is in the warm section, and all the lousy stuff is in the cold section.\n\nThe final straw, the one that drove me to write this review, was this weekend.  How incompetent must an LCBO outlet's staff be if they can't even keep the handy little cardboard beer carriers (you know, the ones you build yourself to carry 8 cans?) in stock?  Now I not only have to buy warm beer, I have to juggle it!
