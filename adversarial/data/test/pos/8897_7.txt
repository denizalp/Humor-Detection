I know we're talking about a Taco Bell here and who really reviews Taco Bell, anyway? But I need to get this off my chest. \n\nThis is officially the worst Taco Bell on the east side. They never make anything right. And they're only nice when the manager is watching.\n\nI went just last night because I left work late and had a meeting and wanted a quick bean burrito on the way. I ordered 2, and it was fast. Too fast, actually. There was nobody in the drive through line at all yet I could hear the manager inside yelling to speed things up. Sure enough, when I got my burritos they were made fast. Too fast, actually. I think they might have had about 2 tablespoons of beans in them. When you make a bean burrito and it is almost devoid of beans you know you've screwed something up.\n\nNow, two unsatisfactory burritos are not enough to earn my first one star review. It actually took some work on their part. I have had so much bad attitude and bad food from this location that I can honestly say I think it's the worst Taco Bell anywhere near me. Go to the one on Lee Rd or on Euclid. (Yeah, I'll drive to East Cleveland for Taco Bell!)
