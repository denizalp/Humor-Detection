I'm usually pretty long-winded with my reviews. But then, there's this:\n\nI literally forgot-- completely fucking FORGOT-- that I stayed here for a few days last year.\n\nPROS: Oh, wait, we got a cabana for like seventy bucks. I seem to remember that being adequate. I feel like we got a free buffet (although in hindsight, I feel like it wasn't very good).\n\nCONS: Dude, no, seriously, my Partner-in-Crime and I had to think for roughly four or five minutes about where the hell we stayed that time we went to Vegas in August last year. \n\nVERDICT: no, really. I'm gonna go ahead and just call this place the Bermuda Triangle of my brain. Nothing sticks out as particularly lame, nothing seems to be piquing the \"awesome\" sphere of my brain (other than the company I was keeping), so, um, I'll give this place a vote of, \"Um, sure?\"\n\n(NOTE: ..dude, no, srrsly. NOTHING about this place stands out in my brain and that concerns me, somewhat. I think I ACTUALLY may have paid to stay in Limbo.)
