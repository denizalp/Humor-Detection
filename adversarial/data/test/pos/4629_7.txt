CLT has several news outlets throughout the airport that sell newspapers, books and magazines and other stuff you might need for your flight. Sodas, candies and other snacks too. This is the only such vendor in the A concourse near gate A5, which is where the Delta, United, Southwest and \"old\" American flights depart.\n\nPrices can be high as expected when you have a captive audience.
