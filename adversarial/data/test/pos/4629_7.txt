We were out in the Northwest on our haunted house expedition, and decided to stop in because we hadn't been here in years. It was kind of late so the restaurant area was closed. I HATE sitting at barstools, but they had this weird sort of option of sitting on really tall padded benches against the wall. Slightly more comfortable, but the Anaconda said he felt like a little kid with his feet dangling.\n\nGot the bacon cheeseburger with sweet potato waffle fries. Burger was well cooked and tasty, and the hot, crispy fries came with a thin, sweet dipping sauce that went perfectly. Baby Sis got a house specialty sandwich with bratwurst. She said it was good but I can't personally attest since I didn't actually get a bite. She never was good at sharing.\n\nService was fine- friendly staff who seemed a little overworked. Pleasant vibe- they played a lot of classic rock mixed with country hits which seemed to cover the customer base pretty well. (About half of which were chatting and happy while the others were hunched over the video poker machines in their own private hell. I feel your pain.)\n\nNow for the part that, for me, lost them their fourth star, but ironically, made the Anaconda and Baby Sis want to give them 5: they let you smoke at the #@$! table! WTF!  Am I the only one who recalls a law passed not that long ago that prohibited smoking in food service areas? What the hell ever happened to that??!! \n\nThey sat there dreamily puffing away, declaring that it was such a treat not to have to go outside for their post-meal coffin nails, that this was their new favorite restaurant. I wanted to call the police.
