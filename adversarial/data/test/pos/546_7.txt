Very misleading, and I feel cheated. \n\nThis place is marketed as \"handmade products\", which makes a consumer like myself who is wary of parabens, phthalates, sulfates, BPAs, preservatives and what-have-you- basically the nasty stuff that can damage your skin- think that this is a safe place to shop. \n\nWrong. \n\nI even told the people who helped me that I was looking for a product free of these things, because I have sensitive skin, am prone to acne, and even use medication for my acne. Well, the people in this store didn't even know what was in their products. They just want to make a sale.\n\nCaveat emptor. Truth is, I should have carefully read the labels, but the ladies in here were seemingly helpful. I brought home three or four different products and the first one I used had methylparaben:\n\n\"Studies indicate that methylparaben applied on the skin may react with UVB, leading to increased skin aging and DNA damage.[6][7]\" (Wikipedia article on methylparaben)\n\nFool me once, \"shame on...shame on me. Fool me twice- well, ya ain't gonna fool me twice\" because I'm not gonna come back here. Thank goodness they have another store where I live, because I'm returning these products ASAP. \n\nTo the managers, owners, shareholders: take the crap out of the products. You have great potential and the products could be wonderful. Your staff is very kind and friendly but you will lose customers marketing this way. \n\nVery disappointed and sad. Really wanted to love this store.
