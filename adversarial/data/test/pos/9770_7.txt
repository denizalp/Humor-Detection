Pusateri's - the lesser evil compared to Whole Foods in the Yorkville area.  Located at Yorkville and Bay, the clientele is quite elite.\n\nThe reason why I would give Pusateri's a leg up from Whole Foods is because they do sell some unique items that you cannot find at a local grocery store - namely imported European products.  While this location is small compared to its Avenue Road counter part, it is a neat place to stop by for bistro fare (soup\/salad, sandwiches, baguettes, baked goods, coffee).  \n\nIt is very reminiscent of a European grocery store, and the staff are very friendly.  While this is not a one-stop-shop for all your grocery needs (unless you just bleed money), it is worth it to stop by once in awhile.  \n\nIn the summertime, the outdoor patio is a nice place to people watch or sip a coffee while enjoying a book.
