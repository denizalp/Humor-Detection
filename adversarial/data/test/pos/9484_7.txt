This wasn't the worse hotel I've stayed. But it was definitely my least favorite amongst the hotels I've previously stayed in Las Vegas \n\nI booked a last minute ticket and hotel. And this is where I ended. The price was great online. But what Expedia failed to add to the price upfront was the 34 dollar a day resort fee. It kind of sucked because I didn't even stay at the room neither night in Vegas. (Hey!! I was on vacation) \n\nThe staff really does harasses you a lot about coupons or getting a free room. It's cute at first. But eventually get very annoying. \n\nThe hallway on the tower I was in was a bit dated. But it wasn't trashy or anything. It was kind of like staying a Hilton that hadn't been renovated yet. But not outdated. \n\nWould I choose this hotel again. Probably not. But if I just needed a place to lay my head. I suppose it would be okay.
