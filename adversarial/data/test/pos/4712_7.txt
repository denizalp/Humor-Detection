This is probably my newest favorite place for sushi! I didn't know what to expect, but i was pleasantly surprised! Their rolls were not over stuffed with rice and from what I had the nigri was super fresh. We sat in front of the owner and he kept our food coming steadily. He actually was making things for my husband, like the mackerel or the super white tuna, which both these items he generally doesn't like but liked it at Sushi Freak! I love that he added sea salt and lemon to the octopus and he did the same with the scallops! \n\nService was awesome! The 3 ladies working there were very attentive and so were the sushi chefs. I definitely will be back and they have a great assortment of rolls that a pregnant lady, like me can eat that doesn't have tuna or raw fish! Definitely a place to go for AYCE great sushi!
