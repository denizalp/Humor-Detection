I was so excited to eat at Barringtons for my birthday dinner. I'd heard and read so many rave reviews, I was sure it would be amazing. It wasn't. In fact, to say I was underwhelmed is an understatement. Where to start? We had a reservation for 8 and they even called us to confirm. But when we showed up, they made us wait for 15 minutes and there was nowhere TO wait because the bar was full of other diners in the same position. Waiting for their tables to turn. Pacing wasn't much better after we were seated as we watched our waiter do a series of odd jobs other than wait on tables (never mind ours) for 20 minutes. We only had water and menus. The menu isn't so long that it takes 20 minutes to make a choice. When we finally ordered, the food came quickly, but that was my next disappointment. My shrimp dumplings were only OK, and frankly tasted previously frozen. The halibut main course was a nice but TINY piece if fish, and the sauce flavors were almost too subtle. If I'm going to pay $29 for an entree, I expect more than six or seven bites of food! The highlight of the meal actually was dessert. We had a lemon marscapone cake with blueberry frozen yogurt and candied almonds which was superb! The flavors blended perfectly and the cake was light and moist. \n\nOther than the food lacking that \"fine dining\" perfection I would have expected, the space itself is awful. It's not \"small\/intimate\" it's \"small\/claustrophobic\" and oppressively loud! The bar was perpetually full to overflowing into the tiny room and the tables are so tiny there's barely room for the plate and beverage. I'm only 5'2\" and 110lbs and I felt like I was sitting at a child's width table at adult height. It felt more like a chain restaurant's ambiance than a place you go for a special occasion that's for sure! \n\nOn the whole, a major disappointment. Maybe the economy has them packing people at the bar to up drink sales ( and overbooking to do it), maybe we hit an off-night,  I don't know, but I wouldn't go back. I should have gone back to Ratcliffe on the Green instead. That is a fine-dining experience. Barringtons was not.\n\nADDENDUM: I just re-read other reviews and wonder if I even ate at the same restaurant (yes, I know it WAS Barringtons, don't worry, I'm being sarcastic)! There was no four course option where we would get selections chosen by the chef, the chef never made an appearance, it was not quiet and intimate, it was loud, stuffy and decidedly \"suburban,\" and the fact that people don't seem to mind dropping $150 for salad and pasta, or appetizer and tiny entree is astounding to me when there are such amazing meals to be had in Charlotte for the same or LESS!
