$60 for 24-hrs is so worth it if u r staying more than a day in LV. Sign-up for the free Total Rewards membership first at any of the participating hotels. There were no lines at the buffets we went to as we visited LV in a not-so-crazy mid-November. \n\nSpice Market in Planet Hollywood: 1) Ambiance isn't great but we had the best table attendant one can have in all of Vegas. A big, lovely African-American woman. Sorry we didn't get her name. 2) Food selection is just okay buy they have good seafood corner sans crab legs. 3) Enjoyed their crab salad too. \n\nLe Village in Paris: 1) Great ambiance. 2) Awesome selection of French cuisine. 3) They have shelled crab legs! 4) Best that we've been to (so far). 5) Very popular! It wasn't a weekend and table reservation on Yelp was full, but we still took our chance to get supper and happy to see that there was no line, after all. Place was full when we left. \n\nParadise Garden in Flamingo: 1) I'd say this buffet is underrated. 2) Great salad layout. 3) Loved their pork adobo. 4) You get a view of their outside garden with pink flamingos, big kois swimming in the pond, and duck loons. Ask to be seated by the window. \n\nBacchanal in Caesar's Palace: 1) Who wants to pay extra $25\/person on top of what you've already paid for Buffet of Buffets? No! We turned around after being told of the extra fee at the entrance. 2) Based on the reviews, it's not super-duper anyway. So right there and then, this place is overrated. \n\nBe sure to leave a few $ tip on the table after dining.
