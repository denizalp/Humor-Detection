eeeeek! I was not impressed....more than that, I was bored for 75% of it. I understand this is a very long running show, but in my opinion any other Cirque show would have been a better choice. As a Cirque show collector, I have to say that I felt like I wasn't much of a fan if I hadn't seen Mystere, so I made it a priority for my recent trip to LV. The seats were cheap, we bought them ahead of time with a dinner package at the steak house in Treasure Island and tried to make the night special for this seasoned show. However, the show failed to deliver in the entertainment arena. The old man that kept appearing was annoying, the giant baby was creepy and gave me nightmares.....the props were unimpressive. I think it's time that this show moves on and something more exciting takes it's place.
