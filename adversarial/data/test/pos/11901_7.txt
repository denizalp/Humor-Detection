Images Restaurant is who I'm writing this review for.\nGotta say I was very disappointed in the food & service.\nI ordered a cheese, ham & egg omelet with a side of 5 bacon.\nI went after work with two co-workers who were already there. Once I sat down a lady came over & I ordered a water. Then shortly after I asked for a cocktail & was told they would send the cocktail waitress over. Well I waited & waited & no one came. So I asked someone who was walking by for the cocktail waitress. \nShortly after she came & took my drink order. Then the food came & it was disgusting! They used process cheese slices on top of the omelet & inside it. This cheese was nasty & ruined the omelet so I couldn't eat it. Also the hash browns that came with the meal tasted like they had soaked them in spray butter. I had asked for my bacon to be soggy not crispy & of course it came out crispy. So I told the waitress & she took it away after I asked for soggy bacon again & then I had asked if I could have the 3 side of bacon not 5. She came back with the bacon on a different plate & it kinda looked like the same bacon she first brought. Apparently bacon is not cooked to order here. I told her it wasn't soggy the way I liked it but she left it on the table anyways & there was 6 pieces of bacon not 3 & walked off. \nWhen it was check time, mind you we never asked for it, she just brought it over she asked me if I wanted  a to-go container because I had barely touched my food & I told her no thanks & told her that I didn't like my food. As anyone who had some common sense could see this since I took like 2 bites of it. Well you would of thought she would of said sorry & taken it off my bill.......NOPE she did neither & I paid for a nasty meal that I refused to eat. Ten thumbs down Images Restaurant & staff!!
