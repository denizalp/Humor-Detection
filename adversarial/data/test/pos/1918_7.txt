Long story short.....\nYou are basically paying for the all you can eat seafood part. And that.....was delicious. So why only 3 stars?\n\nFor $60+ per person, I would prefer meat that doesn't have gristle and as dry as a bone. Mashed potatoes were cold, and the mac and cheese wasn't the best. If you want an \"upper class\" buffet in Vegas, I guess you'll be happy here. (Stick to the seafood).\n\nOtherwise, I'd rather use that money to lose in the casino, as opposed to a meal that, despite the plethora of options, actually had me dissatisfied...and somewhat hungry (and I'm skinny). Probably won't be returning any time soon
