Because of a horrific experience I had with the bartender in whom ordered me the hottest wings known to man, he refused to take them back, especially when I specifically asked for not hot. He got in my face and ordered me to eat them. Ever since that night with scum bag behind the bar I've never stepped foot in there since. This is the kind of place where the saying applies: you get what you pay for.  So far I've not been in that establishment and life couldn't be better
