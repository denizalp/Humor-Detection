Went inside and was told I must buy something if I want to get a water cup, which is technically illegal in state of Arizona. I've been there multiple times to hangout and snack on some appetizers and even asked to do an advertising project for my granddaughters media class featuring them and the owner acted angry we was there \"bothering his customers\" when there was two people there and it was in the morning on a slow Tuesday. The pizza is soggy which is why if I ever do go there, I'd stick with the simple fried food that is hard to mess up. Their cheese curds are the only thing worth ordering in my opinion.
