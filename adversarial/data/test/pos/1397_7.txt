Heard about the bento boxes but opted for the chirashi. Ordered through Eat24 and they made my order after I arrived, which is a pet peeve of mine but it was ready fast and fresh. The portion size was okay; the fish was cut a little thinner than expected. The eel was really good though, so maybe that's the bowl to go for. The smoothies are also good, and I especially appreciate that they don't use any added sugar so they're actually healthy and make a great lunch when it's too hot to eat solid food.
