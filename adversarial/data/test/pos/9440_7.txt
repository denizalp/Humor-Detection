This place was good. LoL. Such a bland review huh? Well we went for sushi, ended up getting the AYCE dinner. Everything was ok, they give you 60 mins, but IDK if they actually time you. We were there for 35 mins and were stuffed. The sushi was pretty good. I didn't get to have my Ahi Sashimi I usually get and no, I didn't want to get sushi and take off the rice! The chefs were nice (and flirty) but the waitress took forever. I'd go again because its close but hmmmm not my fav. Very good if someone is new to sushi so they can try sushi and also have cooked items.
