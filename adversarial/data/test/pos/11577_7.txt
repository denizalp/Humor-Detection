Unfortunately, my first ever Yelp review is in response to perhaps the worst dining experience I have ever had; which is saying something, considering I've probably averaged 200+ restaurant meals per year over the past 11 years. \n\nIf this review was about the food, I'd have given it 3 stars - not great, not terrible. We had originally gone to this neighborhood to have some poutine at a neighboring establishment, but there was a significant outdoor wait in -20 Celsius weather, so we came here.  Perhaps the wait would have been a more comfortable experience.  \n\nMy wife and I both ordered the \"Chinese\" style fondue - hers with chicken, mine with thinly sliced beef.  The sauces they gave us were just OK.  The cooking is up to you, the consumer, so you need to be careful or you may over or under cook your food.  The cooking broth was nicely spiced.  \n\nBut the \"service\" we received was poor, bordering on hostile. I think the waitress was annoyed that we didn't order alcoholic drinks or upgrade to the \"feast\" option with our meal. After ordering, my wife asked our waitress for a water refill and then waited about 7-10 minutes before we saw her again.  We continued to wait for our food without our her checking in on us, until we flagged her down so that we could each get a refill of water.....we waited again for the food and the water (probably another 10 minutes) and I repeatedly made eye contact with this waitress, hoping she would at least bring us the water.  But she ignored us, while she tended to other customers....mind you, the water was sitting on a table 7 feet away, but it would be rude\/inappropriate to fetch our own water, so we didn't. \n\nWhen she finally served us our water and the meat (but not the cooking broth) portion of the meal she was extremely curt when I asked if she knew when the broth would arrive.  \n\nAnyway, eventually the broth did arrive and we had an OK meal, but by that point our dinner had been pretty much spoiled.  We would have ordered two portions of their probably delicious, but overpriced ($10) chocolate fondue and given her a nice tip had our experience been different. Throughout this ordeal, my wife and I were completely polite and did not say anything cross to our waitress, so I seriously don't get why we were treated the way we were being treated.\n\nAlas, we asked for our check and got a somewhat hostile explanation that we couldn't put a gratuity on our credit card.  It's just as well, because it made it easier to leave her a $1 cash tip that was probably $1 too much, and a note about the hostile service.
