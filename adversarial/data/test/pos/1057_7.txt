Nice place. Very clean, they make the pizza right in front of you. The regular pricing is reasonable. Great location in Old Farm Shoppes and parking is always available. This is a quality place that is run right.\nIt's not as good as Papa Del's but Papa Del's takes 90 minutes or longer to deliver a pizza that has often cooled or slid into a lump of cheese by the time the delivery boy finished smoking the doobie on the way to your house.\nSo with Papa Murphy's it's no tip, hot out of your own oven, and Dow Chemical is happy because each pizza uses two square yards of Saran Wrap.
