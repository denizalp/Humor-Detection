ok so everytime i go to this chain i always regret it afterwards. Of course i ignored my experience and went for my desire. After you eat there you feel like you just inhaled an elephant. And for the life of me I have no idea why but whenever i eat here I get projectile diarrhea...in fact i went to robertos one time and I had to use the bathroom before i ate and i walked into the most disgusting bathroom i have ever seen..he evidently had just had a meal there. That was enough to keep me from ordering at all. From now on I think i will just pass on this chain its obviously not the best food nor does it agree with me.
