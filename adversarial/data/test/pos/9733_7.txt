First time in Phoenix and saw this place on Yelp.  Didn't really think AZ was known for bbq but decided to give this place a whirl. The bbq was surprisingly yummy.  I had the baby backs and spicy sausage. The bbq wasn't drenched in sauce which is how I like it. Huge portions and very reasonable prices. Their cinnamon sugar donuts at the end of the meal are so addicting!  Friendly staff as well with lots of seating.
