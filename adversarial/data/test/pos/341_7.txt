The view is amazing for 360 degrees... The ambiance is quite chill and the DJ on Friday night is decent. Mostly top 40 and EDM infused mixes playing through the speakers. \n\nThe late happy hour is only for food and the reason this place gets a couple of stars knocked out of the sky is because of the service and the food that is served. The buns on the sliders were hard enough to break a window on impact and the calamari was soggy (probably microwaved for happy hour). It also took forever for the waitress to make her way around to us. I could have taken the stairs to level 0, walk to the liquor store and walk back up the stairs to Level 107 before she came back with our order. \n\nThis place has a lot of potential, it just needs a facelift in a few places. The view is main reason this gets 3 stars.
