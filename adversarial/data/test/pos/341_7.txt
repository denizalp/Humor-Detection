First off, total bull crap on the free coffee check in, always free at any dealership. \n\nWent there cause I was told on the phone they had the car I wanted but of course not true. \n\"Oh no Boss, Xterra not pathfinder\"\n\nPushed toward new when I clearly and repeatedly said used or cert pre own\n\nTypical \n\nWe went to Henderson and told them about it and they said it happens all the time.
