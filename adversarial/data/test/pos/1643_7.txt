I've lived in this area approximately 6+ years and I've used the kiosk at this post office many times. I love the efficiency and ease of use. \n\nHowever in the past two weeks I've had to go inside three times and interact with the USPS staff. Goodness! Many of them are doing their job, that isn't necessarily the issue. First thing is most of them seem miserable. I mean these people all seem so genuinely unhappy. The next is that on every one of my most recent three interactions, a customer was unhappy and\/or frustrated. All three issues were different, but all three customers complained that someone else used to let them do this or someone else told them the could... It just seems like some of the people enjoy saying no. Almost everyone I interacted with was slightly rude or at the least very abrupt.  Two of the young guys working in the back to get your packages are both very nice. Although the woman working back there was very unfriendly. Going forward if I need to speak to a person I would try to go to a different location if possible.
