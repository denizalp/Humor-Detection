Don't move here. You'll regret it.\nI'm literally counting down the days until my lease is up until I can't get away from this disgusting place. It looks nice, but the people who live here are very trashy and love to vandalize\/hit your car without care (which happened to my whole backside of my car with no bother to leave a note in BROAD DAYLIGHT). They don't really care who moves here, as long as they're getting paid, so every neighbor seems like they had a long time dream on becoming a sh*tty rap DJ\/woman abuser at late hours of the night. Trash is literally EVERYWHERE in the complex. People don't clean up after their dogs. This place was nice when my mother lived here 9 years ago when it was new (she referred me here), but now it's just as trashy as Las Vegas can get. It's in the middle of bum f*ck no where, so go figure only cheap ghetto people live here. Do yourself a favor and look somewhere else.
