I wasn't really quite sure how to review this company. I've never had lawn maintenance before so wasn't really sure what to expect. I was very impressed with their professionalism when they came out to give me a quote.  The gentleman walked the property while I was at work and was available to me when I called to answer all my questions.  Their price was higher than others but I was impressed and sold by their promptness and friendliness. \n\nWe've been using them for about 3 monthes now and they've always showed up the day they are supposed to.  The quality of the work is very good and billing is easy with their auto pay service.\n\nOn the negative side, I've become a bit defensive with them because it's starting to feel like I'm a money tree for them.\n\n\"Oh, you have a leak in your irrigation. That will cost 80$ to fix.\"  \n\n\"Fine\", I say. \n\nThe week after there's another leak and a story of how I really should replace my entire system because it's so old. This upsets me because I just paid 80 bucks to fix something that according to them wasn't worth fixing and I should have replaced in the first place.  \n\nThey have also mentioned that my tree in the front yard, that was just trimmed and maintained by an arborist, really needs some work and quoted me $600 (Inc discount) for a job I paid the arborist full price of 400$ to do. The tree looks great and doesn't need work. \n\nI really feel like I'm just another sale to them and that they're really just looking to line their pockets.   I also understand that they're a business and their whole point is to make money but it rubs me the wrong way. \n\nI should also mention that recently sent out an email offering a $25 discount if you give them a 5 star yelp review. Obviously I'm forgoing that to try and give honest feedback. Seems to defeat the purpose of a rating website if companies can just buy 5 star reviews. \n\nSo to recap:\n\nGreat, friendly people. \nSlightly pricy\nWork is competed on time and satisfactorily\nQuestionable selling practices. \n\nGood luck!
