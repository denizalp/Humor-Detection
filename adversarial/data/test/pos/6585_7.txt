I have been hearing all the talk about hot yoga so, I figured I would give it a try when I saw a deal on Groupon.\n\nThe instructors here are awesome!! I tried the yoga class and it was much more difficult then I expected it to be. I never expected that yoga would be such a good work out. You deformity sweat in that room so, bring plenty of water.\n\nI also tried the Hot Pilates. It was also a great work out and more intense than the yoga class. It was more of a strength building and muscle toning class. It was much more exhausting than the yoga class. Again, bring plenty of water.\n\nThe rooms smell disgusting, but I guess that is every Hot Yoga place. Bikram Yoga is just not for me though. It's just too damn hot!  If you enjoy Hot Yoga though, then give this place a try. Don't forget to bring your yoga mat and your towel.
