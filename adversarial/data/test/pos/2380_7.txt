This casino in Montreal is quite popular.  It is housed in a tall structure, and I believe it has 5 floors.  The 5th floor is all restaurants.  The restaurants were all closed by the time we arrived at the casino.\n\nThe casino has all the games one would expect.  Plenty of slot machines and table games.  I left with more money than I came in with which is always a good thing.  There are no beautiful women to offer you drinks while you play.  This is not Las Vegas.  What they do have is a complimentary beverage bar.  You can help yourself to their fountain drink machine, coffee machine, water machine, and some juices as well.  Very cool indeed!!\n\nThe evening we were there, a band was playing and singing.  It was nice to watch and listen to the entertainment while gambling.\n\nIf you are a tourist, then I would not call this Casino a \"Must Visit\" destination in Montreal.  I only go here cause my relatives love coming here.
