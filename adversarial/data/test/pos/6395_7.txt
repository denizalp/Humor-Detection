OMG ... everything about this place was on point!!\n\nI had bookmarked this for my trip to the Sin City and looking forward to it, so I was concerned that my expectations would be so high that I might be let down.  Um, negative.  We took a cab over to Paradise and have found our new favorite restaurant in Vegas!\n\nFrom the ambiance, dark and trendy, to the food, rich and delicious, this place did not miss a beat.  The mac n' cheese is a must if you love mac!  And the stuffed dates ... om nom nom.  \n\nWe didn't have any issues catching a cab back either, as the hostess station was accommodating with this, too. We will definitely be back!
