I'll just go ahead and get my main gripe out of the way: Mesa Grill is one of the most unimpressive looking 'fancy' restaurants that I have been to.  If it wasn't for the fact that it is in the middle of Cesar's Palace, I would have guessed that it was just your average South-Western\/Mexican restaurant.  It was when the hostess asked me to remove my hat when I realized that they take themselves pretty seriously here, and thanks to the food, rightfully so.\n\nMy meal was delicious! I ordered the Tiger Shrimp Sweet Corn Tamale as an appetizer, the New York Steak as my main entr√©e, and mash potatoes as a side.  I actually had a difficult time selecting what I wanted, because although the menu is small, most of the items were unusual dishes that I wasn't interested in trying.  The menu consisted of a lot of seafood and less traditional meats, and I just wanted something basic.  Thankfully everything that I ordered turned out to be really good.  The highlight was the shrimp appetizer.  It was ridiculously priced for how tiny it was, but the combination of flavors was outstanding.  The theme of the meal in general was flavor, and everything from the bread to the pear margarita that I ordered pack a ton of it.  \n\nIn addition to my food, I tried my date's Pork Tenderloin.  It was amazing!  I would highly recommend it as a main dish, and it is most likely what I would order the next time I am here.\n\nMesa Grill is not a place that I could eat at all of the time, nor is it a place I would take someone to impress with ambiance.  However, they have superbly flavorful food that was well worth the visit.  It will not be one of my 'go-to' places when I visit the strip, but I can see myself coming back from time to time.
