What a big sloppy mess - sadly I mean the food, not me. Maybe I wasn't drunk enough?\n\nWe were seated immediately upon entering at 3am on a Wednesday.\n\nOur Sage Fried Chicken orders (1 Benedict and 1 with Bacon Waffles) took ~25 mins to come out, which in hindsight was not worth the wait. \n\nYes the portions were redonkulously ginormous. But the flavors: disappointingly subpar; the presentation: unappetizing; and the overall execution left us unsatisfied. \n\nTwo decadent things that make ANYTHING \"Benedict\" sexcellent: hollandaise sauce and perfectly poached eggs. \n\nSo right off the bat this \"Benedict\" is lacking:\n* hollandaise is substituted with their \"chipotle cream\"... Boooo;\n* no yolky goodness. What should've been poached eggs (per my request) still came out scrambled (per standard menu description). Ugh I was so looking forward to satisfying my need to poke a runny yolk. \n\nMy husband liked the mash potatoes my meal was plated atop but I discarded the mushy biscuits beneath the kitchen-sink pile of fluff on my plate... Including the sticks of uncooked spaghetti impaling my food. Hella random garnish - I just didn't get it. \n\nBottom line: there are better things we could've spent our $50 on: black jack, pai gow, wheel of fortune, and\/or more alcohol.\n\n#meh #FoodieRant #ShouldaPutMyMoneyInASlotMachineInstead
