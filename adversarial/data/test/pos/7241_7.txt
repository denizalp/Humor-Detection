Some visits are better than others, why\/how? THE SERVICE. \n\nMY WORD.....you are a federal employee with federal benefits....SMILE. You won't die. Answer a question without a *sigh*....YOU WON'T DIE. Open a second window or dare I say a 3rd window, why? Because people are in the waiting area; all staring like drones; listening to one LOUD talker and his\/her asinine conversation. And guess what? YOU STILL WON\"T DIE. \n\nOverall....2.5 stars because I haven't really experienced better from any Social Security office between the states that I have visited or lived in but I can't wholeheartedly support a 3 star rating based on YELP'S verbiage. \n\nHours are FICKLE: They are open from 9a-4pm but lock the door at 3:45pm and you are not allowed to be serviced or take a number to receive service if you walked in, unknowingly, as someone walked out and let you in. I have no quarrels with letting in people after closing because everyone wants to go home but prepare to miss work\/go in late\/or leave early just to handle business with this office. I guess the window clerks must have other job duties that make them cranky before working the window. PLEASE DENOTE: this isn't a full 8 hours to service the public.
