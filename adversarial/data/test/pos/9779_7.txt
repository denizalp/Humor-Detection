For a place that supposedly specializes in \"rice bowls\", their rice was inedibly bad. It was totally hard and undercooked. The flavours were okay but that hardly matters when the rice taste like rocks. There were also bones in the salmon. The prices are too high considering what you actually get, especially the for the shrimp bowl, three tiny shrimps with some rice and it's $14? This entire experience was so disappointing for a restaurant that claims to serve the \"ultimate donburi\", I am cringing so hard at all these false claims on their social media pages. Definitely would not recommend.\n\n--EDIT--\nI love how two 5-star reviews showed up within 15 minutes of each other after my review, and both of them praised the quality of the rice, something that is usually not worth mentioning but they had to try to discredit my claims. Both of those 5-star reviews are also the first reviews left by those two accounts. It would appear that both of those accounts were created today as well. Not fishy at all...
