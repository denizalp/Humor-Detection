For two months, my husband and I researched and interviewed surgeons for a Breast Reduction and Lift + Abdominoplasty (Tummy Tuck) surgery for myself.  It was important to us to interview a female physician to gain a woman's perspective, which is why we went to the Carlotti Cosmetic Surgery Center to meet with Dr Michelle Cabret-Carlotti.\n  \nOur consultation appointment was a very positive experience for many reasons.  From being greeted by the receptionist, taken back to the consultation room Dr Carlotti's assistant and then meeting with Dr Carlotti, we were impressed with the professional, friendly and down to earth atmosphere.  \n\nThe one major decision making point for us was how Dr Michelle handled the consultation with us.  Her attention to detail on my past medical history, her ability to discuss options, risks and answer the many questions we had in laymen terms and her understanding of how I felt as a women were all key.  Most importantly was two surgeons, Dr Michelle and her husband Dr Albert Carlotti would perform the surgery hence reducing the time under anesthesia.  \n\nSurgery was very successful and the post operative care from the entire Carlotti staff has been second to none.  They truly care and helped us through every step of the entire process.\n\nI am now 1 month post op, feeling great and loving my results.  At 50 + years old, I have an improved self image.  \n\nIf you are considering plastic surgery, I highly recommend you speak with the Drs Carlotti!  You will not be disappointed.
