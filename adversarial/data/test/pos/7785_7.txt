If you are looking for an athletic activity that will change your life, Cactus Crossfit is a great start to begin\/continue your journey to a healthier, fitter, and overall more positive you.  A good friend of mine tried to convince me to start crossfit for about a year until I finally got up the nerve to finally snoop around Scottsdale for a place where I would fit in.  Low and behold there was a perfect fit right in my neighborhood!\n\nKevin, the owner, has a great vision for what crossfit should be like: a self motivating experience that challenges your mind, body, and soul.  If you are not 100% committed to changing the way you look and feel, Cactus Crossfit is not for you.  Regardless of cost, you have to make the decision to start and stick with this modern day workout regime that will truly transform you. \n\nI've always been an athlete of some sort but was not satisfied with what was being represented when I put that swim suit on.  Where are my abs, I'm doing so many crunches!?  They were just hiding behind useless exercises that were of course making me sweat, but unfortunately not making me stronger or leaner.  Enter crossfit. \n\nThe workouts are hard, competitive, but incredibly rewarding.  The more you push yourself, the more you get out of going.  Again, it's all about you!  Don't worry though, the coaches and athletes that workout at Cactus Crossfit are very supportive and are always willing to help you improve your times and increase your lifts to unbelievable weights!  I never thought I could just throw 135 pounds over my head and squat.  Insane!  The \"community\" feel to at this box is also fantastic!  The new box on Indian School is ridiculously roomy and feels good to work out in a space where you can practice your skills after or before each WOD. \n\nAt the beginning of the year, Cactus did a 60-Day Paleo Challenge.  If you haven't heard of Paleolithic eating habits, look it up!  It's weird at first but once you start, it's almost impossible to stop.  I quickly realized how important diet was in developing a body that was bomb.com.  Although I didn't technically do the challenge with the gym (I traveled a lot for work in January and February so I took it up on my own), I lost 25 pounds (pretty sure it was pure fat), developed muscles I did not know existed, and have never felt or looked as good as I do today.  A healthy combination of paleo meals and crossfit 3-4 days a week has completely changed my life and I see no turning back now. \n\nI HIGHLY recommend Cactus Crossfit to anyone looking to make an incredibly positive change in their life and wish anyone else luck at the pool this summer.
