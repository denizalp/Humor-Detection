We came for what everyone was talking about, the Crack Pie. Small slice for $6.50, it was simply too sweet. After taking a first bite, I was immediate hit w sugar. It makes enjoying the entire pie, which is damn small, very hard. Would not get it again.  Also got a blueberry & cream cookie.  Not as sweet but quite good. And the Compost Cookie, which is essentially everything. I tasted hints of coffee and salt. It was a nice balance of flavors and textures. Would get this again. Each for $3.\n\nPrices here are high, probably because rent is high and that's what they need to charge to stay in business.  In my opinion, it's not worth it. But hey, it's Vegas and chances are, you're on vacation. So splurge a little and try it out.
