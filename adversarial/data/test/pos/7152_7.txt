I've been dying to come here!  Just waiting for the right band to make my grand entrance into this highly rated venue.  \n\nI must say, it most DEFINITELY lives up to the hype!  It really helps to have a medium size venue in town finally.  I had heard rumors that we weren't getting certain bands (a lot of the ones I like, such as indie rock, etc) because we didn't have the type of venue to host them.  Well, in comes Stage AE, the perfect size venue!\n\nI was in the outdoor area for Death Cab For Cutie last night and it was amazing!  Not a bad \"seat\" in the place!  Seat meaning a place to stand.  There's a large area in the front of the stage to stand at or you can sit up on the lawn area.  The lawn area is tiny, but it's elevated, so it's probably good for people who are vertically challenged!  It was awesome though because I never felt squished, thank gawd, because there were a lot of sweaty people I would NOT have wanted to touch.  \n\nI also thought the whole area was incredibly clean.  I know it's newer, so I would hope it is.  Plus, beer is only $5 for a 20oz!  Screw you First Niagara Pavilion and your $7 12oz beers!  Bungling AND Blue Moon are on tap so that just makes me love the place even more!  \n\nThe absolute only complaint I have is that I wish it was non smoking.  I realize it's outdoors and smoking kind of goes with the concert territory, but I'd rather not worry about getting burnt by a waving ciggies or smell it. I know, I'm speaking as a total non smoker.  \n\nI can't wait to go back and check out the indoor venue.  I don't doubt it's just as great.  I'm SO happy that we have this kind of venue in the Burgh finally so I can rock out properly!
