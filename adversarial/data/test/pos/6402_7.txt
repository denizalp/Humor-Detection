Very cool shop that offers henna & eyebrow threading.  \n\nThreading is an ancient method of hair removal \nand it really is the most effective method of shaping beautiful eyebrows and removing unwanted facial hair. Unlike other hair removal techniques there is no burning, peeling or chemicals that irritate the skin. Threading is the most precise hair removal method to date and the hair even grows back thinner and slower!\n\nMy mother told me about threading a long time ago but I still like to get my brows waxed \n\nI do like the fact that the hair grows back slower and unlike tweezing where single hairs are pulled out one at a time, threading can remove short lines of hair.\n\nOnly $10 and they take walk in's \n\nLoyalty program = 1 stamp per service for every 5 you get a free $20 henna service or free brow threading \n\nLadies were very professional & friendly ! \n\nIf you've never tried it before give it a go it's not as painful as waxing \n\nThe shop does have a very strong scent like hippies that was my least favorite part of the experience \n\nEnjoy !!
