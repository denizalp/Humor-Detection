Get to the pool at 8 am when they open the doors to reserve a lounger if you want a specific area or chairs. The hotel provides towels, just look for the yellow\/white striped ones in the cart. Put the towel on the lounger you want, with a personal item on it, and it's yours for the day, no charge!\n\nGreat service by the waitresses. Mixed drinks were $8.50, think beer was $5. Never even get out of your lounger if you don't want to.\n\nSlide thru the shark tank is free, I did it 3 times and it was a bit of fun.\n\nPool is great with a large shaded area to get out of the sun for a while. It was 109 degrees the day we were there so the shade came in handy.\n\nThere are blackjack tables adjacent to the pool if you want to play in a unique setting.\n\nMusic was good all day, and not obnoxiously loud.
