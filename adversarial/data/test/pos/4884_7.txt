I don't love McAlister's Menu really. I never can find anything that excites me....  I would love for them to publish the calories on their menu.... because i'm sure everything is unhealthy there.. In fact, let's go to the nutrition facts shall we?\nhttp:\/\/www.mcalistersdeli.com\/nutrition\/\n\nWHAT?!  The Grilled Chicken Caesar Wrap is 780 CALORIES. HELLO +++lbs!!\n... Applesauce 100 calories.. whew.... at least I didn't do mac-cheese (320 cal)\n\nFYI - Watch out for the McAlister's Club... 1010 cal!! WOAHHHHH BUDDY.\n\nNEE-NAW... NEE-NAW... Oh wait, that's the artery police.\n\nHowever, the inside of this location was huge and parking plentiful. And the service was great! Very quick and courteous.\n\nSorry McAlister's ... Way too Rich for my blood. and by Rich, I don't mean Nene's rich with the trump check. More like with the lbs++++\n\nPS - their sweet tea is BOMB. probably diet bombing too.\n\nTEARS.
