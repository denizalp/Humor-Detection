Apparently 411 Locals is getting my reviews pulled down. I have reviewed the guidelines, and I would say that my comments are about the \"Core Experience\" of working with 411 Locals. \n\nI found their sales tactics annoying and rude. The person I spoke with on the phone was aggressive and rude. Is this not \"Core Experience\" enough for you?\n\nAdditionally my number is on a Do Not Call list. Again, this is part of the \"Core Experience\" of working with them - which is to say, we had no previous business relationship, yet they contacted me to solicit work. When I declined they were rude, pushy and generally obnoxious.\n\nIf I was walking down the street past a restaurant, and the owner came out and asked us to eat at his restaurant... that would be completely appropriate to mention here. What if the owner followed me down the street yelling at me when I said no? What if they called me at home?\n\nThis is exactly the same.
