OK, so I have to say that I wanted to like this place a lot.  Looking for a place to eat one evening I did a quick search what was nearby and came across this.  Scanned the reviews and pictures and thought this would be a great place to stop.\n\nDriving up to the place you get this feeling that you are about to enjoy an authentic hole-in-the-wall experience.  I mean you don't always come upon a bar that was basically a house at one point in time.  I love these types of places.  We walked into the dining area first and thought we'd check out the bar before picking a table.  The bar area was packed, so I deduce that this is quite the hangout spot for your night out.  We ended up deciding to eat in the dining room area.  It's rather dim, two TVs on the wall, and some old school arcade games accompany the tables throughout.  We were able to seat ourselves and picked where we wanted.\n\nWe were promptly greeted by our server and had menus in hand and drink orders placed.  We looked over the menu and by the time our drinks came back we were ready to order.  I had the Fish on the Plate and my other half chose the blue burger.  We also took advantage of the drink special that night, which was killer for a Saturday in the city.  Actually, whatever night you are here, take advantage of either or both of the specials, one is for food and the other is for drinks.  Saturdays you get a large cheese pizza for like seven bucks.\n\nOur food arrives and I have to say these are monstrous servings.  My order came with two sides, since I was already going fried I chose French fries and onion rings as my side.  I also got some tartar sauce for my huge ass piece of fish.  What I did not know is that this came with Cole slaw as well, I'll be honest, I'm not a fan of their style, but not everyone is going to like every type of slaw out there.  My other half got fries with his burger.  I honestly could not eat all this food and did not want to take it home with me, reheating fish is not the best idea if you ask me.  My other half wasn't quite as happy with his meal.  After some prying he informed me that it was over salted for him.  For the burger I suppose the mixture of blue cheese and bacon and there being no type of sauce to calm that down made it a bit much.  As for the fries, they were overly salted.  I didn't believe him until I tried one myself.  I only ate half of a fry and was in dire need of some water.  We kind of brushed that off thinking that maybe it was an oversight and just kind of happened.  But when we got our check, we figured out what went on.  \n\nWhen you get a burger or sandwich it naturally comes with fries.  You can change that for a fee to onion rings or sweet potato fries I think.  So when the server asked if fries were fine, he said yes.  But on the check she had put it in as 'loaded fries.'  Normally when you see 'loaded fries' that means covered in cheese and maybe bacon.  But here I guess that means thickly coated in salt.  He couldn't even eat them and I can attest to that.  He didn't want to make a fuss, so I didn't make a fuss.  It was his meal and it appeared he wasn't very hungry to begin with.  So I guess for him, this worked out well.\n\nParking is a bit tricky here, I almost drove past the place at first and then realized that there is a parking lot across the street.  Ample spots available.
