So, they say breakfast is the most important meal of the day...  this place seems to agree.\n\nSmall location, maybe fits 20 people max.\nMenu has all you can ask for at a breakfast place: waffles, pancakes, eggs every way, etc.\n\nIt was my last day in Pittsburgh, so I decided to go \"all out\" and went with the French Toasts, with a side of sausage. \nCoffee was served, server says the order will be ready soon and out comes this massive plate filled completely by 4 huge, thick French Toast, and a sausage patty the size of a guy's hand.  You must imagine my face of surprise...  How in the world am I gonna eat all that?  (FYI... the picture does not do it justice)\n\nAs if the server knew what I was thinking, he comes out of the kitchen and says \"we have a rule, whoever doesn't finish their plate has to help with the dishes\".  I raised my hands, and said \"bring out the gloves because I'm not even going to attempt it\".  It was a fun exchange of words while he poured more coffee in my mug, which was always kept full.\n\nThe French toasts reminded me a little of the PAM commercial with the \"ghost of dinners past\".  They had a touch of salty taste, of a griddle that has seen a lot of busy days.  Don't get me wrong, they were good but, don't expect a clean sweet taste here, which is fine with me not liking things too sweet.  \nThe sausage wasn't too greasy, which I appreciated, and after eating 1.5 of the 4 French Toasts and Â¼ of the sausage, I was done.\n\nThankfully they let us pay, without me having to touch the kitchen or a dirty dish. \n\nIf you find yourself here, remember to share... The pancakes, as I saw at the table next to us, come in 4s too.  \nOr, order an egg dish, these seemed more \"normal\" size and looked good!  \nOne thing is for sure, you will start your day full and ready for whatever it brings after having one of their breakfasts.
