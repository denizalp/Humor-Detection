The fact that my boyfriend and I refer to this as the \"shady Giant Eagle\" should be a pretty good indication of how I feel about this place. In times of desperation, I'll stop in, head straight to the items I need, and make a quick exit. Besides being just an eyesore, the employees I've dealt with seem slightly clueless, causing the lines to move very slowly. The customers don't make the experience any better. I remember standing behind a woman in line who was arguing with the cashier for 10 minutes about being charged 2 cents over the price tag. Yes, that's right. 2 CENTS. It took a lot of deep breaths to restrain myself from throwing my loose change and storming out.
