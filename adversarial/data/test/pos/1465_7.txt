Finishing lunch, I saw a sign with a girl on a cake nearby and mistook it for a bakery. Luckily for me, my sister corrected me and told me it was a place for women's hair removal. That would have been embarrassing to walk. Luckily for us, Drago Sisters are just down the street and could satisfy my sweet tooth. \n\nThey have a large variety of different styles of baked goods which were gorgeous. We either picked well on our four items or everything is just good. Drago Sisters has a huge selection of petit four sized cake bite which were moist and bursting with flavors. The gingerbread and pumpkin were dense, chewy, and packed with holiday goodness. It is smart how they offer regular and mini sized options. Before I could even scope out the entire case, my sister already pointed out that I need not look any further than the mini tres leches cake. Soaked cakes are where it's at and just the right size. The mini eclairs are phenomenal as well. The light shell, decadent custard filling, and dark chocolate dip makes me wonder why I have shied away from this dessert for so long. Oh yes, I remember now, nowhere makes it as good as they do. \n\nI asked for forks in case Diana S. and I got the craving to snack on our way home, but we devoured everything before leaving the packing lot. In the end, I did the walk of shame to the trashcan to discard of the evidence. Two young ladies saw me and gave me that knowing smile. I responded with a \"It just wasn't that good\" as I pointed to the two empty to go boxes.
