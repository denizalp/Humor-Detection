Sometimes I wish I had no shame. I wanted to curl up next to the monstrous statue of the Chino Bandido in the dinig room to take a photo.  Alas, there is still some shame left in me...\n\nI love the idea of CB: Mexican Asian Fusion.  My favorite part about this place is the mini tour of the flavors you're taken on if you let them know that you're new. I loved being able to taste so much stuff: Carnitas, Jerk Fried Rice, Jade Red Chicken, Black Beans, etc.  The dish I most wanted to try, Pollo Diablo, was not on the tasting menu, but other thigns were tasty.  I also like that with the combination meals, you can get two meat items and get them served plain (over rice), in a burrito, or in a quesadilla.  Adding cheese to stuff is almost always a good idea, but not to asian flavored meats. That's weird.\n\nWe ordered two combinations with Carnitas, Jerk Chicken, Jen Red Pork, and the Pollo Diablo. Quick summary:\n-Carnitas: pretty flavorful; one of the better dishes\n-Jerk Chicken: a bit on the dry side and not as spicy as advertised.  Perhaps we roll too hot for most places.\n-Jen Red Pork: Crispy on the outside, mostly tender inside. A sweet, warmish sauce. Not bad at all.\n-Pollo Diablo: This was supposed to be my star (thanks Guy Fieri for hyping it!). It was spicier than the others, but not necessarily more flavorful.  It was dry in the burrito, so I opened up the tortilla and munched on it plain.  More moist, but mostly oily moist and very little flavor otherwise.\n-Black beans: pretty flavorful but the consistency of grout. Seriously. These beans lined the walls of my stomach and wouldn't leave!\n-Free cookie!  DId you say free?  Cookie?  Yay! Chocolcate Volcano cookie was nothing like a volcano, but yummy nonetheless!\n\nI love the idea and love the friendly service.  I don't love the meh flavors or the way my stomach felt for the rest of the day: gut-bomb city!\n\nIt is, however, a weird torture I might endure again if I lived here.  There's something that pulls me towards you, you cute, chubby, Chino Bandido!
