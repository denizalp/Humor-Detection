Upon a recent return visit, I gained a new appreciation for the Luv. Mainly, the custard didn't give my belly the blues like last time. The raspberry was creamy and dreamy without any side effects! Plus, I learned that to truly appreciate this institution you must arrive with an entourage of at least 8. Apparently, custard tastes better in large groups, but more importantly acting like a vagrant in a parking lot is decidedly more entertaining with a posse. Good photo ops are plenty! 4 stars for chilling in the parking lot with a cup of custard!
