Montreal is making me a believer of the old adage \"it's all in the water.\" Because between Fairmount Bagels and Amelio's, I've had some of the best-tasting breads ever!\n\nAlthough the draw here is pizza, I followed my wife and son's lead and ordered entrees.\n\nMy wife: manicotti with spinach..cheesy saucy gooey paradise with a distinct flavor that goes down satisfyingly light.\n\nMy son: spaghetti with meatballs...he wanted more and more. \n\nMe: spaghetti with meat sauce...only in Montreal can an ordinary dish like this win me over.\n\nAppetizer: salads, italian bread (3 loaves, one foot-long each), and garlic bread with cheese.\n\nI know..a lot of bread...and that's how Amelio's proved my family has an eating addiction that rears its joyous head only while we're in Montreal.\n\nOne more thing, anyone complaining about the salads being bland or tasting like they came out of a bag should be suffocated with a bag.  If this is what salad tastes like when it comes out of a bag, let me know where they sell these bags because I'll buy them by the sack!
