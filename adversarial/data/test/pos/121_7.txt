My fiancee and I recently decided that it was time to remove the two palm trees in front of our house because it had become too expensive to maintain them.\n\nAfter reading a few reviews and receiving some quotes, we decided to hire this company to do the job.\n\nThey were able to schedule the service within a couple of weeks following our request for a quote and they were also able to accommodate our schedule.\n\nThe crew that showed up consisted of five guys who had the job completed with in just a few hours. That included grinding both stumps and hauling away every bit of debris.\n\nIt was also nice that this company had the best price from among the quotes we received. We were completely satisfied and would definitely recommend them to anyone meeting tree removal service.
