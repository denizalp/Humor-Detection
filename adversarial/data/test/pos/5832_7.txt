Gouter is one of those hidden bakery gems in Toronto.  A non descript and quiet spot in the very northern edge of Toronto.  It does require effort to get here and it's not easily accessible by mass transit.  That being said, I think for anyone who lives in the area should grab their car keys and give those freshly made croissant a bite... or two... or many.\n\nIt is such a simple spot and deceivingly so... you'd never realize that all the magic of these pastries and vienoissorie is happening right behind a wall by their very hand.  None of this purchased frozen stuff... all made in house by their master pastry chef, Rodney.   The store is pristine and clean but towards the edge of minimalist.  The cute mural on the back wall is a nice break from the simple whites.  It's mostly take out but there is a few tables you can sit at.  It was completely empty and quiet when I visited on a Saturday afternoon.\n\nWhen I first entered, the wafts of butter is alluring... this is a very good sign and it was as they had a fresh batch of croissants.  IN THE AFTERNOON!  How amazing is that.  I knew looking at the desserts that I had to grab a few... a lot of eye catching details, fresh fruit, and swirls to make any dessertarian happy.  They also have lots of in house made ice cream and chocolates to those who don't like pastries.  In other words, this is your happy place if you love French treats.\n\nLemon Tart - With cute little peaks of meringue doting the top of the tart, you notice there is a glint of gold ... it's not paint.  It's real gold leafs decorating the tart.  With a tender and super fragile crust, it holds a gentle light lemon curd.  It's not as bold as the North American version but it's also not as sweet.  So for those who love a hint of lemons and not a tart pucker, this might be your preference.  Just as tip, you plan to take this with you in the car... don't.  I had all the tarts I brought home be broken in multiple pieces before I even had the chance to take it out of the box.  And I had the box laid flat on the floor in a slow drive home (401 traffic was bruuuutal).  4\/5 for flavour ... leaning towards 3.5\/5 cause there's really no chance of leaving it intact for a gift later on\n\nBerry Tart - a pretty tart with lots of berries on top ... love the fact that all the strawberries were red and rip all the way through.  Too many times I've seen fresh berries used but it lacked any flavour with it having a white core.  I also do have to appreciate how they used a smaller strawberry... I'm pretty sure it's not the French famed varietal but much better than the tasteless Florida or California giants we get here in Toronto.  Anyhow, this one was definitely on the later flavour .... still beautifully done.  Tender butter crust, vanilla pastry cream that is light, and lots of berries.  It's just missing that wow factor that the lemon tart had more of.  This one also broke apart badly... more so than the lemon tart.  3.5\/5\n\nPain au chocolat (chocolate croissant) - I ate this one fresh in the bakery and was rewarded with layers of croissants flying around as I bit in.  It is honestly one of the lightest croissants I've had AND YET completely buttery.  How?? Most of the time I'm used to croissant that can double as a bun cause it's chewy or heavy but not here.  Honestly... one of my favourite croissants I've had to date!  5\/5\n\nOverall, definitely a worthwhile trek if you're in the area OR a croissant lover.  I dont think there is one better in all of North Toronto or even GTA ... it definitely puts some good downtown bakeries to shame for flakey and buttery croissants.
