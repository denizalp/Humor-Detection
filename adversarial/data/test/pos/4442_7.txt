I was hesitant to return after my first experience, but my fellow Yelpers love this place and I was in need of some relaxation and it is near my house, so I decided to give it another try. I think part of my negative experience the first time, was that I didn't know what to expect and hadn't been to a place like this before. \nSecond time around I was more relaxed. I don't know if I like that the TV was on because I was tempted to open my eyes and watch the news and news is NOT relaxing. I still am not a 4 or 5 star fan. One reason is that it is WAY too bright in there to really relax. I know the employees have to be able to see to work and other customers need to be able to be able to see when coming\/going. I will return because of the proximity to my house and the great deal... $22 for an hour long massage-head, neck, feet, leg, back. Can't beat that.
