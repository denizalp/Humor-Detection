Had a appointment for a gel manicure @ 3:00pm, thirty seven  minutes later still sitting in reception. \nThey took me as I was getting up to walk out. I should've seen that as a warning sign. The lady who did my nails was completely distracted - answering the phone, taking payments, etc. It was like getting your nails done by a grumpy receptionist.\nAfter I told her I was looking to get a gel manicure over my naturally long nails she proceeds to file them down to nubs!!! I asked for grey and when the Grey polish wrinkled she slapped this grey glitter on it and now I have sparkling nubs! I am pissed
