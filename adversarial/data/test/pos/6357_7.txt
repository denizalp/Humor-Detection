Super disappointed.  I was so excited to try them.  I was looking forward to the long johns, cone sushi, and the Chow fun.  Long Johns were the only ones that were good.  The rice in the cone sushi was super wet.  The chow fun was oily.  I had the plate lunch and had to throw the whole thing away because of the oil.  I was really hoping that we had a place that reminded me of home.\n\nViolet - Thank you for responding. I got my order To Go since I had to go back to work. I'm shocked that you expected me to go back to the store and have your cooks fix the problem when they food should've been good from the start. \n\nThanks for the Aloha spirit
