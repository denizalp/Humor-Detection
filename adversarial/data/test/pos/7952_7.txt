I quite like this venue. It has a vintage, cozy feel although it is a decently large venue. It's been around for ages, and hosted many a performance... you can almost feel its history when you walk in with remnants of its original theatrical structure giving homage to its origins. \nOk so maybe that last sentence was a tad romanticized and sentimental... but it's my story and I'm sticking to it.\n\nI've already seen quite a few shows here, well-known bands as well as the more obscure, and it's never disappointed. It's usually standing-only... which I prefer so I can dance to my favourite songs, the sound is good, the bar has decently-priced beers and friendly servers, there is an optional coat check and a balcony to boot. \n\nConveniently located in Griffintown near Autoroute Ville-Marie (720) and Lionel-Groulx station, it's easily accessible by metro or car. Corona Theatre has quickly become one of my favourite concert venues of Montreal. I'm a fan.
