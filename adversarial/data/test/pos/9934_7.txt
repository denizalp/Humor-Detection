How many times have I turned this place down due to the mistake every time I get invited to eat at Wendy's after church I always think they're referring to the fast food joint...haha but I'm glad to have corrected that mistake because this place is one hell of a find if you're craving noodles at the moment.\n\nI have been here several times now and have never found it to be busy.  The service is one of the best with the owner or manager occasionally coming out to talk to you personally about the food.\n\nMy favorite noodles are the seafood with rice (egg) noodles and roast duck with egg noodles.  Don't worry if you're not in to noodles because they serve other great dishes too besides noodles, like their oyster omelette and a combination of american\/chinese food on their east meets west menu category.  Their website is great too because it shows all the food with pictures.  Here check it out at http:\/\/www.wendysnoodlecafe.com\/ \n\nYou can't go wrong here because even if you are left unsatisfied because of your bad taste in food, the prices here are really cheap.\n\nBTW this is my 100th review as a yelper of 1yr.  Yeeeaaaah! Hey Misti do I win a car for this?
