If being a good public citizen means I get to eat at a restaurant like Citizen Public House, then I vow never to roll through a stop sign again! \n\nI had the chance to check out Citizen Public House for dinner last night and was eager to take a bite into the culinary adventures of Chef Bernie and pastry delights of Tracy Dempsey. We arrived to enter a cozy atmosphere full of energy from the group of guests enjoying their meals. The setting here is simple but simple does the trick because the food and drinks are excellent. \n\nWe started with cocktails and an appetizer. I was told the coconut drink (I'm blanking on the name) was like a vacation in your mouth and considering that I've got the tropical itch, I opted for that immediately. They warned me it was a stiff drunk, but I had no idea how stiff they really meant! Let me just put it this way, if you are looking for a cocktail that will do the drink for the entire meal, this is your drink. I didn't need another after just this one! \n\nMoving on to the food now! We started with a bar snack appetizer of Kilt Lifter fondue with sausage, pears and bread. It was a perfect snack to get our appetites moving and munch on the food while we waited for out entrees. The pears and fondue were an interesting combination but it grows on you after awhile. Apparently, I was feeling cheesy that night because for my entree, I went for the Grilled Halloumi Cheese which is on Serbian lepijna bread, with chickpea puree, pickles, Campari tomato, tender greens, tahini. I liked to think of it as a grown up's grilled cheese. Although it didn't have any meat in it, the sandwich was hearty and satisfying enough that it didn't need any. I had a taste of the Smart Chicken and that was excellent as well! \n\nTo end the good citizen meal, we had to try a Tracy Dempsey desert because how could you pass up one of these delicacies! We were told that the Chocolate Toffee Bread Pudding is a must for chocolate lovers. They weren't kidding! The dessert was delicious and just the right amount of sweet to end the meal. \n\nI like Citizen Public House because it isn't pretentious and while it's in the heart of Old Town, it doesn't have the Old Town scene vibe. It's perfect for an evening of good good and tasty cocktails in a comfortable setting. \n\nI can't wait to visit again!
