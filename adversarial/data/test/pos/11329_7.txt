When bf's closest guy friend was in town for work, and we needed a cheap place to stay that was close to the Convention Center, we found this on Expedia.  From the looks of other reviews here, rooms usually go for less than the $86\/night we paid, but there was a convention going on so that might have driven the prices up for this weekend.\n\nWe checked in super late on a Friday night, and parked pretty easily near our room.  An elevator took us up to our floor, and our room was right down the hall.  When we walked in, the room was HOT - almost like the heat had been on, blah.  It took a while for the room air conditioner to cool down our relatively small room, especially since the drapes in the closed position blocked the cool air's flow into the room.\n\nThe room itself was decent - a tube tv, 2 queen beds, coffee maker, fridge, little bar sink in the main part, a closet area with a makeup mirror and table, etc.  \n\nThe beds were decent - the covers were duvets, so they likely get washed more than the traditional crappy bedspreads hotels have.  The bed we slept in looked pretty clean, but the other one's duvet had some questionable-looking stains on it.\n\nOther than us getting short-toweled (small face towels) til the maid cleaned our room the next day, the room was what we needed - close to everything but off the crazy strip, fridge, mostly comfy bed, hair dryer, free parking.  Wifi wasn't free, but it's okay.  They had a shuttle to take people to the Convention Center and The Flamingo that we didn't take advantage of, but was nice to know.\n\nI'd stay here again - especially if the rate was as low as other reviews say.  But next time, I'd ask for a room with a king sized bed.
