Two Words: Organic Ingredients \n\nI had the pleasure of meeting Owen, one of the owners. He sat my friend and I down at the bar to test some samples. \n\nMy favorite was the Doctor Pistachio which had pistachio, dates, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, honey and filtered water. \n\nCurrently, they have a few bites to eat such as the acai bowl. He informed me that they will include items such as avocado toast.\n\nOwen is very passionate about House of Alchemy as he proudly states that everything in their beverages are organic except their filtered water.\n\nI look forward to the next visit!
