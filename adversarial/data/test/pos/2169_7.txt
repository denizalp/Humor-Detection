The older balding guy with the goatee was a dickwad. Literally wanted to leave because of him. Wish I got his name so I could mention him. Usually I'll return somewhere if the food is mediocre  but the service is good, but thanks to that guy I think I'll pass. Maybe if he was nicer the business wouldn't be so dead empty. Not to mention the hummus was butthole. Try less tahini next time.
