Hubs and I popped into Sushi House Goyemon while visiting his parents in LV. Its true, this place is packed but we didn't care. We wanted all you can eat sushi that's prepared fresh and not sitting under some lights at a buffet! For the bargain price of about $26 per person you can pretty much order anything off of their menu. We got half-orders of rolls, indulged in uni and binged on pork belly. Overall the quality of food is pretty good and we'll definitely stop by next time we're in town! It's definitely worth it.
