\"OK, that kicked ass!\"\n\nThis is the only sentence I could manage after leaving Los Reyes de la Torta.  The food coma was quickly rendering me incoherent...\n\nThis place well, does kick ass.  ¡Muy auténtico!  Salsa music in the background and soccer on the TVs.  An extensive menu with portions that seem to only come in one size - ginormous.  \n\nWe thought we were being so smart by sharing two items.  Yeah, right.  There was enough deliciousness to feed a small family.  Mango juice... served in a chalice with a big slice o' mango riding on the side.  Shrimp quesadilla... I had no idea that tortillas could be made in that size.  Torta Del Rey... Easily more than 5\" tall and packed with just about everyting that their kitchen can prepare.  I would love to see someone try to bite into this.  We had to eat it with a fork.  Amusing that the torta is served with potato chips - who has the stomach real estate left to eat those!?\n\nThe only thing you can do after a meal like that is crash on the nearest couch until you feel human again.\n\nI will be hungry again sometime late next week.\n\n¡Ay, lo me Encanta!
