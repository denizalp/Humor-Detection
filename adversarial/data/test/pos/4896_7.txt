OMG Indian food burritos!!!! I literally saw this out of the corner of my eye as I was driving around running errands, and almost crashed into the curb I was so excited. It reminded me of an Indian burrito I had at Parilla Grill in Bend, OR that still haunts my dreams!\n\nSimilar to Chipotle in that you can order a burrito or a bowl, and choose your toppings. The result was smaller than a Chipotle burrito bowl, but delicious. Plus you can order various sides.\n\nI had a chicken chili bowl with 2 veggie samosas. Altogether around $11. Everything was really good and service was fast and friendly. \n\nIt was good and I'll probably come back again.
