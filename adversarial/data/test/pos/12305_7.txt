Oh Amber, you are the Miami of Toronto, and I'm not sure if that's a compliment.\n\nOwned by Tofique, whom every frequent patron knows intimately.\nThe patio is the jam at this place and it's a hot spot during the Film Festival. \n\nYears ago, I worked there and we had to wear all-white (at a bar!) and the bar is all-white, and it was murder.\n\nWho frequents the joint? Fashion magazine editor's and the buyer's for Holt's and TV personalities like Ben Mulroney. It's pretty jovial for the crowd it attracts and it can be a very discreet place to meet for drinks. it ain't cheap honey, not it ain't cheap at all, but you don't come here for the price points, it's to see and be seen dahlin'.\n\nAlso, they make this great martini with rose water and the staff are great. Ask for a red-headed slut, I taught them how to make that.
