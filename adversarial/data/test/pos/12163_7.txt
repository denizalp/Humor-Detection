First off, I'm super impressed by this entire Asian food plaza. It has all the popular restaurants on Mountain Spring Road. From fancy Vietnamese food to sushi, and now Mongolian Hot Pot, Vegas' Asian food scene is so hot RIGHT NOW.\n\nI came to Chubby Cattle right at noon on Sunday morning and people were waiting to be seated. I had no idea this restaurant was featured on the Food Network, so I noticed the TV hype as patrons mentioned they wanted to try this place due to ZimmernList. \n\nWe wanted to order the Wagyu (which they advertised on Yelp too), but they were sold out. So we ordered the Beef combo with a veggie platter. The veggie platter came out in 30 minutes (it's raw veggies, we cook it ourselves, c'mon) and our beef came out 1 hour later (again, it's raw. we would have to cook it ourselves). \n\nThe veggie platter came in a large wooden basket with a variety of vegetables but what I didn't understand was the romaine lettuce. I get bok choy and cabbage, but I don't get why you would cook lettuce in broth. It's just weird. \n\nThe beef combo was actually pretty decent once it came out and the meat was nicely marbled.\n\nThere is a rotating conveyor belt (like a sushi belt) of toppings that you can choose from for your hot pot. All the toppings were not labeled nor did the ingredients looked very appetizing. The rotating plates were color coordinated to different pricing, so we got the price but the frosty covers don't reveal much.\n\nAt the sauce station, the variety of sauces was nice, but there are a million signs of how to develop \"recommended\" sauce combinations. \n\nAll in all.. there is WAYYY too much going on here. The gimmick of these random features fall short. \nI think Chubby Cattle should just concentrate on executing good quality meats\/veggies in a timely manner. The entire restaurant was not pleased with the slow pacing of the food coming out (our server was pleasant, at least!).\n\nInteresting experience but probably never would be back.
