I think that I'm being extremely generous by marking Legoland as even a one star, I would put zero if I could.  The only reason why I give it a two is because of the Kingdom Quest ride.  Please save your money and go some where else.  I paid for my ticket and my older daughters ticket, while my youngest got to go in for free.  I bought my ticket online as they claimed it would be a better rate.  Sorry to say it Legoland a dollar cheaper for a boring time isn't cheap.\n\nSo for an adult and child it came out to $50 fine my daughter wanted to go and I thought hey the second gets in for free.  So the three of us went.  The line ups to get in are confusing and haphazard.  He customer service was not the greatest as they were annoyed when I asked what I needed to show them to get in.  Once we got in we got our photos taken.  We entered a room that had some Lego toys and made our way to Miniland.  \n\nIf you have a toddler under two that walks make sure you bring another adult.  My toddler wasn't able to go on any of the rides or go into the play area other than a lame slide.  My oldest however was allowed to go on but try being in two places at once.  Moreover, the peddling ride you can't go on even if you are accompanied by an adult if you don't meet the minimum height requirement.\n\nSeeing as we got there first thing in the morning t wasn't too busy thank goodness, but as it got busier it was harder for me to supervise my toddler and my older child.  My toddler got bored quickly of the lame slide and pretty soon I found myself wishing we had never come.  \n\nLuckily, the only saving grace was that all three of us were able to go on the Kingdom Quest ride.  It definitely was not worth the $25 that I had to pay to get in when that was the only attraction I could go on with my toddler.  \n\nI think legoland should be ashamed of itself for charging for such a cheaply put together attraction.  After a few hours I chose to leave and will not be planning to go back how ridiculous.
