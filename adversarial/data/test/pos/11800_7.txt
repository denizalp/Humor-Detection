Worst hospital ever and I have been to other MTF's and civilian hospitals! This is also a VA hospital so you always have to wait a month for something as simple as a follow up but there are plentiful PAP SMEAR appointments. I guess the doctors here would rather look at vajayjays all day! Nurses never call me back. The doctors don't care about quality patient care. No decency or bed side manner. I wouldn't trust them with my life. I always get a 2nd and 3rd opinion. Tax payer dollars are wasted at this place. I would rate it 0 stars if I could!
