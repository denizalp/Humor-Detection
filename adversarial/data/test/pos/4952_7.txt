Finally the NHL has arrived in the Entertainment Capital of the World. A couple of months before our new NHL team the Las Vegas Golden Knights plays their first game in early October, their official merchandise store is open for business. \n\nIt was on a brutally hot summer Saturday where you can boil an egg outside on the cement pavement by the T-mobile Arena, that I celebrated the brutally cold temperature of the ice hockey rink inside the Golden Knights Official Store. \n\n The Armory blends in with the Park-facing side of the T-mobile Arena. There were no window displays or signs that advertises the first official professional sports merchandise store open in Las Vegas. If it wasn't for my brother I would be incognizent it exists or was open. \n\nAs soon as I walked inside the Armory, a Golden Knight welcomed me. In reality it was a Golden Knight statue near an enthusiastic woman that welcomed me here. The shop is staffed by a sundry of enthusiastic employees. The Golden Knight was the omen of the official team merchandise that was stocked throughout the shop. The merchandise includes caps, t-shirts, hockey pucks, license plate holders, and mugs. The presentation adds to the appeal of the merchandise and cheering on our first NHL team. The presentation includes the Golden Knight statue, a nearby NHL player mannequin displaying the Golden Knights jersey, and a kiosk to design your own jersey. \n\nAlong with the high enthusiasm, unfortunately are high prices. In spite of the fact that I appreciated the high selection of Golden Knights caps, I did not appreciate the high $30-plus prices I saw on them. And these were the less pricey. The Golden Knights t-shirts were priced around $45. These are a couple of examples of high prices. I wouldn't consider it sticker shock since nothing shocks me about prices on the Las Vegas Strip. The prices are so up the totem pole that even the Golden Knights t-shirts sold at a shop in the upmarket Caesar's Forum Shops costed $10 less. I can only imagine the price difference at Big 5 and Walmart. Putting things in perspective, I am sure that it would be a different story after watching the first professional sports team in Las Vegas. I could see myself being so in the moment in the upbeat energy after attending an NHL game that I wouldn't mind spending more money on official team merchandise capturing the excitement of the game I saw. Especially if the Golden Knights win. Being that I am an avid hiker that considers a cap a necessity, a premium price on a Golden Knights cap would be a nice momento on the hiking trails. And a $10 paperclip Golden Knights magnet next to numerous professional team magnets on my refrigerator will remind me that Las Vegas has a become a professional sports city. \n\nIn preparation to sharing my review, I was debating whether to give 3.5 or 4 stars. The fact is that the prices are high. Upon further reflection, I value customer friendly businesses that offer products or services that are difficult to nearly impossible to find anywhere else. The Armory also known as the Official Golden Knights Merchandise Store has the honor of being the Very First Official Merchandise Store of A Professional Team in Las Vegas. With that honor it sells hard to find official merchandise of the Golden Knights in an enthusiastic environment that supports the first professional sports team of the Entertainment Capital of the World.
