Oh dear-how to put this? It's a Foodie's dream. Not a Resto, but a Gourmet shoppe. The Cheese selection alone is enough to make one pass out. The Charcuterie, the same. There might be a  place somewhat like this in Chicago, but I'll bet not. Everywhere I looked, there was something I wanted, but couldn't buy, 'cos it wouldn't fly on the plane. In the end I bought an Opinel knife (remembering to put it in my luggage, 'cos I would have cried like a baby if I would have spaced, put it in my briefcase and had to surrender it to the TSA.)\nIt's a shoppe, but they make sandwiches there from the good stuff in the display cases. \nI ordered a Jamon et Brie on an exemplary baguette. Paired with a San Pellegrino Chinotto. Both were sublime. I and pal Beno took a seat on the chairs perched outside, and had a delightful repast with the Floor show provided by the denizens of Boul Saint-Laurent: Pretty Girls, Pretty Boys, Weirdos, Hipsters and Aliens. Oh-so-sophisticated and if I lived in Montreal, I'd be at this place every few days.
