I had a great experience here. Two women helped me pick out a frame - they were personable, attentive, patient, they listened to what I wanted, and gave me all the space and time I needed.  They have a very nice selection of glasses, probably the best I've seen for the price range, and they had many options for petite or smaller sized frames. The prices are great for designer frames, and my glasses turned out wonderfully!
