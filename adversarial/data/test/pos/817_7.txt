Mah-ni jo-ah hey-o! \n\nThis place is awesome. Immaculately clean, with good towel\/robe service. The rooms are well-lit and well-maintained. Salt scrubs, jade sauna, and clay ball therapy are some of the features. I love to relax in a warm room with soothing herbal smells all around me. \n\nMy roommate and I always book the scrub, which is a cross between torture and a massage, and essentially rubs an entire layer of skin off of your body. The masseuse scrubs, kneads, and pounds every inch of your body. But: soft smooth baby-seal-like skin remains. \n\nAfterwards, we have lunch at one of the little Korean restaurants across the street, which we prefer to the in-house cafe. Nothing like some jjam-ppong to finish off the day!
