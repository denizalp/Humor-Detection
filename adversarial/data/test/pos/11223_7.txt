I'm so EFFING ANNOYED right now! I'm actually at the Starbucks location as I type this review. \n\nDon't get me wrong. I'm a huge Starbucks fan... probably one of their biggest. I came here today, to enjoy a couple of hours sipping my grande berry blossom tea with a shot of vanilla (such a nice, calming tea) and Starbucks complimentary wifi (if you have a starbucks card)... \n\nBOY WAS I WRONG! \n\nMr. Starbucks Barista took his bloody time making one of the simplest Starbucks drinks known to man! As a result, a non-customer (person who didn't purchase anything) took the only seat available in this puny Starbucks. This seat was going to be mine, if Mr. Starbucks server dude had put my tea in the correct sized cup in the first place and didn't chat up a storm with another employee while pouring the hot water in the cup!!!! \n\nAnd now I'm left sitting at the bar, suffering as a seat floater... waiting for people to free up a spot...
