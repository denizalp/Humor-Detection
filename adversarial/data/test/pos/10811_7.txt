It's crazy, I have lived in Scarborough for 15 years and only recently heard of this place. \nIt was mentioned in a nest burger thread on Chowhound and boy was the poster correct. \nI don't drive, so getting there was a bit tough, since it is not anywhere near where I normally take the bus, but recently we headed there on a Saturday. \nThe restaurant is located in a small strip mall and is easy to see. \nPrevious reviewers mention there are no seats, but we were lucky enough to find a bit of a stand up counter to eat on. \nFor my first McCoy meal I chose the Mojo Burger (a really big home burger topped with cheese and bacon) a small poutine (the fries and gravy are awesome, there are no cheese curds though, just shredded cheese) and onion rings (old style, obviously hand dipped).\n\nI was all delicious, and even though I have a large appetite I was unable to finish (even though I really wanted to)\n\nThe staff were all really friendly, and seem to be a family, it's nice too as they seem to know all the regulars (and there are many)\n\nService was quick, food was hot and delicious, I highly recommend.
