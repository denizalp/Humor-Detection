We stopped in to The Toy Box recently and once again enjoyed all of the cool things they had to offer.\n\nCustomer service was friendly and very helpful.  :)\n\nThe store is small, yet it has the charm of a small business owners dream! When you look around you can see all of the collectables from Star Wars themed toys,  NFL Beanie Babies to newly released  and  even some newly retired Legos. Toys from the current, to a few blast from the past kinda of toys which is always awesome . I love looking at ALL of the toys that may become collectables too.\n\nWhen you are in Downtown Summerlin it's a cool shop to pop into. You just might find that one toy you have been in search of. ;)\n\nI highly recommend this toy store for wonderful Customer service in addition to the unique toy finds located here. Enjoy!! :)
