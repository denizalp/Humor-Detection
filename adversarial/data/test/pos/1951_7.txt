I'm like some who don't quite understand the cupcake craze. A small little store that does nothing but cupcakes seems a little bizarre to me. I mean where are all the pie-only boutiques?\n\nAnyway, my girl friend loves cupcakes, especially red velvet. Since we were riding our bikes along the greenbelt here, we stopped in to check it out. Right off the bat, we discover that they don't make red velvet cupcakes because they do not use artificial ingredients. I get it. But after the sucky cupcakes we had, they should reconsider.\n\nMy girlfriend had the Pucker Up. The only hint of lemon was the actual lemon wedge that was stuck in the hockey puck of icing sitting on top of the cupcake. She hated it and after only one bite it ended up in the trash can with a thud!\n\nI went with the Blonde Bombshell and although I wouldn't go so far to say it was inedible, it absolutely was not worth $3. It was very bland and crumbly. The icing itself, I thought should've been a sweet buttery flavor, actually had a sour taste to it so I scraped off as much of it as I could.\n\nSomeone else on here, prior to my write-up, had yelped something to the effect of taking the $3 and going for a happy hour beer....my girlfriend and I agree that we should've walked over to Duke's for a pitcher. It would've been much more rewarding after a bike ride than a couple crappy cupcakes.
