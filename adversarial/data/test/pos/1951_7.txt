Utopia is my best friend.  We're best friends.  I've never had a bad dining experience in all the times I've gone.  Utopia and I sit around, drink wine or beer and tell amusing little stories and we might make fun of people who act douchey in non-douchey situations.  No wonder why Utopia's stuck around for so long.  Utopia can be your best friend too.  Go now.  Have their melted brie with raspberry couli.  Eat their burgers and salads.  Laugh and be merry.
