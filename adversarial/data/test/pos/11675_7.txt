I came upon this place during a little cruise around Middlefield to check out small town living... no really... I decided to go for a drive and see how the small towns lived.  When I saw some horse & buggies hitched at the back of the parking lot, I knew I had to check this place out.\n\nIt has the feel of a small town family restaurant, well, I guess it is a small town family restaurant.  I didn't see many Amish people in here, but the employees are dressed in the Amish garb.  Not sure if they are in fact Amish, but it adds to the novelty.\n\nI had the chicken salad and soup combo.  Although it was satisfactory, it wasn't anything spectacular.  I think people go here for the buffet and salad bar.\n\nThere is an attached gift shop that has some cute, yet tacky, things.  The candle selection is pretty great.  I doubt I'll ever be back in Middlefield, but if I was I would probably stop in here again.
