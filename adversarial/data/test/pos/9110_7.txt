If you want a sandwich that'll make your blood pressure go up, this is the place for you. This is the location close to my office and so if I want something quick without having to drive, I end up giving them a call. For the past few years, they've been good at making my blood boil...and I keep giving them a chance. \"Jimmy will change\"...NO! Keep dreaming!\n\nOrdering on the phone is quite painful as their order takers can't hear. \"It's too loud in the store\" yet I don't hear background noise. Investing in a good phone might help. When they write your credit card number\/ name\/  address\/ phone number - they can never get it right. \n\n\"We tried calling you multiple times because your credit card won't go through.\" It helps if you call the right number and most credit cards have 16 digits. This leads to not having a receipt for you.\n\nThere were times I had to wait a long time for a delivery when it's only a 2-minute drive away. \"The driver got lost\"...really? GPS for less than half a mile?\n\nHowever, I do like their sandwiches better than say Quizno's or Subway. I normally get: Bootlegger's Club, Hunter's Club, Turkey Tom. You have the option to just have the meat and bread (Slims) or not have the bread at all (Unwich).
