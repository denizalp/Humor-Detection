Can I give it negative stars?\nSo, I've heard this place is a Phoenix institution and rocks!!  I had no idea so many people don't actually have tongues.\nI've had better fish that sat in my freezer for decades, which is what this mess reminded me of.  The fry's seemed like an after thought.  No tartar sauce?   What??  Very few places do I walk away from the food.  I actually felt bad for the garbage can that had to hold the remainder of my meal.
