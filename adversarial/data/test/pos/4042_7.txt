Loved this place if you're a child of the 80s 90s you'll love it too.\n\nStopped in because my tickets for Rock of Ages came with a free shot.  The place was an awesome place to get ready for the show and their selection of Bourbons was top notch.  Great service  and music complete with their ridiculous MTV music videos*I will definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas.\n\n\n*FYI MTV used to play music videos.
