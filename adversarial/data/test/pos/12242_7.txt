You can't browse a yelp talk-thread without hearing mention of Fez.  You hear Fez is amazing.  You hear Fez is overrated.  I decided to kind of zone out what everyone had been saying and try it for myself and see what I thought.\n\nMy friend came in from out of town and I wanted to take him somewhere sort of out of the way.  Just to show him around.  We ate at a few places close by, but I wanted him to get a full-on Phoenix experience.  It was brutally hot out that day, too so I wanted to show him, basically, that Phoenix isn't necessarily the Devil's armpit.  There's cool stuff, too.\n\nTo make it complete, we took the light rail there.  It was a strange journey getting there.  First, the goddamn kiosk fucked me out of two tickets.  I paid for 'em but I didn't get 'em spit out.  I told a light rail security guard and he just said, \"Drop my name...\" if asked to show my ticket.  Seemed dubious, but I never got asked to show my ticket so it sort of worked out.  Then, once on the light rail, this annoying drunk dude and drunk chick were being totally belligerent.  They wanted to know somewhere fun to go.  Every place I dropped, they were like, \"We're not going there!  We don't want to go there!  That's not what we're doing!  What the fuck?!\" and started to really get on my nerves.  I finally told 'em I wasn't their tour guide and to piss off... especially if you're gonna be rude about it.\n\nFinally, we got to Fez and I was like, \"Man... I'm sorry that it's super hot and drunk people are being bitches.\"  We got in and it was pretty great right away.  Immediate seating and it was super air conditioned and I could feel my sanity slowly pump back into my brain.  \n\nI order the burger that's loaded with mushrooms and it was very, very good.  Everyone says to try the sweet potato fries.  Sorry, but I skipped.  I'm not a big fan of sweet potatoes, but I did have their spicy fries and those little fuckers were amazing.\n\nOur waiter was so attentive and awesome and willing to bullshit with us, it made the experience a whole lot nicer, balancing out the oddness of the day that preceeded.\n\nI always have to mention a restaurant's bathroom.  I love it when they decide to make the can a place to enjoy.  Fez's bathroom was amazing.\n\nDessert was amazing.  Brownie covered in ice-cream.  I wanted to marry it, but my dad would freak out and my mom.... she'd just sit there.  Based on my experience, it's a nice place to go and I would definitely go again, just to try their different burgers and maybe test the waters with their lamb plate.  \n\nIt's not expensive and it really is delicious.
