OFFICIAL JURY SUMMONS\n\nI got a sinking feeling when this came in the mail.  It comes about three weeks before your reporting date. That gives you plenty of time to mull over every unpleasant aspect of jury duty. You could get stuck on a marathon trial that could virtually destroy your life (pay is $40 a day when the trial starts). If you disagree with them, your fellow jurors could heap abuse on you and subject you to mental cruelty.\n\nThe night before you are to report, you call the number to learn your fate. The first go-around, my number was not included in those being called. Hallelujah! Shooters!\n\nThe golden phrase is \"THAT COMPLETES YOUR SERVICE\" at the end of the recording.  If the female bureaucrat says you'll be REASSIGNED, you're not off the hook.  Jury duty is still hanging over you like those tax returns you didn't file, back child support, the psycho ex from Bulgaria you thought you'd never see again.\n\nFor a couple of years, my sleep was free of jury duty nightmares.  Then one day:  OFFICIAL JURY SUMMONS.  This time there was no escape.   The three weeks of dread, the phone call, the bad news.  I'm not off the hook. I really have to go downtown and report for duty.\n\nClark County has a nice new government building, so at least your ordeal doesn't involve a trek to some dreary dingy government complex.  You have to go through a metal detector.  Everything goes through. Your belt. Empty your pockets. If you have steel-toed boots, take them off.  \n\nJury Services is on the third floor.  It's a large hall with maybe 200 upholstered chairs.  It has windows.  There's a jury \"lounge\" with sofas, more chairs, a TV, and vending machines.  On the first floor there is a lunch room that provides minimum-standard food, such as a Caesar salad in a plastic box for $6.95.  That sort of thing.  You can get a latte.\n\nThe building is a wi-fi hotspot.  You can bring laptops, cell phones, iPods, etc. to the jury corral, where your future as a juror will be decided.  Of course, when you go to the courtroom, all devices must be OFF. \n\nThe best thing about the whole ordeal was Kris the jury clerk.  Her conduct of the proceeding was pleasant and businesslike.  She gets her orders over the phone from mysterious unseen honchos elsewhere in the building.\n\nBy 9 a.m. the hall has 135 citizens. First you're subjected to a movie hosted by Judge Hardcastle.  The screens come down from the ceiling.  You're told that it's an \"honor\" to be selected for jury duty. Thanks, Judgie!\n\nAfter the movie, things turned ugly in a hurry.  About 40 poor saps were culled from the group and told they were \"empaneled,\" i.e., drafted. They had to come back in a couple of days.  They took off.\n\nAround 11, another bunch was pulled into the jury \"lounge.\"  The rest of us were free to go for lunch.  Upon our return, Kris said, we would be herded upstairs to a courtroom.  I wolfed down a couple of shrimp cocktails at the Golden Gate while rehearsing lines I might use to spoil my chances of becoming a juror.  \"If he's not guilty, why was he arrested?\" and so on.\n\nAfter lunch, a miracle: Another group of about 40 were culled and sent upstairs. That left about 20 of us to await our fate. \n\nThe afternoon dragged on. As usual, I shunned my fellow citizens, preferring to station myself in the most distant corner with a book (Horse Heaven). About 12 chairs down, another misanthrope watched a movie on his iPod. I felt twinges of alienation and disbelief at my circumstances. How did I end up here? I don't belong.\n\nThe TV had highlights from the Olympics. We were given breaks. At about 4:45 Kris got the call from upstairs.  We were cut loose, with no jury duty worries for two years.\n\nIt turns out the bunch taken into the lounge were sent home because the case was dismissed. Jury duty isn't the ordeal you might think it is.  If, that is, you don't have to serve.
