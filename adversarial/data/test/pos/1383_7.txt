Pros:\n-They sell a variety of cookies, brownies and ice cream. What is not to love about that?\n-Not only do they have a variety of types of cookies, they are all delicious! My fav is the chocolate chip (with ice cream )\n-They deliver!!! And on top of that, every time I have ordered delivery, the cookies are still warm and gooey upon arrival.\n\nCons:\n-Calories.\n-if you have a big group, plan on ordering take-out. Their space is small.\n\nBottom Line:\nIn the words of Cookie Monster...\"Nom nom nom nom nom nom nom!\"
