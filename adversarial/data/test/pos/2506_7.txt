SHIT HOLE!!!  Too bad 0 stars is not an option here.  The staff and management are rude and only want money.  Someone sprayed pepper spray and sent multiple patrons to the ER and the staff just sat there like they could care less.  Save yourself the trouble and just flush your money down the toilet!.  This place is so ghetto and trashy.  All the money they make from $30 admissions and it still looks the same as it did in 1974.  Disgrace to the gay community!!
