Looking for a little something that's off the beaten path in the Arts District? Stop by Blackbird Studios & Gallery, inside the Commerce Street Studios. This little gem of a gallery is really cool, and very urban! Check out the work of Blackbird's resident artists', along with the rotating lineup of featured artists. You may want to sit in on one of their 'artist talks', or stop by & join the party on First Friday? At Blackbird Studios there's always something going on. \n\nOn \"Third Friday\", each month everybody gets together for \"Drink & Draw\", a collective group of both seasoned artists and novices', sharing an evening of creating art, good conversation and new friends. Every one of all ages is welcome to join in. D & D starts around 7:00 p.m., so BYOB (leaded or unleaded), BYAS (art supplies), and mark your calendars for an evening of creative fun for all.\n\nBTW: this troupe is also a HUGE supporter of local and worldwide causes. I've posted some pics from their last event, \"Japan Aid\" an art auction that raised $$$ for the Red Cross to help the tsunami victims. They did a fabulous job, and you've got to give them extra credit for that!\n\nOne more thing before I forget, there is a great 'Summer Sale' going on right now. A wonderful opportunity to collect fabulous artwork for pennies on the dollar. It doesn't get any better than that. Stop in, and check out a variety of lowbrow & contemporary art today.\n\nBlackbird Studios, the perfect place to 'nest'!\n\n\nHours:\nFirst Friday:                 6:00 p.m. - 10:00 p.m.\nSaturday:                     Noon       -   7:00 p.m.\nSunday:                       1:00 p.m. -   4:00 p.m.\n\n*Live Drawing Sunday afternoons.
