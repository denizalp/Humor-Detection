The best thing you might eat here are the garlic knots. I think I came close to eating two baskets worth all by myself. I didn't care if I wreaked of garlic or that I'd be sweating it out of my pores the next day, they were pretty damn good. As for the rest of the stuff I tried... meh. The menu is typical Italian-American food, the kind of stuff you'll see in a million other spots. Perfect for the non-adventurous eater -- the kind of diner who thinks not eating at a national chain is a bit risky.Â \n\nThe kitchen plays it safe and turns out unremarkable food. Meatballs ($14) made from a filet mignon and pork loin mixture were too hard and dense with a sauce that lacked depth. The small portion of the kale peanut salad ($8) was plenty to share, but the underdressed dish had me reaching for water to wash it down. The end of the meal took a turn for the better with a satisfying, but uninspired, lasagna ($22) with ground filet, ricotta, and mozzarella.\n\nKid menus are available as well. My son's spaghetti (ordered sans tomato sauce, just butter) was a sizable portion that he devoured. Each kid's meal comes with a beverage and mini cannoli.\n\nLocated steps away from the movie theater in Downtown Summerlin, it's a nice looking space with a large patio and a smaller than expected interior, with a bar and open kitchen. The food is more paint-by-numbers than Monet, but is just good enough to satisfy a suburban customer base used to eating recognizable Italian.\n\n2.5 Stars
