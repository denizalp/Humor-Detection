I walked into US Egg the day after Ironman Arizona.  OK...I hobbled in and then gingerly, very gingerly sat down.\n\nI instantly asked for a hot chocolate with EXTRA whip cream and my waitress did not disappoint.  I was given a tower of sugary goodness, which I ate a lot faster than my run pace.\n\nI ate some combination of eggs, meat, and potatoes.  In my post-race fog, I honestly don't remember what it was called, but I know that (a) I liked it and (b) I wasn't hungry when I was done, which is quite an accomplishment the day after racing 140.6 miles.\n\nIf I ever return to AZ, I would definitely go again!
