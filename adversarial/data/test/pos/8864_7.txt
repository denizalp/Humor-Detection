First and foremost this place is beautiful. They really did an amazing job gutting the place. Formerly known as Pure, Omnia completely transformed the space for the better. I came here on a Tuesday night for a Cocktail City party. It was held on the patio and had a stunning view of the Vegas Strip. Extremely long lines for the bar, which is to be expected. We made our way to the dance floor and i dont remember anything after that... Andy realized I had been roofied so we left right away. I will probably come back and try this place out again (and not drink) and hopefully have a better expierence.
