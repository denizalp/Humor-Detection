Ok,put simply-its a basic place to kill time-i do go when i'm\nbored. Theres free soda and coffee. They are giving little more than when they first opened (i'm not a heavy gambler) but they put these colorful lights in each corner on the ceiling that light up when someone wins a jackpot of some sort. Cleanliness wise: Bathrooms should be CLEANED more often.. there was literally a piece of poop on the floor in one stall, I walked in,and walked out real quick.. the cleaning ladies were walking out like they were done. The cigarrete smell is horrid when you're not a smoker, need a strong air purifier or non smoking corner--- i never seem to find alcohol wipes ANYWHERE to clean the slots- not trying to touch these cigarette infested slots after someone just pooped on the bathroom floor.a
