Talk about living up too the HYPE and MOREEEE! I always pass by Yonaka everyday before work and afterwork. So had it on the radar then hearing more and more great reviews, oh my GOD the pictures get posted looked phenomenal, and even done too the decor. Friday night asian persuasion decided check it out on recommendation of the duke and duchess of Yonaka. Mahalos too Arvin and Christina. The place from the minute you step in blows you away with the interior design. The walls with wood whatever but really modern retro look, the tables (even have slot too hold the menu on the side of the table; REALLY now if that not modern what is?) and booths too chairs really nice and comfy, and the sushi bar although we Mel C, Terri R, and I sat on table look really nice. Jus the whole look of the restaurant looks like fine dining see on the strip but think Yonaka free standing restaurant is impressive too say the least.\n\nIt doesn't with the decor but from the service our servers was the best started with Ashley and then Michael. They both were extremely knowledgable about the menu made some great recommendations that we all had and some ran out of room but UYE Duke and Duchess get the rest in!! The attention too detail was top notch constantly checking up but at the right times. Just super friendly staff that makes the evening experience that much more fun. The management very much present asking us questions and also giving us great recommendations (pointing out the specials of the day chalkboard; I miss I walk in really blown away by the decor). Never empty glass on our table. \n\nThe Happy Hour forget the booze for food! Yonaka takes Happy Hour food too another level!! This stigma that cheaper price food. Yonaka is artwork on plate or even say picasso on plate. Seriously the amount of detail put into every dish HH or regular menu there is no difference. Refreshing. The prices are very reasonable for HH not just one or two things few things on the menu most under $10. The regular menu not so bad. I keep thinking that eating at fine dining establishment on the strip but yet got the bill not even close. \n\nThe food gosh we just about order the kitchen sink and more. I did have the benefit of Mel and Terri on lent. LOL! I got whole karaage for myself! It was really good. I like the fact that not deep fried more saute and the sweet chili something type glaze combine with jalapenos and onions was awesome, The edamame was solid. I fan of ones not just boiled but saute or this case grilled get so much more flavor in every bite. The spicy tuna rolls not that spicy at all but loved it! Three per order for HH. Brussel Sprouts everyone raves about that staple everyone should get every visit. It refreshing dish. It just vegetables but still so good. I love the sauce served in or more vinaigrette. Soft shell crab was solid. I found it interesting that not come with wasabi or ginger (had too ask). It was tasty and liked maybe the chef was bored but spelled Yonaka on the plate! Yellow tail was really good. We had mixed berry that was good. I sure missed couple but everything was awesome! If not been too Yonaka yelpers need too GO!!!
