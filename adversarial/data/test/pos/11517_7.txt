Delicious, cheap, quality, and totally worth every penny spent! \nAlthough it's considered \"quick service\" the sandwiches are top notch and a total bang for your buck! 10\/10 would come back again! \n\nWhy I was here \/\/ came with a large group of friends, because it looked quick and they lots of seating \n-note: they do not really have things for vegans! Only GF\/vegetarian options. \n\nAtmosphere \/\/ casual, located in the casino,\nService \/\/ quick, efficient, they give you a buzzer and when it lights up, you pick your food up at the counter. Comes packaged and in a bag for those who wish to take it on the go. \n\nFood \/\/ Chipotle chicken avocado sandwich \/\/ 7.45 - wow this was super yum! Filling and the bread was nicely toasted! They were generous with the chicken and avocado which was a huge plus! \n\nThey also have baked goods and chips on the side. I got the sea salt vinegar! Yummm! \n\nOverall \/\/ I would come back! Earl of Sandwich is great!
