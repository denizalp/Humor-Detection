It could've been luck of the draw that I asked for three awesome beers in a row. Even if that's the case, this place is worth a visit for craft brew fans.\n\nLovelady Brewing is a 2-year old spot on Water St in Downtown Henderson. Unless you're inexplicably driving here from the south, you might miss the sign. It's ok. Make a U-turn then park in the surprisingly spacious parking lot, and walk over to an  local brewery.\n\nI did wait until their 2nd anniversary until I made my first visit. As of the date of this review, I have no idea what the normal price is, but I was grabbing $4 full pours of brews all night long at an obvious bargain compared to bars and other local breweries.\n\n(UPDATE 4\/14\/18: Visited during a normal day and found out that they have prices for what they call a \"Schnitt\" (half-pour) which are comparable to the 4-5 oz taster pours at some bars. For example, Love Juice runs at $3 for a Schnitt and $6 for a pint. Also, all the tasters here are $2.)\n\nFirst pour was the Love Juice #9, a beer which I've seen at Total Wine & More before. It's a NE IPA, a variety of New England India Pale Ale that is unfiltered and leads to a more hazy appearance than typical IPAs.\n\nI followed it up with It Takes 2 To Mango, another NE IPA. This one promised mango and delivered it not long after I started imbibing. It's on the tart end of the continuum, but it grew on me as my palate adjusted to detect the mango. It ended up as my favorite of the night.\n\nThe Double Trouble was no slouch either. To me, it resembled all of those bourbon barrel-aged stouts, but it's actually a BBA doppelbock (a strong variant of a German lager). It had a more subtle level of the flavors which I expect from the aforementioned heavyweights. I would definitely grab another pint when I can.\n\nI cut myself off after the 4th pour, the barrel-aged Black Hole. One of the bartenders (perhaps a Lovelady family member, as are several of the folks whom you'll surely find on the premises) stated that it's been aged in Jim Beam barrels, like the Double Trouble was. It ended up being my least favorite of the night, but only by a small margin. I just couldn't find the flavor depth which I've tasted in other coffee porters\/stouts, but I still liked it a lot.\n\nThe seating area, indoor and otherwise, is actually quite spacious. it was only because of the anniversary event that every table was packed throughout the duration of my visit, but I'm sure that it's far more tolerable on an average day. The folks behind the bar worked quickly and kept the lines moving, which is pretty much all you could ask for.\n\nIn my book, Lovelady Brewing does Henderson proud. They have great employees \/ family members and delicious beers, so they're certainly the third of a triumvirate of capable craft brewers in the city. I'll be back really soon to try some of their other beers.
