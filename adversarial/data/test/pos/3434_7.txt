True to its name, NAQP features quality American and Canadian clothes for men.  It is located in a small house\/boutique on 10th ave, one ave south of the main drag in Inglewood.  They have a  selection of high quality men's clothes. If I was forced to categorize them, I'd go with upscale-casual lumberjack chic.  \n\nIs there any guy who doesn't need a really good flannel shirt in Calgary?  No, of course not.   \n\nNAQP is totally unique within Calgary and a really great new addition to Inglewood.  Go check them out.
