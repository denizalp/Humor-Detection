OMNIA at Caesars is supposed to be this mythical nightclub in Vegas. We came to see Nervo one weekend with a large group of hotties. Spoiler alert: never made it to Nervo cause we weren't really feeling the club after all.\n\nAs usual, OMNIA is super strict on guest lists and being properly dressed to enter. Right when we arrived, we had to search through Caesars to find the end of the guest list line. Finally we found ourselves back on the Strip with what seemed like 4 million lines all trying to get into the same damn club. They need to do better with their signage cause it was hella confusing.\n\nAfter about an hour, we all got in and were ready to party. First stop was checking out what kind of rooms they had. They offer smaller rooms for hip-hop and an outside patio for basic electronic, plus the main EDM hall that's full of all the works.\n\nOMNIA ended up being aiite, and my main gripe was that it was hard to really find a space that really fitted my needs. The outside patio made you feel like you were on a rooftop bar rather than an exclusive VIP club, and the hip-hop room was small and cramped compared to the large EDM hall. It was also a complete maze getting around this club and half the time we were trying to find our drunk friends in a sea of beezies.\n\nWe ended up leaving after a few hours cause OMNIA just didn't cut it for me. I think if there was a better headliner I would've committed more time to staying and enjoying the music. But as a club that prides itself on its glory, I'd pass easily for the likes of Hakkasan or Light.
