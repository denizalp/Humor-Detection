How the hell does a small, out of date strip mall like this have 2 amazing restaurants?!? With Crudo right behind this place you may overlook this little Nook. Well, opening the doors to this place you go from a ugh I don't want to be seen in front of this building (JK) to a whole different feeling. Cool little dark feel and vibe to this place. Raised, half circled booths line the length of the long restaurant and gives it a more intimate feel. Of course, I came for takeout, idiot!! Trust me I will be back to enjoy the restaurant next time. Anyways, for starters we got the fig bruschetta with asparagus and prosciutto (you put this on anything and I'm all in!!). Nailed it!! The Diavolo pizza was next! Now next to prosciutto on my list of meats I must devour is soppressata. Well chorizo, then soppressata. Thin sliced soppressata accompanied by fresh mozzarella and basil. Hellz yeah good. The soppressata has some good heat to it so be warned if you don't like spice! Nook is yet one of many unreal good pizza joints in town. I swear it must be these chefs reproducing at alarming rates. How can you have so many great pizza places? Nook Nailed it!!! I will update my review after I eat here. Might be a 5 star
