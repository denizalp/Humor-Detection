Disaster. This place is a nightmare. It's relatively new and already doesn't look it. And, I had one of the worst checkout experiences of my life. I got in line and the line was long and getting longer. There were 2 cashiers one of them had a very large transaction so the front end supervisor hopped on. All of a sudden, one of the cashiers, who was dressed as Bon Qui Qui, stopped ringing and started processing her go-backs IN SLOW MOTION. She would periodically look up and notice the line getting progressively longer, but continued to move at the pace of molasses in winter. She has a promising future at the DMV. After nearly 10 minutes of this the front end supervisor told her that she wasn't supposed to start that until 2:45 (it was now 2:40 and she had been at this for 10 minutes) and that it shouldn't take her more than 5 minutes. Clearly she hasn't seen her in action. Or inaction. The girl acted like this was new information (I doubt it) and went ahead and started ringing. I swear there was steam coming off the entire line. It was totally ridiculous. I will absolutely never shop here again.
