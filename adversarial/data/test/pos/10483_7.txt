No idea how or why this place only has 2.5 stars?!?\n\nWe used to frequent the one downtown and even though it was a pain in the ass to get to we still enjoyed the old school vibes and of course people watching on Fremont!\n\nI always order the same thing...two egg breakfast with bacon and hash browns and we split a single pancake for dessert. Something about their food just tastes better than many other joints serving the same stuff. Real butter? Fresh eggs? Real potatoes? Freshly squeezed orange juice? Warm maple syrup? Not sure but it just works for us. \n\nIf you haven't tried the pancakes here I highly recommend at least getting a single one just to see what I'm talking about. Hands down the tastiest pancake I've ever had.\n\nThis place is pricier compared to others but I can taste the difference in the quality so it's worth it. I also don't enjoy coming over to the Suncoast and smelling like cigarettes. The restaurant doesn't have full walls and you get to listen to the loud machines directly on the other side which annoys me but I still visit for the food.
