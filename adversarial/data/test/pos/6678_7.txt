The only reason I was here is because I was, uh, wasted and wanted to continue my buzz. Didn't realize that there was going to be an entertainment tax levied because there were two girls dancing behind a sheet, and two well vodkas (Stoli) were going to be $30. Rookie mistake, I know. I suppose that's what you get for being right off the casino floor!
