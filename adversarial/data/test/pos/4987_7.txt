For a sports bar located blocks from Chase Field and US Airways Arena, I don't know how they get away with having so much non-Phoenix sports memorabilia on the walls.  Only in this city!\n\ni was in here *after* a DBacks game and it was practically empty.  They have a decent enough draught selection.  But the place itself is kind of skeevey.  The bathroom was gross and there's a window at eye level across the wall with the urinals so you can look out into the bar (maybe to keep your eye on the game?).  But it means other people can look in.  Strange.\n\nThey were showing the ASU game at the time and the TV I was seated in front of had a terrible fisheyed picture, it almost made me nauseous.\n\nFeh.
