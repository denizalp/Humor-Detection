Momofuku has been around for a while now but I never got the chance to try it until recently. I very much enjoyed my experience at Major Domo in Los Angeles and was hoping for the same here at Momofuku. Located in the Cosmopolitan hotel in Las Vegas, the restaurant is beautiful, modern and airy. \n\nWe came here for lunch and were luckily seated right away, having just beaten the first lunch rush. Since this place was known for their buns, we all ordered our own Pork Belly Buns which came with hoisin sauce, scallions and cucumbers. Honestly, while tasty for what it was as expected, I'm not sure if I could justify spending $7 for just one bun. If you don't live in an area where buns are easily accessible, then give it a try but if buns are a popular \"it\" food in cities like LA, you could probably find the same thing for less that's just as good. \n\nNow the Bo Sssam Rice Bowl sealed the deal for me. Glazed pork shoulder, kimchi rice and pickles put together is seriously one awesome flavor bomb. The pork shoulder was fall-apart tender and the kimchi rice was seriously addicting. The pickled vegetables were sweet, crunchy and vinegary. The perfect accompaniment to round off all the strong, heavy flavors. Although the bowl looked sort of small, it was actually quite deep and all of us who ordered it found ourselves with plenty of leftovers to bring back.
