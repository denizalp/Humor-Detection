Warning: DO NOT make the same mistake I did! A huge mistake we did was coming to this place on a Sunday afternoon so close to the opening of this place. It also seemed like, from the way all the patrons were dressed, that most might have been coming from Sunday mass\/church, so lots of families and large parties were waiting.\n\nWe had an estimated wait of 45 minutes for our party of 5 when we arrived around 11:45AM but actually ended up waiting about an hour to be seated. After that, it took about 30 minutes for our food to arrive. Overall, service was very slow. It was understandable given how PACKED this place was. People were surrounding the restaurant waiting for the table, and you had to be present to hear your name being called over the mic. \n\nIf you can avoid it, I would certainly advise against dining here on a Sunday afternoon.\n\nAfter we were seated, Leigh, our server, greeted us and gave us our menus. \n\nService 3.5\/5 \nI really have to hand it to her... that place seemed chaotic but she was doing a fine job in refilling my friend's coffee and giving us updates when our food was being prepared. I can't really accurately rate the service due to high volume activity, but I did feel like Leigh was trying her best.\n\nFood 4\/5\nWe ordered drinks first. They had kool-aid on tap (offered in grape, blue, and fruit punch). I chose the fruit punch but it was waaaayyyy too sweet so I had to really water it down to drink it comfortably. My friend ordered a lemonade and had to water hers down too, so be aware of over sugared drinks (to be expected in a soul food restaurant, I suppose?) Two of my friends ordered an Arnold Palmer with unsweetened iced tea and I really enjoyed it -- probably would be my choice of drink for the next visit.\n\nI ordered the Baby Ray which came with 3 chicken pieces and 2 waffles. The chicken was drenched in gravy with some semi-carmelized onions as a topping. The gravy had what I believe was a hint of bell pepper to taste (I really hate the taste of bell peppers but this was tolerable). I ended up only being able to finish the thigh and wing part of the chicken. \n\nI only finished the thigh and wing part because the breast was not only way too much food for me, but it was also too dry.\n\nWaffles were perfectly made and also quite large. I was able to finish 1 1\/2 out of the 2 waffles. All this food was actually way too much and definitely put me in a food coma. Do note that I came here on an empty stomach and waited 1.5 hours to actually eat.\n\nAmbience 5\/5\nSouthern style everything! Mason jar cups, mason jar chandeliers... super super cute! I didn't have too much time to examine the restaurant but it was very upbeat and busy. Despite the amount of people in the restaurant and the noise level, I was able to hold conversations with my table which is great. I've been to restaurants that were just as packed but I wouldn't be able to hear the person next to me.\n\nI also saw that they had an outside area, covered of course, which I would love to try when it gets a little warmer out.\n\nI had a pleasant experience with the food and would love to give this place a try at a less busier time!
