The Studio B buffet. Had to save the best for last. After all, the Studio B Buffet is where I had concluded my Vegas trip. After all, its near the outskirts of the strip. Actually not even close. I would say you check this buffet out on your way into Vegas or on your way out. Theres pros and cons for that as well but that is a whole different story. \n\nI cant really comment about the food, after all I was very picky with the selection. I did not try a variety of different things either. What I did do was do what all people do at buffets. I binged and binged and binged. But wait, it wasnt just the food that I was consuming plate after plate. It was the beer. THE FREE BEER. THE FREE DRAFTED BEER. You sure read that right. \n\nYep. So I arrive and just like any buffet, there a wide variety of different foods to choose from. People seem to be taking advantage of the huge crab legs here along with the other seafood, served both chilled and warm so you know. \n\nMy first attack was on french toast. Friends told me I was wasting space eating cheap things like french toast. Like they didnt know who I was or the way I can eat. 3 french toasts later, before anyone even sat down with their food, I was onto my 2nd plate. French toast was very IHOP-like. \n\n5 thick slices of prime rib later, I wonder if I got my moneys worth yet? Hmm I did not think so, neither did my stomach. Avoid the top layer of the prime rib. It was salty as hell. The salt got me thirsty. At this point, I started to wonder where the beer was? Sneaky Studio B Buffet puts it right in front of the buffet so no one notices. Too bad I have friends who dont let friends NOT DRINK when they are drinking. \n\nSo I double fist it, 2 Coors Light beers please.Naturally this is the way to go. After all, who wants to get up and grab a beer again and again. \n\nAt this point, the table is full. They wanted to go gamble about 1 hr to 1.5 hrs into eating. Go ahead I said. \n\nThree of us stayed back. We were taking up a lot of space considering it was just the three of us. We wanted to sit in a nice comfy booth which the waitress agreed to do so. \n\nWe move with beers in hand. Now this was where the real damage at the buffet has begun. \n\n16 beers, 5 bowls of clam chowder, 10 pieces of bread, 10 chicken wings, 3 french toast and 5 slices of prime rib later, I dont know if we were drunk out of our asses at the buffet or were we just sick from eating so much. We killed 2 bottles of Tabasco sauce w\/ our chowder. Who knew that being drunk and eating clam chowder would taste so damn good. Props to their chowder, that was my favorite item there. The wings were pretty good too. But then again, when doesnt  wings go well with beer? \n\nFinally we decided to leave, gut sticking out and all, as I had to rush to the nearby restroom to take a huge crap. Thankfully the Tabasco sauce did not hurt me. \n\nTotal elapse time: 4 hours. \n\nBest way to leave Vegas, in a drunken food coma. Make sure your not the driver either. \n\nBye bye Vegas, until next time.
