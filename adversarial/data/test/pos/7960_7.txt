I like this store.  If you had a time, just look around and you may find bargains, it worth to shop here.  I heard that owner of Ross also own this store.  I bought queen size sheets set for $14, bathroom rug for $2.50, 3 pairs of socks for $2, a pair of sunglasses for $5.  Some stuffs are much cheeper than a Walmart, Marshalls and Ross.
