eating at honey bears is like having an average-looking girlfriend. you're thankful for all the good times you've had, but you have this suspicion that if you looked around you'd find something better. pulled pork sandwich is decent, but the bun is soggy. ribs are tasty but stringy. the \"hot link\" sandwich tastes like a sliced up hot dog. best things there are the fries and the BBQ sauce, which actually go quite well together. make sure you check your take out order before you leave, they've been known to get things wrong.
