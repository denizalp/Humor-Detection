Well, it's a random late night craving for drive through food. There was 2 cars in front of me, but it moved along quite quickly. I haven't been to Taco Bell for a long time and was not sure what my memory of what to expect taste wise could recall. The lady who took my order was really friendly and very polite. Ordered 4 supreme gorditas, a supreme burrito, and a supreme Chalupa. Came out to almost $19.00 lol. Well, everything fit in one small bag curiously so I had to check my order because I actually was not sure how big these things were supposed to be anyways. All was in there though. Came home, ate it, and was instantly reminded of why I haven't been back in so long. The food just lacks flavor. Added the mild sauce- now it's mildly flavorless. If it was not the fact that I knew I was chewing, I couldn't tell you what I was eating. It really just tasted like nothing. No defining ingredient at all. *sighs* Well, I was surprised of the friendly service in the drive through, but the food was forgettable. Will not be back.
