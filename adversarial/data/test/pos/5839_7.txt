I'm with Rory O. on this one, Paloma on St. Clair West makes some of the tastiest gelato, frozen yogurt, and ices that I've had. My first experience with Paloma was way back when eating wasn't considered as cool as it is now and a burger was just a burger. They had one up at 400&7 and only the local Italians seemed to know about it. Fast forward to 2013 and there are several locations in the city, even in the mall (Yorkdale, I don't know about others)! \n\nI'm not sure what it is about this particular location, which, funnily enough, I only discovered recently, but it has the best lickables of all the Palomas--and elsewhere in this city. They have a gazillion flavours and I'm pretty sure I've seen flavours here that I've not seen at their other locations, or elsewhere for that matter. I won't name names, however, as I can't be 100% sure of this but so far I've had the dulce de leche (tastes buttery and not heavy on the caramel-y flavor), mango, peach (both so-so), pineapple yoghurt (yum), burnt almond (big chunks of almonds that have a good smoky taste to them like they roast 'em themselves over an open fire!), pink grapefruit (refreshing and one of my all-time faves)...they seem to have the perfect density to the creaminess and there is just the right amount of flavor with each! I have yet to find that elsewhere--I find a lot of the time at other places, the quality isn't there and compared to Paloma's, they taste kind of cheap--I can't wait to try them all!! \n\nIf I'm not mistaken, they may even be a little more $$ than their other locations but don't quote me on that. The only drawback is their service. I don't expect a tea party with these people each time I go in, but they're really cold. Thing is, they're not like that with the other customers though, and I'm not rude!! I don't get it...anyhow, it's located at the far west end of Corso Italia--funnily enough, two doors away from Agio which is where I ate AGAIN tonight!! It may be cash only.
