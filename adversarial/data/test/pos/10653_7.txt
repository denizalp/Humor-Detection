Other than the crowded seating and the menu that is difficult to see from most seats (take a picture and read it on your phone!), the restaurant and the service was excellent. The food was wonderful.\n\nNow, we only have to solve the problem of which one is better, Joe Beef or Liverpool House. I guess we will just have to go back repeatedly to help decide.
