Decided to go this place because it's very close to my house and I was in the mood for Indian food and didn't want to make the trek to Saffron.  OMG!  Most menus at Indian restaurants are the same--you won't find too many varying entrees to choose from, but still, the Paneer Tikka Masala (I think that's the name) was out of this world.  I've gone back a few times since and have nothing but positive things to say about the staff and the restaurant overall.\n\nThis is a great place to get some solid Indian food at a pretty decent price.
