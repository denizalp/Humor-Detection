Manager\/owner at the front desk was snubbing someone on the phone as we waited to be seated.  Reservations..we were seated directly next to the kitchen with 80% of the tables open.  Asked for a different seat..he sat us across from the same seat.  My problem with this is that I would have thought that with a reservation we could expect a better table...ESPECIALLY when we asked.  I know how picky that sounds but in a very small restaurant,  it matters.  When we finally were offered bread, it was embarrassing...white sliced bread..seriously.  and not yummy lol.  Mediterranean Salmon with shellfish?  2 clams 2 mussels and something close to a \"boiled piece of salmon\".  I make much better at home.  Place looked and smelt wonderful though :-)
