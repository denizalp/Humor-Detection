We are among the OG's who used to eat here when it was Villa Pizza. The kids and my childlike brother always loved the sweet tangy sauce. ( In later years, my brother made a discovery of empty cans of Campbell's tomato soup in their trash. Coincidentally, this was always my mother's \"secret ingredient\" in spaghetti sauce. My mother was not even one smidge Italian. She was a white girl from Idaho.)\n\nDon't worry about what my brother was doing in their trash.\n\nAnyway, Babygirl and I were jonesing for pizza to go with our evening of the \"Walking Dead\" (eat first, view later!), and she decided it had to be the glorious pie of her childhood memories. \n\n We picked up so I can't comment on the delivery, but all went well with our order. A large cheese is about $14, which isn't too bad. The pizza did taste pretty much the same as before, which is 4 stars from her and 3 from me. The thin crust is nice and chewy and had a decent char. The chicken wings were nice and meaty but a little tough, but they do have great ranch dip- nice and garlicky. They were at a steady 3 stars until we tried the meatball sub.\n\n Yuck! Meatballs should be moist and tender- these went past that and deep into mushy. Tasted like more filler than meat. I think they used that recipe from the poor relative's barbeque in \"National Lampoon's Vacation\".  Gave most of it to the very surprised dog, who never gets anything. \nHe ate it, but last night he was eating a rat, so I wouldn't depend on his opinion.
