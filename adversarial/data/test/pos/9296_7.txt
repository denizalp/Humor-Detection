Let's cut to the Chase.\n\nPretty generic dark grey building hovering over the skyline of Cleveland Ohio. Not the tallest or prettiest building but still pretty cool considering that Cleveland was - for a long time - a dying industrial relic of the past, and now it is springing up in this way which is a great thing.\n\nAlso I'll be honest. I have a premium investment account with Chase and I f***ing love it. No wonder rich people in America are so rich.
