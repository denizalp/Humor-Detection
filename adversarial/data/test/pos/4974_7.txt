Came here on a Friday for lunch at around 11:45 AM, and decided to try one of their Lunch specials, which looks pretty good.\n\nI decided to try General Tao chicken, one of their spicy dishes, and I find it pretty A-OK. It is spicy but really good. There was just too much gravy in the food in my opinion. I wish the gravy only covered half of the plate, but it has made the chicken very soggy.\n\nMy friend got the Chilli Chicken, which I should have ordered, because I find it much better tasting than General Tao, but I guess I will try that next time I go here.\n\nThis restaurant gets pretty packed especially during lunch, so make sure you arrive around 11:30 - 11:45. Even arriving at 11:45AM, we had to wait at least half an hour for our food.\n\nI would go back to try their Chilli Chicken next time.\n\n\nReview 4 of 100
