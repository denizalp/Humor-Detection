For many a moon, I enjoyed dukedom at this local staple and because of its proximity to the rooftop casino next door, I used it often as a turn key opportunity for local lady-friends. \"Let's meet at mercbar\" was the old adage for \"let's meet at the closet bar possible to my Patrick Bateman condo next door where I'll feed you glasses of very nice \"Chardonnay...\"  Funny , cause its true. ;)\n\nFull disclosure now behind us, I can say that I really like this place.  Quality creative drinks served by an attentive, attractive staff.  Very nice ambience and great place to take a lady for cocktail.  \n\nI'm a big fan of the Pisco sours--they also have a great selection of bourbon and a decent charturie (sp?) board....\n\nFun fact: during the week nights high end (Ehem) female friends are known for hanging out here due to the proximity of the Ritz Carleton, the Biltmore and other 5 star millionaire magnets   \n\nMiss you mercbar! We shall meet again!
