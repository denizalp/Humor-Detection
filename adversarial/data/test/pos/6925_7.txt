Avoid this dealership ...I made clear I wanted to put a lease in my daughter's name (she was one day shy of 18) with me co-signing in order to build her credit. Oh sure, no problem...you can take the car for her today and we will redo the paperwork tomorrow when she turns 18. I said great. Returned the next day as agreed and this time everything was different and the best they could do was to add another $40 a month to the lease terms. I was outraged. Completely lied and scammed me. I'll never do business with them again...be warned and go elsewhere!
