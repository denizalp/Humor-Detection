The Sahara Hotel can be fun. Seriously.\n\nThere's the $1 black jack tables, creepy Beatles tribute bands, and karaoke nights at the Cantab Lounge that are unflinchingly hilarious (and depressing). Some of the rooms have nice views of the mountains. The praise ends there.\n\nDon't expect the internet to work, and try not to walk around alone. Once, I waited for forty minutes for the elevators to get fixed... all while fire alarms blared and old women continued to fill the penny slots without delay. If the shower in your room sounds like it's going to burst, that's how you know the hot water is working. Avoid the buffet. The steakhouse isn't too bad.\n\nHave fun!
