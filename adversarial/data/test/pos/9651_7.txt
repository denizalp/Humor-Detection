Located at the Las Vegas Blvd entrance of the Monte Carlo Casino, you'll find this eco-friendly, sustainable, green, organic and local coffee or espresso bar.  There is the other Seattle-based mega coffee chain in the hotel.  But, for a great experience from organically and ethically sourced coffee beans, great coffee beverage flavors with individualized latte art and attentive service for our wake-up, we choose Sambalatte Torrefazione.\n\nThis coffee bar's d√©cor is eye-appealing with its organic colors, spacious counter where you can watch your highly trained barista prepare (brew)your beverage in a Steampunk Coffee Machine and if you're lucky, you can catch the Master Roaster in the coffee lab roasting the next batch of coffee. The baristas are highly trained in preparing the best brew for you while drawing from their single-origin coffee beans.  There is a lot of seating options available at both indoors or outdoors.  The coffee \"condiment\" stations are nicely stocked and kept clean by the hardworking employees.  But, maybe the reason why these stations are so clean is because your coffee beverage tastes so good that many don't need to add sugar or creamer.\n\nI first started trying Sambalatte Torrefazione a couple years ago at this location and will have to say they pride themselves as being consistent.  They are consistent with their friendly service and great tasting coffee beverages and luscious pastries.  Prices are reasonable and competitive with the other coffee chain but you don't have to fight the long lines or search for a place to sit.  Our experiences feel so much more personalized.\n\nAt Sambalatte Torrefazione, you can feel relaxed and treated well from the time that you enter until you leave.
