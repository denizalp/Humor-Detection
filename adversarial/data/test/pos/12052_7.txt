Came in hoping to get \"the best duck in the city\" according to the Yelp reviews. Ordered a whole duck. It was just 40% bone and 55% FAT!!! No meat. The vegetable on the side was OK but too oily. Maybe I came in the wrong time?! I will try this place one more time because of such great reviews on Yelp.
