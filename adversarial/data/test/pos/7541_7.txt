Busy, busy! On a Saturday around noon, Morning Glory was slammed with hungry diners and the staff was visibly frazzled. I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich ($6) made with cheddar, gruyere and havarti and sliced tomatoes plus a side of rosti ($2). The sandwich prices seem reasonable ($5-8) until you realize there are no sides included - luckily there is a menu of sides to choose from (greens, rosti, bacon, etc.)\n\nWhile the sandwich was decadent (three quality melted cheeses AND tomatoes, plus the light rye bread was crispy and sufficiently greased up), I had to subtract a star for the pitiful rosti. Though it tasted just like rosti should (perhaps the addition of paprika would spice it up, just sayin') the portion was pathetic - just a few shreds of potato that barely stuck together and definitely not $2 worth. I was anticipating a nice little hash brown patty rosti like the kind at Le Petit Dejeuner but this rosti definitely fell short. The worst part was that two of us got rosti and mine was the better looking of the two!!
