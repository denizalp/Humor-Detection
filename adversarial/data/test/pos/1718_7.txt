Yes, one solitary star and just because I cannot give you a perfect zero. Lets break this down. \n\nService: I got a manicure and a pedicure. On Spa day, the total was a 100 or so dollars. Now at this price I expect one thing at the least. Cut my nails right ! The lady that did them, cut my nails straight across. And by this I mean my nails looked like a box, they did not curve along the spend natural line as one would  expect. So for a 100 bucks you cant even cut my nails right ? Seriously a wtf moment\n\nSo ok I forgive you for screwing up my pedicure, but when I point out to you that my nails were not done right on the manicure, you spend less than 5 seconds with a file and still leave it the same way, you should not be doing anyone's nails. (And then Cheryl or whatever her name was tells me how she hates doing nails!! More wtfs follow in my in internal monologue!)\n\nSo I guess what I am getting at, is do not bother going to Jurlique. Even if they let you go in for free, you's be spending money or time or both getting it fixed. \n\nYes, the place was bad enough to make me come out and review this place. Argh. What a flipping waste.
