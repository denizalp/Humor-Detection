Man, I almost forgot what it's like to be in a groovy, trendy, local coffee shop!\n\nAmbiance: fabulous art on the walls, lots of geeky memorabilia (heavy on Star Wars).\n\nService: fast and friendly.\n\nSelection: I seriously doubt there is a type of coffee you like that they do not serve here.  From drip to various espresso drinks to MCT oil & butter, to nitogenated.  I got a \"Bulletproof Coffee\"  which is a coffee loaded in fat due to MCT oil and grass-fed butter.  It was slippery and delicious!\n\nDon't be fooled by the generic exterior, this place packs massive amounts of charm!
