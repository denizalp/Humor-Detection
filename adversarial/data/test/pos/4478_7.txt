I hate dealerships and I try to avoid them at any cost... But this place is a different story! After several lousy experiences at numerous other dealerships, I didn't want to come here but when it comes to my hubby's STI, I don't really have a choice lol. \n\nThe staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Unlike other salespeople at other dealerships, when I say \"I'm just here to look, and have no intentions of purchasing yet,\" They actually get it! They didn't keep pushing or try to persuade me in any way whatsoever. They still took their time to answer any questions we had and just said \"well, here's my card and whenever you decide you're ready, you got my number.\" Uhm... you rock!! The only thing that kept going through my mind was: Awesome! Finally! a salesperson that actually has EARS and a BRAIN! Who would've thought that was possible?! ;)\n\nNow, back to the STI... husband loves his car more than anything. I think his priority list looks something like this:\n1. STI\n2. Wife\n3. Dogs\n\nEh, at least I come before the dogs... good enough for me. Anyway, back on topic... He occasionally comes here to purchase parts from Zenkai motorsport. If you're looking to modify your Subaru and\/or have any questions... Mike is your guy!\n\nI think we'll definitely be coming back here to purchase our next vehicle later down the road.
