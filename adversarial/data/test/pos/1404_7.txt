I came for a sunday brunch. The desserts lead me on. \nIt was like a Monet. They looked so delicious from far away, but up close they were just a mess. They didn't taste so good. \n\nBut they did have PRIME RIB for brunch! OH MAN it was sooooo damn good. I ate tons of prime rib and bacon for brunch. The Chinese food looked iffy so stay away from that. But the breakfast items are good, and the spicy tuna handrolls are also decent. They're also pretty damn spicy. \n\nTop it off with $5 bottomless Mimosas. MMMM MMMMMMM MMMMMMMM
