This is one of my favorite pizza joints in Vegas. I have missed this place a lot and came back this past weekend after not having it for a while. I usually order the same thing. Meatballs, garlic string beans, the New Yorker, Cal Italia, etc. I want to know what the hell happened to the New Yorker?! It had an excessive amount of tomato sauce on it. I can only taste the tomato sauce and the pizza overall was a lot saltier than usual. Barely any ricotta too. I only ate one slice. :\/\n\nService is always good. I've never had an issue with their service. Glad they turned the music down. The old fart in me always thought it was too loud in here with the rock music. I will come back but the past few times, I have been going to the Green Valley location and it was excellent. Please fix your New Yorker! Thank you.
