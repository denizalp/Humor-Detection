Bait and switch and falsifying information over the phone is not the proper way to get the customer in the door. We wasted our time listening to their lies and reading their false advertisements and driving to see a vehicle that they never had on the lot. I am writing this review to urge others not to waste their time with Scott Clark. \n\nScott Clark advertised a vehicle for sale on their website and on Autotrader.com. I called to verify information from the posting because there were only five low quality photos posted. My husband also called to verify the information and that the vehicle was still available. We both called numerous times on different days. We received the same information three times, \"the vehicle is here, come take a look\".  We decided to make the hour drive to test drive it. When we arrived the vehicle was not there. They told us it was a trade in deal that fell through and that the car was never actually on the lot. Scott Clark advertised the vehicle on multiple sites and verified on the phone that they had that specific car when they never should have advertised a car they didn't have on the lot\n\nDo not waste your time at Scott Clark Nissan. They will lie to you repeatedly. They will advertise vehicles that they do not have to get you in the door. Scott Clark is a bait and switch dealership with poor business ethics. I will never do business with any Scott Clark dealership and I will tell everyone I know all about my horrible experience with Scott Clark.
