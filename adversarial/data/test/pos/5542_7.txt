After my last hairstylist \"broke up with me\" by moving to Wisconsin (what-EVER!) I decided to go \"low maintenance\" for awhile, coloring my own hair and getting my bangs trimmed at a local cheap walk-in place. That is, until the cheap walk-in place (see my other reviews) butchered my bangs so badly it took months to grow the remaining bits out. That's when I realized I needed to pony up the money to go to a real salon. I chose Armis Salon based on the reviews here on Yelp and elsewhere.\n\nArmis herself was behind the desk and greeted me warmly when I entered. She was my stylist, and I couldn't be happier with the results! First, she took plenty of time to look at my hair and talk to me to understand what I was looking for. She carefully tousled her way through my hair checking the cowlicks and texture, and asking about what side I parted my hair on, and what I might consider. She even managed to get it looking pretty good with some skillful maneuvers and said, \"Something like this?\"\n\nYes, something exactly like that, please. After we talked through colors, she was off to the races, getting me started with partial highlights, then finally cutting my hair.\n\nThe resulting cut and color was exceptional by my standards. I'm the type of person who can't wait to leave a salon so I can go home and \"re-do\" my style more how I like it, but Armis' work was perfect and I left absolutely happy and satisfied.\n\nWhat I liked most about Armis was that she talked with me and got to know me and my hair. And better yet, when she styled my hair at the end, she instructed me step-by-step on how to achieve the same looks she was magically pulling off. She recommended I purchase some clips (and told me where to buy them) to help with styling, and recommended a hairdryer with brush attachment from Target. \n\nLeaving with not only a great cut, but also the information and tools I needed to keep it looking fabulous, was something I've never experienced before. Armis and her salon are fantastic, and I can't recommend her highly enough!
