Couldn't agree more with the majority of reviews. It's not good.\n\nI had gone to Best Buy to buy a new fridge. Thirty minutes later I am standing in the hi-fi section persuading myself that what I really need is a kick ass stereo.\n\nI decide to step outside to try and calm what could be an awful frenzy of spending. Pick Up Stix looks like a great place to grab a quick bite so I stop by. \n\nLike so much fast food, it sounds good. Seems convenient. But of course you leave regretting your actions almost immediately. Still, it worked. \n\nI have a new fridge.
