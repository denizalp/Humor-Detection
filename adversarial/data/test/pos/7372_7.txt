Intrigue is a 3.5 star club to me - it has a few quirks that hold it back but overall, I think I enjoyed my time there.  \n\n(By the way, something to note is that all clubs in Vegas do have heavier security than they used to - guys should expect a pat down\/wand with bag checks).   \n\nSome of the things that I really enjoy about the club:\n-Personally, although the music was a little 'eh' that night, the background setting is one of the cooler aspects.  Three colored fountains bounce to the music and they also all have flames hidden in them to create flame fountains.  Sure it doesn't get too surprising after the first song but whether you're staring at them in the back or just seeing them in the background of a DJ, it makes for a cool scene (plus a waterfall that hasn't changed much from the Tryst days).  \n-The effects are on point - everything you need is here including strobe lights, lasers, CO2, etc.  There's a whole lot of them too and makes it almost too much but it's cool to see them all work in tandem alongside the fountains.  \n-The back is a nice place to relax and enjoy both the outdoor air as well as seeing the DJ stage\/crowd from a cool little back area long with selfie machines.  \n-Service was fairly nice.  Bartenders were quick and the prices were fairly standard Vegas prices ($20 for a Red Bull\/Vodka).  \n\nSome of the off things about the club for me include:\n-The Cotton Candy Stands: It's a cool idea in theory but really random and personally doesn't really fit with the theme for the club.  How about selling masks like in the logo or bar snacks for the drinking crowd?  \n-Weird in-between acts: There were really abrupt dancers that came out and literally stopped the DJ set and would see the DJ duck behind the station.  Sure the dancers have a theme and are talented...but again, the theme seems super off and kills the flow of a DJ.  Why not have the dancers come out to the music (I get it - because an elaborate dance set was created...but at the expense of the atmosphere\/flow?)\n-Crowd: Trust me, I love to be in a club that isn't crowded to the point where everyone is stepping on one another but it didn't seem crowded with half the tables on the outside not taken.  The club is definitely still developing and trying to spread.  \n\nThe in-between:\n-The music: Intrigue definitely seems to try to flow with live acts like Kesha or Beba (when I went).  At least my night, though, Beba didn't appear until super, super late (past 2AM) and the DJs before were just...okay.  Taking out the dance acts would help with some of this I think?  \n\nSo again, a lot of love it\/hate it items - hope the club develops into something special.
