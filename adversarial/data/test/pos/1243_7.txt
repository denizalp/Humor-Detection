Love the food I've tried here so far!  Nice decor\/atmosphere.  It can get VERY NOISY, though.  The pork torta sandwich (that title is repetitive... torta is Spanish for sandwich), which came with goat cheese and tamarind on grilled flatbread and sides of cole slaw and awesome waffle fries, was fantastic!  I also had the pleasure of trying my neighbor's Coconut ginger curry rice (w\/ chicken).  Yummy!  Complimentary tiny dishes of dips and tortilla chips were devoured by table companions so I assume they were good. \n\nArrive early for happy hour or dinner or you'll have to resign yourself to a long wait.
