Let me start by saying that I leave reviews for places that surprise me for either being overrated or for offering a good bang for your buck.  \n\nChelsea's Kitchen is probably one of the most overrated places I've ever been.  I have no idea how so many people have given this place 5 stars.  \n\nI mean this place seriously sucks.  A $15 burger that looks like your buddy's dad made it on his old propane gas grill?  Covered in packaged American cheese and \"house made\" Russian dressing but it has Chelsea in its name so it must be great?  Maybe they meant the Claussen burger since the best part about it was the jarred grocery store pickles that were on it.  Really?  Just give me a Zipps burger and the fries will be better too.  \n\nRest of the table got short rib tacos, steak tacos, paella special and another burger.  No one was impressed.  \n\nI've been to this kitchen twice, the first and the last time.  Do yourself a huge favor and skip the valet and keep driving down Camelback to somewhere else.
