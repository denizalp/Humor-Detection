I dont know what the crack everyone else is smoking, but this hotel is great. Maybe it's because I grew up poor and a \"nasty\" hotel to me is a motel 6 in the ghetto, but we had a perfectly acceptable experience with the Flamingo this past week, starting with the check in on Thursday afternoon (3\/10). \n\nThe check-in would be my only beef with the place, since they are very much aware it can take 30-90 min waiting in line, yet they do not add more reps behind the counter. We were lucky and it only took about 25 min to get up to the desk. \n\n** The Total Rewards kiosk does not let you check in if you are a new member **  \n\nI read so many tips to sign up at the kiosk and ask to be checked in, and was excited to show off my trick to my man friend, but we asked two Total Rewards reps if we could check in at the Kiosk, and they both said no. Maybe they only let low tiers check in during super crazy wait times.. I donno. But either way, being a TR member cant hurt, so just do it. And the Gold card is glitttttery! We ended up getting $3 off our hotel bill at the end after redeeming points which, for no effort, ain't too shabby. Shows you how little money we spent on TR partners\/gambling, though, heh. \n\nBut yeah, we only waited 25 min and our front desk lady was SO nice. She'd been at the Flamingo for 7 years, I think? She recommended the Yard House nearby, which was awesome! (go during happy hour and get the Vampire taco). \n\nI figured since we were there on a timeshare presentation deal they would just stick us in the worst of the worst rooms, but I was pleasantly surprised with our Fab room on the 19th floor. Wood laminate floors, plenty of counter space in the bathroom, and the bed was a fricken normal bed. No stains, cockroaches, busted windows or anything to complain about.  Yes, the showers are not Bellagio standard, but hey.. just dont have Bellagio standards at Flamingo prices and you be fine. \n\nI saw a lot of complaints about the elevators, but we had no problems whatsoever. It did get pretty busy last Saturday of our stay, but we never had to wait longer than a minute for an elevator, and no weird hocus pocus shit happened on the way down. \n\nOh, and there was no coffee maker in the Fab room, which was kind of disappointing, but I got my fill of coffee at the time share (which I totally recommend doing for perks if you are not gullible). \n\nOther than that, the Flamingo is a great location in the middle of the strip, and the blackjack tables have awesome side bet rules, so we raked in the cash (Margaritaville has $5 min limit with same rules, whereas we could only find $10 minimum tables at Flamingo). \n\nI would definitely stay here again!
