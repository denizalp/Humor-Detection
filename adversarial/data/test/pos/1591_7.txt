It's true--Canadians really do love denim. There's no place more appropriate to assemble your finest Canadian Tuxedo than Hadio.\n\nThere must be no less than 500 denim jackets stacked on the floor and lining the entire length of this second hand store in Mont-Royal. As far as the eye can see in every shade, wash, and brand. From Levis to Wrangler to Lee and any other manufacturer, if you love denim, you'll love this shop. \n\nThey also have hordes of novelty t-shirts and wacky button ups. Seems like it's a little on the pricey end of the spectrum for locals, but as an American with an exchange rate that levels the playing field, it's a bargain.
