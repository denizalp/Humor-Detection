I placed an order for takeout-- we ordered Panang curry, massaman curry, and soup. We had high hopes-- but Benjarong wasn't very good (the Thai place that was at this location before) and this place isn't very good either. Same owners new name?\n\nThe curries weren't creamy or flavorful. The Panang lacked flavor and the chicken used was weird dark meat and cut in large hunks.\n\nThe massaman curry was very viscus and just again, not good. \n\nUnfortunately we wont be ordering from this restaurant again.
