Oh man! Implode the towers, build new ones, and use the pyramid to house the casino, cirque show, nightclub, titanic exhibit, etc. I stayed here once pre-remodel and decided to give it another try post-remodel since they gave us two nights free. \n\nIt needs to be remodeled again at the very least, especially since Vegas is moving more toward luxury and moving away from themes. The rooms are dark and dingy feeling and still have that chotchsky Egyptian decor. \n\nWe stayed in a tower room..the layout of the hallways are confusing and the a\/c in the room barely kept up. If you're looking for a no thrills cheap room then this may be for you.
