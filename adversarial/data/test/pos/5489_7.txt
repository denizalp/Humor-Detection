Brought my laptop in to get the screen fixed. Didn't get my laptop fixed, but the gentleman working that day showed me how to utilize my laptop as a desktop. They could have fixed my screen, but he advised that the age of my laptop wasn't worth getting fixed, but in a nicer way lol. So he basically saved me money and now I get to use my 10yr+laptop to find photos and music I hadnt heard or seen in a long time. \n\nI have another hard drive that just stopped working which is what I used for my actual desktop computer and I have a lot of memories stored in it. I'll definitely be bringing it by to see if I can salvage what's left of the thousands of photos I've stored on it.
