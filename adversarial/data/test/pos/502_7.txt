I will no longer be going to this nail salon. The nail technician Ben, and Tom did a horrible paint job on my nails. Very sloppy work. Also take caution to the male tech's hands, if they are dirty ask them to use a glove or ask for another tech.I used to like coming here because of the location, and moderate price range. However, I am willing to drive a distance to receive quality for the service provided and see my money's worth.
