This is a very popular spot with my coworkers. You can get a seriously large meal for a good price. And the service is friendly and attentive, especially if you're a regular. And the food is surprisingly good for a 24\/7 coffee shop. Plus there's the whole 50s\/ 60s vibe with the music. Its nothing gourmet or unique, but it ain't bad.
