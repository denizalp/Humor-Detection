I have used A\/C by Jay for many of my clients a\/c needs.  One tech lied about the work he performed at one clients home.  On another call to a different client, they diagnosed the system without even checking the freon level or checking the load on the compressor.  After many failed attempts with their company, I have finally found a very reliable, trustworthy and professional company with Precision A\/C.  Laith Hensley came out and now he is my go to guy at Precision a\/c. It was very disappointing  to put faith in A\/C by Jay for so long to have them consistently fail me.  I did share my concerns with the office and they said they would have someone call me to address my concerns.  To date, I have not received a call.
