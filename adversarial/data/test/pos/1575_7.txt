Two Words: Hidden Gem \n\nThis is a local favorite. Honestly, the few places to get fresh sushi in Vegas.\n\nMy favorite is the lobster roll - it is worth the $. If sushi is not your thing, they have lots of other options meat, vegetarian and seafood. My go-to would be the black cod - so flavorful. \n\nAs for drinks, they offer a variety of sake. I got this really interesting cocktail that comes with a sphere ice cube. \n\nService is always impeccable and they are so warm!
