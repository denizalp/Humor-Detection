I do not recommend getting the whole day buffet deal. In the end, it's not worth it after all. Reason #1: Sunday all day buffet consists of lunch and dinner only, no breakfast. Reason #2: Pretty much the same food during dinner as lunch, so you'll get sick of it. Reason #3: You'll be \"drinking\" so much during that day that by dinner time, I don't think you would want to stuff your face with the same food to get your money's worth.\n\nFood was alright. I remember crab legs, turkey, ham, steak for lunch and rotated during dinner time too. A variety of other food, but nothing was very memorable except the omelet station (selection of ingredients and made fresh to order). I normally judge a buffet by desserts and for lunch they still had Halloween decorated desserts probably from the day before. By dinner time, desserts were pretty much the same with a few switched out and replaced. They do have a soft serve ice cream machine with sugar cones, chocolate and vanilla custard (?). The white chocolate cranberry cookies were good though.\n\nP.S. They had free champagne when I went and with a glass of orange juice, you get mimosas with your lunch! =)
