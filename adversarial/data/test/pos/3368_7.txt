Was not impressed with any of the juice here. Alot of the juice tastes like chemicals. Even though the juice price was very very low so was the quality in their juice. Staff was nice but asked for a rewick and after I saw what they did I was disgusted with the rewick. The coil was bent and the cotton was horrible. I don't know what all the hype is about besides the price. Sorry but I will not be returning
