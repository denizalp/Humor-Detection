A meal is like having a relationship with the chef, this meal was like having an abusive spouse. \n\nThe meal opened with a home made english muffin accompanied by a delicious honey butter and jams that seduced and promised so much more to come. \n\nBut after what I can only assume was a bad day at work, the shouting started... a fig and goat cheese pizza with arugala that was so heavy handed with the fig and truffle oil that it may have left bruises... but we'll just tell people I walked into a door. \n\nOf course, there were apologies made, promises he'll never do it again, and a make up gift.  The most deliciously cooked burger I've had in a long time. A perfectly cooked fried egg on top of medium rare meat, with roasted red peppers on a wholesome bun. \n\nAs we all know, though, it isn't meant to last, and soon things fell apart once more. A pork belly so thoroughly charred to a crisp that I was unable to forgive. So we had to go our seperate ways.. but even with all the problems, I'll still probably be back. I mean... he loves me...
