I don't know about you but my craving for Pizza is always coupled with immense guilt for wanting something so unhealthy! not any more though... =) \nthe Pizzas at Pure are not only delicious, but even after you have devoured an entire pizza you won't get up from your chair feeling overly full or bloated or gross! it probably has to do with the fact that they use fresh \/ local \/ organic (when possible) ingredients, and they keep the pizzas simple - thin crusts, moderate toppings, but a good \/ creative variety to choose from. Yes, I do think the pizzas are a little pricey for what they are; but there's no harm in treating yourself to some delicious, non guilt inducing pizza once in a while! my favorite, is the simplest one on their menu - the margarita pizza with honey on the side. If you're looking for a non tomato based one, the wild mushroom pizza is great. Their pepperoni supreme is pretty good as well, though I thought the pure country one could definitely use a little more prosciutto on it. Their menu also includes sandwiches, calzones and salads - may be I'll get to those some day, but for now I'm sticking with the pizza!
