We didn't stay at the Westin, but it was an extremely odd stop on our off the strip tour in search of a little bit of dirty Vegas. \n\nThis place just cracked me up from the beginning. The ceiling was leaking and they had almost the entire front entrance blocked off with yellow hazard tape. The gaming area, I think they call them casinos at most places was itty-bitty and the dealers looked beyond bored with little to no action. Moving on to the bar, I suppose.\n\nHow can you go wrong at a bar... any bar? You really can't, but I guess I expected a bit more quality from a place like the Westin - then again, their roof was leaking. The bartender approached us and was munching on something while asking what we wanted to drink. Keep in mind that no words were uttered during his attempt to \"ask\" us what we wanted, only chewing and head nods. We ordered a few shots of Jack Daniels and he took off prepare our order, and probably eat a little more. Hell, if he's eating so am I! They have bar snacks on the bar for when you play, so our lack of better judgement decided to let us indulge. I have absolutely no idea what we were eating, but they were dry, crunchy, salty and nasty - just what I needed! As my money dwindled away on the video poker machine, the snacky bartender returned (still chewing) and delivered our shots. There was a brief moment when I thought the shots may be comped due to my play on the machine until my buddy Noel spilled the entire glass of bar snacks all over the poker machine... ugh. My friends are indeed morons. Snacky then muttered \"That will be forty-something dollars\" as he looked at the mess in disgust. Can't say I blame him.\n\nLeaky roofs, snacky bartenders, uninterested dealers and saltly snacks = 4 stars.
