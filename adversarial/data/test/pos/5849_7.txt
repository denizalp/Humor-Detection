Disappointing,  to say the least.   Every glass of water brought by the waitress had stuff floating in it.   She thought I should just drink it because she couldn't find a clean glass.  Had to pay for a bottled drink.  I was ready to leave at that point but was convinced to stay by the person I was with.  Service was slow, despite telling the waitress that we were on our lunch hours.  The salad was ok.  The pizza was disappointing,  too greasy and salty.  The food gave both of us indigestion.   Won't be returning.
