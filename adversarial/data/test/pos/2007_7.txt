This is my second favorite dumpling place, it's not that the dumplings aren't as good as Qing Hua but I live closer to it so it gets extra points for proximity. \n\nMai Xiang Yuan has great dumpling, not to mention the variety. I guaranty that they'll have something for every one from plain Jane pork to my favorite Oyster and pickled cabbage. In my opinion the best way to enjoy this kind of restaurant is with a group of friends so you can each get a different type of dumplings and share them, but if you're on your own you can always get them to give you two kind of dumpling per basket.\n\nThere isn't much to say about the service other then it's like most places in Chinatown quick and efficient but without much conversation.  I memory serves me correctly they close early as well, so if you have a craving for dumpling past 9 pm you might be out of luck.\n\nThis is a small place with only a dozen or so tables and what feels like hundreds of waving cats. If you plan on heading over with a group it might be a good idea to call ahead and make a reservation. If you're in or around Chinatown you might want to stop in and enjoy some of the best dumplings in the city while being watched by waving cats.
