請問!  boh deen-wah johk.  I like this place.  Ordered takeaway here a few times here now and stuff is quick, cheap, hot and wrapped super well.  No dripping red mystery sauce on my El Camino seats!  Wonton could use a tad more flavor but hot n sour soup is some of the best Ive had.  Never had Cantonese pan-fried noodles until I had em on a whim from here.  These things changed my life!  Whatever that brown sauce they add to the pork and beef version is awesome.  Also, I tried Schezwan beef and it was equally as good!  Spicy and smokey.  My only regret is that I didnt order it without onions.  Onions are the devils foreskin.  As with most reviews I like to point out the positive then backhand em with reality.  This place does not have hot sauce packets...  The DO have \"hot sauce\"  but it comes in a cup and you have to pay extra.  Both times Ive had it its different.  This past time it was bitter and flavorless and NOT EVEN HOT!  The first time it was more like a sambal. I know we are in the Midwest and people have the flavor palet of a 5 yr old but some of us like it hot.  The compaines that make all that duck sauce crap also make HOT sauce.  Just buy a box and be done with it..  First Chinese spot in history that I have not seen that doesnt carry some sort of spicy goodness...  I will be back but next time I will just bring my own Sirracha aka. hipster ketchup...
