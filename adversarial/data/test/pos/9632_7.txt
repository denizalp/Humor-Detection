this is a local place and we were so glad we found it!  \n\nthis place is located in the same plaza as raku (another local favorite) on spring mountain road which is known as chinatown (and you will find all different asian restaurants here).\n\ntheir ramen was super duper delish.  i went with the tonkatsu broth which has a strong pork flavor, but kind of wished i went with the shoyu which is clean soy sauce, tangy, a bit sweet broth.  \n\nvegas is all about buffets and over the top fancy schmancy restaurants, but if you are in the mood for good ramen for around $8, i strongly recommend this place.\n\np.s. and it's great for hangovers -- i'm just sayyyin'.
