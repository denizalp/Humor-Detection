The food looked and smelled great; unfortunately, I wasn't able to taste any. Why? I'm glad you asked.\n\nI arrived at 9 on a Sunday night. The place was only open until 10, but the server grudgingly sat the large party in front of me. She explained that I would have to wait. I noticed that every table in the dining room was occupied or needed to be bused, which should have been my first clue. I only saw two people working: the server who was clearly exhausted and someone behind the cash register taking care of a dozen diners that wanted separate checks and to pay with individual debit cards. I shouldn't wonder that the server was exhausted.  At Yuan Végétarien, diners  fill out a slip for each round of food, like ordering dim sum, which seems like a really labor-intensive proposition for one server.  Also, it had been 28°C and really humid that day, and the dining room was not air conditioned and was as hot and damp as a fireman's boxers.  I shudder to think what the kitchen must have been like. I felt sorry for the server but not so sorry that I didn't notice her numerous empty-handed trips into the kitchen.  Maybe she figured it wasn't her job to bus tables and was waiting for the guy trapped behind the cash register to do it.   It was like the scene from \"Mildred Pierce\" when Joan Crawford scolds a waitress never to go into the kitchen empty handed.  I figured I had nothing to gain from that.  \n\nAfter about 20 minutes of watching the server wander back and forth in a daze and apologetic nods from the guy behind the cash register, it was obvious that they were making no headway toward clearing a table and that I would not be able to eat at Yuan Végétarien that night because of the way the place works.  I would have appreciated some candor from them about that instead of letting me connect the dots on my own.  It turns out that I did have a really lovely dinner--elsewhere.
