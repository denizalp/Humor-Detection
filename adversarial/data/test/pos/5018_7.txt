Best Italian food I've had, since like ever.\n\nThe service was great, nice decor and ambiance, and don't get me started on their AMAZING food.\n\nI never imagined that I would compliment a restaurant's bread and butter, but here I am. We were lucky that day because we were served two kinds of butter for starters, the homemade basil and sun-dried tomato butter was the bomb. The cold cut platter was on the house, and the meat quality was exquisite.\n\nTheir portions are humongous, after a shared appetizer we were almost full. The fried calamari was sauteed in grilled red peppers and marinara sauce, and every bite was delectable.\n\nI had the veal scaloppine with tomato sauce and angel-hair pasta, while my girlfriend chose the ravioli and ossobuco. My dish was spectacular, but nothing too exiting. Fresh homemade pasta with great seasoning.\n\nThat ossobuco and ravioli, on the other hand, was practically screaming \"eat me!\"  It is delicious, delectable, mouthwatering, tasty, delightful, gorgeous, lip smacking, yummy, wonderful in taste, texture, and aroma. I just cannot find enough adjectives to describe the scrumptiousness of the dish, the food speaks for itself.\n\nThe place is slightly pricey than I expected, but everything was prepared fresh and with finesse, definitely a hidden gem in Lasalle.
