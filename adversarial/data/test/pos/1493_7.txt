This business will rip you off. Stay away!!!!\n\nI cracked the screen on my iPhone and took it to be repaired at Gadget Experts on 6\/26\/2016. About 2 months later, the screen started lifting off of the frame so I took it back and they graciously accepted fault for the craftsmanship of the repair and fixed it for free. \n\nToday, 11\/19\/2016, the screen started lifting off again in the EXACT same manner so I took it back to Gadget Experts. I explained to BRANDON (what a waste of air that one is sucking up) that this was my second time back with the same issue his business had already taken responsibility for previously. He offered to fix it for 50% off. I explained to him that I was not willing to accept a discount as I paid for 100% of the repair cost to fix 100% of the phone. I also explained that I paid for a permanent repair, not a temporary fix that I have to keep throwing money at. Keep in mind that I didn't have an issue with the screen lifting off until they \"repaired\" it the first time.\n\nI didn't write this post simply because of the money that Gadget Experts screwed me for, but rather for the principal. If your business is consumer facing and you simply do not care about the quality of service you provide those consumers, then you WILL lose that business.\n\nYou can look to other reviews on Yelp to confirm this is the way Gadget Experts does business as there is another review with a very similar situation as mine from September. I also urge you to look at my other Yelp reviews to determine that I don't post negative reviews often. I hope I can prevent another person from wasting money at this incredibly unethical, horribly managed business.\n\nIf you want a temporary fix for your electronics and don't mind paying multiple times for a problem they will inevitably create themselves, visit Gadget Experts. They have exactly what you want.
