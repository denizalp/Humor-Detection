I would give this place negative stars if possible. \n\nDeceit...\n\nMy company and I just finished the Pack Expo show in Las Vegas yesterday. Prior to our trip, we were contacted by a convention housing service to get hotel rooms for our staff. They gave us a few options, but said that The Quad was highly recommended because of the \"remodel\" that it had gone though. We had stayed at Imperial Palace nearly two decades ago and liked it back then. After visiting The Quad website, I was sold on the remodel of a once elegant hotel so we booked rooms there. We even paid a little more for these rooms as opposed to ones from other hotels. \n\nFirst, the parking is very difficult to find. There is construction all over the place so if you take  a turn that should lead to the lot, you might end up at a dead end and be forced to turn around and sit in traffic again. Once you actually find the correct route, it is still confusing because of all the turns and signs pointing every direction between The Quad and Harrahs right next door. \n\nChecking in wasn't too bad. When you walk in, the hotel looks really nice. We thought we had made a great choice with The Quad...then we got to the elevators. Apparently the remodel stopped just past the lobby and casino. The elevators were dirty and old. Tiles on were cracked and the carpet was filthy. As we exited on our floor, it was a flashback to 20 years ago because nothing in the hallway had been updated. Still the same carpet and wallpaper that had survived two decades or more of abuse. Our rooms weren't a pleasant surprise either. The AC was a wall unit that you'd find at a cheap motel and when I flipped open the cover to adjust the temperature, it just fell onto the floor. Chairs in the room were stained with something that I'm probably better off not knowing and there was no safe available. \n\nMy sales guy and I wanted to hit the gym before dinner so I called downstairs to ask where it was. \"Fourth floor in the Verge Tower\". \"Where is the verge tower? I'm in tower four?\" \"Sir. It's just the fourth floor.\" Seemed simple enough. We waited for the ridiculously slow elevators then hopped off on the fourth floor only to find more disgusting rooms, but no gym. We tracked down an employee and he told us we had to go down to the lobby, past the counter, and upstairs again. Not quite \"just the fourth floor\" as the lady had told me. The gym was so-so, but I didn't expect much anyway. What got to me was that the elevator doors were rusty. Not just bits of rust, but the entire brushed metal covers were gone so it was just two giant doors of rust. Completely gross and unsanitary. \n\nWhen I returned to my room again, I noticed that there were sticky spots on my magazines next to a sticky circle on the table where a drink had been left. The only problem is that I didn't have any drinks in my room so it was either from the cleaning service or the guest who stayed there before me that hadn't gotten cleaned up. Very gross regardless of which of those two caused those sticky marks. \n\nI feel deceived because The Quad is advertised as being the updated and remodeled version of Imperial Palace. That is clearly not the case once you get closer to elevators and rooms. It shouldn't be pushed as remodeled when the rooms are a time capsule from 20 years ago. In fact, the rooms were cleaner back then because they were 20 years younger. I know it's Vegas, but some people still sleep and it isn't much of a hotel remodel if the rooms didn't change at all. Highly disappointed with our stay at The Quad. I wish they left it as Imperial Palace so at least expectations would be lower going in.
