This place does not disappoint! \nTook my cousins from Hawaii here, then took my family here to celebrate Dad's birthday later in the week, and they delivered great customer service and food like I knew they would!\nKudos to Abigail on April 17th, then Roman for making my parents feel comfortable on April 23rd (they were initially intimidated by the environment)! \nIt was also cool to see teamwork. When the wait staff was busy, a chef with a Chef Knife Tattoo on his right arm bring us a dish before it got cold, and make small chat.
