So SMG was just \"okay\" to me. The food selection is great but quality I wasn't too impressed with. You should be sure to check the menu in the bar and decide on something before going in and settling down to watch your movie. The light available in the theater is not enough to even read the menu. Likewise, it's not enough to see the food your eating very well or to sign a check and write in a tip.\n\nThe negatives above aside, the seats are the best available in the theater world. Something akin to a La-Z-Boy recliner with a swivel table and drink holders big enough to hold your liter-o'-cola. Assigned seating is also great because it ensures you don't need to line up and fight tooth and nail to claim the best seat in the house. Service was excellent too. I can't think of why, but the server we had was cheerful and ever ready to do her job of risking her life up and down stairs in the darkness to bring us our lukewarm meals and room temperature soggy sweet potato fries.\n\nThe movie quality and lighting in the theater is perfect, as expected. But the one thing that enhanced my experience (and mind you plays no role whatsoever in the quality of my review) was the intensely rude guy behind me. Well, I honestly found him hilarious but in that \"are you serious!?\" kinda way. He spent the whole movie burping, farting, munching audibly and kicking my chair continuously. Your mom let you go out in public? Hahaha!
