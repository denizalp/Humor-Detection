Saturday night they had like 3 dollar AMFs.  Thats cheap.  And they had 2 dollar beers.  Thats cheap.  It was kinda dead, and the fact that the bottom floor was 18 and up, it was hard to tell if the ladies were old enough for this guy.  So i stayed on the top floor, which ended up getting me shots purchased by a group of southwest airlines flight attendants.  Seemed like a decent place.  Its right next door to 2 other clubs, and i chose this one cuz some homeless guy outside said this place had hotter chicks.
