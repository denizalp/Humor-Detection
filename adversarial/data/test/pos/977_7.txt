So pleasantly surprised eating here.  it is a few blocks from home, and have yet to try until now.  It seemed each time we passed this place at night, it looked rather dead, so nothing was ever piquing my interest to try it. \n\nWell, we finally did and everything was fantastic.  \n\nWe were greeted with a basket of bread and two dipping sauces.  Traditional turkish perhaps?  A dill creamy sauce and a hot red sauce.  Neither of the two were as good as an oil or butter, but that's fine.  \n\nFalaffal was our choice of hot appetizer and it was delicious.  The flavors were perfect and the dipping sauce complimented it wonderfully.  \n\nI ordered a chicken and doner kebob combo plate instead of going with one type of meat.   I'd surely recommend if you like little pieces of meat and different flavors in your mouth.  There are about 6 other kebob options that you can combine to get a little of each flavor.  Such different flavors and all were fantastic.  \n\nMy date ordered the Lamb Saute which was small pieces of lamb mixed with peppers, onions and maybe other veggies, and a tasty red sauce.  I wish I could pinpoint more precisely the flavor other than delicious.  Dip that rice pilaf into that and you got yourself a meal.  \nActually, I think I will try that next time. \n\nI also see on their website that they have a great happy hour.  I'm thinking of going back for their $6 wrap with fries, maybe my gyro meat would taste more like the gyro I was craving when it's inside a wrap.  I remember going to Instanbul a bunch for lunch and prices were much more affordable on that menu, so I'm assuming this place is similar (since the menu is strikingly identical).
