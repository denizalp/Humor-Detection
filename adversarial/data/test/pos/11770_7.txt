ANOTHER GREAT FIND FOR MY HOLE IN THE WALL PLACES LIST!\n\nBased on some of the reviews I read, the wings, fried chicken, hot links, and catfish were all highly recommended.\n\nSo I ordered wings and catfish. Originally I wanted to order fried chicken as well but they told me that they had just run out. From what I heard, their fried chicken is so good that they usually run out. Ok, so why don't they fix that? \n\nAnyways, the wings were decent. Your choices were mild, medium, spicy, and barbeque. The catfish was really good. It had that perfect blend of batter and cornmeal. Nice and juicy too. Next time I hope I can come early enough to try their fried chicken.\n\nNow when you go to this place, they are situated in their own building in between an apartment complex on the right and a convenience store on the left. Parking is rather small and on busy occasions, you might just have to park down the street somewhere. \n\nWhen you finally make it inside, you will notice that they are basically a convenience store that just happens to serve burgers, wings, fried chicken, catfish, and many others that looks appetizing. You have about 4 decent tables and if you're lucky, you are able to sit at one of them if you are not gonna take your food to go. Yes, they take cards and I dont remember seeing any signs of a minimum amount so I guess that's a good thing. Their bathroom is all the way in the back and it's not all that obvious. You kinda have to do a little bit of exploring before you can find it.\n\nI hate to say it, but the actual appearance of the place looks rather ghetto. But the food and the service they provide is quite remarkable. If they had a better location and make up they would be making some serious money.\n\nSo in closing, my advice would be to call ahead for a pick up order and if there is a table available then by all means, go ahead and eat there. As for their menu, you really have to be there if its your first time and some parts of their menu are not all that clear.  4 stars for the food and 2 stars for the location so 3 stars it is for me.
