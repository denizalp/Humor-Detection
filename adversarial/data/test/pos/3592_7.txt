This barro's location moved from Val vista\/ray to Val vista\/williamsfield.  I use to love the pizza but recently i have noticed a decline in quality of their pizza--very little sauce on the pizza, the ingredients did not taste fresh. I don't think the decline has nothing to do with the move to a different location.
