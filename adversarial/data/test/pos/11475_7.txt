Young, feisty chefs are doing their thing cooking up experiments with unlikely combinations found no where else in Montreal. The spot is small and perfect. Found in a non descript part of town you have the feeling you're in on the best secret. The Motherfucking Burger is the most glorious motherfucker you want in your life, and your mouth. They also make spoum - a cousin of ice cream except better and lighter, made wth egg whites and not cream. Ask for the cannabis version because, why not... This one of the most surprising and atypical dining experiences I've had, period. If you like to play it safe, stay boring. This place is for the wild.
