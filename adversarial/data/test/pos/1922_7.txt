Great location. Great amenities. Great people. The management is always welcoming and concerned. The maintenance crew is always professional. I love living here. I bought a membership to Costco. Got on board with promotions from the mall and the 3-4 grocery stores nearby. Just have to enjoy a neighborhood, instead of destroy a neighborhood.
