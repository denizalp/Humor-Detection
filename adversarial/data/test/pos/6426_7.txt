What a unique experience!  Le Milsa is located fairly centrally in Montreal.  We were able to walk over from our downtown hotel.  This was my very first time dining at a Brazilian buffet so I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  We were given cards that say \"GO\" on one side and \"STOP\" on the other.  When you're in \"GO\" mode, the servers come by with great big skewers of meat (beef, pork, lamb, chicken, turkey) and shave off as much as you want onto your plate.  What a concept!  A buffet where the food comes to you!  \n\nI wouldn't necessarily call myself a meat lover (definitely not a hater), but I was surprised by the amount I was able to consume in one sitting.  I loved all of the meats equally.  They were all juicy and tender and full of flavour and it was nice being able to control how much or how little you wanted of each type of meat.  The skewers come around frequently, so your plate is never empty.  They also serve you sides of salad, potato, rice and mushrooms.  \n\nAs you consume your delicious meal, the entertainers (dancers) come out and perform for you.  They make their way all around the restaurant, so everyone gets to enjoy the show.  Beware: they may even ask you to dance with them!\n\nIt appears that Le Milsa was built in an alleyway.  The interior walls of the restaurant are made up of the exterior walls of the neighbouring buildings.  I love the atmosphere - very cozy and romantic.\n\nWhat I remember most about my visit to the Le Milsa was the dessert.  (Don't forget to switch to \"STOP\" mode or you'll never get dessert!)  Have you ever had roasted pineapple covered with cinnamon?  Just like the other foods, their pineapple is on a skewer and roasted to perfection.  Had I known I was going to love the dessert so much, I probably wouldn't have had that last portion of meat.\n\nThe price was on the high side ($29.95 per person), but it was all-you-can-eat and included entertainment.  Service was incredible.  It's obvious that they want you to have a great time.\n\nIf you're not up for doing the buffet, there are other options to choose from. \n\nLots of fun, great food - try it at least once!
