Great nail art, not your basic every day salon. Very nice staff as well! For mani pedi expect to be in a chair for about 2 hours. All the work was done very precisely and came out as exactly what I wanted! You're getting what you pay for defiantly but it is defiantly more pricy then most nail salons.
