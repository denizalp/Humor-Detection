There are 2 Sunglass Hut stores at Las Vegas North Premium Outlet Mall.  We visited both.  The smaller store had less selection and not so good service.  The larger store had good service and a larger selection.\n\nMake sure to check out their Clearance section!  Lots of name brands at discounted prices!  Need some patience to browse through them all, but you may get lucky.  My wife scored two sweet deals with the help of a couple of nice staff members.\n\nVery good experience!  Need sunglasses?  Go to the larger Sunglass Hut first.
