...The place is simply the Garden of Eden where one can walk around and eat the apples without pesticides and meat without hormones. That's probably how it was before evil Serpent of consumerism talked us into trying mass-produced poison ( people in the hospitals should be on antibiotics, not chickens). \nSeriously what a breath of fresh air!  \n The store is not cheap but it has fantastic deals. Kids eat for free on Thursdays. And you don't even have to bring kids to get the food. You just tell them you have children to feed. The staff (so nice that you almost suspect them in smoking something  backstage) will pack it to go for you. They just want any child out there to be able to have a healthy meal once a week. That simple.\n About adults. On Tuesdays they have Prime Rib for $8.99... So good that the line to get it looks like the soup lines during Great Depression.They have very cheap homemade soups and delicious organic wine for $6.99. And if you sign up on their website you can get something free every week ( chicken, 2 avocados, etc.) \nPlus it's a good place just to grab a bite. They have a very nice dining area ( and not like at Heinen's - much nicer).\n      Don't get me wrong. I used to love Heinen's but it just reeks of rotting capitalism - very sluggish inflexible discount system, lack of good deals, artery-clogging  meals and plus why the hell can't you (absolutely healthy adult) take your own shopping cart to the vehicle? Those poor high school boys in blizzard or pouring rain are ordered to put my BOURGEOIS  groceries in my BOURGEOIS trunk. I always thought that  that kind of service provided by children belonged in the movies from sixties or 3rd world countries. And the whooping $5 an hour Heinens pays them simply makes me cringe. I am surprised they don't have a shoe polishing orphan with a baseball cap for tips outside. Yikes. You simply feel like this privileged son of a god when you shop there. Not a feeling the person who recycles and donates blood wants to embrace.\n      That's what the store of the past-  Heinens does to the kids. It works them.  Earthfare - the store of the future - feeds them. It's just always sweet and reassuring to know that business does not only takes from the community but also generously gives back.\nIf you don't feel loved there, you just don't know what love is.
