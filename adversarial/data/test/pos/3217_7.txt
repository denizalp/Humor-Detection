The owner is so sweet, he's honest and friendly to everyone who comes in, it's evident that he is very passionate about the wellbeing of the restaurant and customers.\n\nEverything that I've tried thus far has been delicious.  (The mango lassi compliments any dish you get, mmm.)  In addition, the Momos are truly authentic to the traditional Tibetan variation of dumplings.  What can I say?  We like our beef Momos hearty and made with love!\n\nI don't always visit Parkdale, but when I do I always make it a point to drop by.
