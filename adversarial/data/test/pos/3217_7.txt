Following is my personal, highly scientific \"supper club\" grading system - did the Tornado pass or fail??? Read on:\n\nRequirement 1 - vintage bar with lots of Naugahyde, tacky lighting and bartenders with the ability to make a good old-fashioned. \nPASS - all present and accounted for. Bonus points for the old-timey neon out front.\n\nRequirement 2 - relishes\nPASS - Tornado serves proper relishes (carrots, celery, olives, onions, radishes, etc) threaded on skewers in an iced glass. Like a bloody Mary, but without the tomato juice. Also present - a loaf of homemade bread, soft breadsticks and a biscuit. Yum.\n\nRequirement 3 - \"classic\" appetizers straight out of 1965\nPASS - Oysters Rockerfeller? Check. Shrimp cocktail? Check. Escargots + frog legs too! My shrimp cocktail was a thing of beauty - huge, meaty, clean shrimp with spicy cocktail sauce.\n\nRequirement 4 - French onion soup that is mostly cheese and bread\nPASS - as a bonus the Tornado's version was not too salty. Delicious.\n\nRequirement 5 - enormous steaks, properly cooked\nPASS -  my filet au polvre was the best steak I have EVER had. EVER. Buttery, tender and perfectly cooked - absolutely delicious. The Mister had a monster strip which had amazing flavor - maybe a seasoning of wine + shallots?\n\nRequirement 6 - \"Experienced service\"\nPASS - our waitress was clearly a veteran of the industry. She was fun and made sure we never lacked for anything.\n\nI really have no complaints about the Tornado - amazing food served in a classic atmosphere!
