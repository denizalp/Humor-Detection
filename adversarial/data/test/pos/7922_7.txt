We had the night all planned out: Dinner and drinks at Tao, then we get into Tao nightclub without having to wait in line and pay cover.  It was brilliant, and all thanks to other Yelpers who noted that this was their policy.\n\nOnly trouble is: Tao nightclub isn't open on Wednesday, and we didn't find that out until after dinner when we asked our server.  He mentioned that Lavo, their sister restaurant\/nightclub, would let us in for free.   Ok, cool, mission accomplished.  Maybe tomorrow we can dine at Lavo, then get into Tao nightclub.  Hope it works the other way around . . . .\n\nNot really impressed by Lavo, partially because of the bottle-service phenomenon.  It was pretty small, and all the seating was taken up by bottle service tables, roped off even though there was no one there.  You try telling your girlfriend who just walked to the monorail, to Tao, and then from Tao to Lavo in heels that she can't sit down.  Not pretty.\n\nI have to give bottle service and high heels a separate paragraph.  See above for why both of these things can make a fun night out feel like a death march.  If these two things did not coexist in Vegas everywhere, there would be a lot more happy ladies out there, perhaps with less-sexy feet and not draped around some dude who wants to show off his $, though . . . \n\nThe music was just OK.  The mashups\/medleys of old school pop like MJ and other '80s and '90s hits were too short - you'd get into one song and they'd switch it up on you real quick.  Most of the newer stuff was standard club hip hip . . . snore.  It was still fun, I can dance to almost anything with a beat, but mix it up a little.  Soaring melodies and more funky bass lines can do wonders to lighten up the droning bass.  I wish MJ's Don't Stop 'Till You Get Enough lasted longer than just part of a medley . . .  we stopped, but we didn't get enough.\n\nThe crowd was cool, no real aggressive douches, or it would have been maybe 2-star or worse.  But we did see a group of them entering as we were leaving, so who knows.  The dancer they had on a platform was hot and talented, she kept things going.  The rest of the crowd was fun, friendly, out for a good time, and that, a bass line, and some good club lighting can keep me out on the dance floor despite the music.\n\nLooking forward to trying Tao-the-nightclub tomorrow, and hope dinner at Lavo gets us into Tao like the reverse did last night.
