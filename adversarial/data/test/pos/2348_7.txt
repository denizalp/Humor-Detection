The go to place to relax and have a treat!!!\n\nOne boring night, we stumbled upon the coolest Gelato place in town back in January. I gotta be honest, i was just curious with how the carefully crafted thing would taste. I mean, who serves gelato looking like a flower? Its a feast for the eye. And when I tried it, I WAS HOOKED! and Hooked like peanut butter loves jelly! I gotta have it every week!\n\nIts been more than 3 months since that faithful night, and we have been coming back to Amorino with our friends like clock work every single week, rain or shine. This place just keeps on getting better and better. The gelatos are amazing! the presentation is awesome. The coffee is great, the macarons are delectable and the crepes with salted caramel? TO DIE FOR!\n\nWhat makes this place dear to our hearts are the Staff and the Owners welcome you warmly! its like hanging out with friends. And they're friendly to pets! I always take my side kick Sammie the Dog (@theadventuresofsamsam) and the owners come out, pet him, plays with him and the icing on the cake, HE GETS A TREAT TOO!!! So as a pet mom, thats the kindness you can never order from any menu :)\n\nSammie the Dog's special note to Owner's Jeremy and Nicholas and of course our favorite staff Polyana : Thank you for making me feel special! Arf arf!!!
