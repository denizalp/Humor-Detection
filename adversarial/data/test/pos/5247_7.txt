This location is awful. I came in at 1030 on a Sunday and waited 45 minutes for a wrap and a smoothie. Poor girl was there by herself!!!! Where were the other employees? There was literally 13 people in there and they left her by herself until 2 people came in at 11 am. My smoothie was delicious and wrap was perfect, however the wait time wasn't. \n\nThis place is so poorly managed, unclean, and full of teenagers all the time at odd hours. I remember like a mob of little kids hanging out @ 11 pm on a weekday blasting music and cussing messing around with the employees!
