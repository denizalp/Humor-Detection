Um, whoever recommended this place to you, lied. Or had a false perception of what Chinese food is supposed to taste like. \n\nThe Orange chicken was amazingly OVER-battered. Fried rice was insanely salty. Egg-drop soup was a pathetic imitation of traditional Egg-Flower soup. The vegetarian eggs rolls were slimy inside! Mongolian beef was yet again toooo salty. And lastly the Sweet and Sour chicken was a failed try. I dunno WHAT was going on back there in the kitchen, but it tasted like the chefs were cooking with blindfolds.\n\nI had four glasses of water during my meal. Nearly became dehyrdated.
