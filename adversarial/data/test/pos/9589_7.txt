I like the overpriced underwear and clothes, mostly because if you buy enough of it, the other half becomes free. The treasures of a broken economy. It fits and I have gotten pretty good service. The good service is probably in part to my age, I am their future customer and I'm gullible enough to buy 5 dollar undies. The bra fittings were right on, much better than Belks and Dillards. I know that most people don't seem to have good experiences here, but I always have.
