I'm going to blame the lack of good reviews for Monicals on the fact that most people reviewing restaurants in Champaign-Urbana are college students.  Because every local I know LOVES Monicals. It is, in fact, one of my must visit places every time I visit the twin cities.\n\nIt's different from most of my favorite pizzas in that it's thin... ultra thin.  Crunchy crust, cut in squares, lots of cheese... it's a very tasty pizza.  However, the uninitiated may order this without knowing the best part of Monical's... the french dressing.  This seems odd (at least to all of my out of town friends in the past) but the way to eat Monicals is to get a bottle of the french dressing and dip the pizza in it.  I put the dressing directly on the top of the pizza myself... it's one of the oddest but best combos you will ever taste.  In fact, they even sell their french dressing online!  (And its worth it, because you will never find a dressing that good in stores.  Seriously, I've looked.)\n\nGrab the family pleaser (with salad and cola) and lube up your salad and pizza with copious amounts of french dressing... and thank me later.
