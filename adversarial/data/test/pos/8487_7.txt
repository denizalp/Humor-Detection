For some unknown reason, we decided to get the kids' hair cut at Concord Mills.  Thought it would be a good idea and take care of everything at once.  Stupid idea.\n\nSat down, waited a minute or two, one kid was called back.  Then the other.  Then we watched as first one person was called over to ask how to cut a kids' hair, then another, then another, and so on.  It took more than an hour and a half to complete this process.\n\nI could have learned how to do it myself in that amount of time (no insult to hairdressers intended or should be implied - only meant to address those at this location in particular).
