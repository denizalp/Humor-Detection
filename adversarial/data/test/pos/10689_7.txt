Went there tonight before the game.  The best thing about the whole bar is their t-shirts.  (I really wanted the t-shirt that read \"You look like I could use a drink\")\n\nAnyway....I had the nachos...bad choice....smothered in cheese sauce and melted cheese, beans, cheese, peppers, cheese, tomatoes, and oh yeah...cheese.  It was a soggy mess.  (And it was huge...the nice server should have been thoughtful enough to warn me that it could feed a table of 6)... my friend had the pulled pork sandwich and the probably the best onion rings that I ever had. (Yes I stole a few)\n\nI have to give it minus another star for the HORRIBLE music that they play...seriously...if I am going to see a game, I don't think house and dance music is the way to go. But too each his own.\n\nBut I did had to cut the time short during the game because I started to get sick....hmmmm...soggy nachos perhaps?
