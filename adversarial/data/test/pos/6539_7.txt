Twas'  a Friday evening and I worked way too late, so  I decided to pick something up to go at a relatively new Thai  restaurant close to where I live. \n\nThai E-San doesn't look like much from the outside, but once you walk inside - you are transported to a different world.  Although I have never been to Thailand, I could only imagine that this is the kind of restaurant one might find there.  Beautiful tapestries, huge granite- inlay  tables  and an ambiance that transports you to a different place and time.\nFor a Friday night at 7p.m. it wasn't that busy - only three other tables- two of which were single guys.  So I ordered the Pad Thai Noodles with shrimp only , and was offered a seat while I waited.  The only server  working asked me if I would like water or tea and since I thought that it would only be a few minutes,  I politely thanked her but declined.\n45 minutes later.........\n I finally had my to-go  order.  But please , let me digress.......\n\nAfter 20 minutes of waiting  I got up and stood in front of the reception counter and looked into the kitchen.  There were only two persons working in the kitchen; I assumed one to be the cook and a prep cook. I had asked the only server who was running ragged ( mostly to the kitchen asking (in Thai?? ) where the food was).  She told me the cooks were from Thailand.  \n\n It looked like a Laurel and Hardy comedy back there.   The (prep cook?) kept wringing her hands and pulling her hair  and dropping things.  The cook (I assume) kept yelling at the poor woman (no wonder she was discombobulated). \n\nOk . let's talk about the food.   My Pad Thai was ok.  I had asked for a side of the chili sauce (which they forgot to add) as  I like my food spicy.  These were really mild.  Also , the noodles were gummy and stuck together.  I was wondering if they overcooked the noodles in their confusion to get the other diners food out (which, I observed also took way too much time) .\n\nI have read some rave reviews about this place.  So I do want to give it another try before giving my final decision. I am willing to forego some hiccups with service and food as I appreciate the fact that this is an authentic restaurant with immigrants from Thailand, and that it may take some time to get their act together to  provide consistency in service and food.  I really do want them to succeed.  I'll try again next month so as to give them some time to get their act together.  Hopefully, I'll have a better review next time.        Chow for now :-)
