My first introduction to Ethopian food, and I can remember it like it was yesterday.  It's interesting and unusual, but nothing about it could be offensive.  It's just not *that* weird, despite how it looks and the way you eat it.  I don't know if I would recommend going for your first time w\/out someone who's been before.  I wish it was served at a higher temperature and that the men's room had been stocked w\/ paper towels, but otherwise I have no complaints and look forward to returning.  As a side note, the hummus here is excellent, and I would recommend starting with it if you're a little nervous about the whole idea.
