VALENTINES experience ruined by this  hotel!!! \n  My husband was asked for feedback by hotel, yet has not been offered reconsiliation. This was a surprise from my husband. Great time on the grounds (bit overcrowded tho), the restaurants, the view that my husband paid the upsell fee for was wonderful. \n However, The room had not been cleaned. This was not the obvious not cleaned room either. This was the get in bed and go to sleep to discover a smell of analgesic rubbing cream emanating from the sheets. We discovered this around 3am. No problem - have housekeeping take care of it. \n    We had had a long night. So no prob- fresh sheets. Until we went back to bed, fell asleep.. smell still there. The medicated ointment had permeated in to the mattress.\n The efficiency and professionalism of staff severely lacking. \n The attitude and tone of the guest services staff was confrontational, unsympathetic and unapologetic. Literally had to request from their employees a verbal apology. This was not only a tremendous inconvenience to us and a great disappointment but also raised concerns for the exposure to the biologics present in the room. We were mouth wideopen flabbergasted!!\n  The only staff member of the hotel that recognized the grave implications of the state of the bedding was the actual room attendant. The supervisor of housekeeping offered 2 pieces of chocolate. Refused to perform a sniff test of the mattress, however, did proceed to cough mouth uncovered in our enclosed space. Anxiety levels were through the roof as we waited door opened for Maintenance to replace the mattress. Who had their own set of issues as they delivered the wrong mattress to us.\n   The Supervisor of Housekeeping offered up a spot clean of the room after a convo between her and the attendant. We were so beyond exhausted and felt for the attendant, we declined. (She had to run back and forth to remove, find and replace sheets and cases.) This however prompted our own  investigation. Finally it all made sense. \n   Even though the room was a cool, modern feel, it didn't wow. WHY? The room had not been cleaned. Upon closer inspection, the cabinets, mirrors, chairs and floors had visibly dried stains, dust and lint about. The biggest and most notable? The bathroom shower- long black hairs in and about the drain and entrance to the shower. I nearly threw up, I\n began gagging. This was beyond too much for us.\n  At around 5am the fiasco drew to a close with more dealings with the guest services. Facing 4-5 hours of sleep after being so severely stressed by the experience, we requested a late checkout. The level of inconvenience Guest Services expressed to us was insane by this point. We were enraged. \n    Who would think that a hotel that intrigues everyone with so much romance would show so little concern for the effect it has on it patrons through their representatives? I have a medical condition that causes great fatigue. This experience drained everything out of me. It took me a week to recover physically. \n    This experience has stuck with me, hence the reason I have reported back my findings so late. We are recent locals to the area. The number of choices we have to stay on the Strip include staying home then heading out for the enjoyment. What a horrible experience Bellagio afforded us. I would advise everyone to think twice. Do the due diligence when u enter the room. Don't do the upsell until you can be guaranteed the status on the room. Hey better yet the Paris across the street may score lower but they are cheaper, with great views and better staff - from our experience. Or spend the money and stay at the Cosmo. People! I hadn't even begun to talk with you about the long check in  lines. OMG
