We went to La Comida for a bachelorette party after hearing great things about this restaurant. When we got there our server seemed a bit off, but whatever I figured the food was what we were there for anyway! After ordering and getting the smallest cup of guacamole I had ever seen, came my main course. The fajitas were horrible. If your chicken tastes like fish... Something's wrong. After sending the order back the waiter came back with an attitude...!! Over all a horrible experience. I would never go back.
