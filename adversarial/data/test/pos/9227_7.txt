2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge 78\/100\nFunny little story... \n\nI love coffee but once in a while I do coffee fasts. I cut coffee out of my diet and reset. I add that because unfortunately my body cannot handle too much caffeine. I usually get migraines when I've hit my caffeine limit. Well, the first time I went here, I was dying to try the Nitro Brew. I love trying new things. I knew it would be strong but I still wanted to try it. I like to live dangerously. ;-) \n\nAs soon as I got there, the awesome barista offered me a sample of the Nitro Brew. That got me wired immediately. It's bold and strong. I liked it, so I ordered a full size. \n\nNot knowing the effect the Nitro Brew would have on me, it was insane what happened next! About an hour later... As I was driving to my next destination, I felt high as f*ck on caffeine. I felt like I was on an acid trip or something (no, never tried that.) but I felt like I was on drugs. I thought I was going insane. Never again. haha. No more Nitro Brew for me. I've had cold brew before, but not like that. It was truly out of this world, \"Am-I-on-the-mothership?-status.\" \n\nI only had a couple sips of my drink and I was wired all. freakin. night. 8 hours later (midnight), I was still up and alert. It's no joke. If your body can't handle a lot of caffeine I suggest staying away from the Nitro Brew. But if you can handle it, it's perfect for those long days. \n\nI loved the clean and simple interior, the wall mural, amazing & knowledgeable baristas, cute Acme mugs & dishes, high tables and stools. I'm not a latte or sugary coffee drink type of girl so I love the simple menu and quality coffee. \n\nLove this place. This is my kind of coffee shop. I will be back to try the rest of the menu!
