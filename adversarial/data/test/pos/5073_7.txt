This is my new favorite place for pizza. It is cheap, fast and so good.\nI have heard of this place for a while but never tried it. Even knew this location opened down the street from me. I was craving pizza the other night and good ol' Yelp pointed out that this place was down the street. Time to give it a try. So off I went.\nThe place isn't huge but it is nice. Quite a few tables scattered around. Even though the line was to the door it moved pretty quickly. The dough is pre-prepared on boards behind the first employee in the line. They reach back and grab one and start your pizza. You start with the sauce and cheese. They have multiple kinds of both. You can create your own pizza or get one of their recipes. In my opinion true pizza is dough, sauce and cheese. That's it. Put anything else on there and it turns into a sandwich. But that is just my opinion. They have a ton of toppings and you can load up your pizza as much as you want all for only $8. That is a great deal.\nThe pizzas are thin crust which is how they bake so fast once the go in the huge oven behind the prep line.\nAll of the employees were very nice. The store was neat and clean. The line moved very well and even after you got out of line you didn't have to wait too long for your pizza. You can get it to go or stay and eat. They have one size. 11 inches. Which I think is perfect for a individual serving. Plus it's pizza you can always finish off the rest cold in the morning. My pizza didn't make it to the morning. It was so good I chowed down on the whole thing in one sitting. \nI will definitely be back. In fact I almost went right back the next day. I'm still craving it. It's a great idea and very well executed. When I want cheap fast pizza, which is a lot, I will return. Much better than $5 pizza from that other place. Good job Fired Pie!
