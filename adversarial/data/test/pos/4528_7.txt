I used to live around the corner from this joint on Earll, and used to hit it up every once in a while. Can't say anything bad about this place, and strangely enough, I haven't much good to say either! Its JUST A BAR! Don't give me that \"its cool because regulars occupy the place.\" To me, if you are a \"regular\" in  bar, you need to expand your horizons. I will say this, its in Scottsdale and its not pretentious! There.
