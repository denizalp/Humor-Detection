Flight delayed, so off to the bar I went. \n\nI needed four things: a TV for golf because Tiger was on fire, bloody mary, food, and somewhere to plug in my food. Check, check, check, and check. \n\nBravo to Bar Symon for having outlets and charging stations at every table and bar stool. Amazing. They also have in-restaurant flights monitors so you can keep tabs on any flight updates. \n\nI was a big fan of the bloody mary. I love any bar that makes their own mix. I decided on the Fun Guy burger and a side caesar salad. I won't lie, it was really hard to say no to the rosemary fries. Burger was good- blue cheese, carmelized onions, mushrooms, and arugula are a great combo.\n\nThe service was amazing. The bartender did a great job all the way around with everyone (my tab says Sara, so I hope I'm giving credit to the right person). She was nice, efficient, and on her game.
