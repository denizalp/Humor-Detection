I never thought I'd say that I missed Pasta Pirate (the old steak\/seafood\/pasta place that had been at the Cal forever) but its replacement simply sucks overall. We came here to try since it's new and also because my mom's casino host said certain things were really good. Either that lady is a liar, or she just has very awful taste in food. \n\nI came here unwillingly, only to spend time with my mom while she's visiting and because she had $20pp comp. I expected slightly overpriced, average tasting food - we got slightly overpriced, bland food that any chef should've been embarrassed to serve. \n\nI feel bad saying that, because the chef was very nice and he actually came out after we got the apps to check on things. We didn't say anything, but he took the lettuce from the lettuce wraps back to show the guys on the line because it was soggy and kind of brown. So chef does seem to care about quality control, and yet he was ok with those lousy noodle dishes going out later? I already posted pics w comments if you care, but I'm too lazy to relive the details of that crap meal in a review. \n\nUp to you if you want to waste your comp on this place, but I definitely wouldn't spend any cash here. Restaurant was more than half empty for peak dinner time on a Friday night so I don't expect it to be around too long. They seem to have already reduced the menu in the 3 months it's been open and reduced operation to only Thursday-Monday
