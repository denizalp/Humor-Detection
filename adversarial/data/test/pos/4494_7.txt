Happen to be visiting Vegas? \nLooking for a good place to eat off the strip?\nCraving some awesome fried chicken?\nHow about Korean food, but don't want to smell like KBBQ after an awesome meal?\n\nBazic is thee place to go!\n\nI've been here a few times back when I used to go to Vegas every month back in the day.  They're known for their fried chicken. It's pretty good - beats KFC or any fast food place with fried chicken!  \n\nThey also have a karaoke room which is convenient for those who are into it.  From what I can recall, service was always good, the staff were always friendly\/chill. \n\nI recommend this place to anyone who happens to be in town. :)\n\nI'd like to go back and see if anything's changed :p
