My main man grew up in the midwest, so the chubby little boy inside of him lit up when he realized we were in a Papa John's delivery zone. Personally, I'd never had it before recently, and it isn't my favourite pizza. It doesn't hold up well in the fridge (sup cardboard). But their wings are decent and their dipping sauce is flipping melted garlic butter, so yeah. They're A OK by me.
