Ok.... As a business owner I'm telling you up front to take my review with a grain of salt.  Here's why.  \n\n#1  It's a Wednesday that I'm writing this review.  I know many sushi restaurants don't carry their freshest stuff on Wednesday's but that it comes in for the weekends.  I get it.\n\n#2 After coming here did I find out it's an \"all you can eat\" kinda place.\n\nWith that as a preamble here's my review.\n\nAt roughly $26 per person for all you can eat ... I mean ... what do you expect really?  Top shelf uni?  Top shelf ... anything?  In any case when I see 4.5 stars on Yelp where I come from (New York) I expect buttery toro, perfect texture uni ... so creamy, baby yellowtail, king salmon, kunomoto oyster, live scallop ... if  you've ever eaten top shelf YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.  Apparently 4.5 stars in Las Vegas is NOT THE SAME as 4.5 stars in New York.  THAT'S FOR SURE.\n\nDid they have uni? Yes. It was so mushy though and two of the four pieces were various colors ... :-\/  \n\nThe ikura (salmon roe) was rubbery. The true test of fresh salmon roe is that it POPS in your mouth.  That is 4.5-5 star quality.  Is it just me or do people in Las Vegas don't know great sushi?  Did I catch them on a bad night?  IDK... I've been here to Raku twice and both times during the week it was off the hook and met my expectations.\n\nTo it's credit ... the staff was very helpful and the service was FAST.  I love fast service. \n\nWith regards to the food ... large quantities at cheap prices always seems good but if you've ever really experienced top shelf sushi\/sashimi and you're looking for that here... uh uh.\n\nYou've seen what I said regarding the uni and ikura.  To it's credit the yellow tail was very good as were the two special rolls we ordered which were the salmon everything kinda roll and the yellow tail lover roll.  See ... when you go to any sushi restaurant you'll always find the best \"flavor\" in special rolls where they can cover up the freshness that you would otherwise find in their sashimi dishes and when you order the \"all you can eat\" you are prevented from ordering sashimi.  :-\/  THAT'S BECAUSE they want you to fill up on the rice.  As a business owner I get it ... it makes sense. ;)  But if you are a true sushi connoisseur ... homey don't play dat. By the waiters suggestion I did order the oysters and to their credit they were really good but were they \"great\"?  Sorry.  I like my oysters ice cold.  Call me a sushi snob but I like my raw fish fresh and cold.\n\nSo ... my recommendations for a person coming here.\n\nIf your sushi habits are to have all you can eat on a budget ... this is the place for you. $26 per person... you can't beat it.\n\nIf however you are a sushi snob like I am and you've been spoiled with the likes of top shelf raw fish ... don't bother coming here while in Vegas.  Face the facts ... you've going to have to bite the bullet and check out some of the higher end places.  \n\nI'm willing to come back here on a weekend and see if I'm wrong but ... we'll see. Till then ... no more than 2 stars.
