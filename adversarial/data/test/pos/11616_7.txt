Sights-  Atmospheric notch or two above a local pub and grub venue with it's low lighting and sections with comfy club chairs and fireplaces.  Large Bar and TV's throughout.\n\nSounds- Some great 90's tracks playing at just the right level.\n\nSmells -  Eau de Sour Bar.  Not strong enough to make you gag, but persistent enough to cause constant olfactory distress.\n\nSelections- Limited Happy Hour cocktail specials- $5 Skyy Vodka drinks, $4 well drinks, $3 drafts.  Small but varied selection of appetizers in the $5 to $7 range. \n\nService- Efficient and pleasant.\n\nWe had: \nA Skyy Raspberry Cosmo & a Stella. Shrug! \n\nThe Ferrari-Carano Marinated Chicken Flat-bread with Caramelized Onions, Jack Cheese and Mushrooms.  Truly delicious and savory!\n\nSynopsis-  The stench was a super bummer.  The happy hour drinks, though cheap, were uninspiring; just drinks, not craft cocktails.  The decor was OK.  The flat-bread was terrific, but that alone is not enough to make me want to come back.
