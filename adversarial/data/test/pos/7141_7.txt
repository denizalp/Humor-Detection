The In-N-Out at the Linq Promenade is one busy business, but they are smooth operators there.  Our favorite place to get burgers, In-N-Out serves up their regular items with a slight upcharge, but not by much.  It's crowded, yes, and you may not be able to find a seat at prime hours (like on New Year's Day), but there is plenty of seating next to the fountain outside. My regular order is the #3:  hamburger with grilled onions, fries well-done, and a root beer.  It's just as good here as it is at other locations so if you want your fix, just be a little patient for your order and you'll be enjoying the best of the West in no time.
