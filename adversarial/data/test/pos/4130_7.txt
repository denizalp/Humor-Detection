Stayed here for a night and got a player's card, giving me the player's price at the restaurant and $5 of slot play. The slot play was fine (guess who came out in the black??) but the restaurant was in poor condition.\n\nWe were given a free \"cup\" of 40 oz coffee for staying at the hotel. That's a pot of coffee, you guys. And none of it was any good. We also got a free glass of wine, but it required me to get up from eating and ask 5 different people how to redeem it. At the end of it all, the hostess got some chardonnay from out of a cabinet right next to my table. I didn't think it should have been such a hassle for me or for the hotel.\n\nThe gambling here is fine. $10 minimum blackjack and roulette. The front desk was nice and helpful. Very smoky rooms and meh wifi. Free parking is a huge plus.
