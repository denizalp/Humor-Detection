This place looks crappy and creepy on the outside. Be bold and fearless, young (or notsoyoung) eater -- the food is worth crossing potentially awkward cultural boundaries for. And your car will be safe, I promise.\n\nWe (le moms, le pops and I) were seated very quickly even though the place was chock full of Chinese people (and other people.. but mostly a lot of Chinese speakers). They give you menus (2 diff menus, look at both) and there are pictures (with English and numbers!) on the wall. \n\nWe had:\n** Shrimp wontons with noodle (forget the noodle but the shrimp wontons are awesome! believe me because I generally think wontons suck! plus I mean.. it's in the name...)\n* mustard green soup with pork and tofu (#14? tofu so soft... broth so clean yet flavorful (ginger)... pork so... so GOOD. comparable to the soup at Siam Cafe... I'm not sure which is better but I might say WG's)\n- crispy whole fried sole hk style (#39. not bad. dad demolished it. but not as stand out as the other stuff)\n- szechuan pork and eggplant (i love eggplant. and i love this dish. i do i do i dooo)\n- mapo tofu and meat (I believe the meat was pork. this was good, spicy, but not too special)\n*** JADE TOFU AND FISH (or something it might be 38) YOU. MUST. ORDER. THIS. It is delicious! My mom shouted when she had a bite because it was that good. (And then my dad did and then I did.)\n- cold milk tea -- personal preference, this is nummy to me\n\nBelieve me when I say  -- 1 appetizer and 1 main dish is enough for normal people! DON'T over order because the food does NOT taste as good the next day (it might even suck). Just come back sometime like I know I will. \n\nLived in Cleveland since day 400 or so of life and this was my first time here. If you haven't been you are missing out on part of the wonderful thing that is Cleveland.\n\n*edit* If it helps..  my parents and I greatly prefer this to Hunan East (different style of Chinese food, I know).
