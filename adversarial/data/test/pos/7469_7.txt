After hearing the hype we decided to give this place a try on a rainy afternoon. The place was packed (which meant little parking and a 40 min wait) which is fine because that tells me there's probably something good happening there. We were seated and the first thing you notice is don't bother talking to anyone in your group. It's very loud in there so you just kind of sit there pointing at things. We had a group of six and all ordered various beers. I can't anyone was blown away by the flavor. Red Rocket was ok, the sour beer was ok, the double IPA was horrible, wet barrel barley wine was alright. Basically the beers could've been brewed anywhere, nothing really impressive. \n\nWe did order food because originally we were going to stay awhile. Service was fine so I can't complain there. But after being annoyed with the noise level and the lackluster beer it was apparent we were just gonna have a round, try some apps and move on. One friend ordered just fries. They had decent flavor but were a soggy, messy pile that just didn't look to good. The artichoke dip had a weird bitterness to it, like they dropped vinegar in the batch and hoped no one would notice. The pretzel sticks were good but the \"beer cheese sauce\" served with it was some weird, watery, sour foul tasting liquid that ruined anything it came into contact with. Skip the beer cheese anything. The wings were decent enough, meaty and flavorful. And the jalape√±o sliders were good. (That lead me to believe perhaps the burgers are good there?) \n\nAll in all, it was a disappointing trip. The six of us all had been looking forward to the joint then the big letdown. I don't know if we even were in there for as long as we waited. I know the place will do just fine and I'm excited to see what they have up their sleeves for new beers. Just some tweaking here and there and it will be THE place to be in Gilbert.
