Surprise, Surprise, Surprise! Another phony clone. Really folks, all of your customers aren't naive vacationers who don't have a clue about what good food is supposed to taste like. \n\nWe're (unfortunately) in Vegas a few times a year on business and went to Bouchon for an early 6:30 dinner after working all day at a trade show. We didn't have a reservation and were offered a table on the outdoor patio. I protested that it would be too hot since I knew it was over 100 degrees out there. The hostess added \"it's not too bad\".... I should have added: \"we're here for dinner, not Bikram yoga\"....I Googled the weather and found that it was 105 degrees. Up dog, down dog.... \n\nThey miraculously found us an inside table. We were not famished and ordered: \n\nonion soup (I ate mine, wifey's went back: too salty and just not good). \n\nmushroom quiche - undercooked to the point where the egg was still runny (wifey sent back, they cooked it more, still nauseating)..... \n\nside order of green beans (haricot verts) okay, nothing special \n\nside order of ratatouille (more salty than the Dead Sea)\n\nAction:  apologies.  soup and ratatoulle removed from bil.  Free extremely marginal dessert given.   Halved yellow cherries ON TOP of FOLDED crepes with a sugary sauce and tiny scoop of bland ice cream....This was \"on the house\" after I reminded the waiter that it was supposed to be on him.  \n\nWe had a couple glasses of acceptable wine.  \n\nVerdict: Guilty.  Just another Vegas shit hole with a fancy name.
