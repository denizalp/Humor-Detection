Great (if going to a Dr can ever be considered great) clinic not far from home. Can't complain.\n\nSometimes the walk-in clinic can get busy, but its a walk-in clinic. You will wait a heck of alot longer if you go to the hospital.\n\nHad pleasent experiences with both my kids. Friendly Drs who were quite and understood the challenges of having a sick kid on your lap waiting.\n\nEverytime I have been its a pretty quick in and out. Short and sweet. If that is what you are looking for, check it out. \n\nIf you are the type to come to the Dr and want to chat about the weather and how the teller at the bank looked at you funny, you might want to move along. They run a well-oiled machine here.
