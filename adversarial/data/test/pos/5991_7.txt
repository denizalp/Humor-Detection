The food is insane.  A super fun addition to the neighborhood. Really close to Ross Park Mall. They don't serve greasy bar food -- they sell generous portions of smoked meats, real Mac n cheese and corn bread muffins. Best salmon I've ever had. Great place to see a live band, watch a game or just hang out. Love this place.
