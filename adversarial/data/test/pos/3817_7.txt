So glad I finally had the chance to check this place out! There are some really great pictures on here that make you want to try so many things, so being a Yelper of course I had to try!  Came on a Monday night with the whole family and we all really enjoyed our food!\n\n So here's what we ordered: pecan parmesan crusted rainbow trout with coleslaw, and steamed broccoli. Not packed with a lot of flavor but still really good if your a lover of all fish, coleslaw was great and well, broccoli is broccoli. Fish and chips it was beer-battered and it came with fries. The fries and fish were both equally great. I had the ribeye and crab cake. My sides were garlic whipped potatoes and steamed asparagus. They had no gorgonzola butter so one of the gentleman made me a blue cheese butter and it was phenomenal!  The steak was cooked to perfection and the crab cakes was bomb! My kids had popcorn shrimp and chicken tenders and they loved both plates. We had raw oysters, Singapore calamari, ceviche, and bang bang shrimp! Every appetizer was awesome! The oysters are not very big but they are some of the best I have ever had! Service was good and all in all everything was great! Definitely will visit again to try something different!
